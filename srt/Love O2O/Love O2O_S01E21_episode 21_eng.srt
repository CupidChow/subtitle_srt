00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,470
 Silence Wang - "An Alluring Smile" 

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:10,540
 ♫ I always casually tell you my wishes ♫ 

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,540
 ♫ And give you looks that a thousand words wouldn’t be able to describe ♫ 

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,640
 ♫ In this world, there will always be people who are busy looking for treasure ♫ 

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,670
 ♫ But they mistake the blazing sun for it ♫ 

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,560
 ♫ And miss out on the manifestations of life ♫ 

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,470
 ♫ On the long bridge of this ancient city ♫ 

8
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,590
 ♫ There is a sea of people and cars going on their way ♫ 

9
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,140
 ♫ Your smile is like a ray of light ♫ 

10
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,700
 ♫ That suddenly lights me up ♫ 

11
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,730
 ♫ (Your smile is like a ray of light. That suddenly lights me up) ♫ 

12
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,710
 ♫ The wind blows gently; summer is not yet over ♫ 

13
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,780
 ♫ Bikes ring on the greenway ♫ 

14
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,750
 ♫ So this is what love looks like ♫ 

15
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,960
 ♫ So this is what love looks like ♫ 

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,980
 ♫ Just admit that you were allured by my smile and couldn’t forget me after you first saw me ♫ 

17
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:02,120
 ♫ Saying that love is deep like the sea… you flatter me ♫ 

18
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,020
 ♫ The most romantic thing is to just watch the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder ♫ 

19
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,260
 ♫ That’s the direction my heart goes in ♫ 

20
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,180
 ♫ (Watching the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder. That’s the direction my heart goes in) ♫ 

21
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,260
 ♫ I want to travel to all four corners (of the earth) with you to enjoy the views in all kinds of weather ♫ 

22
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:18,290
 ♫ I want to write the remaining chapters of life with you ♫ 

23
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:22,500
 ♫ Sharing the laughs and tears with you freely no matter the circumstances ♫ 

24
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,410
 ♫ Our story won’t end ♫ 

25
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:30,100
   

26
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,060
     

27
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:50,650
   

28
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,660
New gameplay for the Majestic Beast system.

29
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,940
That's right. It's been quite a few days since I've fed my little tiger.

30
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:25,200
  Sorry. I've been so busy recently and forgot about you.  

31
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,970
  But Master's tiger probably hasn't been fed in a long time either.  

32
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:35,190
  I'll go to buy some food, and you'll watch the house in the meantime.  

33
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,370
 Stay home and don't run off! 

34
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,070
 Why is this phrase... so familiar? 

35
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,820
  Then look after the house. Don't go to Xiaoling's. 

36
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,760
  Diemeng? 

37
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,340
  Weiwei.  

38
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,690
  Weiwei, you're online?  

39
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,560
Nini, you're here, too. What a coincidence!

40
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,230
  Diemeng, haven't seen you for so long. 

41
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,920
  Yeah, work's too busy.  

42
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,620
  Weiwei, you've been gone for ages, too, not just Diemeng. 

43
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,570
 Yup, I've been busy with work, too. 

44
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,270
 I've been interning lately. 

45
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,210
  It seems that I am the one who has nothing to do.  

46
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,920
  Eh. It's rare for the three of us to get together. 

47
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,610
  How about if we go to the dungeon? 

48
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,110
  Sure.  

49
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,050
 I haven't played in a while and maybe a little rusty with the control. 

50
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,430
  That's no problem. Let's first do one with medium difficulty to warm up.  

51
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,990
  In any case, with Weiwei here, we'll definitely beat it.  

52
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,490
  Careful!  

53
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,180
  Two months offline and I can't even beat a boss. 

54
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,130
  I'll visit an NPC and fix my equipment. 

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,740
  Leader Diemeng is in a bad mood these days.  

56
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,660
  What happened?  

57
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,760
  Maybe it's because she just returned to the guild and is still getting used to it.  

58
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,390
  In the past couple of months, many of the elders in the guild left.  

59
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,660
  Many new people joined and are treating Xiaoyu Yaoyao as a goddess.  

60
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,260
  Many of them don't even know Guild Leader  Diemeng. 

61
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,720
  Didn't Zhan Tianixia return the position of the Leader back to her?  

62
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,410
 Nope, the level and skills of the Guild Leader Diemeng 

63
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,220
  aren't as high as Zhan Tianxia's. 

64
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,630
  Xiaoyu Qingqing is also in the guild. This woman is so annoying.  

65
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,230
  If I weren't for my attachment to the guild, I would've already left. 

66
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,940
  Diemeng and Zhan Tianxia...  

67
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:08,360
  They made up. I asked Guild Leader Diemeng. She said that she fell ill some time ago. 

68
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,140
 Zhan Tianxia took care of her so she forgave him. 

69
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,700
  Hey!  Can't talk anymore. She's back. 

70
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,170
  Want to continue playing?  

71
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:20,600
  No, my internet isn't stable recently. My connection keeps dropping. 

72
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,320
 Let's just chat for a bit. 

73
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,830
 Weiwei, you said you have an internship. Where is it? 

74
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,730
  In the capital. 

75
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:34,220
  You work so hard. You even came back to school for your internship during the summer recess. 

76
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,650
 I guess so. 

77
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,990
  Weiwei, are you in in the capital, too?  

78
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,170
  Yes.  

79
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,840
  Do you have time right now?  

80
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,630
  How about coming out to have afternoon tea? 

81
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,280
  Come on.  Come on. 

82
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,540
  I am so envious that you both are in the same city. 

83
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,520
  If only I were in the capital as well.  

84
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:01,060
  Okay. Where should we meet up?  

85
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,630
  Are you around the campus?  

86
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,000
  Yes.  

87
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,420
 There is a cafe named "Red" on College Road. 

88
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,670
  Can we meet over there?  

89
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,990
  Okay.  

90
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,000
  I'm wearing a dark green skirt and a white top.  

91
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,100
  My phone number is 19678998635.  

92
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,710
  Weiwei.  

93
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,390
  Master.  

94
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,320
  Yes.  

95
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,310
 Can't you use the normal message app to chat? 

96
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,920
  It's easier this way.  

97
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,480
  It's scary, okay?  

98
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:06,000
  I suddenly remember that my relative's villa is not occupied. 

99
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,620
  Her house has a pool. Do you want to go swimming?  

100
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,620
  I think the missus needs to build up her health and strength. 

101
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:21,490
  Swimming?  

102
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,640
  About that, Xiao Nai's even better at swimming than basketball.  

103
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,250
  I wonder what he looks like while swimming? 

104
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,910
  Yes!  

105
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,020
  Can you swim?  

106
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:41,860
  Nope! But I can watch!  

107
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:53,640
  Right. In a while, I'm going to meet up with Diemeng.  

108
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:00,270
  Diemeng Weixing?  

109
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,740
  Yes, she invited me to meet up and chat  

110
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,440
 at the cafe named 'Red' on College Road. 

111
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,160
  Just for afternoon tea. It won't be very long.  

112
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,690
  I will pick you up to go swimming directly later. 

113
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:18,290
  Right. Bring my swimming trunks for me.  

114
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,200
  They are at the bottom of my closet. 

115
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,350
Swimming trunks?

116
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,210
  Weiwei.  

117
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,480
  I know.  

118
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,280
Everyone has worked overtime for two days straight.

119
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,890
Go home earlier today and get some rest.

120
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:29,660
Relax a bit. You'll be more efficient.

121
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,130
What's going on?

122
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,020
 - Really? 
- Is this true? 

123
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,750
 That's great! 

124
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,270
This is mandatory.

125
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,950
Yes!

126
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,320
K.O., let's go to eat at the place with grilled scallops.

127
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,410
Maybe you can steal their recipe.

128
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,400
Where are you going, Third Brother?

129
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,730
- Swimming. 
- Bring me along? 
 - Not convenient.

130
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,180
Not convenient? Then I'm leaving. Bye-bye.

131
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,070
Bye-bye.

132
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,610
A white top and a dark green skirt...

133
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,850
Hello.

134
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:46,640
Are you... Luwei Weiwei?

135
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,010
Hello, Diemeng.

136
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:51,990
Are you actually Luwei Weiwei?

137
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,570
Yeah.

138
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:00,030
Sorry about that. I didn't really think you were this pretty in person.

139
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,450
Please sit.

140
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,380
Do you want to drink anything?

141
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,160
Waiter!

142
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,420
Hello. May I ask what you would like?

143
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,450
Milk tea's good.

144
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,520
Very well. Please wait a little while.

145
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,470
Weiwei, I really didn't think that

146
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,560
you would be this pretty in real life.

147
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,370
I am so surprised.

148
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,590
The Xiaoyu clan even spreads rumors all the time

149
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:37,770
claiming that you are either ugly or a transvestite.

150
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:42,110
If they met you in person, they'd definitely hang their heads in embarrassment.

151
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,680
And about that Zhenshui Wuxiang, what kind of taste does he have?

152
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,830
if he saw you in real life, he would regret so much.

153
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,960
Diemeng, let's not talk about others.

154
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,890
Look at me. It wasn't easy to meet in person,

155
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,370
but I'm talking to you about these old matters.

156
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,930
It upset you, right?

157
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,440
I am not upset by this.

158
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,850
To me, he's like a stranger.

159
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:13,520
It's great that you don't let this bother you.

160
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:19,230
Unlike me, who can't let go.

161
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,410
Before, because of Xiaoyu Qingqing,

162
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:24,270
I was even prepared to end my relationship with Zhan Tianxia.

163
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:29,520
However, he was suddenly nice to me again.

164
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,170
I got sick for a while,

165
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,510
and he tried so hard to look after me.

166
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:39,190
He kept me company and took care of me,

167
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,210
so I got back with him again.

168
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,980
That's great.

169
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,410
I'm also happy for you guys.

170
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,590
It's not what you think.

171
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:55,080
I only learned about this just now.

172
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:00,000
The feelings that changed in essence

173
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,340
and something that changed in quality are the same thing.

174
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,780
You can't keep it, only throw it away.

175
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,970
Even though we're back together,

176
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:14,880
we can't go back to that same feeling anymore.

177
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,760
He thinks that if I can forgive him once,

178
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,190
I can forgive him two, three times.

179
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,690
Therefore, he's becoming more and more unreasonable.

180
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,190
Weiwei...

181
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,220
I feel so tired.

182
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:43,530
Diemeng, don't be sad.

183
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:24,440
After chatting with you, I feel so much better inside.

184
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,150
Why don't we have dinner tonight? What do you think?

185
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:36,790
Sorry. I'm going swimming with someone tonight.

186
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,810
With your boyfriend?

187
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,990
For a great beauty like you,

188
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:48,270
your boyfriend must be really loyal to you. Right?

189
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,230
Since you have plans, I won't keep you any longer.

190
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:56,150
Why don't you leave first? I'm going to sit here for a while. Today, I'm buying.

191
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,770
Oh, no need. It's better for me to pay for myself.

192
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:02,930
Why are you being polite with me? I'm already working and you're still a student.

193
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,690
It's no problem.

194
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:07,170
Okay, then thank you.

195
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:10,140
- Next time there's an opportunity, it's my treat.
- Okay.

196
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,050
   

197
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:25,810
Hello? I'm done.

198
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:28,630
Okay, I'll be there in a while.

199
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:32,160
Then... I'll wait for you before the coffee shop.

200
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,800
Did you buy a swimming suit?

201
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,940
Let's buy it together.

202
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,980
  Let's go together. 

203
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,960
I can see you now.

204
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:52,230
Don't come. There's a mall near here, I'll go myself.

205
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,910
Miss, are you buying a swimming suit?

206
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,940
Yes.

207
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:11,880
Since you have such a good figure, this one really suits you.

208
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,140
It's fine, thank you.

209
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:36,550
Have you finished your shopping? It was pretty fast.

210
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,430
I wouldn't dare to not be quick.

211
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:45,330
 Even if I bought the swimming suit, that doesn't mean I have to wear it.  

212
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:49,210
 In any case, I just won't go into the water. It's not like you can pull me into the pool. 

213
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:29,000


214
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,280
  In a while, I can use my phone to take some pictures.  

215
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,910
 My plan is so perfect without any blemish. 

216
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,820
Let's change first.

217
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,070
Where are my swimming trunks?

218
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,230
Why did you bring this pair?

219
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,470
What's wrong with this pair?

220
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:58,030
This pair is the one I got after winning the inter-school swimming championship. My aunt gave them to me.

221
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:00,590
I've never worn them.

222
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,530
Do you not like them?

223
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,670
It doesn't matter to me,

224
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:13,390
but I didn't think that you liked this style.

225
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,870
What style?

226
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,290
 It turns out to be such a short style! 

227
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,130
 How could my claws be so incisive? 

228
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,100
 If I said that I picked it at random, 

229
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,170
 would he believe me? 

230
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,910
Didn't I say I'd watch?

231
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:21,390
How did I end up putting it on?

232
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,510
Hello, Diemeng?

233
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,740
Tianxia?

234
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,080
 Hey. 

235
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,490
It's almost time for dinner.

236
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:03,170
Do you have time to have dinner together?

237
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,150
I heard of one restaurant with pretty good steaks.

238
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:09,710
Oh... It might not be possible. In a while, I agreed to meet someone to run dungeons. It'll take a while.

239
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,820
With whom?

240
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:16,690
No one really... just with some people in the guild.

241
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:20,160
I'm the Guild Leader, so I have to sacrifice some of my personal time. Right?

242
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,380
Okay.

243
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:34,150
 You've fought for ages, but still haven't helped me get  the Ice Prison Snow Ginseng. 

244
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,180
 Enough, enough. In a little while, let's go again. 

245
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,230
 Now you're talking. 

246
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:44,590
  But will Sister Diemeng be angry if she learns about this?  

247
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,480
  It's fine. We're all from the same guild.  

248
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,420
 You girls probably can't do it. As the Guild Leader, I can't just ignore it. 

249
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,380
 Going to a dungeon? 

250
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,260
  Do you want me to help?  

251
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,540
  Diemeng, why are you here?  

252
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:01,410
 Am I not supposed to come? Didn't you say this was to help people in the guild run dungeons? 

253
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:03,780
 I, as the previous Guild Leader, also came to have a look 

254
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,340
 to see if I can help with anything. 

255
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,390
  It's best that Sister Diemeng decides to help!  

256
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,740
 Going to run a dungeon, like Tianxia said, 

257
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,020
 you girls probably can't beat it. 

258
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,260
 My helping out is nothing. 

259
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:24,640
 However... today, I feel as though I've broadened my horizons. 

260
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,090
  What?  

261
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:29,810
  I met Luwei Weiwei today.  

262
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,160
  You met Luwei Weiwei?  

263
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,470
 That's right. In person, she's absolutely stunning. 

264
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:41,370
  If she agreed to participate in a reality show...  

265
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:48,200
  Luwei Weiwei? How is that possible?  

266
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,300
 You can believe it or not. 

267
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,800
Diemeng went so far as to brag in front of Zhan Tianxia

268
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,900
saying that Luwei Weiwei is a beauty!

269
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,200
What a laugh!  Everyone knows she's an ugly witch, right?

270
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,200
That's right.  What's the point in lying like that?

271
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,400
She's nuts.

272
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,800
Do you think perhaps Sister Diemeng misunderstands about us?

273
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,100
Misunderstands nothing!

274
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,780
She's just jealous that Zhan Tianxia cares about me.

275
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:33,900
Qingqing, what is your relationship with Zhan Tianxia?

276
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:37,600
What relationship? We're innocent.

277
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,400
He just helps me kill monsters and select equipment, things like that.

278
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,200
Only Diemeng thinks he's special.  I don't think he's that great.

279
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,600
She's afraid no one wants her.

280
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Oh, Yaoyao, last time didn't Zhenshui say

281
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,200
that Luwei Weiwei was working as an intern at his family's company?

282
00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:00,280
When Diemeng was telling the lie, she definitely didn't think of this flaw.

283
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:05,200
Yaoyao,  have Zhenshui give us a tour at his company.

284
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,200
We'll go to see what Luwei Weiwei really looks like.

285
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,200
I don't think that's very appropriate. I'm afraid Zhenshui would be suspicious.

286
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,000
What's bad about it? With the relationship between you two,

287
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,600
paying a visit to his company is very normal.

288
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,100
Right.  Zhenshui should take you there.

289
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,200
Otherwise, it would mean he's not serious about you.

290
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,800
Then, I'll talk to him about it.

291
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,980
Is it okay?

292
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,000
Cheers.

293
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,600
Shaoxiang, have you been working hard lately?

294
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,600
It's okay.  Nothing big. It's all just minor stuff.

295
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,100
It would be good if I could help you.

296
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,200
When are you going to take me to your office to have a look around?

297
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,200
Why do you want to come to my office?

298
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,150
We've been going out for so long,

299
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:17,000
and you haven't taken me to tour your office.

300
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,700
Can I or not?  I just want to have a look.

301
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,000
If I were the boss, I would definitely take you there.

302
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,800
But the company belongs to my dad,  I can't just decide for him without a reason.

303
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,830
I just want to take a look, so I can understand you better.

304
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:33,000
Then I would know what kind of people you deal with. How about it?

305
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,900
Yaoyao...

306
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,600
Okay, okay. I'll set it up. All right?

307
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,000
Really?  That's great!

308
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,800
Let's eat.

309
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,600
 Hello Manager Zhen. 

310
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,800
Hello?

311
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,900
What?  Young Master is bringing several women to the office!

312
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,200
I think it's Young Master's real girlfriend.

313
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,100
Real girlfriend?

314
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,000
 They were arm in arm when they came in the office. 

315
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,800
Then what's the story with the one in General Affairs?

316
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,800
 Who knows? 

317
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,000
 Hello, Manager Zhen. 

318
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,200
 How big!  How impressive! 

319
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,300
Why did those three come along with you?

320
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,250
They insisted on coming.  I couldn't do anything about it.

321
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,200
Did I do something wrong?

322
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,500
No, it's all right.

323
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,800
Zhenshui,  your family really is rich.

324
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,800
It's all right.

325
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,000
Have a seat here.  Tonight, I'll take you out for a big dinner.

326
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:24,200
Last time, didn't you say Luwei Weiwei worked at your company?

327
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,600
Right.

328
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,800
Can we see what she's like?

329
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,600
No, I don't want her to know I'm Zhenshui.

330
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,410
Of course, we won't tell her.

331
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:38,500
We just want to see what she looks like.

332
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:43,040
Stop bothering Zhenshui, okay?

333
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,500
It's nothing.  It's not a bother.

334
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,000
Then I'll let you guys have a look.  Don't say anything, okay?

335
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,500
Okay.

336
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,800
You.

337
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,400
I remember you're in charge of the interns in the Human Resources Department.

338
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,600
Yes, Manager Zhen, how can I help?

339
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,300
I remember you hired an intern called Zhao Erxi.

340
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,300
Have her come out and entertain some guests.

341
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,800
All right.

342
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,800
Hello, Dad.

343
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:22,870
Yes, I just brought some friends here to have a look around.

344
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:26,200
Okay, I'll come over right now.

345
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,000
My dad told me to head over. I'll be back in a bit.

346
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,400
Okay. Then we'll wait for you here.

347
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,700
Okay.

348
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,600
Hey, Zhenshui's family really is very wealthy.

349
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,500
With such a large company!

350
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,800
Just now, I went online and looked it up. It's even a public one.

351
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,900
Yaoyao, your luck is really good. You've struck gold.

352
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,600
Hey. I'm not with Zhenshui for this.

353
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,300
Isn't Manager Zhen here?

354
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,200
Oh, his dad was looking for him for something.

355
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,800
This is Zhao Erxi in our company.

356
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,800
A moment ago, Manager Zhen asked for her to take care of our guests.

357
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,000
Erxi, take care of our guests now. I have something to do. I'll leave first, okay?

358
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,400
- Okay.
- Okay.

359
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,000
Nice to meet you guys. Manager Zhen asked me to take care of you.

360
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,800
If you have anything you need, please let me know.

361
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,500
So this is how she looks?

362
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
We're all Manager Zhen's friends. Let's do this.

363
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,200
First, get us some coffee. We'll wait for him here.

364
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,900
Please wait a bit.

365
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,000
Is this the great beauty Diemeng spoke about?

366
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,500
I'm seriously laughing my head off, okay?

367
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,300
Her bragging has gone too far, hasn't it?

368
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:45,000
I really want to take a photo of her, and expose Diemeng in front of everyone.

369
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,900
You can't. Zhenshui will get mad if you do that.

370
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,800
I know. I know. I was just talking.

371
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,800
However, Zhenshui really is pitiful. His previous wife is so ugly.

372
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,700
No matter how beautiful his current wife is,

373
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,500
it's still a stain when you think of it.

374
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,800
Your coffee.

375
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,900
Give me the phone!  Give it to me!

376
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,300
 They are my new shoes! 

377
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:32,990
 But I can't get mad at Manager Zhen's guests. Endure! 

378
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,400
I'm really sorry. I was too careless.

379
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,100
No problem, no problem.

380
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,300
Then, pour me another cup, okay?

381
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,000
 I'll endure! 

382
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,700
Okay.

383
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,200
 My coffee has also gotten cold. Help me get another cup, okay? 

384
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,000
 Oh, okay. 

385
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,000
My earring!

386
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,220
Did it fall under the couch?

387
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,000
What should we do?

388
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,400
- Is it the one you just bought yesterday that cost ¥3,000 a pair?
- Yeah.
 (Note: Approx. $450 USD) 

389
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Can you help me pick it up?

390
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Our clothes... aren't too convenient.

391
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,600
Okay.

392
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,200
What does it look like?

393
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,050
It's a Tahitian black pearl, particularly expensive.

394
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,800
I got it!  I got it!

395
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,900
It's this, right?

396
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,400
Thanks.

397
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,400
- Zhao Erxi?
- Huh?

398
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,200
Oh, Manager Zhen.

399
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,000
Why are you like this right now?

400
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,600
I'm helping them get things.

401
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,300
Oh, that's right, Manager Zhen, help me give them this charger.

402
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,760
- I'll first catch my breath for a little while. If you need me, call me again.
- Hey!

403
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,400
The charger you asked for.

404
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:07,900
Shaoxiang, just now Qingqing accidentally spilled coffee on Luwei Weiwei's foot.

405
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,400
Do you think that she would get angry about it?

406
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,700
She looked so scary a moment ago.

407
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:18,000
I thought that she might attack me like in the online game.

408
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,100
What are you scared of?

409
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:24,000
- Right now, she's just a little employee in the company. How could she dare throw a temper tantrum? 
 - Yeah.

410
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,600
I just knew that you would protect me!

411
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:39,000
Then I won't see you out. In the evening, I'll take you out to dinner.

412
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,600
- Be good. 
- Okay.

413
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,600
I'm going.

414
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,400
- Bye.
- Bye.

415
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,800
Diemeng was lying, as expected.

416
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,400
It's a pity we can't even expose her.

417
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,000
Who says we can't?

418
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,800
Yaoyao, I have an idea.

419
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,600
We'll ask Tianxia to organize a guild meetup,

420
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,000
and ask Diemeng to also invite Luwei Weiwei.

421
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,700
Didn't she say that Luwei Weiwei was a beauty?

422
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,400
Once the time comes, everyone will see...

423
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,400
This time I asked you all to come to discuss something with everyone.

424
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:27,200
 - What? 
- Our guild has been established for a long time,

425
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,300
but there aren't a lot of interactions between members.

426
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:35,400
Therefore, I propose that we hold a regional guild meetup.

427
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:39,200
 - You're saying... a meeting among players?
- Yeah. 

428
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,200
- What does everyone think about this?
 - Eh, it sounds good. 

429
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,400
 - Hey, I think this is really good.
- That's true. 

430
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,600
I think it's very good to have everyone to eat a meal and sing together.

431
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,800
We can find an internet cafe so everyone can go online at once and play the game,

432
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:54,100
or, in the game, we can have a celebration event. It'll definitely be very entertaining.

433
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,800
With the way you make it sound, I'm really looking forward to it.

434
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,900
It is a good idea, but where should we meet?

435
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:03,300
Everyone is scattered in all parts of the country. We're not in the same place.

436
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,390
Our server is called Stormy Capital.

437
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,600
Then, the majority of people would be in the capital, right?

438
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,600
For this first time, let's do it in the capital. How's that?

439
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,700
Good! I'm in the capital. Let's do it in the capital.

440
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,000
Wow, I'm really looking forward to it!

441
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,470
I'm also in the capital. I've long hoped for the guild to organize this kind of activity.

442
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,700
- Fantastic!
- Hey,

443
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,300
Guild Leader, let's decide it like this with joy then.

444
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,800
But I'm not there. I'm really jealous of you guys in the capital.

445
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,200
Based on the sound of this, it seems like it would be a lot of fun.

446
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,000
Zhenshui,  should we participate?

447
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,300
Sure. It's pretty interesting.

448
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:36,100
But... there are so many people.

449
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,400
What are you scared of? It's not like you'd be embarrassed to meet them.

450
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,600
Okay. I'll listen to you.

451
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,400
I feel that Tianxia's proposal is very good.

452
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,400
In order to express my support,

453
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,000
- I will cover all the expenses for this meetup.
 - Wow! 

454
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,400
Zhenshui, you really are so generous!

455
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,600
Will you still treat us if it's a seafood feast?

456
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,200
No problem.

457
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,060
Okay.

458
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:06,400
Since everyone is interested, we'll come up with a plan thoroughly.

459
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,850
Eh, Diemeng, last time didn't you meet with Luwei Weiwei?

460
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:11,700
Ask her to come along as well.

461
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,600
Luwei?

462
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:18,200
That's right. Previously, we had many misunderstandings with her. It's an opportunity to have a meal with everyone

463
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,100
and clear up the misunderstandings.

464
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,400
That's right. If she could come, it would be great!

465
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,100
Previously, in the game, we've had some conflicts;

466
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,900
however, the game is the game, and reality is reality.

467
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,900
Last time, didn't Sister Diemeng say that Luwei is very beautiful?

468
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,800
I'm very curious.

469
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,800
Really? Luwei is a beauty?

470
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,400
Didn't they say she was a transvestite? Ask her to meet up and ask her for photos!

471
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,520
Princess Butterfly, this important mission
 (Note: The Die in Diemeng means butterfly) 

472
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,400
is yours.

473
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,570
But Luwei doesn't like these types of meetings.

474
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:56,600
She probably won't come.

475
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,600
Sister Diemeng, last time, didn't you say that you met Luwei?

476
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,600
She shouldn't be scared of meeting us as friends, right?

477
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,600
Could those words you told us last time...

478
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,620
Okay. I'll talk to Luwei.

479
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:12,090
She should give me this consideration.

480
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,190
Okay. It's a deal then.

481
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:17,300
Let's discuss the time.

482
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,700
 Do you guys think I don't know this was your plot? 

483
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,920
 Once the time comes, I don't know who will be humiliated. 

484
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,700
 However, Luwei's personality... 

485
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:36,760
 I reckon I can only... 

486
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,400
It's inconvenient for me since I am driving.  Help me answer the call.

487
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,000
Okay.

488
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,400
Could it be a marketing call?

489
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,200
Hello?

490
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,200
This is my mom's phone number.

491
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:30,000
Hello, Professor. It's inconvenient for Xiao Nai to answer because he is driving.  I am helping him answer the phone.

492
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,300
I'll give it to him now.

493
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,700
Mom, you guys have a signal there, right?

494
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,700
 That's right. We've just came out of the mountains. Hey, 

495
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:47,800
 - that girl who was... who was tricked by you is next to you?
- Yeah. 

496
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,520
She's interning at the company. We just got off work.

497
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,400
I'm first driving her home.

498
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,400
 Just now, I was really startled. 

499
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,800
 I barely spoke two words to her. However, from listening to her voice, 

500
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,800
 she's a good girl. Don't take advantage of her. 

501
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,200
Depends on the circumstance.

502
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,200
 What do you mean by "depends on the circumstance"? 

503
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,300
 But if you did, you definitely need to take responsibility. 

504
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,300
Mom, you're on the speaker.

505
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,800
 Xiao Nai, Student Bei Weiwei, 

506
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,000
 when you're free, come and visit our house. Then we'll leave it at that. 

507
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,800
I think after you take one call,

508
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,200
all three people will hate you.

509
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,500
Thanks for the compliment. I have always been good in this area.

510
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,800
I'm not complimenting you.

511
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:54,000
Also, why when you get a phone call, it doesn't show the name?

512
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,900
I memorize them.

 ♫ Came at just the right time ♫

 ♫ Are like grass blown by the spring wind ♫ 

519
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:37,700
As per my mother's order, I took advantage of you.

529
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,800
Your impression of Black Impermanence is too unexpected. 
 (Note: Black Impermanence is a deity who escorts the dead to the underworld) 

530
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,050
- Scared me to death.
- What Black Impermanence?

531
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:21,000
This is a black facial mask.

532
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,500
Weiwei, I don't want to live anymore!

533
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,740
I just put it on. I'm going to let it absorb

534
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,900
all of my dark energy.

535
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,800
What dark energy? What's wrong?

536
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,900
Today, the Young Master's girlfriends came.

537
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,200
It was really an eye-opener!

538
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,600
Girlfriends?

539
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,600
In any case, it was a band of women. They all looked the same and dressed the same.

540
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,100
But this isn't the key. The key is that

541
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,000
I, a highly skilled intern,

542
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,700
was used like a maid by them today!

543
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:53,000
They also spilled coffee on my white sneakers. I washed them all night but still couldn't get them clean.

544
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
- I don't want to live!
- Hey,

545
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,700
enough. Erxi, you've been mistreated. Come.

546
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,500
I'll massage you to cool your temper, okay?

547
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,600
- Over here.
- Over here?

548
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,700
Ah, how comfortable!

549
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:11,000
That's right! Weiwei, I have something very important, but almost forgot to tell you.

550
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,800
After working hard day and night,

551
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:19,200
my Huantian Xidi's forging skills are finally at the max level!

552
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,000
This is a cause worthy of celebration around the world.

553
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,400
This really is too good! Finally, I don't have to listen to your whining or

554
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,100
help you level up.

555
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,670
That... That sword I made

556
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:36,900
is still missing an ingredient.

557
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,000
I really can't beat... Hey!

558
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,600
Weiwei, Weiwei!

559
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:45,100
Please consider the great trauma I suffered today...

560
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,000
Bring your laptop.

561
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:04,900
