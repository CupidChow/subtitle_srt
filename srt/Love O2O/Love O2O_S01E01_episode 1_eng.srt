 Silence Wang - "An Alluring Smile" 

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,590
 ♫ I always casually tell you my wishes ♫ 

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,550
 ♫ And give you looks that a thousand words wouldn’t be able to describe ♫ 

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,650
 ♫ In this world, there will always be people who are busy looking for treasure ♫ 

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,730
 ♫ But they mistake the blazing sun for it ♫ 

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,470
 ♫ And miss out on the manifestations of life ♫ 

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,310
 ♫ On the long bridge of this ancient city ♫ 

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,430
 ♫ There is a sea of people and cars going on their way ♫ 

9
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,150
 ♫ Your smile is like a ray of light ♫ 

10
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,760
 ♫ That suddenly lights me up ♫ 

11
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,800
 ♫ (Your smile is like a ray of light. That suddenly lights me up) ♫ 

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,770
 ♫ The wind blows gently; summer is not yet over ♫ 

13
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,790
 ♫ Bikes ring on the greenway ♫ 

14
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:53,140
 ♫ So this is what love looks like ♫ 

15
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:58,010
 ♫ Just admit that you were allured by my smile and couldn’t forget me after you first saw me ♫ 

16
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:02,140
 ♫ Saying that love is deep like the sea… you flatter me ♫ 

17
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,930
 ♫ The most romantic thing is to just watch the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder ♫ 

18
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,240
 ♫ That’s the direction my heart goes in ♫ 

19
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,250
 ♫ (Watching the sunset with you shoulder to shoulder. That’s the direction my heart goes in) ♫ 

20
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,310
 ♫ I want to travel to all four corners (of the earth) with you to enjoy the views in all kinds of weather ♫ 

21
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,330
 ♫ I want to write the remaining chapters of life with you ♫ 

22
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,440
 ♫ Sharing the laughs and tears with you freely no matter the circumstances ♫ 

23
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,150
 ♫ Our story won’t end ♫ 

24
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:30,160
   

25
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,060
   

26
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:42,170


27
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,620
   

28
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,860
Luwei Weiwei, be careful.

29
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,660
Zhenshui, I'll aggro him up later.  As usual, find an opportunity to ambush him. 
 (Note:  aggro means getting the gaming character's attention for battle) 

30
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,110
Okay!

31
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,470
Hurry up.  Keep up!

32
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,470
Wow! The Magical Heaven Reversal Necklace?

33
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:12,090
Nini, your equipment.

34
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,010
I'm so lucky today.

35
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,840
The Magical Heaven Reversal Necklace?

36
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,360
Luwei Weiwei, interested in a duel?

37
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,610
Sure.

38
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,280
There should be some prize for a duel, right?

39
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,760
We'll use that necklace the Boss dropped as the stakes. What do you say?

40
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,650
So you have your eye on the necklace.

41
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,990
It's not mine though.

42
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,050
Then I'll battle you.

43
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:42,030
You are among the top ten players on this server.  If I battle you, I'll lose without a doubt.

44
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,550
You can have Luwei Weiwei fight in your place.

45
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,420
If I lose, I'll give you the Magical Heaven Reversal Ring.

46
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,320
Do you dare?

47
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,900
Weiwei?

48
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:58,510
- Okay. 
- Good. See you at 5:00 p.m. at the tavern outside of Jinling City.

49
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,810
Zhenshui, what do you want to see me for?

50
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,850
Are there monsters in this area?

51
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,120
Weiwei, it's been more than six months since we became a couple.

52
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,430
Yet you're still calling me Zhenshui. Isn't it a bit awkward?

53
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,380
Does it seem even more awkward if I call you Wuxiang?

54
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:29,680
Honey, today's task are 12 Three-Eyed Monkeys. Help me kill them.

55
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,810
Sweetie, just stand by and watch. I'll take care of them.

56
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,360
Okay!

57
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:41,620
Weiwei, are you going to college in the capital city?

58
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,200
 I'm also based in the capital city. Should we meet up? I'll treat you to dinner. 

59
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,990
 I know of a really good Japanese restaurant. It's as good as those Three-Star Michelin restaurants in Japan. 

60
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,080
 That's not necessary. Let's just have fun playing the game. 

61
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,310
 There's a saying now that you never know whether it's a person or a dog playing the game with you. 

62
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,180
 I just want to make sure. 

63
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,770
 I want... to see what you look like. 

64
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,920
 Could you show me your picture? 

65
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:36,010
 Professor Yu's class is just so good. 

66
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:39,010
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello to you all.

67
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,820
Weiwei, nobody's around. Hurry up!

68
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,140
What's going on? Why did the electricity go out all of a sudden?

69
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,460
The circuit seems to have blown out.

70
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,660
I was just cooking noodles and it got blown out?

71
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,670
Will Auntie ( the dorm supervisor ) yell at us?

72
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:59,490
Sister, couldn't you have calculated the amount of current required before cooking?

73
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:04,530
Come on, Dear. I major in Computer Science, not Electrical Engineering.

74
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,100
What do I do? My noodles aren't done yet.

75
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,810
What's this about what to do? Share half the noodles with me.

76
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,710
All right.

77
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,490
You're awesome!

78
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,360
No wonder the girls in science and engineering have such a hard time getting married.

79
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,050
If we can handle all electrical work ourselves, what do we need guys for?

80
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,850
First of all, I did handle the electrical work,

81
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:36,040
but it has nothing to do with your problem in finding a boyfriend.

82
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,000
Secondly, Miss Erxi, my online friend just asked me for a picture.

83
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,720
I just suddenly disappeared. He must have thought I have something to hide.

84
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,990
How are you going to compensate me for the damage to my reputation?

85
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,310
Do you mean Zhenshui Wuxiang, your partner in the game?

86
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,170
Wow, Bei Weiwei!

87
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,810
Stop right there!

88
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,240
How do you know that so clearly?

89
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,730
Were you peeping on me while I was playing?

90
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,930
Don't worry about the details.

91
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:07,820
- So, are you going to show him a picture?
- Of course not.

92
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,920
We only became a couple so we could tackle territorial quests.

93
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,370
It'd be really weird to show my picture.

94
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,630
However, it's not very nice to immediately log off.

95
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,850
At the very least, I have to find an excuse.

96
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:21,760
For example, something like "my computer is broken" or "I lost all my pictures."

97
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,280
No way.

98
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,970
Your laptop's not working and all your photos are gone?

99
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,310
You jinxed me.

100
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,150
Why is this not working?

101
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:42,130
Weiwei, I forgot to tell you that

102
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:45,350
when I borrowed your laptop yesterday,

103
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,460
I accidentally dropped it.

104
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,560
Where are you running off to? Where are you running off to? Come back here!

105
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,450
Just what happened? You'd better explain.

106
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:00,100
- Let's go.
- Let me finish eating my noodles first!

107
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,860
What eating now? You broke my laptop and still in the mood to eat? No way!

108
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,420
Go!

109
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,310
It's such a nice day today.

110
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:13,740
Xiao Ling went to see her boyfriend. Si Si is attending a classmate gathering,

111
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,940
but I have to go with you for your computer repair.

112
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,340
This lovely spring day is going to be wasted.

113
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:22,120
You have the nerve to say that! Who broke my laptop? Get going!

114
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,340
Here.

115
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:42,120
Some new movies are coming out lately.

116
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,080
Let's go to a movie after you drop off your laptop for repair.

117
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,820
I won't leave it with the store. I plan to buy a motherboard and replace it myself.

118
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:52,090
It saves money and is quick. Besides, I have to use it tonight.

119
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,120
Do you need it so urgently?

120
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,190
Of course. A studious and ambitious Computer Science student like me

121
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,410
cannot be away from the computer for even a day.

122
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,410
- All right? 
- He he!

123
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,480
Tell the truth.

124
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:09,060
I have a duel tonight.

125
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,730
I knew it.

126
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,040
In the blink of an eye, we are sophomores already. 
 I never thought at Tsinghua University

127
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,870
where there is such a large disparity in number of males and females,

128
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:26,370
and in the Computer Science Department which has an even bigger gender imbalance,  two years have passed,

129
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:30,030
and still no one took notice of me.  It's so sad.

130
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,670
Don't tell me you chose this major for that reason.

131
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:39,210
Of course, that's not the only reason.

132
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:43,690
Tsinghua University, which has the top science and engineering programs, is definitely the college I dreamed about.

133
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,150
Computer Science is also the field of study that I like.

134
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:51,210
However, none of that should interfere with my marriage planning.

135
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,610
Let's go to see what that's about! Hurry!

136
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,610
What are they all looking at?

137
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,310
   

138
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,910
   

139
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,940
Xiao Nai is coming back to play in the basketball game!

140
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,910
That's great! We can see him play basketball again!

141
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:35,150
 It's Computer Science versus Biochemistry. Xiao Nai is the star player. We should get to see him this time. 

142
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:39,530
 Not necessarily.  Xiao Nai is already a senior and he rarely shows up at school. 

143
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:43,430
I heard that there hasn't been any update for that mysterious post on the chat forum.

144
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,940
I think it might just be another gimmick this time.

145
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:51,230
Who cares? There's nothing to lose by going to take a look. Besides, this is the last time we'll get to see him in person.

146
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:55,470
 True. It breaks my heart to think of it. Why isn't he going to the graduate school? 

147
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:59,460
 - Exactly. It's such a shame. 
- That's right.
- Hey, you all have to go later. 

148
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:03,200
We need to get there an hour early to grab seats.

149
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,890
Weiwei, I didn't realize that you'd be so smitten.

150
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:12,080
Of course. It's the legend. I've downloaded every piece of software he's released.

151
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,320
If the school publishes a list of ranking like in games,

152
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,690
he would be number one in all the skills.

153
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:24,700
Girl, you sure have substance. I only look at the face and the body.

154
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,080
I really can't understand what goes on in the brains of you geniuses.

155
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,160
By the way, just who deleted that video of his swimming meet?

156
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,110
- I really want to see it! 
- Hush.

157
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,660
Yiran, let's buy this.

158
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:59,870
Na Na, I don't even know him.

159
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,470
How can I get him to help me?

160
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:06,210
Don't worry. I met someone in his dorm a couple days ago.

161
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:08,130
That's how I came up with this idea.

162
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:12,630
We just have to buy the RAM and then go to them for help.

163
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:16,700
I don't believe that they could have any excuse not to help once they hear your name.

164
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,910
Don't worry.

165
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,430
I've already told him. The merchandise has been shipped.

166
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,240
Just have him check, okay?

167
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,300
- Boss, how much is this?
- 500 yuan.

168
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,390
500 yuan? Is it that expensive?

169
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:40,600
Go ahead and ask around. It's the same price everywhere. This stuff is not the same, all right?

170
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,970
Sell it to us cheaper. How about 450 yuan?

171
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:47,070
Not a cent less. I'm already selling it to you at the lowest price.

172
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:52,250
Boss, isn't your price a bit unreasonable?

173
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:57,500
The contacts on your memory stick don't have the proper sheen. It's obviously a used item.

174
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,740
You're selling it as new and even twice as expensive.
 Are you trying to pull a fast one on us?

175
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,870
Nonsense! What do you know? Stop meddling!

176
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,540
I'm a Computer Science major. Why wouldn't I know?

177
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:12,190
Your shop is right outside the school, yet the way you do business is so shady.

178
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,980
Once the word gets out, it won't be good for your business.

179
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,480
That's right! You're so shady.

180
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:24,090
Where's the former boss? Where is he? Has there been a change of hands?

181
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,810
What former boss? It's always been me, okay?

182
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:30,890
What's with you two girls? Did you come here just to cause trouble?

183
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:34,580
You girls look so pretty and proper, but you're full of lies! Leave.

184
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,900
Classmates, the memory sticks of this brand usually only cost around 200 yuan.

185
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,600
If you don't believe me, just check online.

186
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:47,320
- The ones online are fake so, of course, they're cheaper. 
- She seems to be Bei Weiwei.

187
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:53,610
Fellow schoolmates, thank you. However, I believe the store owner wouldn't lie to us.

188
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:57,430
And he has a business to run, so it's only fair that he should make a profit.

189
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:09,980
She was acting all refined and considerate!  Who was she trying to impress?

190
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,420
We were helping her, but instead, we were made to be the bad guys. Here.

191
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,650
I know why!  It must be because you're Bei Weiwei and she's Meng Yiran.

192
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:24,680
Don't tell me you don't know who Meng Yiran is? The school beauty queen.

193
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:31,280
- I thought she looked familiar. 
- That must be it.

194
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:36,180
In the school beauty contest last year, the competition between you two was so fierce like a raging fire.

195
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,330
How could she not act high and noble in front of you?

196
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:43,410
It wasn't like a raging fire. Who was the one who submitted my photo last year?

197
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:50,240
You already searched my computer and cell phone last year. It wasn't me!

198
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,200
Besides, why would I post such a blurry photo?

199
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:59,520
If I were really the one who took the picture, I would definitely take a high-quality photo

200
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,550
of a full-frontal shower scene!

201
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:08,140
Do you think Meng Yiran's photo was Photoshopped? The kind of editing that takes several days?

202
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:12,610
She doesn't look as good as the photo on the forum. Had she posted a real photo,

203
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:16,620
Weiwei, I guarantee you wouldn't have lost last year!

204
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,050
I'm going to the internet cafe later.

205
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:24,440
Also, I recall that she won last year. She was first, and I was second.

206
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,000
Theoretically, I should be the one feeling hostile toward her. Why would she be hostile towards me?

207
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,340
Who knows?  Maybe...

208
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,010
her chest is flat.

209
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:39,040
Geez! My dear!

210
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,370
She must be.

211
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:44,300
I finally know why you can't get a boyfriend.

212
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,010
Why? Tell me and I'll change right away.

213
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:51,560
- It's obvious because you're more concerned with girls.
- Weiwei, don't think I won't hit you!

214
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,670
All right, I'll stop teasing you. Bring my laptop back with you later. Bye!

215
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:01,270
How could you talk about me? You're stuck to a computer all day!

216
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:12,480
I heard from your father that you're planning on starting your own company.

217
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:15,190
I do have that plan in mind.

218
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,350
In what field?

219
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,200
I'll develop two games first.

220
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,890
If you win this round, I'll give you a gift.

221
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,010
Weiwei!

222
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:58,430
Luwei Weiwei, I thought you were too scared to come.

223
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,230
I don't seem to be late.

224
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:05,160
Late or not, the outcome will be the same.  Get ready to give up the necklace.

225
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,030
Let's begin.

226
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,280
Your turn.

227
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,040
Thanks for taking it easy on me.

228
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,300
Thanks for taking it easy on me.

229
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:27,710
 Geez. No wonder Luwei Weiwei is the only female player in the Player Rankings. She is such a game master. 

230
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:31,760
 Exactly. How can she control her jumps so well? 

231
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,740
 Those dodges were epic. 

232
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,930
 With this level of skill, how is she only ranked number six? 

233
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:42,460
 - I wonder who the number one is. 
- Isn't he the legendary Yixiao Naihe? I don't think I've ever seen him. 

234
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:47,050
 That name is so pretentious. How could he choose such a username? 

235
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:50,040
 Luwei Weiwei, let's have another match! 

236
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:56,590
 Sure! But I'm now at an internet cafe and have only bought for one hour. 

237
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,600
 Let's finish this quickly, then. 

238
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,660
According to our agreement a moment ago,

239
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:05,920
you won this round, so I'm going to give you a gift.

240
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:11,420
I'll give this place to you.  Aren't you starting a gaming company?

241
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:15,680
After renovating this place, it should be suitable for your startup period.

242
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,000
Uncle, those were your terms. I didn't agree with them.

243
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,580
Don't you want it?

244
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,100
I don't.

245
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,540
Good boy! You got ambition.

246
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:33,530
I just think there's more joy in starting from the ground up.

247
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:37,670
Moreover, I've already found a place.

248
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:49,720
We're both oddballs with gene mutations. We both like tinkering with computers.

249
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,420
You mentioned that your father is in archaeology and your mom in history.

250
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:58,710
And yet, you're into computer science!  I can tell that you are of the same color as your uncle here.

251
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:01,750
I don't have enough energy to manage this place.

252
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,560
If you don't want this place, I'll let it go vacant first.

253
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,490
Boss, there's a call for you.

254
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,040
Okay.

255
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:32,790
♫  Rain drips on my jacket  ♫

256
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:36,500
♫  Longing (for you) soaks the corners of my clothes  ♫

257
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,010
♫  The signal you gave me, a smile  ♫

258
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:43,590
♫  Came at just the right time  ♫

259
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:47,030
♫  As I pass by you, the tips of your hair  ♫

260
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:50,790
♫  Are like grass blown by the spring wind  ♫

261
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:54,180
♫  Romance is fermenting  ♫
♫  For you, I’m willing to  ♫

262
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,890
♫  Chase away all the troubles  ♫

263
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:01,460
♫  I want to take you to the ends of the earth  ♫

264
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:05,040
♫  I want to listen to your heartbeat  ♫

265
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,440
♫  I want to give you a hug  ♫

266
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,270
♫  And make the whole world know  ♫

267
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:15,840
♫  Only after meeting you did I realize how important you are to me  ♫

268
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,780
♫  No one else can feel your sweetest smile  ♫

269
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:24,270
What's up?  It's about time.

270
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:26,650
Let's go to your house to eat.  I'll cook a tasty dinner for you.

271
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:34,980
♫  You are so important to me  ♫

272
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:58,230
Xiao Ling! Xiao Ling! Xiao Ling!

273
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,310
What's wrong now?

274
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,920
I don't know how to solve this problem.

275
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,540
Erxi, can you please go and collect my bed sheet for me?

276
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,540
I'm busy.

277
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,200
This one.

278
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:15,490
 Hurry. It's going to rain. Hurry. 

279
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:18,440
 Hurry up! Hurry up! 

280
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:26,230
Erxi, can you get my bed sheet for me, please?

281
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,460
With the time you spent asking me to get it for you, you could have already collected yourself.

282
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,550
- Don't I have a face mask on, do I?
- Si Si, Si Si...

283
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,630
- Someone's knocking. Someone's knocking. 
- So annoying.
-  Erxi, open the door. 

284
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:35,160
- Coming. 
-  Xiao Ling, hurry up. 

285
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,120
Oh my! Thank you, Weiwei. Thank you!

286
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,770
It's raining so hard. Why didn't anyone get the sheet?

287
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:53,120
Weiwei, you came back so late.  Where did you go?

288
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,300
Do you even need to ask? For sure, Heroine Bei went to conquer the online game.

289
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,170
I was the one who brought her computer back for her.

290
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,780
That's right.  I've returned it to its proper owner now.

291
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,910
Thank you, Heroine Erxi.

292
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:09,240
It reminds me when Heroine Bei and I tried to help someone today, we were almost irritated to death.

293
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,170
- What happened?
- It's all because of Meng Yiran!

294
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,990
Meng Yiran?

295
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:19,330
Weiwei, when did you get to know Meng Yiran? I never heard you talk about her.

296
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,620
I don't know her.

297
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:24,030
We happened to run into her when we went to the electronics store earlier today.

298
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:27,920
The owner tried to rip her off by trying to sell her a RAM for double the market price since she didn't know any better.

299
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,460
I couldn't just watch without doing anything as a Computer Science major.

300
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:34,720
You were obviously helping her, but what did she say?

301
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,900
"Fellow classmates, thank you. However, I believe the store owner wouldn't lie to us."

302
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:44,680
"And he has a business to run, so it's only fair that he should make a profit."

303
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,610
She's acting all noble, but what about us?

304
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:51,760
She made us look petty and stingy; consequently, the owner wouldn't even sell anything to us.

305
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,850
Weiwei, what are you going to do about your computer?

306
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:58,330
Replacing the motherboard has always been expensive.  So, I've thought about it.

307
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:02,070
Later, I can just buy a capacitor part and switch it myself.

308
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:06,230
Capacitor part?

309
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,860
Even though I am also a student in the Department of Computer Science,

310
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:14,020
I feel, however, Bei Weiwei and I are in different Computer Science departments.

311
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:17,010
I don't understand at all.

312
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,680
Plus one ( Me too ).

313
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:25,030
I am so lonely, forlorn, and cold.

314
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,850
Where is the thing I put here this morning? Did anyone see it?

315
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:33,080
Are you looking for your notebook of gaming notes?

316
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,650
 Do you know where it is? 

317
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:36,040
It's right here.

318
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,820
Thank you, kisses.

319
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:41,940
You take notes everyday, but I don't even know what you are jotting down.

320
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:46,850
In your life, other than studying, playing games and taking notes, can't you do something else?

321
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:50,630
I don't need anything else.  I find this very fulfilling.  You shouldn't underestimate this.

322
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:54,370
This notebook might help me one day become a game developer.

323
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:56,670
If I am lucky, I might be able to work for Feng Teng Corporation

324
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:59,100
or be part of the team that designs the new "A Chinese Ghost Story II."

325
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,030
Erxi!

326
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,720
I just don't get it.

327
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,400
Other people play games to kill time, but you play games to plan your future.

328
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,430
The brain of a genius is truly different from us normal people.

329
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,490
Yiran, I'm currently writing a draft.  Just wait for me here for a moment.  I will be done soon.

330
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,760
So was that Weiwei who helped us haggle yesterday?

331
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:47,500
Yes, the one who got second place in the school beauty contest; the one who lost to you.

332
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,530
She's quite pretty.

333
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:51,150
How is she pretty when compared to you?

334
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,400
Her look is so common,

335
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,740
just like a flower vase you put in the corner ( of the room ).

336
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,930
If she were in a TV drama, she would be the supporting actress.

337
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:01,100
There is no way she can match your aura.

338
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,690
Na Na, you shouldn't talk about her like that.

339
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:07,430
Fine, fine, fine. Can't I even speak the truth?

340
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,830
She's a bit different from what I thought.

341
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:12,200
She seems quite helpful.

342
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,500
Yiran, don't fall for her trick.

343
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:20,000
She is only trying to show off and make us look foolish.

344
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,220
It doesn't seem to be the case.

345
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:27,500
Miss Yiran, just because you like a boy who is a computer science major,

346
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,620
it doesn't mean that all computer science students are nice people.

347
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:34,460
- Stop talking nonsense. 
- I mean it.

348
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:38,630
A few days ago, Cao Guang took a picture of Bei Weiwei getting out of a fancy car.

349
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:41,460
That car is worth at least several millions.

350
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,100
Bei Weiwei isn't as innocent as you think.

351
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,530
- Really?
- Of course!

352
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:49,410
Speaking of the devil... he just got here.

353
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:57,800
Cao Guang, about the picture you took of Bei Weiwei getting out of a fancy car, can you please let me and Yiran see it?

354
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,650
How did you know about that?

355
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,800
I was right behind you,

356
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,960
but you reacted so fast.   I didn't even think about taking a photo.

357
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,320
- I've deleted it. 
- You've deleted it?

358
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,430
Did you fall for her and are trying to protect her?

359
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,940
You must be joking. Why would I like that kind of girl?

360
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:25,000
Yiran, did you hear what Cao Guang just said?

361
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,110
One's appearance comes from what's in the heart. So,  don't be so naive.

362
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:54,890
Weiwei, Zhen Yi Technology is also recruiting summer interns; looking for some from the Computer Science Department.

363
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:56,690
Why don't I help you apply for it?

364
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:58,960
Okay, that sounds good.

365
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,220
I need to find an internship for summer break anyway.

366
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,610
Why don't you help Xiao Ling and Si Si apply as well?

367
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,720
Okay!

368
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,700
Done.

369
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,970
You really fixed it.

370
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:28,200
In the future when I have computer problems, I will be relying on you.

371
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,010
No problem. Five-cent repair services at your disposal.

372
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:37,430
The minute you fix your computer, you go and play your game. Gaming is your life.

373
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:39,670
I've already studied what I needed to study for

374
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:41,860
and finished the homework that I needed to do.

375
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:45,850
This only shows how efficient I am.

376
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:50,660
Wow, I threw out a casual compliment and you are falling in love with yourself!

377
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:54,890
Actually, I used to think that playing games was a waste of time.

378
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:59,600
But after playing the game, I realized that it's like entering a whole new world.

379
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,170
If you have both the dream and talent, why not work hard for your goals?

380
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:48,760
Weiwei, come to the Stone of Three Lives. Let's dissolve our partnership.

381
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,100
Why?

382
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,360
I'm sorry. Don't ask why.

383
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,390
I will give you a set of Heaven Reverse equipment as compensation.

384
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,430
 There's even a break-up compensation? 

385
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:03,480
 No need. I'm coming over. I will see you soon. 

386
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,100
You're here, Weiwei.

387
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,180
I'm really sorry.

388
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,660
It's okay.

389
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,510
Let's go now.

390
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:44,590
 What is this eve with the same moon as before, and how long will the love and hate last? 

391
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:49,650
 As the sea and earth switch their places, as the moon cycles through the dimly crescent and brightly full,  the fate of marriage is the hardest to find. 

392
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,230
   

393
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:53,200
   

394
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:14,210
 As you drink the Water of Forget Love, the heroic couple will become strangers. 

395
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,100
 The relationship between Luwei Weiwei and Zhenshui Wuxiang has been broken. 

396
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,990
 From this moment on, the fate between them has ended and the two no longer have any attachment to each other. 

397
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:29,160
I still have other quests, so I will be leaving now.

398
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,700
Wait a moment.

399
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:37,070
Please accept this equipment set.

400
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,830
Just think of it as my compensation to you.

401
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,290
Really, no need.

402
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:43,520
We became a couple, so that we could complete the quests.

403
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,840
No need to feel any burden when we break up.

404
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:51,700
I am going to do my daily quests now. If we ever have the chance again, let's fight monsters together.

405
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,850
All right, then.

406
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,840
Weiwei!

407
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:05,170
- How can you still be in the mood to gather herbs? 
-  What's wrong?

408
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:08,560
Yet you're asking me why! Did you split up with Zhenshui?

409
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,920
Yes, I thought it was something serious.

410
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,650
How can you be so calm?

411
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:17,140
I heard he's going to form a couple with Xiaoyu Yaoyao.

412
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,460
Xiaoyu Yaoyao?

413
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,060
Did you not know?

414
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:24,990
She placed first in the poll for Dream Angel, and is also known as the number one beauty.

415
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:27,460
Hurry up to take a look on the website. Stop gathering herbs.

416
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,400
I'll go now.

417
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,550
   

418
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:40,940
   

419
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,410
 Did you guys really break up? 

420
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:50,010
 Yes. We only became a couple to complete quests of the game. 

421
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:52,230
 Don't think too much about it. 

422
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,070
 I still find it a shame. 

423
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:56,730
 Actually, Zhenshui's pretty nice. 

424
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,970
 Who knew he would also fold before a pretty face? 

425
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:02,460
 However, Xiaoyu Yaoyao is quite pretty. 

426
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:06,670
 I heard Xiaoyu Yaoyao's target before was someone on the equipment ranking leaderboard. 

427
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:09,150
 I didn't expect her to pair up with Zhenshui. 

428
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:13,200
 But lately, I've often spotted them training together to level up. 

429
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:16,270
 Oh, so that's what happened. 

430
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,720
 I don't blame Zhenshui, though. 

431
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:23,750
 Weiwei, actually... 

432
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:27,040
 Actually what? 

433
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,210
 Your skill is so strong. 

434
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:31,160
 You're sixth in the player ranking. 

435
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,650
 Moreover, you never ask men for equipment and don't share your profile picture. 

436
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:39,640
 Actually, everybody suspects you're a transvestite. 

437
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:42,280
 Transvestite? 

438
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:48,620
Come on!  I'm a transvestite just because I won't show my profile picture?!

439
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:51,230
What will become of this world that focuses only on the face?

440
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,760
Bei Weiwei!

441
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,360
You're the beauty queen of the department! If you say that, what are the rest of us to do?

442
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,320
Quiet down. Just when I was getting to the best part

443
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:03,460
and imagining myself as the female lead,  you then yanked me back to reality!

444
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,330
 Congratulations to Hero Zhenshui Wuxiang 

445
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:11,340
 and Heroine Xiaoyu Yaoyao for your pledge of eternal love 

446
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,940
 in forming this happy union. 

447
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,850
 - So impressive!
 - Yes, yes. 

448
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:46,570
 - I have high hopes for them.
 - Yes, they're very capable.
- They are quite a good match.
 - Yes. 

449
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:50,190
 Are you kidding? It's a match made in Heaven. 

450
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,730
What's that?

451
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,560
 That's right. 

452
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,600

453
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,420
   

454
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,450
   

455
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:17,340
Take a guess about how much money Zhenshui Wuxiang will give this time with his red envelope?

456
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:21,560
888 yuan for prosperity. That's what I want, anyway.

457
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,850
I can't help but think of Luwei Weiwei right now.

458
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:27,340
I wonder how she's feeling.

459
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,060
Luwei Weiwei?

460
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,040
 Isn't this Luwei Weiwei? 

461
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:35,800
 Does everybody see that? I saw Zhenshui Wuxiang's former partner standing on the Vermilion Bird Bridge! 

462
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,380
 Yes, Yes, I see her! It's true. 

463
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:42,170
 I see her.  I feel the sight of her backside seems so sad. 

464
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:44,870
 This world only cherishes the cheers from the new couple. 

465
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,490
 When did they ever notice the weeping of the old partner? 

466
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:50,150
My goodness! It's going to be fun today!

467
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,630
She might be here to snatch the groom.

468
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,580
 Internet slang again? 

469
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,770
 - I hate internet slang the most! 
 - Weiwei, hurry up! I need to go too!

470
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:20,690
-  So what about the internet slang? Are you discriminating against another medium? 
- Wait for a moment.

471
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:22,530
 I support Luwei Weiwei to snatch Zhenshui! 

472
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:25,610
 Xiaoyu Yaoyao is mine! 

473
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,360
All right, almost done!

474
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:37,480
 Third wheel! She's a pretty woman, but why would she resort to this tactic? 

475
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:41,330
 Why so ostentatious? Her partner was taken. Of course, she has to show her displeasure. 

476
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:44,000
 - Xiaoyu Yaoyao is shameless!
- Xiaoyu Yaoyao is shameless! 

477
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,600
 She's really shameless. 

478
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,320
 Player Xiaoyu Yaoyao is shameless. 

479
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,070
  108 banned for 24 hours for using uncivilized language. 

480
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:57,920
What's wrong with that Luwei Weiwei?

481
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,610
She's been dumped, yet still has the nerve to show up and cause trouble?

482
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:02,860
That's right, Zhenshui. How did you handle things?

483
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:06,120
That ugly woman must dislike Yaoyao and deliberately came to cause trouble.

484
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,070
Our Yaoyao is being bullied. You'd better give us an explanation!

485
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:11,250
That's right. Give us an explanation!

486
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,560
Don't blame Zhenshui. He doesn't want this, either.

487
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,700
I trust him.

488
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:22,010
Yaoyao, I will clear this up.

489
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,850
Weiwei, hurry up!

490
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:55,170
I only went to the bathroom. What did I just do...

491
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:58,070
for everyone to mistake me for planning to snatch the groom?

492
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,870
If I run off now,

493
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:11,220
the gossiping masses will surely believe that I'm heartbroken and running off in tears.

494
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,970
 What's going on? Weren't you cool with it yesterday? 

495
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:26,990
 Also, I already tried to compensate you. You didn't want it yourself. 

496
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:31,190
 Fellow player, I just came to join in the festivities. 

497
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:40,470
It's awkward whether I leave or stay.

498
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,610
I got it!

499
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:58,500
   
 Take a look over here! New potions freshly brewed from the top-level alchemists. I'm offering them at 20% off!

500
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,990
-  Top-level potions?
- 20% off? 

501
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:03,330
-  That cheap? I want it!
- I want it, too! 

502
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:05,840
 -  Give me one. 
- I want it as well. Give me!  

503
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,810
-  Give me one. Give me! 
- I was here first. Don't cut in. 

504
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:12,950
 Have some order. Get in line. Line up! 

505
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:15,930
 I came first! I want it! 

506
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:17,380
 I came first! I came first! 

507
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:20,320
All right, all right. All sold out now.

508
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,800
- When will you be selling again? 
- That's right! When?

509
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,800
When I feel like it.

510
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,580
- Let's leave. 
- Time to go.

511
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,010
 Let's leave. 

512
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:33,560
 Let's go. 

513
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,320
 Luwei Weiwei. 

514
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,050
Yixiao Naihe?

515
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,620
The top-ranked player on this server, Yixiao Naihe?

516
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:12,510
 A master, an idol, and rich! 

517
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:20,950
Brother Yixiao Naihe, did you called out to me?

518
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:23,420
What did you think of this event?

519
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:27,330
 Did the legend come here to gossip as well? 

520
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,510
It's very grand.

521
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:33,040
Would you like to have an even grander wedding ceremony?

522
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:38,830
Couple up with me.

523
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:52,900


524
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,600
Yang Yang -  "Just One Smile Is Very Alluring"
