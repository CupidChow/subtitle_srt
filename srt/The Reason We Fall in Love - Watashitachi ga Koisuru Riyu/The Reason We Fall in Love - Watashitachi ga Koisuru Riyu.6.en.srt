1
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,350
Oh, um—

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,100
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:12,310
- Is everything all right?
- F-Fine! I'll text you later.

4
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:21,420
Where did I go wrong?

5
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,440
First, we stopped to grab groceries after work.

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,740
We even held hands on the way back.

7
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,990
Then I made gratin for dinner.

8
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,460
She seemed to enjoy it.

9
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,810
Finally, after dinner...

10
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,150
Up to that point, everything seemed to be going well.

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,710
Right?

12
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,680
Oh, um—

13
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,410
That's it.

14
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:02,590
She only started acting strange, after I took my shirt off.

15
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,640
No, don't tell me...

16
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,740
Is it because I have a beer belly?

17
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,700
Or is it because I smelled sweaty?

18
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,420
Or is it because I have an old person smell?

19
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,930
What're your thoughts, Akira?

20
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,610
[Aoi Morita: I'm sorry.]

21
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,870
Good morning, Ichikawa-san.

22
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,390
Morning. Early hours don't dampen your energy?

23
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,950
Nope. Especially with how much fun I had yesterday.

24
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,200
- I got it!
- There you go! That was amazing!

25
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,400
My muscles are so sore. Especially my arms.

26
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,530
- You were eager to score a hit.
- I suppose.

27
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,740
Not as "eager" as the one sporting a bedhead to work, though.

28
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,050
Sorry about that.

29
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,150
Let's go again sometime.

30
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,650
Then, are you free tomorrow?

31
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,910
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

32
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,830
Sure, why not?

33
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,050
Awesome.

34
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,630
Romance with an adult is difficult.

35
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:52,610
Though I'm often at her side, our eyes never meet.

36
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,290
One misstep is all it will take

37
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,870
for her to distance herself.

38
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,560
[The Reason We Fall in Love]

39
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,640
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

40
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,750
Good morning.

41
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,110
Morita-san, do you have a moment?

42
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,240
Yes, coming.

43
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:36,420
Did she realize how troublesome it would be to pursue a relationship with her direct boss?

44
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,230
Is that why she apologized?

45
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,260
I can only assume that's it...

46
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,040
You're staring daggers at Aoi-san.

47
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,460
Like an open book, aren't you?

48
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,160
I don't know what you're talking about.

49
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,300
Keep this up, and the whole office will catch on.

50
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:02,800
Or what, have you started going out after all?

51
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:11,520
Now you get to be with your loved one even at work. Lucky you.

52
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,020
Every day's a date for you two.

53
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,630
Drop it. What did you want?

54
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,390
Right. I needed your approval on this.

55
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,250
Let me see.

56
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,660
Hey, Itami...

57
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,990
Looks good.

58
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,220
Thank you.

59
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,430
Just make this part easier to understand at a glance.

60
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,140
Will do.

61
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,120
You missed a conversion here, too.

62
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,820
- Sorry, sir.
- Keep it in mind for next time.

63
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,520
Right.

64
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,100
Everything else looks fine to me.

65
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,850
Sir.

66
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,410
Could I... have a moment?

67
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,240
Sir...

68
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,060
I'm sorry for running out yesterday.

69
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,210
It's fine.

70
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,420
If anything, I should apologize.

71
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,760
No, you have nothing to apologize for.

72
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,790
It's a personal issue anyway.

73
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,460
What?

74
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,220
No, well...

75
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,800
How to put it...

76
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,750
The problem lies with my own feelings on the matter.

77
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:50,010
So... You mean...

78
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,460
Excuse me!

79
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,650
I've booked this meeting room.

80
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,650
Now out with you both!

81
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:04,020
In any case, I'm sorry!

82
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,480
Are you just going to stand there?

83
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,400
Sorry.

84
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,430
Sorry, you both.

85
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,300
I do have someone I like.

86
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,410
Oh my gosh, calm down!

87
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,100
You don't have to cry.

88
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,620
But I'm just so happy.

89
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,190
Sad, too.

90
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,720
Not to mention worried...

91
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,840
You should not be crying waterfalls about this.

92
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,830
It's only your little sister getting married.

93
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:15,060
I'm more worried for my emotionally unstable brother here.

94
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,610
Thanks for worrying.

95
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,470
Sorry for crying like that.

96
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,370
You sure you're okay?

97
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:25,520
Come on, you're losing precious tears.

98
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,830
A problem with how she felt...

99
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:35,370
Does that mean her feelings have changed entirely?

100
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,780
No, that doesn't sound right.

101
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:42,320
Maybe she got turned off by an older guy who was rushing things?

102
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,810
Either way, does that mean she dislikes me now?

103
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,580
Am I being rejected?

104
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:05,160
Remember that younger guy I mentioned the other day?

105
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:10,590
Well, I saw him and his crush mutually confess to each other.

106
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,300
She was around his age.

107
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,310
The whole scene screamed "young love".

108
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:25,730
They were like the definition of adolescence.

109
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,050
It was all too dazzling for me.

110
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:34,800
You're not listening, are you?

111
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,880
Sorry.

112
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,540
What was that?

113
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,520
Nothing.

114
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,600
So, what's on your mind?

115
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,170
Nothing, really.

116
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:56,810
You scored a cute girlfriend, so why are you acting all angsty?

117
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,180
No reason.

118
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,700
Sorry, I'm late.

119
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,760
No worries.

120
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,960
- Let's go.
- Right.

121
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,040
You reminded me.

122
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,910
- Yes?
- Can we postpone our outing tonight?

123
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,280
What?

124
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:20,310
A coworker of mine is going through a rough patch, and I'm worried for them.

125
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,620
I want to help them through it.

126
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,600
Sorry.

127
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,140
I see.

128
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,960
I understand.

129
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,870
Hey, at least you now have Friday free.

130
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:37,020
You should spend it with your girlfriend.

131
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:41,860
Ma'am, I told you. I don't have a girlfriend.

132
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,530
Right, right.

133
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,650
I've been eyeing this cat-shaped pudding, too.

134
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:54,670
That also looks delicious.

135
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:57,330
Makes me want to visit all your recommendations.

136
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,420
Really?

137
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,590
Let's do it!

138
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,830
- Excited?
- Very.

139
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,560
Yikes, I have to get going.

140
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,560
- Sorry about that.
- It's all right.

141
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,960
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

142
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,880
Bye for now.

143
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,300
Good evening.

144
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,590
Oh, Aoi-chan! How's it going?

145
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,840
Kei-chan...

146
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,440
Is something wrong?

147
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,220
What should I do?

148
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,430
Everything okay?

149
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,380
These pickled veggies are good.

150
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,950
Thanks.

151
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:45,270
What's up? You look really down in the dumps.

152
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,400
Nothing's up. It's no big deal.

153
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,990
It is a big deal, isn't it?

154
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,700
Did you have a fight with Morita-san?

155
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,220
Wait, you're going out with Morita-san?

156
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:02,810
Things are going well with you two, right?

157
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,130
Yeah.

158
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,060
More or less.

159
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:11,490
More or less? But you went over to his place, right?

160
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,360
Yeah.

161
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,900
Don't tell me.

162
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,020
Did you not go all the way?

163
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:24,150
- Is he a clean freak?
- No, nothing like that.

164
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,080
Then what's the issue?

165
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,300
- Well...
- Hey you two.

166
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,120
Sorry I'm late.

167
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,690
What were you two talking about?

168
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,890
- Nothing, really.
- Nothing, really.

169
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,000
Huh?

170
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,940
Ozu-san is my cute junior. You'd better cherish her.

171
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,430
I will.

172
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:54,360
She's young, but doesn't hesitate to state her own opinions, right?

173
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,960
Exactly.

174
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,390
She's always clear to tell me where, what, and when.

175
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:02,420
She never backs down on her word either.

176
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,590
Tomonari, are you seriously all right?

177
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,590
Fine.

178
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:12,820
Forget him. Sure, we gathered for his sake,

179
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:17,460
but if all he gives us are small quips, he's not helping his case.

180
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,790
I suppose...

181
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,870
Anyway, keep talking romance. I want to hear more.

182
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,670
What about you?

183
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,150
Me?

184
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:29,600
Forget about me, I've got nothing interesting to share.

185
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,000
Forget about me, I've got nothing interesting to share.

186
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,600
Let it out anyway.

187
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,650
There's nothing I can do.

188
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:44,550
I'll always be like a younger brother to her, nothing more.

189
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,210
Really?

190
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:47,700
Yeah.

191
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:52,950
She seems to think I have a girlfriend.

192
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:57,560
And I think she has a boyfriend as well.

193
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,990
I see. Then of course you'd be cautious.

194
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:06,820
Really? Personally, I'd just ask if she actually had a boyfriend.

195
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,490
And if there was a misunderstanding, I'd want to clear it up, fast.

196
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:13,620
Sensitive topics are hard to broach.

197
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,830
They're even harder to answer.

198
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:21,990
You're right about that...

199
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,200
Seriously, it was delicious.

200
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,070
So, how far did you two go?

201
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,450
What? What's wrong?

202
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,480
That's not something you just ask people.

203
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,900
It's private.

204
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,550
- Utsunomiya.
- Huh?

205
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:40,230
So, they went as far as Utsunomiya, to get those dumplings.

206
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,230
What's got you all flustered?

207
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:50,450
Well... I mean...

208
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:57,680
So... how far have you gone, Kurosawa-san?

209
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,330
Things happened, okay?

210
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:08,150
"Things"? What things? Were you rejected?

211
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,120
- I'm going to borrow your restroom.
- Sure.

212
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,140
Okay, talk. What really happened?

213
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,090
Nothing.

214
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,680
We're just...

215
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,160
a boss and subordinate, that's all.

216
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,540
You're still worried about that?

217
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:47,290
Not anymore. It's more her than me, it seems.

218
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,340
She must've realized a relationship with her boss wouldn't work after all.

219
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:59,060
That must be why I was rejected.

220
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,830
Oshima-san texted me.

221
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,370
I envy your relationship. You look over the moon.

222
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,620
That I am.

223
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,050
Huh?

224
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,260
What does that mean?

225
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:36,810
"Tomonari is acting depressed because he was rejected."

226
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,050
"Is Morita-san okay?"

227
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,650
Huh?

228
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,560
You're with Kurosawa-san?

229
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,480
And you rejected him?

230
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,250
No way, what?

231
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,490
What do I do?

232
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,510
Why?

233
00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:00,610
It's been five years since your last girlfriend. Cherish her, all right?

234
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,920
I know.

235
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,210
Don't give up on her so easily.

236
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:10,240
Ask her how she actually feels about this.

237
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,600
Yeah.

238
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:20,070
Your noncommittal responses won't solve anything, you know?

239
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,200
If you're so hung up over this...

240
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,810
Hello?

241
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:09,190
Can we meet up somewhere to talk?

242
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,830
Of course.

243
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:17,890
I had wanted to see you as well.

244
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,710
In fact, I was on my way to your place.

245
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:26,890
I'll meet you there.

246
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,720
You might be right about the boyfriend, though.

247
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,240
Even I think Ichikawa-san is suave, and I'm a girl.

248
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,050
Yeah, she is.

249
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,580
Wait, huh? How did you know?

250
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,440
What?!

251
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:53,050
Come on, you're so obvious. Your affection is overflowing.

252
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,050
Good luck. I'm rooting for you.

253
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,100
Okay.

254
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,600
Thanks.

255
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,500
Cheers?

256
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,000
Cheers.

257
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,310
Thanks for dinner.

258
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,500
Oh, thanks.

259
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,400
How are things with Sakamoto?

260
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,120
Why ask about Sakamoto-kun?

261
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,960
I just wanted to make sure he wasn't troubling you.

262
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,800
Far from it.

263
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,910
He's a good kid, really.

264
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:30,280
Right? That's what I'm saying.

265
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,380
Sorry...

266
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,080
You could have waited inside.

267
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,650
You're not too cold, are you?

268
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,110
I just wanted to see you. The sooner the better.

269
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,270
Morita-san, whatever your conclusion is,

270
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:14,150
I'm prepared to accept any answer you give me.

271
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:21,830
So please, tell me exactly how you feel about all this.

272
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,990
I can't.

273
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:32,470
Why?

274
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,730
It's okay.

275
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:43,300
I'm ready to hear anything you have to say.

276
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,990
I just want you to be honest with me.

277
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,330
To tell you the truth...

278
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,720
Yeah?

279
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,030
They weren't matching.

280
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,150
My tops and bottoms were mismatched.

281
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,100
Tops and bottoms, of what?

282
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,770
My lingerie.

283
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,280
What?

284
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,640
I was just so embarrassed...

285
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:53,130
Kurosawa-san?

286
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:55,870
So that's all this was about...

287
00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:00,300
What a relief...

288
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,360
I'm really sorry for the misunderstanding.

289
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:07,420
You know I wouldn't care about that.

290
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:10,840
Sir, this is a much bigger deal than you're making it out to be!

291
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,500
Sorry, sorry.

292
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,880

[Next Episode]

316
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:16,200
Because I love you.

317
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,340
- Is everything all right?
- Fine.

318
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:22,140
- Sakamoto-kun, I'm eight years your senior.
- Does that really matter?

319
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,220
Ayaka? Is that you?
