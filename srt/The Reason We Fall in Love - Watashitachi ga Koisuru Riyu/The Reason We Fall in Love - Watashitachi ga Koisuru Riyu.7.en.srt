1
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,130
Morning.

2
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,460
Good morning.

3
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,830
You're covering up.

4
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,460
That's because I just woke up...

5
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:12,960
Yeah?

6
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,600
And... it is a little strange to be in bed with Kurosawa-san.

7
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,660
- Let me see your face.
- No!

8
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,940
- Why not?
- Nope.

9
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,030
- Come on.
- No!

10
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,530
Let me see.

11
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,280
No, not yet!

12
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,670
- Don't be shy.
- No!

13
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,980
Hungry?

14
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,190
A bit.

15
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,300
Then I'll whip up breakfast.

16
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,780
What?

17
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,000
Really?

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,890
Yeah, nothing grand though.

19
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,840
Do you normally eat breakfast?

20
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,700
Usually just some toast, that's all.

21
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,070
I see.

22
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:13,940
What should I make for us...

23
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,840
I'll head on out first,

24
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,610
to go home to change my clothes.

25
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,090
Do you have to?

26
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:02,150
I can't go into the office wearing the same thing as yesterday.

27
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,950
Then just swap your shirt. The jacket can stay.

28
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,780
I suppose, but...

29
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,010
Maybe you can fit into one of mine.

30
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,610
Huh?

31
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,040
- One of yours?
- Yeah.

32
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,400
I have smaller shirts I don't ever wear.

33
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,260
It's fine! If I leave now, I would still make it...

34
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,440
How about this?

35
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,670
Yeah, looks good.

36
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,420
You'll fit.

37
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,100
- You think so?
- Definitely. Here.

38
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,600
Then I'll take you up on your offer.

39
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,250
Now you can head to the office, without making an extra trip.

40
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,030
Thank you.

41
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,330
And before I forget.

42
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,640
Here.

43
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,160
Huh?

44
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:05,010
It's a key. For you.

45
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,500
Since you might wrap up earlier than I do on some days.

46
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:22,270
You're allowed to drop by whenever you want.

47
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,450
Thank you.

48
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:34,440
I'm thinking we should clock in at separate times, too. What do you think?

49
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,340
I agree.

50
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,780
I mean, if we arrived together...

51
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,400
Yeah.

52
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,430
Good morning.

53
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,200
- Good morning.
- Morning.

54
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,000
- Good morning.
- Morning.

55
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,430
Good morning—

56
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,600
You scared me.

57
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,160
- Sorry!
- Are you okay?

58
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,880
Why are you even so strung up?

59
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,190
If the revisions could be done by next week's end, that would be ideal.

60
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:40,470
That would be everything from our end.

61
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:46,010
You now have Friday free. Spend it with your girlfriend.

62
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,210
Great, I'll get to work on this, then.

63
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,400
What's up?

64
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,950
Huh? Oh, nothing.

65
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,590
- Thanks.
- Anytime.

66
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,960
- Thank you for your time.
- No, thank you.

67
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:13,800
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Morning.

68
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:43,660
Every person has boundaries they ought to abide by. Myself included.

69
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:48,870
Some relationships may seem ideal in the short term, but fizzle out in the long run.

70
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:52,110
It's a boundary I should never cross.

71
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:58,210
Yet sometimes, logic and emotion are at odds with each other.

72
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:02,230
Ichikawa-san, here are the documents from Sales.
[The Reason We Fall in Love]

73
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,930
Thanks.
[The Reason We Fall in Love]

74
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,250
Sakamoto.

75
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,770
Oshima-san, please don't scare me—

76
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,990
Why do you look so depressed?

77
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,730
- I'm not depressed.
- Don't be shy.

78
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:30,600
We've both got our share of troubles. I mean, look.

79
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,400
At what?

80
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,050
This salad here, what else?

81
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:37,510
I'm on a diet to lose the 4 kilos I gained.

82
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,740
Oh really...

83
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,360
In any case, eat heartily and cheer up, yeah?

84
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,120
Eating well is the least of my troubles.

85
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,020
I envy your relationship.

86
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,420
Huh? What? Who?

87
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,360
You're not fooling anyone, sir.

88
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,600
I know you're in a relationship with Ozu-san.

89
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,330
- You do?
- Of course.

90
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:10,500
How? Did Ozu-san tell you?

91
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,930
- What are they talking about?
- I wonder.

92
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,580
You're so lucky though.

93
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,050
Lucky?

94
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:24,240
I mean, you're open about your relationship, even at the office.

95
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,920
I guess so. I'd never given it much thought.

96
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,580
But things are going well on your end, too. Right?

97
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,540
They are, yes.

98
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,230
One question though.

99
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,780
What's up?

100
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:44,250
Are you wearing that straight from Kurosawa-san's place?

101
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,730
Yeah.

102
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,150
Oh my gosh!

103
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:52,980
- I'm so happy for you!
- Shh, quiet, Kei-chan!

104
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,040
Things are going well indeed.

105
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:05,820
You know, I feel like my relationship with Kurosawa-san will last.

106
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,060
Why?

107
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,960
Something about this relationship feels different.

108
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,460
He makes me want to stay with him.

109
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,260
Ichikawa-san.

110
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,580
Sakamoto-kun?

111
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,970
Um...

112
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:47,600
Have you been... avoiding me?

113
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,900
What? No, of course not.

114
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,780
- But—
- Sorry, I've just been busy and all.

115
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,200
Did you need something?

116
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,490
If it's about work, I can talk, but I need to prepare for—

117
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,600
I've been lonely.

118
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:15,440
I miss your company, when you avoid me like this.

119
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,240
- Look, I haven't been—
- I love you.

120
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,160
Sorry?

121
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:32,830
Ichikawa-san, I love you.

122
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,020
Thank you, come again.
[Mid Dining]

123
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:52,340
I apologize for the sudden confession earlier.

124
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,180
Don't worry about it.

125
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,410
But I meant every word.

126
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,360
Although it was a spur-of-the-moment declaration,

127
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,730
know that I am entirely serious.

128
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,530
All right.

129
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:13,970
Could I just make one thing certain?

130
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,070
Of course.

131
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:21,980
Did you mean it in a platonic way of expressing your admiration?

132
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:26,670
No. I meant it in a completely romantic way.

133
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,950
I... see.

134
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,450
Except...

135
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:44,360
I saw you crying while talking with a girl the other day.

136
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,750
I didn't mean to intrude, really.

137
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,230
But I assumed...

138
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,230
That was my younger sister.

139
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:01,670
- What?
- My sister was visiting me in Tokyo.

140
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,030
We were talking about her upcoming wedding

141
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:07,730
and I had gotten a bit emotional about it.

142
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,750
I see, so that's what had happened...

143
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,830
No way, I'm unbelievable.

144
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,310
Give me one second.

145
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,300
This is so awkward.

146
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,060
Ichikawa-san?

147
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,870
Sorry for the weird misunderstanding.

148
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,520
It's fine.

149
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:36,610
Still, I couldn't help but think you two were right for each other.

150
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:42,470
I mean, from my perspective, two youngsters were hitting it off.

151
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:49,360
Meanwhile, I'm eight years your senior.

152
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,550
- That's—
- Does that really matter?

153
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,840
Personally,

154
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,610
I don't think our age makes much of a difference at all.

155
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,390
Hey, Sakamoto-kun.

156
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,220
Yes?

157
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,400
I'm honored you feel that way about me, really.

158
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:43,970
If anything, I don't deserve it.

159
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,640
You're a wonderful person, Sakamoto-kun.

160
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,990
Even so...

161
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,960
I'm sorry.

162
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,890
I...

163
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:03,220
Ayaka? Is that you?

164
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:07,860
It is. Ayaka, what a coincidence.

165
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,130
What's up?

166
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,940
Nothing much.

167
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,460
Your boyfriend?

168
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,510
No. He's a junior from work.

169
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,270
It looked like a date to me.

170
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,350
We're just wrapping up.

171
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,830
Now, goodbye.

172
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,160
Let's grab a drink then.

173
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,810
I said I'm going home.

174
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:28,120
Don't be a poor sport.

175
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,860
Just a glass, yeah?

176
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,680
There's a nice bar nearby.

177
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,140
Come on, I promise it'll be good.

178
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,140
Let go.

179
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,700
Aw, why so stiff?

180
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,930
Look.

181
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,340
Don't even bother reaching out to me anymore.

182
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,740
Hey, no need for the cold shoulder.

183
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,010
Come on, let's go.

184
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,810
Excuse me.

185
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:04,120
We've actually booked another bar to visit.

186
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,620
Huh?

187
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,280
We'll be leaving now.

188
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,150
Hey.

189
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:21,060
What should I choose...

190
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,540
Look, it's your Akira-kun-lookalike mug!

191
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,310
We can match.

192
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,550
I didn't realize there were color variations.

193
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:34,200
The one I have is a gift from Oshima.

194
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:39,290
I never knew he had such an eye for cute aesthetics.

195
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:43,150
I think I'll get this color.

196
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:46,460
I see they sell chopsticks, too.

197
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,000
Kurosawa-san!

198
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,040
Kurosawa-san?

199
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,030
Yeah?

200
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,950
What's wrong? Is everything all right?

201
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,510
Nothing wrong, it's okay.

202
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,160
Did you find a nice pair of chopsticks?

203
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,200
I did. What do you think?

204
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,850
Good choice.

205
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:19,000
There are so many other options though...

206
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,220
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

207
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:36,160
You shouldn't gun down those drinks...

208
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:41,230
I might not ever recover from this.

209
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:45,650
I can't believe you of all people had to witness that.

210
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,800
Just end me now.

211
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,440
And you know what?

212
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,030
The real insult to injury...

213
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,790
The guy was wearing a ring.

214
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,260
Right here.

215
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,920
No, then he's...

216
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,980
Yeah.

217
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:24,420
I bet he was keeping it under wraps this whole time.

218
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:28,350
I bet he made sure to take it off whenever we met.

219
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:31,080
But tonight, we bumped into each other.

220
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,130
He didn't have time to hide anything.

221
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:40,070
Hilarious, really.

222
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,040
I had a feeling he had someone else.

223
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,000
I could tell I was his "second choice" or whatever.

224
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,440
I knew.

225
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,210
I just didn't care.

226
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,770
Except...

227
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,130
I promised myself that I wouldn't get involved in an affair.

228
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,300
I never wanted to and yet...

229
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,990
This is seriously the worst.

230
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,190
How horrible.

231
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,320
Huh?

232
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,030
Why is Sakamoto-kun crying?

233
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,670
Because this is all too horrible.

234
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,860
You shouldn't settle on being someone's second choice.

235
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:40,530
Ichikawa-san, you deserve to be cherished.

236
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,100
What he's put you through is unforgivable.

237
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:56,490
You're a wonderful, beautiful person. You deserve none of this.

238
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:08,620
Sakamoto-kun.

239
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:14,060
You might be the most kindhearted person I've ever met.

240
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:17,630
Ichikawa-san, let us drink.

241
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,430
- A refill, please.
- Coming up.

242
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,050
Let's drink ourselves away.

243
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:33,780
Are you all right?

244
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,490
- Sakamoto-kun.
- Yes?

245
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,230
Ma'am...

246
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,890
We've made it.

247
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,260
Ichikawa-san?

248
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,270
Ichikawa-san.

249
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,940
Ichikawa-san?

250
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,020
Are you all right?

251
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,960
Ichikawa-san, I'm coming in.

252
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,710
How are you faring?

253
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:02,350
Here's some water.

254
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,040
Please, have a seat.

255
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,840
It hurts.

256
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,260
It all hurts.

257
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,720
Sorry?

258
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,110
It hurts.

259
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:36,030
Where does it hurt? Did you sprain something when you tripped?

260
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,800
Everything hurts.

261
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,220
What?

262
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:42,800
Everything. Everything hurts.

263
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:48,430
At some point, I became the second choice and I didn't realize it.

264
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:51,810
You've seen me at a new low.

265
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,240
I can't even face you with any dignity left.

266
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:03,550
I'm in my thirties.

267
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,580
My period flow stays heavy.

268
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,890
My skin dries out.

269
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:11,180
My shoulders ache, my back hurts.

270
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,210
I've gotten insomnia.

271
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,920
I get cold easily.

272
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,070
Fortune says I'm unlucky this year. Next year, too.

273
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,810
And to top it all off...

274
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:28,990
I've fallen in love with a younger guy at my age and it all hurts.

275
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:37,600
I can't believe you had to see all that.

276
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,080
Ma'am.

277
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,360
This is the worst, the absolute worst.

278
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,340
- The worst!
- Ma'am.

279
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,960
♫ I held your hand and laughed ♫

280
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,500
♫ Realized that day ♫

281
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,990
♫ Also your ambiguous pretense, because... ♫

282
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,440
Am I...

283
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,250
the younger guy in question?

284
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:03,140
♫ I try to smile, but the smile fades into the mirror ♫

285
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,430
You are.

286
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:11,220
♫ Maybe I know ♫

287
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,640
♫ But you know what? ♫

288
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:20,150
♫ The cityscape blurs and melts away at dusk ♫

289
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:24,070
Then our feelings are mutual.

290
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:27,380
♫ I'll always be next to you, any time ♫

291
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,130
♫ Your teary eyes and your voice ♫

292
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:34,590
♫ We can go beyond any night, because...  ♫

293
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,030
Why are you crying?

294
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:42,100
♫ Your eyes narrow as you smile ♫

295
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,990
Ichikawa-san?

296
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,550
♫ I held your hand and laughed ♫

297
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:51,120
♫ Realized that day ♫

298
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,450
♫ Also your ambiguous pretense, because... ♫

299
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,920
[Regarding the transfer to our Osaka Branch]

300
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:09,900
♫ It's you more than anything else to me, because... ♫

301
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:15,240
- Ichikawa-san.
- Just call me Ayaka.

302
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,450
Ayaka-san, you're cute.

303
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:19,670
What do I even mean to you?

304
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:22,220
We haven't even been dating for long.

305
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,340
You haven't given our future a single thought.

306
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:28,030
Does this mean we're breaking up?
