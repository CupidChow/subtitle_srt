1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,330
Thank you for the company tonight.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,100
I never once thought I would fall in love again.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,630
Take a good look because it's not happening again.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:16,070
So what a twist that I did, and at the office, no less.

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,540
I wavered between the truth and this mask I wore.

6
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,000
Because I can't just leave you.

7
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:30,080
I told myself a relationship would be more trouble than anything, and yet...

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,950
I love you.

9
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,470
We have a meeting with Rouge Pharmaceutical, Cat's Beverage,

10
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,750
and then one more afterward.

11
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,870
A busy morning, I'd say.

12
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:55,370
Agreed.

13
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,180
Let's grab ourselves a taxi.

14
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,630
Right.

15
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:04,600
Sir, I know we're busy making rounds and all.

16
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,060
But in my eyes, heading out with you is basically a reward.

17
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,540
What?

18
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,880
Just kidding.

19
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,060
Kurosawa-san! There's a taxi!

20
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,990
Over here.

21
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,760
Kurosawa-san, hurry!

22
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,910
We're back.

23
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,920
We're back.

24
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,170
- Hi, Kei-chan.
- Thank you for your hard work.

25
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,390
Kurosawa-san, shouldn't these documents be brought to the design team?

26
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:43,160
Yeah. Can you?

27
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,650
Yes, sir.

28
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,920
Ozu-san?

29
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,600
Ozu-san.

30
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,260
Oshima-san.

31
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,600
Can I sit here?

32
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,530
- Of course.
- Thanks.

33
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,110
Sorry I'm late, work was keeping me busy.

34
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,060
Something on your mind?

35
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,870
Why?

36
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,980
You looked a bit down.

37
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,950
Oh, it's nothing too serious.

38
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,460
My friend recently began dating someone.

39
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:20,050
I was just thinking about how nice that must be.

40
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,830
I see.

41
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:27,060
I'm really, truly happy for her.

42
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,600
Especially because it was mutual.

43
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,360
I mean, having your crush think of you the same way?

44
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,090
That's nothing short of a miracle.

45
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:41,010
I agree. That is something to celebrate.

46
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:47,400
So, I was hoping the same miracle would come my way, too.

47
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,190
Or something like that.

48
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,010
I see.

49
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,190
But are you sure?

50
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,960
There are plenty of other fish in the sea, Ozu-san.

51
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,690
You're so personable, after all.

52
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,690
"Others"?

53
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,820
What do you mean, there are "others" out there?

54
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,340
I mean...

55
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:18,850
You have a crush on Tomonari, don't you?

56
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,240
- And Tomonari—
- Hold on! What are you talking about?

57
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,300
Huh?

58
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,930
I don't have a crush on Kurosawa-san.

59
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,210
- You don't?
- No!

60
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,600
I have a crush on...

61
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,330
I have a crush on...

62
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,440
On you, Oshima-san!

63
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,530
Oshima-san, it's always been you.

64
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:59,920
Sir, why not give romance with me a chance?

65
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,450
Romance?

66
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:09,800
I've avoided romance for years now.

67
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,710
I'll think about it.

68
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,840
I'm scared I'll disappoint the person I've fallen for.

69
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,350
I'm scared I'll disappoint myself.

70
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,700
I'm terrified of disappointing everyone involved.

71
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:43,620
[The Reason We Fall in Love]

72
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,100
Congrats!

73
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:55,290
So? You're filled to the brim with happiness?

74
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,200
Lucky you.

75
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,960
Enough about me.

76
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,900
What about you?

77
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,370
What about me?

78
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:12,200
Are you still seeing that one guy?

79
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:17,070
Your older, two-timing lover...

80
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,900
Or no, "friend-with-benefits"?

81
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,900
Hey, that's an unflattering moniker.

82
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,230
That's what you called him.

83
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,390
I wouldn't exactly call him my "friend-with-benefits"...

84
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,360
But enough about him.

85
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,860
The other day, I let a younger guy come over to my place.

86
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,570
You're drenched!

87
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,060
Let's head to my place first.

88
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,630
O-Oh, right.

89
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,860
Not for nefarious reasons, of course.

90
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,980
It was pouring, so I let him stay.

91
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,150
Younger? How much younger?

92
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:54,200
I think he's in his mid-twenties or something.

93
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,440
And now you're interested in him.

94
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,160
Pardon?

95
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,650
In the younger guy. Right?

96
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:04,100
No, not at all.

97
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,900
Just making the observation that youngsters are cute, that's all.

98
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,500
He didn't even make a move while he was over.

99
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,540
Are all young dudes like that?

100
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,210
I'd hope they were.

101
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,630
Sure, but some guys don't hesitate.

102
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,450
Right?

103
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,830
Anyways...

104
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:29,500
I think he saw the cigarettes... a certain someone left behind.

105
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,210
And for some reason, I really didn't want him to.

106
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,130
Are you all right?

107
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,790
I'm fine—

108
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,320
I'll be borrowing your restroom.

109
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,400
If you'll excuse me!

110
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,920
- So you like him.
- Huh?

111
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,470
You're acting like this is an innocent crush. That's a first.

112
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:03,620
Trust me, there's nothing between us. He's younger than me.

113
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,300
I don't know this new guy or whatever.

114
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,300
But you're allowed to be happy, you know?

115
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:15,800
Either way, whatever happens is up to you.

116
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,680
What the...

117
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,220
For once, you're actually giving me solid advice.

118
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,420
Sorry if it sounded like I was lecturing you.

119
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,930
I'm just surprised. It's usually the other way around.

120
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,820
Want to order something?

121
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,000
Yeah, a bittergourd chanpuru*.
(Okinawa stir-fry)

122
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,220
Don't you hate bittergourd?

123
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,800
I want to give it a try.

124
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:56,560
Sir, what would you do if your crush was already in a relationship?

125
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,420
Your, "crush"?

126
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:06,790
Yes. And they're in a relationship.

127
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,730
Well...

128
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,490
I'd give up. That's all you can do, right?

129
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,050
Especially if they're in a relationship.

130
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:20,290
I suppose so...

131
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,870
A broken heart, eh?

132
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,450
Huh?

133
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:27,190
- That's not for you to decide.
- But you said—

134
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:31,130
I'm only speculating, she may not be dating anyone at all.

135
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:36,910
It just feels like she may be.

136
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:41,520
But even if she is, I don't want to give up.

137
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,330
That's why I've been pondering what to do next...

138
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,480
Sakamoto.

139
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,840
You're an admirable guy.

140
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,280
Huh?

141
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:59,950
How can you be so confident in yourself like that?

142
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,610
"Confident"?

143
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:06,140
Even if she has a lover, you're confident you have a chance.

144
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,620
It's real inspiring.

145
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:17,000
No, no. I'm not confident, not one bit.

146
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,250
It's just far more difficult to give up on her.

147
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:27,690
That's why I'm at a loss.

148
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,450
I see.

149
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,040
You make a point there.

150
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,550
- Let's hit the sauna again.
- Huh?

151
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,120
- One more round.
- Again?

152
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,460
Yup.

153
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,490
Let's go.

154
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,900
Sir, are you for real?

155
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,540
Are you on your way home?

156
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,390
I am. What about you?

157
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,050
I just arrived in my neighborhood.

158
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,660
Where are you right now?

159
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,690
I just crossed the railroad.

160
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:09,040
Ah, I know where that is.

161
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,360
But not anymore.

162
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,170
I just passed the prepared foods store.

163
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,720
What?

164
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,110
I don't recall seeing one around there.

165
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,530
Well, there is.

166
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,770
Interesting...

167
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:25,820
I should stop by next time I head over.

168
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:31,510
Hearing your voice makes me want to see you now.

169
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,010
Huh?

170
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:37,440
Sorry, that must've sounded overbearing.

171
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:42,020
Kurosawa-san, are you drunk?

172
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,410
Maybe.

173
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:48,940
Have you ever made gratin before?

174
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:55,340
Yeah, it's actually a specialty of mine.

175
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,800
Sir, could I get your approval on this?

176
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,260
Sure.

177
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,220
Are you free for dinner tonight?

178
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,580
Can you come over for dinner tonight?

179
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,330
Yes.

180
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,930
Good.

181
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,660
Excuse me, then.

182
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,780
You're way too obvious.

183
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:04,400
Your depression is plastered all over your face.

184
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,270
Of course, it is.

185
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:09,570
It's like the guy you are crushing on is making heart eyes at someone else.

186
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,360
It's a living hell for me.

187
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,960
Guess I can't blame you there.

188
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,950
But I can relate, since I broke up with my girlfriend.

189
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,990
Wait! For real?

190
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,330
When?

191
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:23,020
Last week.

192
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,680
She dumped me.

193
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,070
Are you serious?

194
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,950
You never told me.

195
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,160
That's because you were going through it.

196
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,730
Why did she dump you?

197
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,130
- Tell me.
- I don't know.

198
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,830
She was fed up with me or something.

199
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:42,560
I see...

200
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,630
Poor us.

201
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:48,140
- Let's find comfort in each other's misery.
- Dude, we're at work.

202
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,540
Just for today.

203
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,060
For today?

204
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,740
Hug me back.

205
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,190
No.

206
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,930
All right, then.

207
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,760
Oh, he's back.

208
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,710
Make sure the updated budget is ready for this meeting, okay?

209
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,250
Yes, sir.

210
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,570
Oshima-san, come on.

211
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,770
Right, sorry about that.

212
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:24,080
Can we talk tomorrow?

213
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:29,460
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

214
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,780
Good afternoon.

215
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,260
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

216
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,760
Good afternoon.

217
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,650
- Good afternoon.
- Afternoon.

218
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,270
Hey.

219
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,620
Good afternoon, ma'am.

220
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,470
Ichikawa-san.

221
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,020
Yeah?

222
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,640
Well...

223
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,050
Are you possibly free tonight?

224
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,520
Wow!

225
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,100
- You're good.
- I'm actually part of a baseball team.

226
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,230
- Really?
- And I'm fourth at bat.

227
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,390
Seriously?

228
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,890
Back during little league, that is.

229
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,460
Come on now...

230
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,460
Oh, there's the next ball.

231
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,490
Impressive!

232
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,600
This really gets my muscles moving.

233
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,710
You're up next, Ichikawa-san.

234
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,610
- Me?
- Yup.

235
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,690
Wait, I don't think I'll hit a single ball though.

236
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,660
Then I'll teach you how.

237
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,690
- No way, I'll miss every shot.
- You can do it.

238
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,020
- You think?
- Absolutely.

239
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,320
- Hold my hands here?
- Exactly.

240
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,120
- Then pull your arms in.
- My arms in...

241
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,450
Watch for the ball.

242
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:57,540
- Stretch this way.
- Stretch...

243
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:01,120
- And swing, like this.
- Like this?

244
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,680
Make sure you concentrate on hitting a home run.

245
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,800
- Concentrate...
- By looking up.

246
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,380
- And I'll get a home run?
- Yup.

247
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,230
Good luck.

248
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,750
Close. You were close!

249
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,860
- No, I wasn't.
- You'll get it.

250
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,430
- I got it!
- There you go! That was amazing!

251
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:25,550
I'm absolutely beat.

252
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,410
I'll be so sore tomorrow.

253
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,180
Really?

254
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,750
I mean, I haven't been to a home run range in ages.

255
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,260
Do you come often?

256
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,370
Only every once in a while.

257
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,510
I see.

258
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:42,500
You don't come with your girlfriend?

259
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,210
I don't have a girlfriend.

260
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,230
I see.

261
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:54,160
But I do have someone I like.

262
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,480
Is that so?

263
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,680
- Ichikawa-san, do you...
- A home run!

264
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,060
I mean...

265
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:18,640
Would you be willing to hang out with me again?

266
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:22,690
Sure thing.

267
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,600
Yes!

268
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,730
Where should we go next? Maybe bowling?

269
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:31,140
Or maybe we can play catch?

270
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,460
Sounds good.

271
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,310
Awesome!

272
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,910
I'll look forward to it.

273
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:03,990
I'm sorry I had you book out your evening for me.

274
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,840
It's no worries at all.

275
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:19,560
- I'm sorry for my outburst the other day—
- I'm sorry.

276
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:24,940
I... can't reciprocate your feelings.

277
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,970
I...

278
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,540
I understand.

279
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:41,890
May I at least ask why?

280
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,710
I was honored you confessed to me.

281
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:47,630
Thank you, really.

282
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:56,290
But I can't even imagine what you find appealing about me.

283
00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:03,790
There's plenty about me you don't know and I'm really not all that great.

284
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:08,140
I'm not a man worthy enough for you.

285
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:16,030
That's why... I'm sorry.

286
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:22,610
That's... your reason?

287
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:28,330
It's not that you dislike me or have someone else in your life,

288
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:36,180
it's because you simply believe you're not "worthy enough" for me?

289
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,800
No way!

290
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,630
I can't back down for a reason like that.

291
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:50,870
I confessed because I want to know more about you.

292
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:54,610
I want to go out with you, because I want to see you for everything you are.

293
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:01,380
I'll be the one to decide who's "worthy" enough for me.

294
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:07,260
Oshima-san, do you dislike me?

295
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,020
No, the complete opposite, really.

296
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,240
So you don't dislike me.

297
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,620
Far from it.

298
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,480
In that case...

299
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,290
Why don't we try going out with each other?

300
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,620
It can be a trial run, for now.

301
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,630
A trial run?

302
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,770
Is that still a no?

303
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,860
It's not.

304
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,890
Really?

305
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,300
Only if you'll have me.

306
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,290
Thank you.

307
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,000
Yes!

308
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,840
Um...

309
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:58,300
I'll... be in your care then.

310
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:02,420
Likewise. The honor's all mine.

311
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:20,840
That gratin was delicious.

312
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,000
How is that something you can just whip up?

313
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,220
It's easier than you might think.

314
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,990
It comes together in a second.

315
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:32,680
That's what all good cooks say.

316
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,960
They always say it's "easy".

317
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,780
I wish it was.

318
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,580
How about I teach you a recipe, then?

319
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,830
Really? You wouldn't mind?

320
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:43,700
Sure. Any requests?

321
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,810
Let's see...

322
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,480
How about rolled omelets?

323
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,790
Good choice.

324
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,650
Let's make it.

325
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,140
Great!

326
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,800

Sorry, sir.

349
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,210
I'm so sorry.

350
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:52,270
I'm really, really sorry.

351
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:56,930
I'll be heading home.

352
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:59,080
Wait. Is everything all right?

353
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,160
F-Fine! I'm sorry.

354
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,270
I'll text you later.

355
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,550
Am I being rejected?
[Next Episode]

356
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:27,040
I'm sorry. It's a personal issue.

357
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,330
Is something wrong?

358
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:31,680
You might be right about her having a boyfriend though.

359
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:35,250
Sakamoto-kun, you should spend the evening with your girlfriend.
