1
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,220
What should we eat?

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,840
Let's eat something delicious.

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,060
- Then we will.
- Really?

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,460
Good morning.

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,640
Oh, good morning.

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,730
Kurosawa-san, we have an announcement to make.

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,220
- We're going out with each other now.
- What?

8
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,140
I mean, younger is better, both in terms of stamina and my own future.

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,360
Besides, you're in your thirties, sir.

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,900
But you both work in the same department...

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,890
We promise not to let our relationship affect the workplace.

12
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:43,850
Is this your way of giving us a warning, as our boss?

13
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,540
Or better yet, are you jealous?

14
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,940
- He might be jealous.
- You're being ridiculous.

15
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,210
Anyway, thank you for sending us on a trip as a couple.

16
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,270
- I didn't arrange the business trip for that sort of reason...
- See you around, sir!

17
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,950
I meant... Hey, wait...

18
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,130
Wait!

19
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,220
What am I even dreaming about...

20
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:26,200
[The Reason We Fall in Love]

21
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,040
This is my first business trip, but it seems like easy work.

22
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,360
Where does that confidence of yours come from?

23
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,410
Good morning.

24
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,770
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

25
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,450
You're both early today.

26
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,570
We're squeezing in our prep work before we go.

27
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,430
We'll be heading out on a bullet train leaving at 11:00 a.m.

28
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,010
All right. I'll make sure to have my phone on hand all day.

29
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,460
If anything happens, call.

30
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,380
Thank you, sir.

31
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,400
But I promise we'll manage.

32
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,120
We wish to see this through ourselves.

33
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,220
Is that so?

34
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,040
All right.

35
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,560
Thank you.

36
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,430
- I'll place this here then.
- Please do.

37
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,370
And this goes...

38
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,950
Hey, I told you this file goes here.

39
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,800
Right, sorry.

40
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,770
- There.
- Come on now...

41
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,060
- I'll hold these bags then?
- Sure.

42
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,570
Aoi-san.

43
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,110
- Should we bring some extras of these?
- Sounds good.

44
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,810
Let's bring several, just in case.

45
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,010
Why am I so terrified of being honest with myself?

46
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,160
Is it because it would rock our workplace dynamic?

47
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,030
Is it a matter of upholding my pride?

48
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:10,000
Or is it the fact our relationship would fundamentally change?

49
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,770
Please get our clients to approve these documents.

50
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,890
Yes, ma'am.

51
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,000
And one more thing.

52
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,390
Here, for you.

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,030
As thanks for the other day.

54
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,840
When I was on my period?

55
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,710
Please don't push yourself.

56
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,700
No need to feel self conscious.

57
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,330
I'm the only one around.

58
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,900
Thanks, really.

59
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:52,280
- Can I really have these?
- Of course. You saved me back there.

60
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,010
Thank you.

61
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,480
I'll be sure to savor them.

62
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,320
Don't, they're nothing special.

63
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,680
No, I will. Thank you so much.

64
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,980
What are those? They look delicious.

65
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,430
Give me one.

66
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,730
No.

67
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,480
And what about your "no snacking" rule, Oshima-san?

68
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,560
I know, but those look tasty.

69
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,550
A no is a no.

70
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,900
- Make do with this.
- No, I want this one.

71
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,750
- These cookies are off-limits.
- Why?

72
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,730
- Just because.
- You have a whole can.

73
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:40,930
- Still no.
- But...

74
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,250
- No.
- Just one morsel?

75
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,900
Here, a morsel.

76
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,580
You look tired.

77
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,430
More like I'm nervous.

78
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,820
This business trip has been eating away at me.

79
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,250
The one with your junior?

80
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,900
I have to be perfect and that has my stomach in knots.

81
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,360
Poor girl...

82
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,600
- I'll do my best.
- Good luck.

83
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,480
Wait, did you have plans tonight?

84
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,800
- Can you tell?
- Yeah.

85
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,890
I mentioned it previously.

86
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,300
I'm going shopping with Oshima-san for exercise equipment.

87
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:27,250
He'll pick out my gym outfit, then we'll grab a bite together, and then...

88
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm so nervous!

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,420
Sounds exciting.

90
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,380
So? How's it going on your end, Aoi-chan?

91
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,630
Huh?

92
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:41,610
The thing with Kurosawa-san. Weren't you two making progress?

93
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,590
I lent an ear to her troubles.

94
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,390
That's the bare minimum any boss would do.

95
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,330
Nothing is happening between us.

96
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,490
Not really.

97
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:02,480
He was only acting as any nice boss would.

98
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:07,480
Seems like he never considered me a romantic prospect at all.

99
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,430
What? How?

100
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,560
You two held hands...

101
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,600
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

102
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:20,430
We only held hands, because we got caught up in the moment.

103
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:24,200
We were drunk, so it was... like an accident.

104
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,640
Either way, I was the only one jumping to conclusions.

105
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,610
You think?

106
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,890
You should ask—

107
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:36,720
No, it's okay. I've given up already anyway.

108
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,620
What I should focus on now

109
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,860
is proving to be of use to Kurosawa-san here, at the office.

110
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,800
Shouldn't you both be heading out soon?

111
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,020
Yes. I'm just waiting for Aoi-san to return from the restroom.

112
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,650
I see.

113
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,120
I'm counting on you, Itami.

114
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,150
For what?

115
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,540
Huh?

116
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,790
Are you counting on me to secure this contract?

117
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,430
Or with Aoi-san?

118
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,290
What are you talking about?

119
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:27,730
No need to worry, I'll take great care of Aoi-san.

120
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,830
Do your part and support your mentor through this.

121
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,510
Thanks for waiting. Ready to go?

122
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,540
Yes, Aoi-san.

123
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,580
See you later, sir.

124
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,460
Good luck. And take care.

125
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,060
Yes, sir.

126
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,580
- We'll be off.
- Good luck.

127
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,790
- See you all after the trip.
- See you.

128
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,550
- I'll catch up.
- Sure. See you around.

129
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,280
See you.

130
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,730
Here, I'll help.

131
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:24,150
It's fine, I can handle this.

132
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,120
Yes, ma'am?

133
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,690
Your tie.

134
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,300
A little more like...

135
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,120
That?

136
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,900
It's crooked.

137
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,040
Sorry.

138
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,490
There, perfect.

139
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:11,050
Thank you.

140
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,300
What?

141
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,700
No, nothing. Thank you.

142
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,650
You're repeating yourself.

143
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,370
Thank you.

144
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,290
There you go again.

145
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,200
Did we do something, sir?

146
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,100
No, nothing at all.

147
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,790
Were you staring at us?

148
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,130
What? No.

149
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,920
Please focus on your own work, sir.

150
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,670
Or else you'll be suspended like Manager Kinoshita.

151
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,330
I was not staring.

152
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,880
- He totally is.
- Terrifying.

153
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,360
- Look, he's staring.
- I am not.

154
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,670
I swear, I am not.

155
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,920
R-Right...

156
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,550
Slacking off?

157
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,490
What's with the face?

158
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,990
Nothing.

159
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:35,050
You know, earlier I ended up having to fix my junior's tie.

160
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:40,490
It made me feel like such a mom.

161
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,260
Hey.

162
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,650
What?

163
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,100
Thinking of a certain someone?

164
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,030
Morita-san, was it?

165
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:05,950
Don't tell me you're still hung up over your ex from five years ago.

166
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:08,210
Of course not.

167
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:20,480
Kurosawa, you have a bad habit of deciding things won't work out.

168
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,460
And you sort of shut your partner out when it gets to that.

169
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,110
Sure, it might look like you're being considerate of the other.

170
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:34,090
But you're really just scared of stepping into someone's life. Right?

171
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,490
What are you trying to protect?

172
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,230
You're only reliving your mistakes.

173
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:43,660
- Hey.
- If you want a repeat of five years ago, be my guest.

174
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:47,170
But other people have eyes on a cutie like her.

175
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,280
I know that already.

176
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:58,410
There you are. Ichikawa, my junior wants to discuss design work.

177
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,260
- Got a minute?
- Sure.

178
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:03,290
Hey, Tomonari. How's it going?

179
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,720
Why's it so dour in here? A problem?

180
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,720
No reason.

181
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,040
Hey, let's ditch the moping grandpa and grab drinks tonight.

182
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,250
Sorry, but I've got plans.

183
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,950
Yeah, at the gym, I bet.

184
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,560
Well, actually...

185
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,310
I'm so excited to start exercising in this.

186
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,200
And I'm excited for you.

187
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,850
If you need any tips, ask away.

188
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:44,040
I will, thank you.

189
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,600
Of course.

190
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,140
Your "Extra-Terrestrial Mont Blanc".

191
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,740
Wow, this is ginormous.

192
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,940
Here, let's share.

193
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,710
You can have it, Ozu-san.

194
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,780
Are you sure?

195
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,730
Positive. I'm dieting anyway.

196
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:06,980
- Right.
- Yeah.

197
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,110
- I suppose you are.
- So eat up.

198
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,120
Thank you.

199
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:31,060
Oshima-san, I'm only making a guess, but... do you have a sweet tooth?

200
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,540
A huge guy like me, having a sweet tooth.

201
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,230
Must seem ridiculous, huh?

202
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,210
Not at all.

203
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,710
What?

204
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:52,370
It's ridiculous to hold back on the things you like, because of what others may think.

205
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:58,980
Life is much more fun if you focus on cherishing yourself.

206
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:05,390
Besides, having a sweet tooth totally suits you.

207
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,560
Really?

208
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,060
Yes.

209
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,510
Let's dig in.

210
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,960
- Yeah.
- It looks delicious.

211
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,940
Yum!

212
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,990
Ozu-san, I admire your spirit.

213
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,160
I'll shave down with a broccoli and chicken breast lunch tomorrow.

214
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,940
As will I.

215
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,730
Yum.

216
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:40,710
- Good, isn't it?
- So good.

217
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,400
This is delicious.

218
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,640
Yum.

219
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,020
What's up?

220
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,750
What's up with you?

221
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,090
I told you, no smoking in bed.

222
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:45,230
- Aw...
- You'll get ashes everywhere.

223
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,510
Why the cold shoulder?

224
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,420
Weren't you supposed to be at your girlfriend's place today?

225
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,570
I wanted to see you, Ayaka.

226
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:05,510
[Ryo Sakamoto: The cookies were delicious! Thank you again!]

227
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,950
Thank you for meeting with us today.

228
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:11,990
The pleasure was ours. We look forward to seeing what you do.

229
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,520
And we hope to live up to expectations.

230
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,710
Thank you again.

231
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:17,190
- Thank you.
- Of course.

232
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,010
Thank you.

233
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,390
It's finally over.

234
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,100
I'm beat.

235
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,210
How about we grab a celebratory drink...

236
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:39,410
Aoi-san?

237
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:42,620
Aoi-san? Are you all right?

238
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,020
Aoi-san?

239
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,870
What?

240
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,710
Hey, good work today.

241
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:05,020
What?

242
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,450
Itami.

243
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:19,000
Kurosawa-san! You actually came.

244
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,290
How is Morita-san?

245
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,000
She's currently hooked up to an IV.

246
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,360
The nurse said it would take around two hours. She should be out soon.

247
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,400
Thanks.

248
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,190
So you rushed here for her.

249
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,140
What?

250
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,750
Nothing.

251
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,670
There's still payment and admin stuff to settle, right?

252
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:50,410
I'm sure you're exhausted. Head back to the hotel and rest.

253
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,470
Itami?

254
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:04,800
You're serious about Aoi-san, then.

255
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,560
What are you talking about?

256
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,720
As her boss, I—

257
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,090
Is it really because you're her boss?

258
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:18,300
No "boss" would travel two hours to see if his subordinate was doing okay.

259
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,530
I'll head on back to the hotel.

260
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:33,850
Yeah. Great work today.

261
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,480
Thank you, sir.

262
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,270
Please take it easy for the night.

263
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,330
Thank you.

264
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,030
Morita-san...

265
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,170
Kurosawa-san?

266
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,700
What are you doing here?

267
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,430
Itami called and told me you collapsed.

268
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,440
How are you feeling?

269
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:50,620
Much better now.

270
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,470
Where did Itami-san...

271
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,910
I sent him back to the hotel.

272
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,040
Is this all you brought with you?

273
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,420
Yes.

274
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,430
All right.

275
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,310
I'll see you back to the hotel.

276
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:20,020
Why...

277
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,490
Why are you doing all this?

278
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,520
Because I was worried about you.

279
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:41,290
I also feel responsible for possibly pushing you to this extent.

280
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,990
In that case...

281
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:49,570
is this visit another responsibility of yours...

282
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,300
as my boss?

283
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,640
What?

284
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,840
I get mixed signals...

285
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,620
when you treat me like this.

286
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:09,390

I know in your eyes...

290
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,450
Good morning.

291
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:24,560
...you may only be extending a hand to your junior.

293

00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,490
For you.

295
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:41,900
I'll be there to watch your back.

296
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,240
But to me...

297
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,250
He could learn to be patient like you, Morita-san.

298
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,670
Take a good look, 'cause it's not happening again.

If you're only doing what's right as my superior...

304
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:24,920
then your kindness is all too cruel.

00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,480
Thank you.

307
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,290
That felt vindicating.

308
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:36,690

320
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,790
I want to have a long chat with you, Morita-san.

321
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:27,560
- So if you'd like to visit my—
- Yes.

322
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,750
Stay here until the rain lets up.

323
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,540
Would that be all right?

324
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:36,520
Morita-san, there are better people out there for you.
