Ready to get full on barbecue?

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,350
The reviews recommend the buffet, too.

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,080
Really? I can't wait to give it a try.

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,040

- Yeah.

- Sure.

[Regarding the transfer to our Osaka Branch]

11
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,710
I never thought I'd go on a double date with you, of all people.

12
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,150
A double date? I've never even spoken to Ozu-san before.

13
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:46,620
You're here as company. That's more than enough.

14
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,400
Now, let's grab some buffet.

15
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,310
Whatever.

16
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,990
This all looks delicious.

17
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,070
Kei-chan, are you grabbing dragonfruit?

18
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:57,590
Only if I'm allowed to start with dessert.

19
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,620
- Can I?
- Why not?

20
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,150
Yes!

21
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,420
- Doesn't that look amazing, Oshima-san?
- It does.

22
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,240
- Want a slice?
- Yes, please.

23
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,010
- It looks so good!
- Thank you.

24
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:31,790
How are things with Tomonari? I hope his poker face doesn't scare you.

25
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:36,260
I admit, he terrified me at first.

26
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,970
I don't blame you there.

27
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,750
But underneath it all, he's incredibly kind. He's a great boss, too.

28
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:45,190
Exactly. He's considerate of all his coworkers,

29
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,080
superiors and subordinates alike.

30
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,740
Really, he's a great guy.

31

He is.

32
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,260
I'm so glad there's someone out there who gets his charm.

33
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,340
- Actually, I share a similar sentiment.
- Huh?

34
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,510
I'm glad you're Kei-chan's boyfriend, Oshima-san.

35
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:02,500
No way! You mean it? Are you really okay with me?

36
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,790
Yes, definitely.

40
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,990
I heard dinner tonight was your idea.

41
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:35,280
Morita-san was over the moon when you brought it up.

42
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,920
Oh, it was nothing.

43
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,220
I'm not exactly the best at planning activities,

44
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,780
or finding fun restaurants either.

45
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,090
So really, thank you.

46
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:53,470
Truthfully, I was a bit nervous you'd be against the idea.

47
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,600
I'm not against it at all.

48
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,830
It's just something new.

49
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,190
Right.

50
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,570
Sorry if I look like I'm displeased.

51
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,990
Just know I am enjoying myself.

52
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,720
You two are like the perfect match for each other.

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,230
Huh?

00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,740

56
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:28,210
Nothing. Anyway, Aoi-chan says she wants to stay with you long term.

57
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:32,670
I swear her happiness is infectious.

58
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,840
I see.

59
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:47,000
Take good care of her, okay?

60
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,140
I will.

Thanks for waiting, you two.

Anyone up for dessert?

63
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,020
Yes! Let's go.

68
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,930
Good question.

00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,450
- For Christmas?
- Yeah.

76
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,460
Maybe we could take a short trip.

That sounds great! Where should we go...

79
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,060
- Maybe a hot spring.
- A hot spring?

80
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,330
- Yes.
- For Christmas?

81
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,430
Not what I expected.

82
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:51,130
I thought it'd be nice to get away from the bustling city for the holidays.

83
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,790
Yeah?

84

You're starting to convince me.

85
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,050
We should start brainstorming options for us.

86
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:02,780
If we wanted to stay local, we could travel to Kusatsu or Ikaho.

88
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,920
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

Yeah. He wasn't acting strange at the restaurant either.

00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,660
It was totally uncalled for. She's not even a relative, you know?

184
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,810
Right.

185
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:08,200
Though, it's not like I'd feel any better...

186
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:12,410
hearing that from my mother or relatives alike.

187
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:20,010
Anyway, I totally sympathize with your complaints.

188
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,250
Yes... It's all too horrible.

189
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:32,560
I mean, you're so admirable for working so hard.

190
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,250
Your efforts alone are amazing.

191
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:39,010
Why do people around you have to say stuff like that?

192
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,300
I'm frustrated I can't do more.

193
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,140
Why are you the one crying?

194
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:50,820
Because I don't want people to disrespect you like that.

195
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,750
You really are a kind soul.

196
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:05,340
The only other people who would cry for me are my family.

197
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,000
And even that's a maybe.

198
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,180
- Do you have any tissues?
- I do.

199
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,000
Thank you.

200
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,010
You're crying waterfalls.

201
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,260
Thank you.

202
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,460
Hey...

203
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,930
Over here.

204
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:14,940
- Good morning.
- Do you have a minute?

205
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,470
Yes, sir.

206
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,120
Oshima-san.

207
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,020
Good morning.

208
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:40,650
Ozu-san, good morning.

209
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,010
Right, I have a meeting soon.

210
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:47,050
I've got to hurry, or I'll be late...

211
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,010
Oshima-san.

212
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:55,930
After work, can we talk?

213
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,960
Kurosawa-san.

214
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,630
Why didn't you tell me?

215
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,990
Why didn't you tell me I'm being transferred?

216
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:48,680
Please tell me exactly why you've been avoiding me.

217
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,580
Well...

218
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,670
I'm sorry.

219
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,870
Did something happen?

220
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:01,400
- If it was somehow my fault—
- No, definitely not.

221
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,220
You see...

222
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,790
I've actually gained some weight.

223
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,370
What?

224
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:16,530
Recently, I've been so caught up in our outings together,

225
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:19,260
that I haven't been calorie-counting my desserts.

226
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:23,960
As a result, I ended up gaining 4 kilos.

227
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:31,460
So... is that why you've been avoiding me?

228
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:38,040
Ozu-san, you were attracted to my body and muscles. Right?

229
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:42,770
Except, now I've grown fat.

230
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:47,350
If I gained any more weight, I was afraid you would come to dislike me.

231
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,630
So I thought I would avoid you, at least until I was back in shape.

232
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,690
Have you seen Oshima-san?

233
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:01,490
Huh? He was just here a second ago...

234
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,110
Where do you think he went?

235
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,890
Good question...

236
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,800
Yum.

237
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,350
I've been working out like crazy,

238
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:19,170
but I'm nowhere near back in shape.

239
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,480
I'm so sorry.

240
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,710
Why?

241
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,590
This is all because I said I liked your physique...

242
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,010
It's not your fault.

243
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,280
No, it is.

244
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:40,320
I admit, at first I was drawn to you for your physique.

245
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:46,460
But now, I'm all about your adorable honesty.

246
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:50,030
Muscle or mass doesn't matter to me anymore.

247
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,020
Ozu-san...

248
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:57,220
I'm sorry, I can't believe my preferences made you so worried...

249
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,640
No, really, it's not your fault.

250
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,000
This is a personal issue.

251
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,390
To be honest, I lack any amount of self confidence.

252
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,600
May I ask why?

253
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:19,420
There was a period of time long ago, when I was quite chubby.

254
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:23,980
Although I've worked hard to achieve the body I have now,

255
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:29,560
I end up gaining weight anyway...

256
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,020
Oshima-san.

257
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,800
Listen up, okay?

258
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,280
I love you, no matter what you look like.

259
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,600
I love you, because of who you are.

260
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,380
I don't care if you get fat.

261
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,900
You should eat all the desserts you want.

262
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,720
And afterwards, we can just work out together.

263
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:02,410
So please don't avoid me anymore.

264
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:08,260
I care about you being here, more than how much you weigh.

265
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,560
Ozu-san...

266
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:15,150
Thank you.

267
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,040
Anytime.

268
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:27,050
♫ The cityscape blurs and melts away at dusk ♫

269
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:29,020
Hungry?

270
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:32,730
Yeah. I've been on a salad diet for too long.

271
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:36,370
- Then let's eat our fill of substantial food.
- Sounds good.

272
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,920
♫ That alone is enough to take a step forward ♫

273
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,400
♫ I held your hand and laughed ♫

274
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,080
♫ Just like that day ♫

275
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,470
♫ I don't care if it's ambiguous, because... ♫

276
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,340
Does this mean...

277
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:00,040
we're breaking up?

278
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,930
No. Not at all.

279
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:09,620
Then why did you recommend me for this transfer?

280
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:16,990
Why didn't you consult with me, before making the recommendation?

281
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,850
How long have you known about this anyway?

282
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,500
I...

283
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,210
Did you already know when we went out for churrasco?

284
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,860
Did you know, when you kissed me on the way back?

285
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:39,020
Did you kiss me, all while keeping this transfer a secret?

286
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,990
I'm sorry.

287
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,280
You're horrible.

288
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,330
I'm sorry.

289
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,400
But I couldn't tell you about the recommendation.

290
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:04,060
It was a matter of confidentiality.

291
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,890
"Confidentiality"?

292
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:15,130
So you're fine with my transfer? You won't feel lonely?

293
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:17,030
No, of course I will.

294
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:19,910
And still, you recommended me.

295
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,560
That's why we're even having this talk!

296
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,340
Morita-san.

297
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:38,440
We haven't even been dating for long.

298
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,970
I know.

299
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,300
I can't accept going long distance now.

300
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,200
But this is a great opportunity for your career and future.

301
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,060
We don't even know how long we'll be apart.

302
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,430
Sir, does that uncertainty not bother you?

303
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,960
You shouldn't reject such a promising offer...

304
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,980
just because you're in a relationship with me.

305
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:03,560
I can't be held responsible for holding you back like that.

306
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,230
Responsible?

307
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:17,640
Now we're speaking about responsibility?

308
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:21,220
I never asked you to be responsible for my future.

309
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:41,210
I understand that you're thinking of my career.

310
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,320
But have you given a single thought to our future?

311
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,250
- I have.
- Except you haven't.

312
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,160
Sir...

313
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:08,220
What do I even mean to you?

314
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,640
Kurosawa-san, now I see you have a kind heart.
[Next Episode]

315
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,820
Let go, you're stifling me!

316
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,920
I would appreciate any advice you have to give.

317
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,600
What's with that all of sudden?

318
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,050
I'd like to speak my mind as your partner now.
