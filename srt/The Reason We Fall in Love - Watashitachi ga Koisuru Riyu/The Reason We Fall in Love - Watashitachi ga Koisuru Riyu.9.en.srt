00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,710
[Regarding Ms. Aoi Morita's transfer to our Osaka branch...]

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:08,010
Morita-san.

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,290
You surprised me.

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,470
What spurred that on?

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,690
Did you know, when you kissed me on the way back?

6
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,080
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,080
Then why did you recommend me for this transfer?

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,550
Have you given a single thought to our future?

9
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:32,260
- I have.
- Except you haven't.

10
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:37,300
Sir, does this mean we're breaking up?

11
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,640
Morita-san, could you send me the summary from yesterday's meeting?

12
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,130
I made sure to do so earlier.

13
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,540
All right, thank you.

14
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:56,060
Kikumiya Co. will also be getting back to us today.

15
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,720
Schedule a meeting when possible, then.

16
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,600
Yes, sir.

17
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:20,680
I hear someone from our division is transferring to Osaka.

18
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,010
And I suspect that "someone" is you.

19
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,040
How did word get out about that?

20
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,890
You must be at odds with Aoi-san over the prospect of a long-distance relationship.

21
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,130
Did I just hit bull's eye, or what?

22
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,450
Wait, seriously?

23
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,740
- It's the other way around.
- Huh?

24
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,680
I'm not the one leaving.

25
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,210
Oh, I get it now.

26
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,290
But it's not you? That's great news.

27
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,870
What?

28
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,810
I mean, why wouldn't it be? I like you.

29
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,300
Sir, you tend to keep an eye out for others.

30
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,690
It's like you always know what to say and when.

31
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,920
That sort of care is exactly what I like about you, sir.

32
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:20,010
So why not extend that same care to your lover as well?

33
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,280
Now then, back to work I go.

34
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,000
Hey...

35
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,420
I wish it were that simple.

36
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:45,980
[The Reason We Fall in Love]

37
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,720
Guess we'll be spending another Christmas together, in dateless solidarity.

38
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,730
I personally thought I'd be alone this year,

39
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,240
since someone had a girlfriend.

40
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,690
Guess who's to blame for me breaking up with her?

41
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,990
What's that supposed to mean?

42
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,720
She apparently thought I prioritized spending time with you.

43
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,790
Wait, your girlfriend said that?

44
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,860
- Is that why you two broke up?
- Yeah.

45
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,120
You should've told me sooner.

46
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,360
Say, are we really that strange?

47
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,380
I never bat an eye at us hanging out like this.

48
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:35,320
But maybe I should wean myself off of you.

49
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,190
Hold on now.

50
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,690
I can't have you leaving me, too.

51
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,400
I'm going through heartbreak, with no boyfriend to comfort me.

52
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:51,190
At least let me keep the only friend I've got.

53
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,490
Dude, I'm joking.

54
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:59,420
And how can you look proud about something so depressing?

55
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:03,840
Look, I'm just saying you're the only friend I need.

56
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,700
If you say so.

57
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,320
Still, every dude you fall for must be blind.

58
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,140
You're a great guy, so how does no one see that?

59
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,160
Imamu, I crave those compliments.

60
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,000
- Give me more.
- Stop that.

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,500
- Fine, no more compliments.
- Why?

62
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,790
Drink first, talk after.

63
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,850
Sorry, did I keep you waiting?

64
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,900
Not at all. How was work?

65
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,610
"How was work"?

66
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,600
I mean, erm... Hi?

67
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,330
Hello to you, too.

68
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,050
Sorry, I'm just a bit nervous.

69
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:55,350
- Why?
- Because I don't normally see you like this.

70
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,660
- Is that a good thing?
- Yes.

71
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,800
- You look very cute today.
- Oh.

72
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,320
Thanks.

73
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,190
- Have you ordered yet?
- Not yet.

74
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,950
I was still looking at the menu.

75
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,320
Card?

76
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,700
I'll pay, Ayaka-san.

77
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,540
- It's fine.
- No, I insist.

78
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:24,250
As the guy, let me treat you.

79
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,960
Oh, that's just ridiculous.

80
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,250
I'm the older one, so let me.

81
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,380
- But—
- Thank you.

82
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,620
The movie theatre was absolutely crowded.

83
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,420
Holiday season will do that.

84
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,410
I suppose so.

85
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,450
Did you enjoy the movie?

86
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,850
Yeah, it was good.

87
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:48,500
Really? I'm glad to hear it.

88
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,960
All that movie-watching has made me hungry, though.

89
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,300
Look! There's a store specializing in craft beers around here.

90
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,860
So there is.

91
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,440
I could go for a beer right about now.

92
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,130
Good morning.

93
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,630
Morning.

94
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:28,200
I see you're early, sir.

95
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,750
Yeah.

96
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,590
I wanted us to talk again.

97
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,310
Are you free tonight?

98
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:56,540
Sorry, I have plans to celebrate my mother's birthday today.

99
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,990
I see.

100
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,840
Tell her I said happy birthday.

101
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,100
I will, thank you.

102
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,470
Then, how about tomorrow?

103
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,090
Sir, I have nothing to say to you.

104
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,190
- But—
- Good morning.

105
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,250
Good morning.

106
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,880
- Morning.
- Good morning.

107
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:36,510
He recommended you for a transfer without saying anything? That's horrible.

108
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,810
Even if it was confidential, he should have talked to you.

109
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:47,430
I know, but I also understand it's more complicated than that.

110
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,820
Anyway, I don't know how to feel about this.

111
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:57,520
He said he wants to talk, but what is there to talk about?

112
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,810
My transfer has already been decided anyway...

113
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,890
Fair point.

114
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,870
And you're totally valid for feeling confused.

115
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:10,210
I just can't get a read on him at all.

116
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:15,240
- But first, food.
- Food.

117
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,320
Kei-chan, haven't you ever been at odds like this with Oshima-san?

118
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,370
You couldn't have asked a more timely question.

119
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:28,600
Oshima-san only ever agrees to go wherever I want to go.

120
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,010
Even for our upcoming Christmas date.

121
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,360
Oh, I don't like that at all.

122
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,180
- It's like, he's trying to compensate by being "considerate".
- Exactly.

123
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:42,520
I just wish he'd contribute his own opinions, instead of being my yes-man.

124
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:47,550
Ozu-san is spectacular because she sticks true to her opinions.

125
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:50,730
She's never one to back down either.

126
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,370
It makes me really respect her.

127
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:57,740
Not to mention she's always so bright and up-lifting...

128
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,450
- And Ozu-san—
- Are you only here to sing praises about Ozu-san?

129
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,630
- Huh?
- I mean, I don't mind.

130
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:09,610
Really, I don't. I'm happy for you.

131
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,600
Thanks.

132
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:19,350
Sorry, enough about me. It's your turn.

133
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,830
Go on now.

134
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:21,970
No, thanks.

135
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,570
Why not?

136
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,440
I've got a more important question to ask.

137
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,220
Why is he here?

138
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,450
I hope I'm not intruding.

139
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,490
You have it good, Oshima-san. I'm jealous.

140
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:46,320
I can tell you're loved.

141
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,410
You're all Ozu-san ever talks about.

142
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,320
Wait, really?

143
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,080
What does she say about me?

144
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,040
Ask her yourself.

145
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,120
Kurosawa-san.

146
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,150
I'm losing faith in my own relationship.

147
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:05,420
Do you think Ayaka-san truly likes me?

148
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,310
What's with that all of a sudden?

149
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:12,020
You've been her friend for many years. I would appreciate any advice.

150
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,290
So am I, though?

151
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,920
Huh?

152
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,410
The three of us joined the company at the same time.

153
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,680
We've been friends for a decade. Right, Tomonari?

154
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,250
- Have we?
- What?

155
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,050
We've always been a trio. Haven't we?

156
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,360
Ayaka-san and I went on our first date the other day.

157
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,240
But it felt like she was always maintaining a certain distance.

158
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,720
Even when we walked together, it was like something divided us.

159
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,210
She brushed off my attempt at holding her hand as well.

160
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,610
Maybe she was just embarrassed?

161
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:51,020
I have my doubts.

162
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:56,010
Is that sort of distance normal for most older women?

163
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,930
I wouldn't know.

164
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,750
I suppose not...

165
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:06,730
But I don't think it's something you really need to worry about.

166
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:14,760
If you're so worried though, ask her about it. Ichikawa will listen.

167
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,280
You think so?

168
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:23,480
Yeah. It won't hurt to just be honest with her.

169
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:29,170
Kurosawa-san...

170
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,910
I always assumed your terrifying demeanor wasn't just for show.

171
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,100
But you actually have a kind heart.

172
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,040
- Let me call you my teacher in life!
- Ouch...

173
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,360
- I get it already...
- Hey, I helped too.

174
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,190
- Yeah, yeah.
- I'll always come to you for advice!

175
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,550
Thanks, but now is not the time for hugs...

176
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:50,980
- Why not?
- Teach, you're so wise...

177
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,880
What's up?

178
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,250
- Huh?
- You're sighing.

179
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,180
It's nothing.

180
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,680
Just thinking about how I'm in no place to be giving advice.

181
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,220
What?

182
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:09,000
I mean, even I'm dumbstruck with how much I fumble.

183
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,350
Is this about Ms. Morita-san's transfer?

184
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,790
Yeah.

185
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:18,370
There's nothing you can do about it now.

186
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:24,150
But I admit, if I were Morita-san, I'd be feeling down in the dumps.

187
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:27,100
Not only is she moving to an office full of strangers,

188
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,700
but she has to leave you,

189
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,970
and get used to the job.

190
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,270
Imagine how anxious she must be.

191
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,220
Yeah.

192
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,560
I'll see you later.

193
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,100
Safe travels.

194
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,830
- See you.
- Stay warm.

195
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,820
- See you all tomorrow.
- See you.

196
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,010
See you.

197
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,600
I'll see you both tomorrow.

198
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,510
- See you.
- Stay warm.

199
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:24,640
A relationship can have a huge impact on both our lives.

200
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,560
I've been fearing the commitment it could imply.

201
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:33,980
But now...

202
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,400
Morita-san.

203
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,190
Could we redo our discussion about this transfer?

204
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,010
First, like what the chief told you,

205
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:15,220
you'll be transferring to our Osaka branch...

206
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:19,470
to aid them in a project they are to begin working on.

207
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:26,830
Our Osaka branch has many capable talents and I believe working there will further your own skills as well.

208
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,940
Right.

209
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,920
Sir, may I ask you a question?

210
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,510
Of course.

211
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:43,090
Why exactly was I chosen for this opportunity?

212
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:49,550
You have proven yourself time and time again,

213
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:52,250
since being assigned to our division.

214
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,520
I believed this opportunity would further heighten your potential.

215
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:02,610
Besides, this achievement would earn you prestige.

216
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,560
It would help further your career.

217
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:15,020
I'm honored you have given me this opportunity. I really am.

218
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,350
But...

219
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,090
I cannot stand the thought of parting ways with you so soon.

220
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:39,380
That's why I haven't been able to accept this opportunity wholeheartedly.

221
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:55,970
I'd like to speak my mind as your partner now, if that's all right.

222
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,540
Go ahead.

223
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,560
There are apparently some cute cafes and nice looking bars

224
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,680
near the restaurant we're going to on Christmas.

225
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,860
So I thought maybe we could go?

226
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,220
Yeah, sounds good.

227
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,730
Great.

228
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:23,140
Do you have a preference for which one we should go to?

229
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,520
Nope, you can choose.

230
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,360
Well...

231
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:43,870
Oshima-san, you're just entertaining my whims, aren't you?

232
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,540
What?

233
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:50,040
You always say we can go wherever I want,

234
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,850
or eat whatever I'm in the mood for.

235
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,950
And that makes me happy, of course.

236
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,810
But this is our Christmas.

237
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,730
Am I the only one looking forward to it?

238
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,570
Of course not. I'm looking forward to it, too.

239
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:10,490
Well, it feels like I'm the only one in love.

240
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,190
Sorry. I'm heading home.

241
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,700
Ozu-san.

242
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,530
Ozu-san!

243
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:40,440
I'm sorry for dropping the news on you the other day.

244
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:47,220
I put in the recommendation before we started dating.

245
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,390
It just so happens everything has been settled now.

246
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:57,820
Honestly, I was also conflicted about the notice.

247
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,470
I had no idea.

248
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,430
I...

249
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:16,220
I didn't even stop to think about how you felt.

250
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,800
I can't believe I was so stuck in my own head.

251
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:25,230
I'm so sorry.

252
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,850
No.

253
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,110
If anything, I need to apologize.

254
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,810
I said I couldn't be held responsible.

255
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:36,850
But I shouldn't have phrased it that way.

256
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,860
I'm your boss.

257
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,640
And as your boss, I didn't want you to lose out on this opportunity.

258
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,410
Yet as your partner...

259
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,530
I was happy to hear you wanted to stay.

260
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,650
That you didn't want us to be apart.

261
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,340
But I see a future for us in the long term.

262
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:10,830
I swear it, from the bottom of my heart.

263
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,250
To be honest...

264
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,130
I've never done a long-distance relationship before.

265
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,460
I, too, have my worries about it.

266
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:28,010
Except, I also believe we can overcome whatever challenges it could pose.

267
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:34,310
Our future together is important, but so are our own personal lives.

268
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,660
Thank you.

269
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,780
Kurosawa-san...

270
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,850
I also see a future with you.

271
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,770
I also want us to stay together, long-term.

272
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,150
We'll be okay.

273
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,940
We will.

274
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,430
Now that that weight is off my shoulders...

275
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,960
I'm starving.

276
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:53,110
Shall we grab some dinner together?

277
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,040
But...

278
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,490
We're alone.

- You think?
- Absolutely.

290
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:13,590
Work will keep us busy until New Year's, though.

291
