1
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,100
I can't ever leave you be.

2
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,990
Let's get you back.

3
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,500
Right.

4
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,550
Good morning.

5
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,600
Good morning.

6
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,610
You could have taken the day off today.

7
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:37,250
Thank you, but I feel much better now.

8
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,870
That's good to hear.

9
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,810
I also just wanted to see you.

10
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,230
I'm counting on you for this afternoon's meeting.

11
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,810
Of course.

12
00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:59,750
Hey.

13
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,350
- You show off.
- What?

14
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,710
He made a mad dash to the hospital and then...

15
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,140
Right?

16
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,970
Stop teasing me.

17
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,580
Love adds color to life.

18
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:18,030
Whether it's the painful of unrequited love or the joy of mutual love,

19
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,380
they're all emotions that build upon the other.

20
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,550
And that's something I find to be a miracle.

21
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:31,210
[The Reason We Fall in Love]

22
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,160
Glad to see Aoi-san up and kicking again?

23
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,050
What is your deal...

24
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,200
You're too open today.

25
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,240
Thanks for your help on Friday, really.

26
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,190
I have to say, you made some smooth moves that night, sir.

27
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,460
You swooped in like a fairytale prince.

28
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,580
Quit mocking me.

29
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,970
Would you have rushed to help, if I were the one who collapsed?

30
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,280
- Why would I?
- See? Any normal "boss" wouldn't.

31
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:07,010
You've always been overly conscious of Aoi-san.

32
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,740
- I would know. I've been watching.
- Huh?

33
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:12,520
See you around, sir.

34
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,150
Something's up?

35
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:23,070
Just wondering if there's a prince out there to swoop me off my feet, too.

36
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:27,520
If you need a prince to help drink your sorrows away, you have one right here.

37
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,510
Imamu...

38
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,460
- You're not my type.
- Hey.

39
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,270
But I'll take you up on that.

40
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,560
- You are so not cute.
- Hey, I'll pay.

41
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,070
- Morita-san.
- Yes?

42
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:41,290
Have you ever done work with Ichikawa-san before?

43
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,380
No, I don't think so.

44
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:47,210
But I have been called out to assist her...

45
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:51,640
So him and Aoi-chan, huh?

46
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,390
Ozu-san?

47
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:38,360
No... Does she... towards Tomonari?

48
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,620
Yeah, I bet she likes him.

49
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,070
He's better for her.

50
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,840
But then...

51
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:56,640
What am I supposed to do?

52
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,650
Nope, no more.

53
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,450
Got any plans after this?

54
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,390
I might grab a parfait somewhere.

55
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,150
I thought you avoided indulging.

56
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,900
Not anymore.

57
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,360
Why the change of heart?

58
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,090
My exercise buddy converted me.

59
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,610
It's a recent development.

60
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:25,910
Another gym bro...

61
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,620
She's a younger lady.

62
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,080
Then a gym girl.

63
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,310
Wait, a woman?

64
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,890
Yeah.

65
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,390
So... Anyway.

66
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:44,770
I want to introduce you to her. You'd get along great. How about it?

67
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,580
That was sudden.

68
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,170
She's a bold lady, true to her heart.

69
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:53,500
She's not afraid to express herself.

70
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,040
She's got some real spirit, I tell you.

71
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,360
So how about it?

72
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,550
No, thanks.

73
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,870
Why? Is it something about her?

74
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,000
Or did you get a girlfriend?

75
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,640
Not yet.

76
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,320
"Yet"?

77
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,940
I didn't realize you had someone special like that...

78
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,530
Who is it? Where did you both meet?

79
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,240
Is it someone in the company?

80
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,050
Do they work in sales? The same division, even?

81
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,290
Yeah.

82
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,640
Wow...

83
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,040
Which means...

84
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,660
If anything, aren't you the one crushing on your training buddy?

85
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,700
- What?
- Judging by your face when you talk about her, you know.

86
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:46,360
You know what? Tell me about what "not yet" means.

87
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,500
Nope, no more of this.

88
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,960
Good afternoon.

89
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,330
Oshima-sans nefarious plan is progressing, I see...

90
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,710
- Jealous?
- Sure...

91
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:14,500
But he turned me down for lunch, again.

92
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,180
Oshima-san, would you like to grab lunch with me today?

93
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,220
We could get some soba, to stay healthy.

94
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,770
Sorry! I have prior plans today.

95
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,520
Let's go out some other time!

96
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,360
Did he notice my feelings? Is he avoiding me?

97
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,430
He might just be busy.

98
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,400
But our work isn't especially busy right now...

99
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,860
And what brings you here?

100
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,330
I'm waiting for Ichikawa-san.

101
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,640
She's out eating lunch.

102
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,210
Alone?

103
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,400
I wonder where? And what?

104
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,320
Oh? Do you have something for Ichikawa-san?

105
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,400
- No, well—
- What's this about me?

106
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,150
Nothing! We were just speculating what you were having for lunch.

107
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:59,450
I had ramen today with Oshima-kun.

108
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,490
- Ramen?
- With Oshima-san?

109
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,090
Yeah.

110
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,030
I'd love to join sometime.

111
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:10,980
So a rich ramen was the correct choice here?

112
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,960
Aoi-san, is this...

113
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,810
What happened?

114
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:20,340
Nothing, I just got an eyelash in my eye.

115
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,310
- Are you all right?
- Fine.

116
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,720
I already used some eye drops.

117
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,850
How did it even get in there?

118
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:31,540
I don't know, but it sure does hurt.

119
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,660
Let me see.

120
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,360
- Huh?
- What are you doing?

121
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,360
- Great work as usual.
- What?

122
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,620
Morita-san, a moment.

123
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,040
P-Pardon?

124
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,190
Uh, did I miss something?

125
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,660
What's wrong, sir?

126
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:04,740
I won't know unless you say something...

127
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,220
Itami was touching you.

128
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,540
And I didn't like it.

129
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,200
Sir, it wasn't anything—

130
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,770
Still...

131
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,940
I reacted before I...

132
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,440
How absolutely unprofessional of me.

133
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,650
Sorry.

134
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,730
But I...

135
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,740
Well...

136
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,540
I want to have a long chat with you.

137
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,600
And without the influence of alcohol.

138
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,360
Because there's something I need to tell you.

139
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:05,230
Something... you need to tell me?

140
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,630
I want to talk calmly.

141
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,860
I can make dinner for us.

142
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,500
- So if you'd like to visit my—
- I'll go.

143
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,390
Kurosawa-san, perfect timing.

144
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,240
Could we get your opinion on this?

145
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,400
- Sure.
- Did we interrupt you?

146
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:34,480
No, I wasn't busy.

147
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,030
Then I'd like to go over some designs we covered last week...

148
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,820
Sakamoto-kun, you're like the perfect salesman.

149
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,340
You think so? Thank you for the compliment.

150
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,920
I mean, you're so lovable and charming.

151
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,440
Qualities that I don't even remotely have.

152
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,970
Well, I personally want to get better at giving sales pitches.

153
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,470
Yeah? I'm rooting for you.

154
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,600
Ichikawa-san.

155
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,300
Do you have anything after this?

156
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,480
No, I think I'll be heading straight home.

157
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,370
It's early evening, after all.

158
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:10,420
Then if you're free, would you like to grab dinner together?

159
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,260
Sure.

160
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,330
I live in the area, so I know good places.

161
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:17,370
Really? Let's go, then!

162
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:21,240
- What are you in the mood for?
- Good question.

163
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,280
Where do you usually eat dinner?

164
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,100
Just local eateries that sell set meals.

165
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,680
Eateries are nice.

166
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,290
No way, was there rain in the forecast?

167
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,290
Hold on.

168
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:37,120
Here, share my umbrella.

169
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,920
Thank you.

170
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,730
- This came out of nowhere.
- Unbelievable.

171
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,970
Watch your step.

172
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,240
- Let's take shelter there.
- Good idea.

173
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,020
This is a heavy downpour...

174
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,750
It sure is.

175
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:02,320
It doesn't look like it'll let up any time soon either.

176
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,690
Are we far from the restaurant you recommended?

177
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,050
We're actually quite close, but...

178
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,860
Sakamoto-kun!

179
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,090
You're drenched!

180
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,100
Looks like I am.

181
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,390
I didn't even notice.

182
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,880
You'll catch a cold in the restaurant.

183
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,270
- Let's head to my place first.
- Huh?

184
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,900
O-Oh, right.

185
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,370
Hold on, I'll bring you a towel.

186
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,650
Thank you.

187
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,540
Thank you.

188
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,290
- I can dry myself...
- It's fine, let me.

189
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,490
This isn't working.

190
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,100
Let's hang your suit.

191
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,170
Oh, thank you.

192
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,830
The shower's in here.

193
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,740
Keep warm, don't catch a cold.

194
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,420
Right...

195
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,630
This is bad...

196
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,600
Especially since I'm his superior and all.

197
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,580
[Yuji Shiraishi: Can I come over? I need a place to wait out this rain.]

198
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,070
There, there...

199
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:03,340
This rain hasn't let up one bit.

200
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,050
I'm glad we made it indoors before it started pouring.

201
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,110
Do you cook often?

202
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,970
Relatively so. Especially since my mother passed.

203
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,640
Don't let it bother you. It happened a long time ago.

204
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,110
Let me help.

205
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:37,640
Except, all I can really make is a simple salad...

206
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:43,740
Okay, then. I'd appreciate it.

207
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,210
Yes, sir.

208
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,740
At first...

209
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,900
I was only curious. I wondered why you were always so tense.

210
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:30,140
You were also a bit careless about yourself.

211
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,170
I felt like I was responsible for watching over you.

212
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,640
Eventually, I couldn't take my eyes off you.

213
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:47,600
But I'm already 33.

214
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,950
And when you get to my age...

215
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:56,550
you have to deal with problems aside from your own, like it or not.

216
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:02,050
Romance isn't something I can take lightly anymore.

217
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,870
We're coworkers.

218
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,920
You're my subordinate.

219
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,820
Our situation would involve risks, plenty of them.

220
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,650
What happens if we break up?

221
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,010
What if others find out?

222
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:26,820
I've given this careful thought. But as I do...

223
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,830
I realize all the hassle it would be.

224
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,510
I don't want to get you involved in all of that.

225
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:47,220
You're still in your twenties.

226
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,510
There are better people out there for you.

227
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:56,110
People your age, who share similar interests.

228
00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:01,770
People you could get old with, without leaving the other behind.

229
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:13,240
At least, that's what I was trying to tell myself.

230
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,140
But despite it all...

231
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,450
Despite everything I've told myself...

232
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,570
I love you.

233
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:32,720
♫ Even if they are reborn someday, decades from now ♫

234
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,340
♫ I will find you and embrace you ♫

235
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,020
♫ I'm embarrassed to say this, but... ♫

236
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,440
That's what I had wanted to tell you.

237
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,480
♫ I just want you to know this feeling ♫

238
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,810
♫ I like the way you are ♫

239
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:59,540
♫ I pretend not to notice my feelings ♫

240
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,270
♫ I'm used to faking my emotions ♫

241
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,860
I love you, too.

242
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,300
Kurosawa-san...

243
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,460
I love you.

244
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:19,670
♫ I want you to always, any time, be by my side ♫

245

♫ You always nod to me just the way you are ♫

248
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,960
From now on,

249
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,440
Kurosawa-san...

250
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,430
will you share your cooking with me?

251
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:48,690
Sure. I'd love to.

252
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:52,800
♫ I can't spell very well, but... ♫

253
00:18:52,800 --> 00:19:01,670
♫ You are the reason for everything I do, because... ♫

254
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,980
Thank you for letting me borrow your shower.

255
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,790
They've issued a weather warning.

256
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,370
What?

257
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,680
What to do...

258
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:17,390
Stay here until the rain lets up.

259
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,910
We could drink to pass the time.

260
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,330
Would that be all right?

261
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,320
Of course. Here, sit.

262
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,820
Thank you.

263
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:32,000
[Can I come over? I need a place to wait out this rain.]
[Sorry, not today.]

264
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,300
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

265
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,040
I see you work at home as well?

266
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:53,100
Something like that. I feel bad working overtime in the office.

267
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,810
All those design books, too...

268
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:58,690
Those? Yeah, those have accumulated over the years.

269
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:10,910
Sorry, I shouldn't be scrutinizing a woman's room.

270
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:13,320
Are you all right?

271
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,310
I'm fine—

272
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,060
Ichikawa-san?

273
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,380
I'll be borrowing your restroom.

274
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,280
If you'll excuse me!

275
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,340
That was so embarrassing...

276
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,720
What is it?

277
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:14,510
Nothing really. It just feels like time passed in a blink.

278
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,840
Kurosawa-san.

279
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:42,910
I want to make sure I'm not dreaming.

280
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:49,450
Can you squeeze me back?

281
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:58,590
To make sure I'm not dreaming.

282
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,210
- Are you free for dinner tonight?
- Yes.
[Next Episode]

283
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:25,920
I can't reciprocate your feelings.

284
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,510
Would you be willing to hang out with me again?

285
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,480
Are you still seeing that one guy?

286
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,740
I never once thought I would fall in love again.

287
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,450
And at the office, no less.
