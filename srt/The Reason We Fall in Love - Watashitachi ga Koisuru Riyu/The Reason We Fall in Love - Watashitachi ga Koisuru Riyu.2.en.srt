00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,450
Sir, I'm happy we've become better acquainted with one another.

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:05,710
I'm glad to hear it.

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:08,700
You smiled!

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,330
I guess it'll be our little secret.

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,020
Take a good look, because it's not happening again.

6
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,010
No way!

7
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,480
Kei-chan! Kei-chan.

8
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,010
Calm down, we didn't kiss.

9
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,800
But you did hold hands, right?

10
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,590
Right.

11
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,560
He also smiled with this really soft expression...

12
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,990
He smiled?

13
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,880
Kurosawa-san smiled? I can't imagine it.

14
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,000
I couldn't either.

15
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:09,880
At first, I thought he was a scary guy, who I wouldn't ever get a read on.

16
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,160
I personally don't mind if someone towers over me.

17
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,540
But then he defended me,

18
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,230
and acted surprisingly considerate, too.

19
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,530
Maybe he has a kind heart after all.

20
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,970
Aoi-chan, what did you want to do when you held Kurosawa-san's hand?

21
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,040
I...

22
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:47,800
I didn't want to let go.

23
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,360
Or something?

24
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,980
Thought so.

25
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:01,530
Stop teasing me!

26
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,750
- Go on.
- Huh?

27
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,860
Good morning.

28
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,520
Good morning.

29
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,870
Sir, thank you for your time yesterday.

30
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,720
The pleasure was mine.

31
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,650
If you'd like, shall we go out again some other time?

32
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,280
Sure, why not.

33
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,900
Really?

34
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,340
Yeah.

35
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,800
I'll be sure to invite Ayaka as well.

36
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,790
Right.

37
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,860
And here I thought we'd gotten closer.

38
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06,960
Now it's like he's distancing himself.

39
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:12,220
Only my heart, lost in love, wavers with uncertainty.

40
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,990
[The Reason We Fall in Love]

41
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,610
Make sure you mail that out by today.

42
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,000
Yes, I will.

43
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,560
Did you schedule the appointment with Tendanes Co. as well?

44
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,290
Oh! Shoot!

45
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,940
I'll get to it, as soon as I finish this email.

46
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,790
There.

47
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,510
What's that?

48
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,410
A reminder written on a sticky note. It'll jog your memory later.

49
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,450
Try it out.

50
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,420
Yes, ma'am.

51
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,000
Morita-san, do you have a minute?

52
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,610
Yes, sir.

53
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:24,000
I would like you to lead next week's overnight business trip with Itami.

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,470
You won't be joining us, sir?

55
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,060
With only a contract to secure, there's no need.

56
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,100
Will the two of us truly suffice?

57
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,330
Itami could use the experience.

58
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,950
As could you, Morita-san.

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,320
I'm counting on you to give him the guidance he needs.

60
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,020
Chief Kurosawa...

61
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,220
Mind if I have a word with you?

62
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,840
Sorry.

63
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,740
So? How did it go with her after I left?

64
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,380
The fact that you tried to run means something happened, right?

65
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,800
Nothing "happened".

66
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,330
Besides, nothing should happen.

67
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,530
Why?

68
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,930
She's my subordinate.

69
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,490
We see each other daily, regardless of what occurs outside of work.

70
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:39,020
I wouldn't want to ruin her career over something like interpersonal relations.

71
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:42,410
So no, nothing will ever "happen".

72
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,430
Who decided those rules?

73
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:53,680
Aren't you just scared of ruining what status quo you have now?

74
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:13,750
Scratch that, I can't get a read on him at all.

75
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,730
Oh? I spy with my little eyes...

76
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,970
Oshima-san?

77
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,980
A Sakamoto.

78
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,840
Don't hunt me out.

79
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,800
You're as skinny as ever.

80
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,960
- Oshima-san.
- Are you even eating?

81
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,410
- I am.
- You'd better, or else I'm calling you Skinny-moto.

82
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,520
That's "Sakamoto" to you, sir.

83
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,400
Please, let go.

84
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,400
Aw, you're just so adorable.

85
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,630
I'm so jealous...

86
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:44,090
Oshima-san, would you like to join us?

87
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,620
Can I?

88
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,070
Of course. Please, have a seat.

89
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,980
Thank you.

90
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,240
- Aren't you glad they're welcoming?
- I sure am.

91
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,720
Man, I am starving.

92
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,600
Your meals all look delicious.

93
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,900
There we go.

94
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,130
Is that enough for you?

95
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:06,810
I put on some weight, so I'm packing meals to curb it.

96
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,020
But you're fine as is.

97
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,850
Hm?

98
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:15,090
Nothing, just admiring your homemade meal.

99
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:18,220
I'd recommend starting with gaining muscle, before dieting.

100
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:22,820
Please quit inviting your juniors to the gym whenever you see the chance.

101
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,460
Sorry, do you dislike physical activity?

102
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,220
No, I love it.

103
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,440
Don't egg him on, he'll turn you into a bodybuilder...

104
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,060
- Oshima-san.
- Yes?

105
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,650
Would you please help me pick out some exercise equipment?

106
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,060
Of course.

107
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,420
- Really?
- Sure.

108
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,910
- Yes!
- When are you free?

109
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:47,000
I'll check my schedule.

110
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,800
Well, I'm free whenever, all right?

111
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,630
Thank you! I'm happy you're willing to help.

[Kei Oshima]

113
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:01,970
I can't believe Oshima-san's first name is also Kei.

114
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:07,210
If you two got married, you'd have the exact same name.

115
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,680
You're right.

116
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,590
This must be fate!

117
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,250
Except, you're jumping the gun for me, Aoi-chan.

118
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,120
Am I that obvious?

119
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:25,190
Totally. You're not hiding anything.

120
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,650
I thought so.

121
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:32,930
But Oshima-san has a broad chest, built arms, and a kind smile.

122
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,890
He is my very ideal!

123
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,450
- I never knew.
- Yes.

124
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,970
I love having a crush at the office.

125
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:44,010
Wouldn't you agree?

126
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,440
Huh?

127
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,270
I guess so.

128
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,770
- Have a good evening.
- You too.

129
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,000
Why?

130
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,700
Make sure you mail that out by today.

131
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,400
I will.

132
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,870
Say, did you happen to see Itami-san?

133
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,480
Yes, he just left.

134
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,230
I need to get going as well. See you.

135
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,620
See you...

136
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,990
Why?

137
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,970
He didn't use a sticky note, even after I told him.

138
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:38,340
Why did Kurosawa-san assign me to guide him?

139
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,940
Because I could trust you with it.

140
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,110
Huh? Oh, good evening.

141
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,760
For you.

142
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,690
Thank you.

143
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,120
Can I sit?

144
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,490
Of course.

145
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,580
Thank you for the coffee.

146
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:22,990
You know, Itami still has a mountain of things to learn.

147
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,020
and is working hard.

148
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:29,500
Well, he needs to be doing that now.

149
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:36,490
Yes, I know.

150
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,610
But, sir...

151
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:44,240
I'm not even competent myself.

152
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,830
I'm certainly not ready to give anyone guidance.

153
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,840
You think so?

154
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,140
Well, I don't agree.

155
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:01,520
I believe there's plenty to learn from your work ethic.

156
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,690
That's why I assigned you as his mentor.

157
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:16,890
Give Itami and yourself the attention you both deserve, to grow.

158
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:26,850
I'll be there to watch your back.

159
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,600
So don't worry about it.

160
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:41,990
Thank you, sir.

161
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:46,030
You're... welcome.

162
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:56,850
Um, Kurosawa-san.

163
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,480
I'm so sorry! I knew I'd forgotten it.

164
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,030
Itami-san?

165
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:09,260
I wrote myself a note, but it got stuck to my suit.

166
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:12,850
I only noticed it later and realized I'd forgotten something.

167
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,680
Hopefully, I'll make it to the post.

168
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,910
Take care, Kurosawa-san. You too, Aoi-san.

169
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,220
Be careful out there...

170
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,290
"Aoi-san", huh...

171
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:35,380
Nothing. Let's head on out ourselves.

172
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,590

No. Not possible.

179
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,690
We only held hands once.

180
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,790
- I drank too much!
- And at the time...

181
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:22,610
Right, we were both drunk.

No. No way.

She is my subordinate. My direct subordinate, at that.

184
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:52,550
And yet... my eyes seem to follow her.

185
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:06,790
Do I... have a thing for her?

Excuse me.

188
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:17,140
Ichikawa-san, I'm ready to go.

189
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,440
It's time already?

190
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,620
All right then, let's get to it.

191
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,460
Yes, ma'am.

192
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:34,930
Our design for this advertisement is meant to evoke "purity,"

193
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:38,330
like the new products it is modeled after.

194
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:40,370
Previously, we utilized a vivid palette

195
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:43,640
to emphasize the "cute" factor present in your brand.

196
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,080
However, this time, we will be using pastels and natural tones

197
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,360
to further emphasize the "pure" feel in your newest line.

198
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,080

Excuse me.

We shall also print out the posters on matte paper,

hopefully attracting the target audience of women in their twenties and thirties.

202
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,060
Ichikawa-san?

203
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:26,750
Sorry, you can head on back without me.

204
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,640
Unbelievable...

205
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,560
I just had to forget it today, didn't I?

206
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:56,790
Ichikawa-san? Is everything all right?

207
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,700
Sorry. I can't move...

208
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,550
What? Are you okay?

209
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,070
Should I call an ambulance?

210
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,110
No.

211
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:07,150
It's nothing unusual. I'll be fine.

212
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,680
Head on back without me. Okay?

213
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,300
Please wait, I'll be right back.

214
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,860
Could you place this inside?

215
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,320
Of course.

216
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,470
Thank you very much.

217
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,440
I'm sorry if I made the wrong assumption.

Thank you.

222
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,660
You saved me back there.

223
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:23,200
Of course. It was an emergency.

224
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,130
I'm really sorry for the trouble.

225
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:30,210
I'm surprised you figured it out, though.

My sister and mother also have heavy flows.

227
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,250
I've watched how they become bedridden every month.

228
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:40,240
So I had a feeling.

229
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:45,050
I recognize how tough it can be.

230
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,560
I see.

231
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:53,150
I feel much better now.

- Let's head on back.
- Right.

Please don't push yourself.

00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,730
Perfect.

Then I'll go and turn this in.

00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,840

Yeah.

Yup.

Lots of people regret not saying anything when it really matters.

It'll weigh on you.

255
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,710
So you should go and tell him everything with your whole heart.

256
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,360
Okay.

257
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,830
Thanks.

Kurosawa-san, you're drinking coffee tonight? That's unusual.

You see, I actually have a crush on someone at the company.

Why are you asking me?

267
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:18,680
So you're not making advances on Aoi-san then.

What's this about?

269
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:29,510
I mean, the two of you just looked really close.
