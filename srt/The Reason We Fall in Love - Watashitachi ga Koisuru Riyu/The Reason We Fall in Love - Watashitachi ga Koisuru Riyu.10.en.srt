1
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,600
Sorry.

2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,360
Sorry.

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,810
Would you...

4
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,450
rather not hold hands?

5
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,530
No, that's not it.

6
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,060
But this also happened on our date.

7
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,530
All that movie watching has made me hungry, though.

8
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:52,760
Maybe I had gone for your hand at the wrong time.

9
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,850
Or maybe I was being too clingy?

10
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,330
I just don't know what it could be...

11
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,450
It's not you.

12
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,300
It's our age.

13
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,220
We're eight years apart.

14
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:20,330
People might judge, especially if we held hands.

15
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:25,030
Our age also comes across in our fashion. Like on our date.

16
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,430
You dressed so young and hip.

17
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,650
We may not even look like a couple at all.

18
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:38,400
To whom?

19
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:47,460
Ayaka-san, I would never want to make you feel uncomfortable.

20
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,800
But are we trying to prove ourselves to someone?

21
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:03,560
All I want is to hold hands with you.

22
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,350
That's all.

23
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,850
Sorry.

24
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,050
No, you're entirely right.

25
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:31,960
Whose judgement was I even worried about?

26
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,820
Instead, I've been making you feel all anxious.

27
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,060
I'm such a moron.

28
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,740
I wouldn't go that far...

29
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,510
What...?

30
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,270
It's a bit embarrassing to ask, but...

31
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,370
Would you hold my hand?

32
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,150
Of course.

33
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,920
I actually made potato salad for us tonight.

34
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,830
You did?

35
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,400
I'm excited to try.

36
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,300
38.1 degrees...

37
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,050
Seriously?

38
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:37,930
It's not like Kurosawa-san to take a sick day, is it?

39
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,140
Feel free to take the afternoon off.

40
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,860
[How is your fever?]

41
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:03,400
By the way, have you been preparing for the move to Osaka?

42
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,460
I have, but finding a place is the hardest part.

43
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,360
Housing is packed over there.

44
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,740
I see.

45
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:14,520
It must be tough, knowing you'll be apart from Kurosawa-san.

46
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,670
I won't deny it.

47
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:19,670
But we're only 2.5 hours away by bullet train.

48
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,630
It's honestly not that bad.

49
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,140
If you say so.

50
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,680
Oh no.

51
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,390
What's wrong?

52
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:42,020
My commission for Matsufuji Central requires some major reworking.

53
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,020
I'm getting called into the office tomorrow.

54
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:49,690
But isn't your Christmas date with Oshima-san tomorrow?

55
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:56,740
Whatever, it's fine. We're sort of at odds right now anyways.

56
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,320
You came to visit.

57
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,140
Thanks.

58
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:20,050
How is your fever?

59
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:23,980
It probably hasn't gone down.

60
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,060
I see.

61
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,190
Go back to sleep,

62
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,540
I'll whip up something—

63
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,520
Aoi.

64
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,590
I missed you.

65
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,350
Did you just...

66
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:49,150
call me, "Aoi"?

67
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,590
I blame my hazy brain.

68
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,680
Am I playing fair?

69
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,830
Definitely not.

70
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,460
I never realized how blissful it is...

71
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:23,830
to wake up to your beloved.

72
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,940
Good morning.

73
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,690
Morning.

74
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,000
Yes?

75
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,980
It's just sort of embarrassing.

76
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,180
Embarrassing indeed.

77
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,230
I'm still a bit sleepy.

78
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,290
Should we sleep in, then?

79
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,980
Yup.

80
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,730
Morning.

81
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,920
Good morning.

82
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:07,020
How are you feeling?

83
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,440
Much better.

84
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,320
Sorry, I didn't mean to waste our Christmas like this.

85
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,000
We even had to cancel our hot spring reservation...

86
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,690
It's fine, I don't mind.

87
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,000
My fever's gone down.

88
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,590
We can still spend the day out.

89
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,560
It's okay, I promise.

90
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,650
The cold weather will only make you feel worse anyway.

91
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:48,150
But it's a holiday.

92
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:53,120
Then, how about we cook together a little later?

93
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,180
That's nothing special though.

94
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,830
Exactly.

95
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,800
I want to cherish our "nothing special" moments, while I still can.

96
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,410
Oh, right...

97
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,490
Come join me.

98
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,990
I wish...

99
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:38,130
I could stay glued to your side.

100
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,970
Then that's what we'll do today.

101
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,940
No funny business.

102
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,260
You'll catch the virus, too.

103
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:06,470
- Then I'll just join you on sick leave.
- Nope, no can do.

104
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,760
Aw, why not?

105
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:14,320
I see no end to this...

106
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,230
What?

107
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,500
Who's there?

108
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,400
Merry Christmas!

109
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,510
Oshima-san? Why are you dressed like that?

110
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:53,720
I wanted to see you, so here I am.

111
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:01,050
I'll stay with you while you work.

112
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,770
But this could take hours...

113
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,840
I want to stay.

114
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:11,130
So let me, okay?

115
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,790
Oshima-san!

116
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:26,470
I want you to know I'm happy to go anywhere with you.

117
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:34,300
Still, I'll try to be more vocal about our date plans moving forth.

118
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,950
Sorry again.

119
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:42,230
I know we're at the office, but I have no complaints about our Christmas today.

120
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,050
Neither do I.

121
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:48,710
And I have to say, you look great as Santa Claus.

122
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,600
You mean it?

123
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,110
Absolutely. I love you!

124
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,190
I love you, too!

125
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:02,450
If I'm being completely honest,

126
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:06,010
you absolutely terrified me at first.

127
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,640
Really now.

128
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,940
Do you remember, back in the elevator?

129
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,930
I suppose if a tall girl like you wore heels,

130
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:16,940
you'd end up towering over us men.

131
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:22,000
I personally don't mind if someone towers over me.

132
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,430
You defended me and I felt a change of heart.

133
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:29,070
Right, I remember now.

134
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:32,940
It made me realize you kept a good eye on those around you.

135
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,950
I love that about you, Kurosawa-san.

136
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:43,740
Both as my boss and my partner.

137
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:48,400
I had a similar experience.

138
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:54,390
You may not remember it, though.

139
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:57,620
Sir, are you not clocking out for the day?

140
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,130
Not yet.

141
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,460
Is there anything I can do to help?

142
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:06,080
I was really thankful you reached out.

143
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:11,060
In fact, that sort of thing has happened many times now.

144
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,790
You may think I keep a good eye on people.

145
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,980
But...

146
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:24,750
I think you're the one who taught me how.

147
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,900
I don't want to leave you.

148
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,290
I know.

149
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,550
I'm so full.

150
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,180
I enjoyed dessert.

151
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,510
Agreed.

152
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,400
Should we get going?

153
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,960
Sounds good to me.

154
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,570
Ayaka-san, let me.

155
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,540
It's fine.

156
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,570
You can take the bill next time.

157
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,650
But...

158
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,500
I don't like this sort of thing.

159
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:16,240
We're a couple now.

160
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:21,150
Please don't feel obligated to pay because you're older.

161
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,930
I want us to be equals.

162
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,210
I see.

163
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,920
Sorry about that.

164
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,050
It's fine.

165
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,760
I want to pay.

166
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:44,300
Then no paying because you're the "guy" or whatever, okay?

167
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,040
- We're equals.
- Equals.

168
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,420
Then I guess we split the bill?

169
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,390
Yeah, and make it even.

170
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,700
It's good. Want a bite?

171
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,900
- Yum.
- Right?

172
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,430
Yeah.

173
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,050
Kurosawa-san.

174
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:45,600
This is by far the most blissful Christmas I've ever celebrated in my life.

175
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,180
- Really?
- Yup.

176
00:15:54,190 --> 00:16:00,630
Say, do you remember when we first went out for dinner?

177
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,540
I remember I didn't want us to go our separate ways then.

178
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,110
You know, Aoi.

179
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,910
Being long distance

180
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:21,550
means we'll encounter misunderstandings and anxieties.

181
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:31,260
But that's exactly why I'll express everything on my mind.

182
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,750
I'll be honest with you.

183
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,200
Okay.

184
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,660
I will, too.

185
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,310
Okay.

186
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,260
Aoi.

187
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,610
Yes?

188
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:08,400
There's something I want to ask you.

189
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,610
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

190
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,800
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

191
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,130
- Good morning?
- Good morning.

192
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,000
See you later.

193
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,430
Right.

194
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,780
Are those two going out with each other?

195
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,160
Are they?

196
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,430
- You knew?
- No, not at all.

197
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,480
Good morning.

198
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,090
Morning.

199
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,370
Could we head into work tomorrow, together?

200
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:50,920
Huh?

201
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:56,200
I mean, there's no reason to hide our relationship anymore, right?

202
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:00,990
✨ Thank you to our Channel Manager: sheli ❤️

203

✨ Thank you to our Chief Segmenter: kitty100 ❤️
✨ Thank you to our Segmenters:
kitty100 and marykarmelina ❤️

204
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:09,100
I managed to buy most of the essentials.

205
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,330
All that's left, are...

206
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:15,090
Why are we spending our last day together running errands?

207
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,840
My bad.

208
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:23,060
✨ Thank you to our Editors:
yunoilwoo (TE), vicky_daebak (GE) and kakashiandme (CE) ❤️

209
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,960
✨ Thank you to our Language Moderators and their teams ❤️

210
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,960
✨ Thank you for watching with us! ❤️

211
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,450
Want to step in?

212
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,410
Huh?

213
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:39,080
Wow, these are adorable...

214
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,400
You should try them on.

215
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:46,180
It's all right.

216
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:50,130
If I wore these, I'd tower over you.

217
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,170
Don't you remember?

218
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:00,660
"I don't mind if someone towers over me".

219
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:18,190
What do you think?

220
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,830
Looks nice.

221
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:24,940
♫ Because... because... because... because... ♫

222
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:29,580
♫ That day you said, “Let's go" ♫

223
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,170
I can't believe I'm leaving tomorrow...

224
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,410
Time flies.

225
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,560
It sure does.

226
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,000
I'll have to work hard.

227
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,440
Yeah.

228
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:48,330
Don't work yourself too hard though, all right?

229
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,120
I won't.

230
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:02,260
♫ Maybe I know, but you know what? ♫

231
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,460
I have to admit...

232
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:11,010
I wish we had begun dating much earlier.

233
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:15,070
♫ I'll always be next to you, any time ♫

234
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,020
Well...

235
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,000
We're dating, because we met as we are, now.

236
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:33,470
Not a moment before, or a moment after.

237
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,740
But right now, in the present.

238
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:43,980
♫ Also your ambiguous pretense, because... ♫

239
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:48,380
♫ I'm not good at spelling words, but... ♫

240
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:56,860
♫ It's you more than anything else to me, because... ♫

241
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:03,800
♫ You will always trip over nothing, won't you? ♫

242
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:09,010
♫ And you always say you cut your bangs too short ♫

243
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:14,740
♫ You always put others before yourself ♫

244
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,090
♫ That's the you I know ♫

245
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:20,360
♫ That's why I just can't leave you alone ♫

246
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:26,850
♫ The city at first light is tinged with a fragile glow ♫

247
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:31,780
Write your reminders on a sticky note. It'll jog your memory later.

248
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,350
Righty-o.

249
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,570
That's not professional.

250
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:40,390
It's "yes, sir" and "thank you, sir," got it?

251
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,580
Yes, sir.

252
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,340
Like you're any better though.

253
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,030
No ragging on my mistakes.

254
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:49,810
And there are more efficient, digitalized ways to take notes.

255
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,700
- Afternoon, everyone.
- Afternoon.

256
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,150
Did Tomonari already leave?

257
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,560
Right on the dot.

258
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,500
Someone is coming back today, after all.

259
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,670
Finally.

260
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:05,200
Love is nothing but trouble.

261
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,590
You smiled!

262
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:10,020
Take a good look, 'cause it's not happening again.

263
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,750
I can't ever leave you be.

264
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,740
It makes the heart unstable.

265
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,360
- Morita-san, a moment.
- P-Pardon?

266
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,850
It ruins any routine.

267
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,990
It can even tear emotions apart.

268
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,260
Getting deeply involved with someone is an inconvenience.

269
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,240
Or so, I thought.

270
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,090
But now...

271
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:38,780
♫ That alone is enough to take a step forward ♫

272
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:41,840
♫ I held your hand and laughed ♫

273
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:47,400
I want to stay with this individual and cherish our time "now".

274
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:52,980
I want to enjoy life and the changes it'll bring.

275
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,680
And that's the reason...

276
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:02,000
I fell in love.

277
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,490
