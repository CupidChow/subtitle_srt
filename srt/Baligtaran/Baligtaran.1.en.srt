1
00:01:29,948 --> 00:01:31,066
Hi! Oh, my God!

2
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,525
- You’re so pretty!
- Hello!

3
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,341
- Thank you!
- Your set earlier was so good!

4
00:01:34,366 --> 00:01:35,591
Can we take a picture?

5
00:01:35,616 --> 00:01:36,638
- Sure.
- Us too!

6
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,513
- Sure, no problem!
- We want a photo with you too.

7
00:01:38,537 --> 00:01:40,005
- Let’s go! Come on.
- Come on!

8
00:01:41,071 --> 00:01:42,656
- I’ll go here.
- Where do I go?

9
00:01:42,681 --> 00:01:44,091
I’ll be here. Yes.

10
00:01:44,116 --> 00:01:45,247
Look over here.

11
00:01:45,646 --> 00:01:47,207
One, two, three!

12
00:01:50,675 --> 00:01:51,832
One, two, three!

13
00:01:51,857 --> 00:01:53,726
- Oh!
- It’s okay. Go ahead. Come on.

14
00:01:54,658 --> 00:01:55,856
One, two, three!

15
00:02:32,073 --> 00:02:33,074
Bestie?

16
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:35,613
Bestie!

17
00:02:36,671 --> 00:02:37,881
I’ll go ahead.

18
00:02:37,906 --> 00:02:39,375
Just... Five minutes, please?

19
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:42,252
Uh, I better get going.

20
00:02:42,277 --> 00:02:44,178
- Are you sure?
- Mhm!

21
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:46,133
Alright, bestie. Take care.

22
00:02:46,493 --> 00:02:49,599
I’ll go ahead and lock up for you.
You guys seem busy.

23
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:03,117
That’s so damn good...

24
00:03:03,697 --> 00:03:04,729
Huh?

25
00:03:04,754 --> 00:03:05,754
Shit.

26
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:00,609
Oh, you’re still here?

27
00:05:01,527 --> 00:05:02,553
I was just leaving.

28
00:05:02,578 --> 00:05:03,578
Let me take you home.

29
00:05:03,824 --> 00:05:05,659
No, thanks. I’m already
booking a car.

30
00:05:05,684 --> 00:05:07,764
You don’t have to spend if
you let me drive you home.

31
00:05:08,062 --> 00:05:09,950
No need.
The car’s already outside.

32
00:05:10,693 --> 00:05:11,747
If you say so...

33
00:05:53,401 --> 00:05:54,425
Cheers!

34
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,246
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

35
00:05:56,271 --> 00:05:57,683
Babe, you’re already drunk.

36
00:05:58,359 --> 00:05:59,714
You’ve drunk a lot.

37
00:06:03,942 --> 00:06:05,011
Bestie!

38
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:07,546
Let’s drink!

39
00:06:07,571 --> 00:06:09,644
Wait. I gotta set up first.

40
00:06:10,138 --> 00:06:11,598
Oh, by the way,

41
00:06:11,623 --> 00:06:13,958
This is Denise,
a friend of mine.

42
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:17,009
- Hi. I’m Denise.
- Hello.

43
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,621
Good luck on your set later.

44
00:06:20,392 --> 00:06:21,602
Thank you.

45
00:06:21,627 --> 00:06:24,838
Excuse me for a sec.
I just need to set up my gear.

46
00:06:24,838 --> 00:06:25,838
Okay.

47
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:27,961
- Okay, cheers.
- See you later.

48
00:06:28,562 --> 00:06:30,355
I’m so shitfaced!

49
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,380
I know.

50
00:06:32,429 --> 00:06:34,097
You’re laughing a lot.

51
00:07:14,384 --> 00:07:16,428
Wow, you’re so good.

52
00:07:16,453 --> 00:07:17,662
Thank you.

53
00:07:18,461 --> 00:07:19,503
That’s right.

54
00:07:20,435 --> 00:07:21,812
She did great, didn’t she?

55
00:07:23,438 --> 00:07:25,350
Even the dance was so hot.

56
00:07:26,441 --> 00:07:27,441
Excuse me.

57
00:07:27,526 --> 00:07:29,069
Wait, don’t go away.

58
00:07:30,278 --> 00:07:32,255
Wait. Do you have a boyfriend?

59
00:07:32,563 --> 00:07:33,563
No.

60
00:07:34,178 --> 00:07:36,980
Really? With that pretty face,
you’re still single?

61
00:07:37,005 --> 00:07:38,165
What if I was your boyfriend?

62
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,678
Hey! Can you please stop?

63
00:07:42,182 --> 00:07:43,428
What did I do?

64
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:46,586
You’re getting too close.
She’s getting uncomfortable.

65
00:07:46,586 --> 00:07:48,839
I’m just trying to make friends.

66
00:07:48,864 --> 00:07:51,575
Well, what you’re doing
isn’t very friendly.

67
00:07:52,021 --> 00:07:53,064
Just leave.

68
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:54,507
I know the owner of this place,

69
00:07:54,532 --> 00:07:56,826
in case you need to
be escorted out of here?

70
00:07:57,472 --> 00:07:58,472
Okay.

71
00:07:59,016 --> 00:08:00,058
- Okay.
- Leave.

72
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,560
Get out.

73
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,192
Are you okay?

74
00:08:10,235 --> 00:08:11,278
Thank you.

75
00:08:11,278 --> 00:08:12,612
He’s always here.

76
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,115
He’s also like that with the staff.

77
00:08:15,782 --> 00:08:18,124
It’s nothing. I’m used
to those types of guys.

78
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:19,734
Too fond of themselves.

79
00:08:20,412 --> 00:08:23,290
They think all girls
are available for them.

80
00:08:28,962 --> 00:08:29,962
Denise...

81
00:08:30,047 --> 00:08:31,047
Let’s go?

82
00:08:31,506 --> 00:08:32,632
You can go ahead.

83
00:08:32,632 --> 00:08:34,259
- I’ll be with you in a sec.
- See you downstairs.

84
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:35,259
Alright.

85
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,015
Well, goodbye.
I have to go.

86
00:08:39,197 --> 00:08:40,197
Take care of yourself.

87
00:08:40,474 --> 00:08:41,474
Bye.

88
00:11:41,884 --> 00:11:42,969
The DJ from earlier...

89
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:45,037
What’s her name again? Kat?

90
00:11:45,145 --> 00:11:46,315
Yeah, Kat.

91
00:11:46,487 --> 00:11:47,487
What’s up?

92
00:11:48,428 --> 00:11:50,425
Nothing. She’s pretty.

93
00:11:50,622 --> 00:11:52,457
And she was really great.

94
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,049
Ah, yes. Classic Denise.

95
00:11:56,253 --> 00:11:57,253
She’s your type?

96
00:11:58,213 --> 00:11:59,213
Oh, come on.

97
00:12:24,155 --> 00:12:25,155
Mmm?

98
00:12:33,915 --> 00:12:35,125
Just a moment.

99
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,754
I’m coming.

100
00:12:43,216 --> 00:12:44,216
Mmm?

101
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,560
Bestie!

102
00:12:46,672 --> 00:12:48,799
It’s way too early.

103
00:12:48,824 --> 00:12:50,405
It’s already noon, hello?

104
00:12:50,682 --> 00:12:52,559
I need to borrow some clothes.

105
00:12:54,077 --> 00:12:55,078
For what?

106
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:56,934
I got a gig later.

107
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,209
Your clothes are way better than mine.

108
00:12:59,234 --> 00:13:00,483
Huh? Why?

109
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,961
The payout’s huge over there.

110
00:13:02,986 --> 00:13:04,004
Speaking of...

111
00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:06,031
Cover for me later
at the bar, will you?

112
00:13:06,056 --> 00:13:08,498
What? But it’s my day-off.

113
00:13:08,783 --> 00:13:10,452
That’s still money.

114
00:13:10,452 --> 00:13:12,787
Why didn’t you tell Ace first?

115
00:13:13,305 --> 00:13:14,764
Oh, you know that guy.

116
00:13:14,789 --> 00:13:17,167
- Please? Just lend me some?
- Fine.

117
00:13:17,192 --> 00:13:19,131
Just go check the clothes on my closet.

118
00:13:19,419 --> 00:13:21,588
Thank you, bestie. I love you.

119
00:13:23,508 --> 00:13:25,412
If only we weren't best friends...

120
00:13:29,467 --> 00:13:30,513
Hi, cat.

121
00:13:30,538 --> 00:13:31,943
Hi, Celine.

122
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,066
Oh.

123
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:39,224
What are you doing here?

124
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,410
Isn’t it your day-off?

125
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,981
Ah, yes. I’m just
covering for Candy.

126
00:13:43,006 --> 00:13:44,037
Where is she?

127
00:13:44,861 --> 00:13:46,363
She’s not feeling well.

128
00:13:47,012 --> 00:13:48,779
Or is she in a different gig?

129
00:13:51,369 --> 00:13:52,826
Anyway, go set up your stuff.

130
00:14:17,352 --> 00:14:18,352
Hi, Kat!

131
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,738
Hi!

132
00:14:19,771 --> 00:14:21,564
I see Candy is not with you.

133
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:24,050
Uh, I’ll be covering for her today.

134
00:14:24,484 --> 00:14:26,361
Ah, well. You know your stuff.

135
00:14:26,386 --> 00:14:27,386
Good luck!

136
00:14:27,445 --> 00:14:28,445
Thank you.

137
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,130
Cheers!

138
00:15:28,214 --> 00:15:29,254
Aren’t you going home yet?

139
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:31,785
Uh, no. I think I’ll stay for a bit.

140
00:15:31,996 --> 00:15:32,996
How about you, Kat?

141
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,657
Relax. We're still talking.

142
00:15:37,682 --> 00:15:38,682
Fine.

143
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,285
Just make sure to lock up.

144
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,686
I need to be somewhere.

145
00:15:41,711 --> 00:15:43,535
- I’ll go ahead.
- Okay. Be safe.

146
00:15:48,341 --> 00:15:49,967
You know, you’re really good.

147
00:15:50,297 --> 00:15:51,297
Thank you.

148
00:15:53,113 --> 00:15:54,782
I like your taste in music.

149
00:15:54,807 --> 00:15:56,392
And your outfits.

150
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:57,999
I love it.

151
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,955
Are you trying to flatter me?

152
00:16:01,539 --> 00:16:03,816
I’m serious! Your outfit’s cute.

153
00:16:03,841 --> 00:16:06,230
It suits you well.
You look so hot and sexy!

154
00:16:06,586 --> 00:16:07,586
Thanks.

155
00:16:09,547 --> 00:16:10,730
Oh, by the way,

156
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:12,752
thanks for what you did last time.

157
00:16:12,926 --> 00:16:13,968
For what?

158
00:16:14,552 --> 00:16:16,429
For that drunk bastard.

159
00:16:17,527 --> 00:16:18,549
It’s alright.

160
00:16:18,574 --> 00:16:22,101
I’ve encountered lots of men
like those before with no boundaries.

161
00:16:22,126 --> 00:16:24,254
That’s why we girls
should stick together.

162
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:27,499
It’s nice you don’t feel weird
when men make a move on you.

163
00:16:27,524 --> 00:16:29,816
Well, maybe I just got used to it.

164
00:16:29,841 --> 00:16:32,855
And I’m very opinionated
so I call them out if I have to.

165
00:16:35,841 --> 00:16:37,847
Um, can I ask you something?

166
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:39,369
Yeah, what’s that?

167
00:16:40,058 --> 00:16:42,555
I noticed you kinda froze when...

168
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,499
that guy touched you.

169
00:16:44,816 --> 00:16:47,855
You know, men like those
should really be called out.

170
00:16:49,753 --> 00:16:53,590
Sometimes, I just
can’t help but freeze, or...

171
00:16:53,716 --> 00:16:55,844
be petrified when
somebody does that to me.

172
00:16:56,478 --> 00:16:57,478
Why’s that?

173
00:16:58,749 --> 00:17:01,085
Back then, a guy was courting me.

174
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,905
Then one night, him
and his friends got drunk.

175
00:17:05,186 --> 00:17:07,605
And he was forcing me
to sleep with him.

176
00:17:08,352 --> 00:17:09,958
It even got to the point where

177
00:17:09,983 --> 00:17:12,821
he kept touching me
even if I didn’t like it.

178
00:17:14,804 --> 00:17:17,395
But I was so drunk, I couldn’t do
anything about it.

179
00:17:19,117 --> 00:17:20,117
I’m sorry.

180
00:17:22,245 --> 00:17:23,663
Well, it didn’t get far.

181
00:17:23,688 --> 00:17:25,321
Candy came to the rescue.

182
00:17:26,499 --> 00:17:28,032
But since then,

183
00:17:28,071 --> 00:17:30,313
I stay away from guys
as much as I can.

184
00:17:31,421 --> 00:17:32,755
I’m sorry I asked.

185
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,993
No, it’s okay.

186
00:17:34,274 --> 00:17:37,026
I’m okay. I think I already
made peace with it.

187
00:17:37,051 --> 00:17:38,051
So...

188
00:17:39,137 --> 00:17:41,961
Yeah. I just stay away from men.

189
00:17:42,582 --> 00:17:44,917
Wait a sec. Are you saying...

190
00:17:45,226 --> 00:17:47,020
he was your first male suitor?

191
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:49,172
Were they all girls before?

192
00:17:51,516 --> 00:17:53,354
Oh, not really. But...

193
00:17:53,379 --> 00:17:55,289
I thought I was a tomboy back then.

194
00:17:55,486 --> 00:17:56,486
Is that so?

195
00:18:07,373 --> 00:18:09,667
But are you willing
to try it with a girl?

196
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,320
Try?

197
00:18:11,561 --> 00:18:13,396
Like, make out with a girl.

198
00:18:13,421 --> 00:18:15,269
Or have a girlfriend.

199
00:18:16,042 --> 00:18:17,206
Uh...

200
00:18:17,967 --> 00:18:19,636
I haven’t thought about that yet.

201
00:19:12,605 --> 00:19:13,940
Yes...

202
00:22:17,582 --> 00:22:18,582
I have a question.

203
00:22:19,292 --> 00:22:20,292
Yeah?

204
00:22:20,835 --> 00:22:22,086
Are you and Ace together?

205
00:22:23,171 --> 00:22:25,089
Oh, no. Just casual flings.

206
00:22:26,507 --> 00:22:27,758
So, you’re bi?

207
00:22:28,467 --> 00:22:29,468
Not really...

208
00:22:29,468 --> 00:22:30,553
I’m pansexual.

209
00:22:31,554 --> 00:22:32,554
What’s that?

210
00:22:33,639 --> 00:22:35,057
I don’t care about

211
00:22:35,082 --> 00:22:37,835
a person’s gender,
or sexual orientation.

212
00:22:38,186 --> 00:22:39,770
I like them for who they are,

213
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,022
not what they are.

214
00:22:41,606 --> 00:22:42,773
So,

215
00:22:42,773 --> 00:22:44,233
does that mean I’m a lesbian?

216
00:22:45,381 --> 00:22:47,307
Well, do you feel so?

217
00:22:47,613 --> 00:22:48,798
If I were you,

218
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,031
enjoy it.

219
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,158
Just let it be.

220
00:22:54,827 --> 00:22:56,110
Last question...

221
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,413
Why Ace?

222
00:22:57,955 --> 00:22:58,998
Why not?

223
00:22:59,707 --> 00:23:01,834
That guy’s just so full of himself.

224
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:04,419
We both...

225
00:23:04,795 --> 00:23:06,422
enjoy each other in bed.

226
00:23:07,173 --> 00:23:09,926
I’m just satisfying
my needs and wants.

227
00:23:09,951 --> 00:23:12,078
And good sex is one of them.

228
00:26:11,357 --> 00:26:12,775
Bestie? Cat?

229
00:26:14,735 --> 00:26:16,203
Let me in, please?

230
00:26:16,228 --> 00:26:18,271
I need to pee!

231
00:26:37,675 --> 00:26:39,093
My God!

232
00:27:18,632 --> 00:27:19,884
Denise?

233
00:27:19,884 --> 00:27:21,135
Good morning!

234
00:27:23,888 --> 00:27:25,181
What are you doing here?

235
00:27:25,493 --> 00:27:27,772
Nothing. I just wanted to see you.

236
00:27:29,935 --> 00:27:32,529
I got your address from Candy.

237
00:27:32,605 --> 00:27:33,898
I hope you don’t mind.

238
00:27:35,107 --> 00:27:36,400
I brought you food.

239
00:27:37,818 --> 00:27:38,986
Thank you.

240
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:47,161
Your house is gorgeous.

241
00:27:48,454 --> 00:27:49,639
Nice.

242
00:27:52,041 --> 00:27:53,709
Oh, how cute!

243
00:27:53,709 --> 00:27:56,604
You even have your very own DJ set up.

244
00:27:56,629 --> 00:28:00,256
Yeah. I use it to make
new beats, or something...

245
00:28:00,341 --> 00:28:01,634
Or when I just feel like it.

246
00:28:02,292 --> 00:28:03,292
Mhm.

247
00:28:03,662 --> 00:28:04,695
You know.

248
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,765
I’ve been wanting to learn
how to use one of these.

249
00:28:09,141 --> 00:28:10,684
Do you want me to teach you?

250
00:28:18,067 --> 00:28:19,527
You wear the headset first,

251
00:28:19,752 --> 00:28:23,255
then keep one ear open
to hear the current song.

252
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,615
Then the next song here...

253
00:28:24,949 --> 00:28:27,201
Just press the cue here and then...

254
00:34:25,996 --> 00:34:27,001
Hey.

255
00:34:27,026 --> 00:34:28,185
Your set’s done?

256
00:34:29,354 --> 00:34:30,354
Yeah.

257
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:33,600
Is it me...

258
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:36,532
or are you and Denise getting closer?

259
00:34:38,014 --> 00:34:39,014
Is that so?

260
00:34:42,451 --> 00:34:43,691
I didn't know you're a lesbian.

261
00:34:44,345 --> 00:34:45,345
What?

262
00:34:46,288 --> 00:34:47,408
You’re dating Denise, right?

263
00:34:49,583 --> 00:34:51,293
We haven’t talked about it.

264
00:34:52,085 --> 00:34:53,295
Ah, Classic Denise.

265
00:34:55,486 --> 00:34:56,486
What?

266
00:34:56,733 --> 00:34:57,775
What’s with Denise?

267
00:34:58,875 --> 00:34:59,875
Nothing, really.

268
00:35:01,053 --> 00:35:03,388
I see Denise still hasn't changed.

269
00:35:04,097 --> 00:35:07,684
Why don’t you just save it
and just tell me about her?

270
00:35:07,684 --> 00:35:09,019
Ask her yourself.

271
00:35:09,728 --> 00:35:11,563
You’re always together, aren’t you?

272
00:35:11,563 --> 00:35:13,899
Cut the crap. Just spit it out.

273
00:35:15,484 --> 00:35:17,006
With Denise...

274
00:35:17,167 --> 00:35:19,086
Well, you’re just on
the tip of the iceberg.

275
00:35:19,612 --> 00:35:21,513
That girl just likes to collect.

276
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:23,659
And leave in the morning.

277
00:35:24,117 --> 00:35:25,117
Like you?

278
00:35:25,911 --> 00:35:26,911
Nope.

279
00:35:27,996 --> 00:35:30,082
She's just one of my collections,

280
00:35:30,916 --> 00:35:32,334
not the other way around.

281
00:35:38,674 --> 00:35:39,674
See of.

282
00:38:48,312 --> 00:38:49,312
Hello?

283
00:39:17,086 --> 00:39:18,086
Such a flirt.

284
00:39:18,213 --> 00:39:19,589
Is that so?

285
00:39:19,766 --> 00:39:20,766
Come on.

286
00:39:24,383 --> 00:39:25,414
Oh?

287
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,780
Why aren't you with Denise?

288
00:39:27,984 --> 00:39:29,175
Lovers' quarrel?

289
00:39:29,432 --> 00:39:30,558
Huh? No.

290
00:39:30,819 --> 00:39:31,819
But where is she?

291
00:39:33,069 --> 00:39:34,336
Beats me.

292
00:39:34,361 --> 00:39:35,855
Yup. Lover's quarrel.

293
00:39:36,242 --> 00:39:38,124
Babe, stop teasing.

294
00:39:38,149 --> 00:39:39,234
I’m just asking.

295
00:39:39,259 --> 00:39:40,301
Relax.

296
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,321
But really...

297
00:39:43,529 --> 00:39:44,572
Did you two fight?

298
00:39:45,323 --> 00:39:46,323
No, we didn't.

299
00:39:46,725 --> 00:39:47,725
So?

300
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:50,168
What’s with the sour face then?

301
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:54,016
I heard her and Ace...

302
00:39:54,874 --> 00:39:55,874
Heard what?

303
00:39:56,251 --> 00:39:57,585
Them having sex?

304
00:39:59,407 --> 00:40:00,520
- Yeah.
- Huh?

305
00:40:00,665 --> 00:40:02,751
But I thought they’re just messing around?

306
00:40:05,447 --> 00:40:06,636
I don’t even know.

307
00:40:06,661 --> 00:40:08,494
I thought they were over.

308
00:40:08,942 --> 00:40:13,269
Makes sense why Ace was running his mouth
about Denise the other day.

309
00:40:14,188 --> 00:40:18,002
Honestly, we know Denise
is really that kind of person.

310
00:40:18,468 --> 00:40:19,719
She likes messing around.

311
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:22,556
Has she told you
that you two are exclusive?

312
00:40:30,326 --> 00:40:32,245
- How are you?
- I’m okay.

313
00:41:03,478 --> 00:41:05,217
Oh, Kat. You’re here.

314
00:41:06,087 --> 00:41:07,907
What were you and Ace talking about?

315
00:41:09,253 --> 00:41:10,540
Nothing. Why?

316
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,834
Is there something between you two?

317
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,130
What are you talking about?

318
00:41:25,428 --> 00:41:27,931
I heard the two of you
having sex the other day.

319
00:41:29,723 --> 00:41:33,005
I was calling your phone and I guess
you accidentally picked up.

320
00:41:33,219 --> 00:41:34,219
I heard everything.

321
00:41:34,945 --> 00:41:35,945
Okay?

322
00:41:35,983 --> 00:41:37,568
Sorry, you heard that.

323
00:41:37,593 --> 00:41:38,619
But...

324
00:41:38,644 --> 00:41:41,278
there’s nothing wrong
with what we’re doing.

325
00:41:41,303 --> 00:41:42,303
Like...

326
00:41:42,475 --> 00:41:44,333
We’re both consenting adults.

327
00:41:45,021 --> 00:41:46,085
Nothing?

328
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:48,122
So I’m just another plaything for you?

329
00:41:49,386 --> 00:41:50,669
Do I look like a toy?

330
00:41:51,643 --> 00:41:53,278
Whenever you feel like playing with me,

331
00:41:53,873 --> 00:41:55,138
you’ll show up immediately?

332
00:41:55,163 --> 00:41:56,471
But when you get bored,

333
00:41:56,496 --> 00:41:57,747
you look for another one?

334
00:42:06,169 --> 00:42:07,879
Kat, you’re important to me.

335
00:42:10,932 --> 00:42:14,269
It’s just that I like
having sex with Ace.

336
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,289
You know how it is.
I sometimes crave for a man’s touch.

337
00:42:18,684 --> 00:42:20,144
But it doesn’t mean anything.

338
00:42:21,562 --> 00:42:22,563
Listen to me, Kat.

339
00:42:26,185 --> 00:42:28,323
I understand if you’re mad.

340
00:42:28,552 --> 00:42:30,387
But I hope you get where I’m coming from.

341
00:42:32,198 --> 00:42:34,033
And I’m really hoping

342
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,030
we can still see each other.

343
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:39,068
But I totally get it if...

344
00:42:39,093 --> 00:42:40,552
this is a deal-breaker for you.

345
00:42:41,853 --> 00:42:42,853
Fine then.

346
00:42:43,662 --> 00:42:44,680
Okay.

347
00:42:44,705 --> 00:42:48,376
Just don’t tell me
if you’re gonna meet up with somebody.

348
00:42:49,889 --> 00:42:52,517
I know that’s how you are
when I met you.

349
00:42:52,563 --> 00:42:55,646
And we never really talked
about being exclusive.

350
00:42:55,742 --> 00:42:57,577
Just please, keep it to yourself.

351
00:47:42,925 --> 00:47:43,925
Hello?

352
00:47:44,427 --> 00:47:46,137
Hey, cat!

353
00:47:46,344 --> 00:47:48,055
Come to the bar later, okay?

354
00:47:48,764 --> 00:47:49,764
What’s up?

355
00:47:51,225 --> 00:47:52,435
We’re having

356
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:53,919
a mini celebration.

357
00:47:55,712 --> 00:47:56,813
Just a small gathering.

358
00:47:58,357 --> 00:48:00,735
Ace is opening another branch.

359
00:48:03,779 --> 00:48:04,779
Really now?

360
00:48:05,823 --> 00:48:06,823
Yeah.

361
00:48:07,074 --> 00:48:08,074
So...

362
00:48:08,242 --> 00:48:09,493
I’ll see you later, okay?

363
00:48:10,661 --> 00:48:11,662
Okay, okay.

364
00:48:19,795 --> 00:48:21,464
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

365
00:48:25,234 --> 00:48:27,069
Bro, we’ll go ahead, alright?

366
00:48:27,094 --> 00:48:29,747
- What? It’s still early.
- You know how it is.

367
00:48:29,772 --> 00:48:32,020
- Let’s go.
- That son of a gun.

368
00:49:37,289 --> 00:49:38,958
Hey! What the hell?

369
00:49:39,881 --> 00:49:41,466
We’re just having fun!

370
00:49:41,491 --> 00:49:42,545
Yeah, Kat.

371
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:44,906
Having fun?

372
00:49:45,773 --> 00:49:48,484
You know how weird I feel around guys,
especially with Ace.

373
00:49:48,509 --> 00:49:49,509
Kat, come on!

374
00:49:49,802 --> 00:49:50,970
Quit being a baby.

375
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:52,596
It’s just sex!

376
00:49:52,596 --> 00:49:53,848
It’s not a big deal!

377
00:49:54,098 --> 00:49:55,349
Denise, what the hell?

378
00:49:55,741 --> 00:49:58,035
You know how I feel
every time I see a guy,

379
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:59,603
or when they touch me,

380
00:50:00,271 --> 00:50:01,772
I’m still not comfortable.

381
00:50:04,024 --> 00:50:05,025
You guys have fun.

382
00:50:05,901 --> 00:50:07,194
Kat! Wait!

383
00:50:07,862 --> 00:50:08,862
Kat, wait!

384
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:11,699
I trusted you!

385
00:50:12,132 --> 00:50:13,759
And you expect me to do this?

386
00:50:13,784 --> 00:50:15,411
What do you mean?
With Ace?

387
00:50:15,734 --> 00:50:18,444
This is nothing
but meaningless sex.

388
00:50:18,831 --> 00:50:19,999
Not for me.

389
00:50:22,775 --> 00:50:24,522
Is this all I am to you?

390
00:50:25,504 --> 00:50:27,288
I thought I was important to you?

391
00:50:27,506 --> 00:50:29,295
You are important to me!

392
00:50:29,514 --> 00:50:30,550
What’s this then?

393
00:50:30,693 --> 00:50:33,112
I’m just showing you
why I like doing this,

394
00:50:33,137 --> 00:50:34,913
so you’d understand me.

395
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:38,022
But you’re getting all riled up again.

396
00:50:38,075 --> 00:50:39,451
Who wouldn’t be mad?

397
00:50:39,476 --> 00:50:41,770
Denise, you know what happened to me.

398
00:50:42,479 --> 00:50:44,064
I thought that was a long time ago?

399
00:50:44,089 --> 00:50:45,633
You already made peace with it.

400
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:50,053
Yes, that happened long ago.
But that doesn’t mean it’s okay for me.

401
00:50:50,759 --> 00:50:53,897
Everything comes back to me.
Everytime a guys touches me,

402
00:50:54,142 --> 00:50:55,602
everything’s bad again.

403
00:50:58,047 --> 00:50:59,498
That's how you all are!

404
00:50:59,708 --> 00:51:01,522
Just because it didn't happen to you.

405
00:51:03,092 --> 00:51:04,543
You won't believe that it's true.

406
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:06,962
I’m sorry, Kat.

407
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:09,130
Wait.

408
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:34,876
What are you doing here?

409
00:52:34,995 --> 00:52:36,458
Please, can we talk?

410
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:37,678
Not now, Denise.

411
00:52:40,389 --> 00:52:41,473
I’m sorry.

412
00:52:41,498 --> 00:52:43,083
I just really wanna say sorry.

413
00:52:44,864 --> 00:52:47,028
I realized what I did was wrong.

414
00:52:47,229 --> 00:52:48,397
I’m sorry.

415
00:52:49,168 --> 00:52:51,762
I was being reckless and insensitive.

416
00:52:52,526 --> 00:52:53,755
To be honest,

417
00:52:54,139 --> 00:52:55,653
I’m scared of commitments.

418
00:52:55,688 --> 00:52:58,223
Then I started to have feelings for you,

419
00:52:58,443 --> 00:53:00,153
and my fear went back.

420
00:53:01,577 --> 00:53:02,703
There you are again.

421
00:53:02,728 --> 00:53:04,731
You tell me I’m special,

422
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,743
then you do that shit again.

423
00:53:07,419 --> 00:53:09,004
Kat, I’m serious.

424
00:53:10,364 --> 00:53:13,158
I was being serious when
I said you’re special to me.

425
00:53:13,448 --> 00:53:15,658
That’s why I did those stupid things.

426
00:53:16,172 --> 00:53:17,882
Love can make you stupid.

427
00:53:17,968 --> 00:53:19,261
Did you know that?

428
00:53:20,971 --> 00:53:23,122
But what about that thing you said...

429
00:53:23,265 --> 00:53:25,559
sometimes, you crave for a man’s touch?

430
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,227
I’ll manage.

431
00:53:27,644 --> 00:53:28,896
As long as we’re together.

432
00:53:44,286 --> 00:53:45,913
Will you forgive me, please?

433
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:49,625
Are you sure?

434
00:53:50,205 --> 00:53:52,122
Because once you’re in, you’re in.

435
00:53:52,328 --> 00:53:54,403
You know I have trust issues.

436
00:53:55,487 --> 00:53:56,864
This time, I’m sure.

437
00:53:57,028 --> 00:53:58,550
I’m really, really sure.
