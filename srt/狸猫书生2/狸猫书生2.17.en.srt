1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,800
The

2
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,400
As long as the complete evidence chain is formed,

3
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,880
even without the body, the police can also make a case.

4
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,160
Through the evidence we found,

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,480
and his motive for the murder,

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,160
we can find out the truth.

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,840
Are you sure?

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,280
After seven days,

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,760
we can prove the murderer.

10
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,480
Tonight,

11
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,000
it's finally going to end.

12
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,640
What's your plan after the trial?

13
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,040
Your swimming,

14
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,640
and the waves,

15
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,240
can you give me a share?

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,720
No problem.

17
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,160
I also want to see how big the world is,

18
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,400
and how fun it is.

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,800
I've been locked up for a thousand years.

20
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,400
I'm suffocating. Who locked you up?

21
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,920
A thousand years ago, the Qing Mountain Academy.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,520
Actually, it's not a big deal.

23
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,720
I just did something bad

24
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,720
and got locked up in a cave by a kid.

25
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,720
This is where I woke up.

26
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,160
A sugar-coated fox is a good idea.

27
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,720
Yes.

28
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,720
You've seen it too?

29
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,800
It said...

30
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,120
A thousand years later,

31
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,920
the noble man is back.

32
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,600
Look.

33
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,600
They're starting to panic.

34
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,120
YouTubers,

35
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,220
you kids have been here years ago.

36
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,320
How even some of these holes are too narrow?

37
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,460
Who knows?

38
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,500
They could be human inside.

39
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,320
No wonder you're a fucking idiot.

40
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,000
Just a idiot?

41
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,480
Say you're a simple little king at first.

42
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,120
If I'm called a stupid man,

43
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,120
they'll make fun of me for being a shitty king.

44
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,120
You're so good at this.

45
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,120
You almost caught up with me.

46
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,520
It should be said that

47
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,720
we cooperated well.

48
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,120
Now,

49
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,520
we should get the evidence

50
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,520
and set off.

51
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,120
Shen Goyen

52
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,720
What?

53
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,720
There is someone.

54
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,920
Two.

55
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,120
Can you see them?

56
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,920
What?

57
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,960
One more shot.

58
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:23,800
No.

59
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,360
What if the evidence is broken?

60
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,760
Let's go.

61
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,960
Time's up.

62
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,440
Everything is ready.

63
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,760
Let's go.

64
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,080
Let's go.

65
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,960
Let's go.

66
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,000
Mr. Wang.

67
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,400
Long time no see.

68
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,960
Give me the evidence.

69
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,120
Don't struggle.

70
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,360
You can't escape.

71
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,320
Escape?

72
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,120
Do we need to escape now?

73
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,880
Mr. Wang.

74
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,840
You don't need this immortal soul.

75
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,560
Go and get the evidence.

76
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,440
It must beashio.

77
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,080
How do you know about Bravo?

78
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,520
Online board group.

79
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,280
Bravo can restore it for me.

80
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,600
Don't worry about it.

81
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,640
How can you kill a dying person who has Ñ€ Buddh?

82
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,960
There's a prime pued not deadurry.

83
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,960
It's really interesting.

84
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,960
Since you know that Ling Long Xing won't die,

85
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,960
then you know it's useless.

86
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,960
Really?

87
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,960
But the thing that's stuck on my knife

88
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,960
is the blood of the knife man.

89
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,960
Ling Long Xing won't die or get old.

90
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,960
Only his own blood can kill.

91
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,960
This is the place where the blood of the knife man was hidden.

92
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,960
When the pain is in the eyes of the autumn flowers,

93
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,960
I will remove all the mistakes.

94
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,960
Waiting for a light to light up the frost.

95
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,960
I still remember the past.

96
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,960
The heart beats and the smile is in my hands.

97
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,960
Wandering for a thousand years,

98
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,960
I look back once again.

99
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,960
Waiting for a light to light up the past.

100
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:41,960
I was finally able to say goodbye at the end of the night.

101
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,960
I finally walked out of the wall I had forgotten.

102
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,960
I will be by your side when there is no more waves.
