Episode 1

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I came today

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
to bring you

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
a great news.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What is it?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The appearance of the Spirit Dragon Heart.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You know about the Spirit Dragon Heart?

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Not only do I know about the Spirit Dragon Heart,

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I also know

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
that if a demon is aware of the cultivation of the flying body,

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
if the demon is aware of the injury,

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
it will destroy its body.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What do you want?

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I want to make a new deal

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
with the Lord of the Gods.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
What deal?

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
How can I trust you?

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The Spirit Dragon Heart,

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
the mortal can revive in the second time.

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It can improve the cultivation of the Lord of the Gods.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's useless to me.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Why should I deceive the Lord of the Gods?

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What deal do you want?

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I help the Lord of the Gods to get the Spirit Dragon Heart.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I want to change

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
the skin of a young student.

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
For example, Taosheng.

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
His strategy is enough to sacrifice the Hanlin Garden.

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
By then, the Marquis will be the Prime Minister.

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
All the beauties should have it.

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's luxurious and rich.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's not easy to think of it.

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's not easy.

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
With this Spirit Dragon Heart,

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
the Lord of the Gods can cultivate the flying body

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and become a fairy.

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Well said.

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Do you know where the Spirit Dragon Heart is?

40
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
In the academy.

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I believe the one who doesn't marry

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
can help the Lord of the Gods.

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The best time to get the Spirit Dragon Heart

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
is the night of the full moon.

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
If you really want to make a deal,

46
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
hurry up.

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Lord of the Gods,

48
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
wait for my good news.

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The Lord of the Gods

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You know that Taosheng is the one who has the Spirit Dragon Heart.

51
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Why did you agree to make a deal?

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Is it safe if I don't want it?

53
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You...

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I don't need you to care about how I act.

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Taosheng is not the one.

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Is it the one who can't be the one?

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
No matter what,

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
the Spirit Dragon Heart

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
must be mine.

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Tomorrow is the night of the full moon.

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Do you know how to deal with the fake boss?

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
How does my deal with him

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
have anything to do with you?

64
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We both know that

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Taosheng is the one who has the Spirit Dragon Heart.

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You promised me that you wouldn't hurt him.

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Or do you want the Spirit Dragon Heart too?

68
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You also know that

69
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
if you have the spirit,

70
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
your cultivation will be very good.

71
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm sure the Spirit Dragon Heart

72
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
is very virtuous.

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You can't hurt him.

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
If you do this,

75
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'll destroy my body

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and let you lose your soul.

77
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Then I'll change my clothes.

78
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
If I really want to hurt him,

79
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
do you think you can threaten me?

80
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What should I do?

81
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You have a contract with the boss.

82
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You can't hurt him.

83
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
If the boss finds out that

84
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Taosheng is the one who has the Spirit Dragon Heart,

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
then...

86
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That's what I'm worried about.

87
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Taosheng is too pure.

88
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
He doesn't know

89
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
what kind of danger he's in.

90
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
He doesn't know

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
what kind of cunning person

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
he trusts so much.

93
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's time to let him know the truth.

94
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I don't need you to teach me how to do it.

95
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Slow down.

96
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The door is locked.

97
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Brother Liu,

98
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
what's wrong with you?

99
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Mountain...

100
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Mountain...

101
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I don't know why,

102
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
but he suddenly asked me questions.

103
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
If you can't answer,

104
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
you'll be punished.

105
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You'll be beaten to death.

106
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You'll be beaten to death.

107
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You're always merciful.

108
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You care for your students.

109
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
How could you do this?

110
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
How could I know?

111
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Brother Tao,

112
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Brother Wang,

113
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm leaving.

114
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Slow down.

115
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
My butt.

116
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Brother Wang,

117
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
why did you say that?

118
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You like to check the truth, don't you?

119
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Since you don't understand,

120
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
check it yourself.

121
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Brother Tao,

122
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm leaving.

123
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Slow down.

124
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
My butt.

125
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Brother Tao,

126
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm leaving.

127
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Slow down.

128
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
My butt.

129
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Brother Tao,

130
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm leaving.

131
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Slow down.

132
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
My butt.

133
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Brother Tao,

134
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm leaving.

135
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Slow down.

136
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
My butt.

137
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Brother Tao,

138
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm leaving.

139
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Slow down.

140
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
My butt.

141
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Brother Tao,

142
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm leaving.

143
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Slow down.

144
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
My butt.

145
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Brother Tao,

146
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm leaving.

147
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Slow down.

148
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
My butt.

149
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Slow down.

150
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
My butt.

151
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Slow down.

152
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
My butt.

153
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Slow down.

154
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
My butt.

155
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Slow down.

156
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
My butt.

157
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Slow down.

158
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
My butt.

159
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Slow down.

160
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000

161
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Slow down.

162
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000

Slow down.

166

Slow down.

168

Slow down.

180
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Slow down.

181
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Slow down.

182
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Slow down.

183
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Slow down.

184
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Slow down.

185
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Slow down.

186
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Slow down.

187
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Slow down.

188
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Slow down.

189
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Slow down.

190
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Slow down.

191
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Slow down.

192
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000

194
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Slow down.

195
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Slow down.

196
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Slow down.

197
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Slow down.

198
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Slow down.

199
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Slow down.

200
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Slow down.

201
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Slow down.

202
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Slow down.

203
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Slow down.

204
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Slow down.

205
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Slow down.

206
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Slow down.

207
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Let us witness the years of hardship,

208
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
let us not spend our lives against them.

209
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Fresh shelter from the waves,

210
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
let us band together with strength.

211
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
If we are not tamed or sl hombre,

212
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
let us be never festivals again.
