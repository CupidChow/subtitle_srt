00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,580
[(The

00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:19,180
Shallow

3
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,180
Wang Hao-zhi

4
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,620
Wang Hao-zhi

00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,800
Dearchin

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,820
Wang Hao-zhi

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:28,980
Oh No

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:29,500
Wang Hao-zhi

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,500
I'm glad you're fine.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,500
Did you fail?

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,500
You tried your best just now, but you still got back to Wang Haozhi.

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,500
I was so close to it.

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,500
No. If you leave her body, you'll be in a state of panic.

14
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,500
I know.

15
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,500
Then you still...

16
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,500
If we return her body,

17
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,500
then Wang Haozhi will never be able to learn again.

18
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,500
In short, the truth is important. Your life is more important.

19
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,500
Let's go back to 2025. There will be other ways.

20
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,500
You've thought it through.

21
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,500
I've thought it through.

22
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,500
You can only stay for two hours. How much time do you have left?

23
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,500
One hour.

24
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,500
Wait for me at the library. I have something to do.

25
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,500
Wait.

26
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,500
You don't ask me what I'm going to do.

27
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,500
I believe you.

28
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,500
The End

29
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,500
My ability has been restored. What's going on?

30
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,500
I don't care. I'll use my way to solve this.

31
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,500
I'll use my way to solve this.

32
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,500
Wang Haozhi, are you dead?

33
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,500
Even if you're still alive, it's enough.

34
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,500
It's over. Let me go.

35
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,500
Be at ease.

36
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,500
I'm not at ease.

37
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,500
I'm not at ease.

38
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,500
You're alive.

39
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,500
How can I be at ease?

40
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,500
No, no, no, no.

41
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,500
You're a ghost.

42
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,500
Let's wait until you become a ghost.

43
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,500
Don't kill me!

44
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,500
I'll kill you all at once.

45
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,500
I'll use my power to beat you.

46
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,500
Don't kill me!

47
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,500
I have a reason.

48
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,500
I have a reason.

49
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,500
I'm in trouble.

50
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,500
My heart is about to break.

51
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,500
Wang, Wang, listen to me.

52
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,500
I have a reason.

53
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,500
My mom had a surgery.

54
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,500
I had no choice but to take money from a student.

55
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,500
That's why I couldn't tell her about the interview.

56
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,500
So you're going to kill me to kill me?

57
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,500
You'll come back as a ghost.

58
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,500
Do you have a wish to fulfill?

59
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,500
I can kick you.

60
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,500
Liu Wanzhou,

61
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,500
you not only pushed me down the cliff,

62
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,500
you even tried to bury me.

63
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,500
You even committed a fatal crime.

64
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,500
You're so cruel.

65
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,500
What fatal crime? I didn't!

66
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,500
I was impulsive and pushed you down the cliff.

67
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,500
I still regret it.

68
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,500
You still want to talk?

69
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,500
That pen.

70
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,500
What pen?

71
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,500
The best teacher and employee in 2005.

72
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,500
Only you.

73
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,500
I remember it now.

74
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,500
It's a pen.

75
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,500
I gave the pen to Qi Bin.

76
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,500
Who?

77
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,500
You said it was Qi Bin.

78
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,500
You're...

79
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,500
Tao Ran,

80
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,500
Liu's favorite student.

81
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,500
This student is...

82
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,500
He's the same as you.

83
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,500
He's my student.

84
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,500
He has a tough background.

85
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,500
I think it's always good to be close.

86
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,500
So I gave him the pen.

87
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,500
I gave it to him in front of everyone.

88
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,500
The whole class can testify.

89
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,500
So the student who bribed you

90
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,500
is him?

91
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,500
Yes.

92
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,500
Does he know

93
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,500
that I have your evidence?

94
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,500
I did tell him.

95
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,500
But I just want to see if he can

96
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,500
get this done.

97
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,500
What else do you want?

98
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,500
It's gone.

99
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,500
It's gone.

100
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,500
You scared me.

101
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,500
How is it?

102
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,500
I went to Liu Wanzhou.

103
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,500
I killed him.

104
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,500
What?

105
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,500
I found that I couldn't kill him.

106
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,500
It's like

107
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,500
a mysterious force is stopping me.

108
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,500
But I know who the real murderer is.

109
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,500
I have a new clue.

110
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,500
Look.

111
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,500
A fire broke out

112
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,500
in the dormitory of Qingshan University.

113
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,500
A male student who returned to school

114
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,500
early died.

115
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,500
We don't have much time.

116
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,500
We can only stay for two hours.

117
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,500
We can talk about it after we go back for two or five years.

118
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,500
We have found the rules of the school.

119
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,500
This is a library.

120
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,500
We need to go there.

121
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,500
After seven days,

122
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,500
we have a lot of things to do.

123
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,500
I'm going to the library.

124
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,500
I'm going to the library.

125
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,500
I'm going to the library.

126
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,500
I'm going to the library.

127
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,500
I'm going to the library.

128
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,500
I'm going to the library.

129
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,500
I'm going to the library.

130
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,500
I'm going to the library.

131
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,500
I'm going to the library.

132
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,500
I'm going to the library.

133
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,500
I'm going to the library.

134
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,500
I'm going to the library.

135
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,500
I'm going to the library.

136
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,500
I'm going to the library.

137
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,500
I'm going to the library.

138
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,500
I'm going to the library.

139
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,500
I'm going to the library.

140
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,500
I'm going to the library.

141
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,500
I'm going to the library.

142
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,500
I'm going to the library.

143
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,500
I'm going to the library.

144
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,500
I'm going to the library.

145
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,500
I'm going to the library.

146
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,500
I'm going to the library.

147
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,500
The moon is over the mountains.

148
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:18,500
The heart beats and the smile is in my hands.

149
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,500
I wander around with my heart.

150
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,500
I look back once again.

151
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:28,500
I wait for the light to bury the past.

152
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,500
I was finally able to say goodbye to the end.

153
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:38,500
I finally walked out of the wall I had forgotten.

154
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:44,500
I will be by your side when there is no more waves.
