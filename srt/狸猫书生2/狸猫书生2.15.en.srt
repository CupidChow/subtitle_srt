Episode 1

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,400
Now we know Zhou Sheng is the murderer.

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,120
But Fan Shutong is dead.

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,120
And he has been caught for all crimes.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,120
There is no evidence.

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,560
Even if he is guilty,

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,000
he will leave a flaw.

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,960
But I don't understand.

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,800
When Lord Zhang died,

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,800
Zhou Sheng was with us.

12
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,600
How did he do it?

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,880
Chai Sheng, go to eat.

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,240
Brother Tao.

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,040
Sorry.

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,240
I mistook you.

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:43,600
Liu Sheng.

18
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,400
Even Brother Tao is mistaken.

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,400
We all wear school uniforms.

20
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,760
From the background,

21
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,120
it's normal to be mistaken.

22
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:53,880
Lord Zhang.

23
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,680
You are a man of three levels.

24
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,080
Lord Zhang

25
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,480
is probably not convinced.

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:01,920
Yes.

27
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,600
From the background,

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,240
it's normal to be mistaken.

29
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,040
Brother Tao, what's wrong?

30
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:07,800
Brother Wang.

31
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,160
I have an idea.

32
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,120
Mountain Chief.

33
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:15,760
Mountain Chief.

34
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,200
Childe Chu.

35
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,680
It's so noisy.

36
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,680
Childe Chu.

37
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,440
Where is Mountain Chief?

38
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,720
I have something to report.

39
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,040
Mountain Chief is asleep.

40
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,360
What do you want to tell me?

41
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,520
Childe Chu.

42
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,880
Tao Sheng and Wang Sheng

43
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,720
insisted on leaving the hospital.

44
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,720
I told them

45
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,760
that the mountain chief gave an order

46
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,080
that no one is allowed to leave the hospital.

47
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,440
They didn't listen to me.

48
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,360
They couldn't stop me.

49
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,800
Did they say anything?

50
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,120
They said

51
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,720
they found the real murderer.

52
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,840
What murderer?

53
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,280
Fan Shu Tong

54
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,520
has committed suicide for the crime.

55
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,320
Yes.

56
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,440
I don't know either.

57
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,120
Childe Tao said

58
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,760
he found the key evidence.

59
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,640
And Lord Zhang's clothes.

60
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,480
I don't understand.

61
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:53,960
Okay.

62
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,160
Since they insist on doing this,

63
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,440
let them go.

64
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,240
Go back now.

65
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:00,680
Yes.

66
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,760
Zhou Sheng didn't come after us.

67
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,360
Did you make a mistake?

68
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,720
I won't.

69
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,600
That means

70
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,800
he doesn't believe you got Zhang Nan's clothes.

71
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,000
Then we can only bet.

72
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,040
You finally show up.

73
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:27,960
Zhou Xiu.

74
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,920
Why don't you show yourself?

75
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,960
I'm not good at

76
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,560
playing with you.

77
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,920
It's really Zhou Sheng.

78
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,720
It's really Zhou Sheng.

79
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:29,960
Brother Tao.

80
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,560
I've been wondering

81
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,200
when you started to suspect me.

82
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,400
Since you were particularly concerned

83
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,240
about the emperor's whereabouts.

84
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,640
I'm there.

85
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,240
Go after him.

86
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,320
What did he say to you?

87
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,880
He didn't have time to say it.

88
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,200
So you came here.

89
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,040
What do you mean?

90
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,400
When you were dead,

91
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,880
I was with you.

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,720
You have no reason to suspect me.

93
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,680
This day

94
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,920
really troubled me.

95
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,320
It even affected my judgment.

96
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,200
But until Liu Sheng recognized the wrong person,

97
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,960
I was in a big trouble.

98
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,800
What do you mean?

99
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,440
Because what we saw in the exam room that day

100
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,280
was not Lord Zhang at all.

101
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,800
It was you who was wearing Lord Zhang's clothes.

102
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,560
You're so smart.

103
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,800
You deliberately aroused our attention.

104
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,520
When we saw that back,

105
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,560
we thought it was Lord Zhang.

106
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,400
Then you put on the student uniform

107
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,960
and got into the student's bed.

108
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,320
I still don't understand.

109
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,440
What about Lord Zhang?

110
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,160
I don't understand.

111
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,880
Lord Zhang was killed by Zhou Sheng

112
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,200
before he met with him.

113
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,000
Then he disguised as Lord Zhang

114
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,960
to make everyone think

115
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,560
Lord Zhang was killed during the meeting.

116
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,040
He was suspected once.

117
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,720
This is all your speculation.

118
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,760
Without evidence,

119
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,160
why would Zhou Sheng admit it?

120
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,440
Because he was guilty of being a thief.

121
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,880
When he heard that I found Lord Zhang's clothes

122
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,360
and was about to report it to the government,

123
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,400
he wanted to kill me.

124
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,360
You lied to me.

125
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,320
You have no evidence at all.

126
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,800
That's right.

127
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,360
I was just reading.

128
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,040
I bet you wouldn't dare to have the lucky luggage.

129
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,160
Now,

130
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,880
you can tell me why you killed Lord Zhang.

131
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,480
Lord Zhang sold the student's theory

132
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,840
and threatened to kill the old criminal.

133
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,760
Shouldn't he kill him?

134
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,480
You didn't kill him.

135
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,880
Lord Zhang was guilty of selling the theory.

136
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,680
You could have reported it to the government.

137
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,880
Why did you kill him?

138
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,280
Did you do it on purpose

139
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,320
or are you trying to cover up for someone?

140
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,400
I didn't cover up for anyone.

141
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,840
Lord Zhang

142
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,680
found out about the imperial family.

143
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,720
He threatened me

144
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,080
and asked me to sell the theory.

145
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,840
I was a scholar.

146
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,200
I know the pain of being in the cold for ten years.

147
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,960
I don't want to be threatened by him.

148
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,680
I can only kill him.

149
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,760
Don't write the murderer's prophecy

150
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,440
and spread the word to Mao Yao.

151
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,280
What about the emperor?

152
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,440
He's just a scholar.

153
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,560
He's not a villain.

154
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,440
How could you do that?

155
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,680
I don't want to kill the innocent.

156
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,200
I don't want to kill the emperor.

157
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,880
I just locked him up.

158
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,600
Lord Zhang found out about the emperor

159
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,160
and was taken out by the emperor.

160
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,680
Lord Zhang, save me.

161
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,600
Lord Zhang, save me.

162
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,800
Of course I want to save you.

163
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,120
You're the one who's suffering.

164
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,960
You're not even willing to

165
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,080
bargain with me

166
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,160
even if you're old-fashioned.

167
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,960
Stop it.

168
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,920
Lord Zhang,

169
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,120
you can't let him go.

170
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,320
So you're involved.

171
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,360
Put down your gun.

172
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,960
It's good for you.

173
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,720
It's good for you.

174
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,920
Put it down.

175
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,520
Put it down.

176
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,440
Right.

177
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,440
Right.

178
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,080
Put it down.

179
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,680
Put it down.

180
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,240
Put it down.

181
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,800
Put it down.

182
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,440
Put it down.

183
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,000
Put it down.

184
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,000
Right.

185
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,440
Put it down.

186
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,680
Since he escaped,

187
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,920
how did you find him?

188
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,320
After I brought

189
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,840
my sister to the academy from the mountain,

190
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,640
I knew

191
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,480
the emperor would never

192
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,120
let her sister die in vain.

193
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,120
It's good

194
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,600
to take this chance to threaten the emperor.

195
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,880
Lord Zhang,

196
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,520
go after him.

197
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,920
Go.

198
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,480
Young Master,

199
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,320
we've been looking everywhere.

200
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,760
Let's go back first.

201
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,000
Yes.

202
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:29,960
Your Majesty,

203
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,200
I know you're here.

204
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,120
Are you going to hide here forever?

205
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,320
Don't forget

206
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,080
your sister is still in the academy.

207
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,080
Are you going to let her die?

208
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,720
I agree.

209
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,000
Your Majesty.

210
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,520
Let my sister die.

211
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,440
I'll change my life.

212
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,360
I promise you.

213
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,240
Besides,

214
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,080
let me see her one last time.

215
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,760
I will.

216
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,760
You killed him.

217
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,760
You kept saying that you don't want to kill the Wuguli.

218
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,760
Why are you after me and His Majesty today?

219
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,760
Is it because we found you?

220
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,760
One wrong step, one wrong step.

221
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,760
Now everyone in the Academy knows your crime.

222
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,760
You are the one who killed him.

223
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,760
Now everyone in the Academy knows your crime.

224
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,760
You are the one who killed everyone.

225
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,760
Zhou Xiu, turn around.

226
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,760
I can't go back. I can't go back.

227
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,760
I can't go back.

228

I can't go back.

240
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,760
I can't go back.

241
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,760
I can't go back.

242
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,760

I can't go back.

248
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,760
I can't go back.

249
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,760
I can't go back.

250
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,760
I can't go back.

251
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,760
I can't go back.

I can't go back.

255
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,760
Young people in the world are as free as the wind.

256
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,760
The waves are gentle like the stars.
