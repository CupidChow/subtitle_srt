The King's Avatar

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,040
I didn't expect that the chief is a demon

3
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,680
The chief may not be a demon

4
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,440
Maybe someone used the chief's leather bag

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,040
There is such a secret book since ancient times

6
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,440
If it's true

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,160
Who will it be?

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,200
Think about it

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,440
When did the chief go to the back mountain?

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,920
Rumor has it

11
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,320
Li Wude was hurt by the demon blood

12
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,560
If the chief is like you

13
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,760
He doesn't believe in the demon blood

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,840
Why does he do that?

15
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,160
I see

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,480
I see

17
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,040
So at that time

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,520
He is not the real chief

19
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,000
But Li Wude

20
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,880
Not stupid

21
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,600
In this case

22
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,920
We must expose the real face of the fake chief

23
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,520
Then you tell me

24
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,680
How to expose it without evidence?

25
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,200
Look at you

26
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,200
You must have figured out a solution

27
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,520
Of course

28
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,560
What the chief just said

29
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,160
You dare tell him

30
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,320
Double check

31
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,960
Mr. Wang

32
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,800
As a third family

33
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,480
What have you told Li Wude?

34
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,680
Yes

35
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,000
Reg Чcons

36
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,240
Wait a moment

37
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,040
Don't get connected

38
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,640
Security

39
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,680
Hold on

40
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,800
You didn't tell him

41
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,000
I told him

42
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:53,600
에는

43
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,640
iren

44
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,240
Deprived

45
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:09,960
Lazy

46
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,720
Now that you didn't join the council

47
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,560
I am usually interested in helping

48
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,840
However, the other party is

49
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,760
far more important

50
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,960
Let him go.

51
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,240
I didn't think

52
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,280
you were just a humane student.

53
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,240
And when someone has children well worth touffy nights,

54
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,280
they are misbehaving,

55
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,720
What theximMyleas taught me

56
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,200
is that either students or horse manipulated into ruling demands nothing

57
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,680
As the Lead Learner, I would like to

58
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,720
give my advice to my students.

59
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,760
There is absolutely nothing that can be done about this.

60
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,760
The fake chief told me that the academy is difficult to maintain and use.

61
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,760
He even hid a lot of these banknotes.

62
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,760
I never thought that the fake chief was really doing a business plan.

63
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,760
Such a despicable trick.

64
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,180
noises

65
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:28,280
footstep

66
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,240
He's got a PC.

67
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,760
The teacher of the mountain chief,

68
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,760
you know your mistake.

69
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,760
You and Tao Sheng

70
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,760
are both the people that the mountain chief values.

71
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,760
You still haven't come out

72
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,760
and yet you are doing such a despicable act.

73
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,760
How are you going to face

74
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,760
the hardships of the world?

75
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,760
How are you going to

76
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,760
try your best to make a fortune for the people?

77
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,760
I was confused at the moment

78
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,760
and I was confused.

79
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,760
The teaching of the mountain chief

80
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,760
is not as good as the teaching of the people.

81
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,760
I am not a good student.

82
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,760
I am not a good student.

83
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,760
I am not a good student.

84
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,760
I am not a good student.

85
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,760
The teaching of the mountain chief

86
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,760
is a lesson for me.

87
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,760
You know your mistake.

88
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,760
You are not a good student.

89
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,760
Let the mountain chief see

90
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,760
if he has hurt you.

91
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,760
What is this?

92
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,760
I have been like this since I was a child.

93
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,760
I don't know why.

94
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,760
Please keep the secret for me.

95
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,760
Get up.

96
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,760
This means that you are not a commoner.

97
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,760
You are a man of the heaven.

98
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,760
You should have a better

99
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,760
moral quality.

100
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,760
You should be a man of the pure and good.

101
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,760
You can't be wrong.

102
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,760
Remember the teaching of the mountain chief.

103
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,760
The one with a spiritual heart

104
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,760
has a pure and good character.

105
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,760
If he is hurt,

106
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,760
his wound will heal.

107
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,760
Am I

108
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,760
the one with a spiritual heart?

109
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,760
Yes.

110
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,760
Is there really a way to revive the dead?

111
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,760
These are the evidence

112
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,760
of the mountain chief

113
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,760
colluding with the corrupt officials

114
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,760
and selling the strategy.

115
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,760
With these evidences,

116
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,760
we can reveal his true face

117
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,760
in front of everyone.

118
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,760
You may not be his opponent.

119
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,760
And he knows how to threaten.

120
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,760
Yes.

121
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,760
But I

122
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,760
have an idea.

123
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,760
What is it?

124
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,760
If a demon hurts you,

125
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,760
it will destroy you.

126
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,760
He can use the magic of transformation

127
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,760
to threaten you.

128
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,760
If he dares to hurt me,

129
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,760
I will die with him.

130
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,760
No.

131
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,760
Is it worth to sacrifice your life

132
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,760
for such a evil thing?

133
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,760
I am a man of the spiritual heart.

134
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,760
It all started because of me.

135
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,760
It all started because of me.

136
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,760
It all started because of me.

137
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,760
If I listen to him,

138
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,760
more students will be cheated by him.

139
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,760
More people will be hurt.

140
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,760
The Qing Shan Academy

141
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,760
founded by the mountain chief

142
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,760
will be destroyed.

143
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,760
If I can use my own body

144
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,760
to change his future

145
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,760
and safety,

146
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,760
why not?

147
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,760
Brother Tao.

148
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,760
I was right about you.

149
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,760
Come on.

150
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,760
I propose a toast

151
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,760
to you.

152
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,760
Brother Tao.

153
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,760
I can't be with you

154
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,760
and take revenge.

155
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,760
I am a man of the spiritual heart.

156
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,760
I hope you can

157
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,760
fulfill my wish

158
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,760
and make a wish for the people.

159
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,760
Cheers.

160
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,760
Brother Tao.

161
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,760
Do you remember

162
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,760
the first time we met?

163
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,760
We were together

164
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,760
and you were like a moon.

165
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,760
You were sitting at the door

166
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,760
of the academy.

167
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,760
I was just talking.

168
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,760
I didn't expect that someone could be so generous.

169
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,760
I know the young and wise.

170
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,760
I am the best in the world.

171
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,760
You are arrogant and arrogant.

172
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,760
And the fan meeting.

173
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,760
You made me so happy.

174
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,760
But I also made up for it

175
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,760
as a gift.

176
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,760
Good for you, Brother Tao.

177
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,760
Come on.

178
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,760
If I could go back to the past,

179
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,760
what would you do?

180
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,760
Yes.

181
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,760
If we didn't go through all these,

182
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,760
we could have entered the world together

183
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,760
and took revenge.

184
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,760
Brother Tao.

185
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,760
Why are you like this?

186
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,760
I just have a feeling.

187
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,760
Come on.

188
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,760
Let's drink.

189
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,760
Brother Tao.

190
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,760
I always think that you are strange recently.

191
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,760
What strange thing?

192
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,760
Brother Tao.

193
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,760
This...

194
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,760
