1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,180
But we Bad three

2
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,480
Today This day

3
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,720
I am the same.

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,040
I don't feel lonely.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,600
Really

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The blood on my knife is the blood of the thief.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
What the ancient books say is true.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You came back to catch me, right?

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's a pity.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
As long as you go through,

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
my memory will change.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I can still resist you.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
There's not much time.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Now we have the rules of going through.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We need books and libraries.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We have a lot of things to do in seven days.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I sent a diary to the 50th anniversary of 2025.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
If I fail,

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I will end them in 2005.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Stop!

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
If you don't give me the evidence,

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I will destroy this thing.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'll give you the thing!

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Throw it in the bucket.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The evidence has been melted by the sulfuric acid.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We wasted our energy.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm not going to let you go.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm going to kill you.

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm going to kill you.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm going to kill you.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm going to kill you.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm going to kill you.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
As long as I have a diary,

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I won't let you go.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Ning Ruoxi,

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
if I remember correctly,

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
you came back from 2025, right?

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
If I don't let you go back,

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
you will die.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What did you say?

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What do you want to say?

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I heard all that you said.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
How can I let you go back

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
and fight me again?

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You...

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The book.

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I've already taken it out.

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It should have been burned by now.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You can't go back.

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Ning Ruoxi,

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
just wait to die.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Wang Haozhi,

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I don't care if you are a person or a ghost.

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
If you are a ghost,

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
you can't kill me.

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm a god.

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Since you're not dead,

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
why can't you let me go?

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
How are you?

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You have to go back and deal with it.

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He doesn't know I have a page.

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Let's go.

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We can't go back.

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I can't catch him.

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But you can't stay here.

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Ning Ruoxi doesn't know you're here.

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He has three people.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
We can't let him go.

69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
He has killed you.

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
If I can punish him,

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
it's worth it.

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Come.

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I told you.

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I heard your prophecy.

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Remember?

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's the six-leafed eagle.

77
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
After a thousand years,

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
the old man will meet again.

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
He will experience life and death.

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So you think I'm...

81
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
since you saw me.

82
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
No.

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You think Wang Haozhi is in danger.

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So you try to turn it around.

85
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I was like that at first.

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
But now I...

87
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Actually,

88
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I heard the same prophecy.

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
After a thousand years,

90
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
the old man will meet again.

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
He will experience life and death.

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Is it the old man?

93
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yes.

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So when I saw Wang Haozhi die,

95
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I knew

96
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
your life and death was coming.

97
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So...

98
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So you...

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yes.

100
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So I came to you.

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But look.

102
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Your prophecy has come true.

103
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Wang Haozhi died for no reason.

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But for me,

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
it's not over yet.

106
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You were my enemy.

107
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
But I didn't have anyone else to believe in.

108
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I don't think you can live until the end of my days.

109
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You want me to die?

110
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
No.

111
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Just block them.

112
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You want to be my friend?

113
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
What like?

114
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
No, no

115
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
No, I...

116
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I...

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Li Man!

118
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I will protect her for the rest of my life

119
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
and protect her every effort

120
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Waiting for the starlight

121
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
to get the future

122
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:47,600
2020

123
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Just leave!

124
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The moonlight sprouts in the dark night

125
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
The night is silent, the autumn and winter are quiet

126
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The snow-colored leaves are speaking on the ground

127
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I open the home of time

128
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The sandstorm in my fingers turns into a battlefield

129
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The old days are already in danger

130
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
When the conflict is in the shadow of the autumn flowers

131
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I pick up all the mistakes

132
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Waiting for a light like a clear window

133
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I still remember the past of the moon mountain

134
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The heart beats and the smile is in my hands

135
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Wandering for a thousand years, looking back

136
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Waiting for a light to light up the past

137
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
The ending is a farewell

138
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I finally walk out of the wall I have forgotten

139
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
No longer wandering, I will be by your side
