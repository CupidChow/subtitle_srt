1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
After You

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,820
need to face this

3
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:27,040
OMG

4
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:27,980
Teacher Wang

5
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,080
Everybody Abg

6
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,520
I'm looking for you

7
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,520
You're finally back

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,040
Auntie, I went out for a walk

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,040
I'm going up to get something

10
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,480
No

11
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,480
What are you doing?

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:50,840
When he said that

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,640
I think I know where Wang Zhi Qin is

14
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,160
Auntie

15
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,320
I just remembered something

16
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,200
I seem to have forgotten to bring...

17
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,400
Auntie

18
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,200
Let me

19
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,600
This group is really a mess

20
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,100
I love you.

21
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,980
Who are you?

22
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,520
Tony Wang

23
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,080
Where else

24
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,400
was that戚一素 hiding?

25
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,120
But you because of your lawyer

26
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:30,880
Chip

27
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,760
Mr.

28
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,600
You learned me anability

29
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,880
But you publicly speak of your friend's bribery

30
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,360
It leaked the interview test

31
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,280
That day

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,240
I go to ask the result

33
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,480
Between you two

34
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,720
Hey, don't say nonsense

35
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,960
Oh, you have that kind of choice

36
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,000
I record all your conversations

37
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:55,880
You are good

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,480
You don't have to mention anymore

39
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,400
It is because I am good

40
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,760
I have a difficult task to do.

41
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,560
Can you ask me this time?

42
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,160
Teacher,

43
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,320
go and tell the principal yourself.

44
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,360
I don't want to tell you in person.

45
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,600
Wang Xiao Zhi,

46
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,680
I really can't afford to offend you.

47
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,320
I only say it for the last time.

48
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:11,880
Tomorrow,

49
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,360
either you surrender

50
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,640
or I report it to him in person.

51
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,800
July 4th,

52
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,160
murder and extermination.

53
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,840
So this is the money.

54
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,520
Do you have any evidence

55
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,600
that Liu Wanzhou and Xing Hui

56
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,640
learned from each other?

57
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,800
Who is it?

58
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:38,760
organised by hinaus

59
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,400
General, general.

60
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,600
Another story.

61
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,400
I'm fine. I'll be fine in a bit.

62
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,400
What are you doing here?

63
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,400
Do you know how dangerous it is?

64
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,400
Do you think I've been living in vain for a thousand years?

65
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,400
I won't let you risk it alone.

66
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,400
You're going back to 2005 too?

67
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,400
I'm not wrong, right?

68
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Also?

69
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,400
He also came to me.

70
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,400
He made the same request as you.

71
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,400
He asked me to keep it from you.

72
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,400
He has one person to go back to.

73
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,400
I'll go with him then.

74
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,400
Why do you have to go with him?

75
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,400
He's very important to me.

76
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,400
I can't let him risk it alone.

77
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,400
Besides,

78
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,400
I have to find out the truth about your mother's death.

79
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,400
I'll give you an explanation.

80
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,400
It seems that I can't stop you.

81
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,400
Thank you for protecting me all this time.

82
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,400
Huang Yue, take care of your own life from now on.

83
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,400
Wait.

84
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,400
Gu Dong, take this.

85
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,400
How did you get here without my blood?

86
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,400
You bled at home last time. Did you forget?

87
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
You... What do you mean?

88
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,400
Why don't you go back to 2005 and I'll stay?

89
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,400
I don't care.

90
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,400
I'm here anyway.

91
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,400
Don't try to drive me away.

92
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,400
Oh, right.

93
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,400
It's been more than two hours.

94
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,400
It seems that as long as the ring that goes through the wound is burnt,

95
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,400
it can be stopped in another time.

96
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,400
But now there's no evidence.

97
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,400
What did you find?

98
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,400
Liu Wanzhou

99
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,400
accepted student bribery and leaked the exam questions.

100
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,400
Before that, Wang Hao...

101
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,400
I recorded it.

102
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,400
I advised him to go to school and turn himself in before July 5.

103
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,400
This is a motive to kill.

104
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,400
This is a motive to kill.

105
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,400
But now the recording pen has been burned.

106
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,400
Anyway, it's still early.

107
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,400
When there's no one later,

108
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,400
I'll go back to see.

109
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,400
Let's go.

110
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,400
Okay, let's go.

111
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,400
The most serious burn is the position of the bed.

112
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,400
But there seems to be no electricity here.

113
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,400
This is...

114
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,400
This is...

115
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,400
This is...

116
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,400
This is...

117
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,400
This is...

118
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,400
The smell of oil.

119
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,400
No.

120
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,400
Why is your wound still not healed?

121
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,400
The radiation will help me recover.

122
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,400
Don't worry.

123
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,400
I'll go to the hospital.

124
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,400
I'll go to the hospital.

125
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,400
I'll go to the hospital.

126
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,400
I'll go to the hospital.

127
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,400
I'll go to the hospital.

128
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,400
I'll go to the hospital.

129
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,400
I'll go to the hospital.

130
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,400
I'll go to the hospital.

131
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,400
I'll go to the hospital.

132
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,400
I'll go to the hospital.

133
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,400
I'll go to the hospital.

134
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,400
I'll go to the hospital.

135
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,400
I'll go to the hospital.

136
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,400
I'll go to the hospital.

137
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,400
I'll go to the hospital.

138
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,400
I'll go to the hospital.

139
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,400
I'll go to the hospital.

140
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,400
I'll go to the hospital.

141
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,400
I'll go to the hospital.

142
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,400
I'll go to the hospital.

143
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,400
I'll go to the hospital.

144
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,400
I'll go to the hospital.

145
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,400
I'll go to the hospital.

146
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,400
I'll go to the hospital.

147
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,400
I'll go to the hospital.

148
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,400
I'll go to the hospital.

149
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,400
I'll go to the hospital.

150
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,400
I'll go to the hospital.

151
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,400
I'll go to the hospital.
