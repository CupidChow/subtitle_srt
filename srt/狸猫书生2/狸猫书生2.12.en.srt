Episode 1

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What are you doing?

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I've made it clear.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's not me.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
If you're not guilty,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
why are you holding the dagger?

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Why?

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You're students,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:47,200
yet you're so

11
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,200
I just found the broken pieces in the row of flowers.

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,200
Oh, yeah.

13
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,200
I was there that night.

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,200
It was too dark.

15
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,200
I slipped a little bit.

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,200
I didn't send the broken bowl to them.

17
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,200
Then why did you

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,200
change the cleaning time with Xiaosi?

19
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,200
He can't get up.

20
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,200
I helped him.

21
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,200
Is it wrong to help others?

22
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,200
You're lying.

23
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,200
The cleaning of the yard is fake.

24
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,200
Your real purpose

25
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,200
is to clean up the crime scene.

26
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,200
No, I didn't.

27
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,200
That day,

28
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,200
you met the worst cut

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,200
on your way to deliver soup to Zhou Sheng.

30
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,480
met the most powerful Duan Sheng.

31
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,200
Maybe he spilled your soup

32
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,560
or he was humiliated by you.

33
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,920
Because of the conflict,

34
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,640
in the quarrel,

35
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,960
your sleeve was cut by the coffin

36
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,800
and left this broken cloth.

37
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,640
You knocked Duan Sheng down.

38
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,200
You hate the evil-looking, bold and wild life

39
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,600
from the heart.

40
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,400
You kicked him down with one foot.

41
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,200
So he left

42
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,200
the ashes of your feet on him.

43
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,920
Duan Sheng fell into the flower pot.

44
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,800
You didn't do anything.

45
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,080
You grabbed his head

46
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,800
and hit the stone in the flower pot hard

47
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,120
until he died.

48
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:53,800
Right?

49
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,800
No.

50
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,200
It's not like that.

51
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,320
You were really scared.

52
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,040
But you quickly calmed down.

53
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,800
Because you knew

54
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,400
Duan Sheng was

55
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,920
fooled by the legend of the cat demon killer.

56
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,080
So you used a knife

57
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,720
to cut off his tongue

58
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,800
and framed his death

59
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,920
on the legend of the cat demon killer.

60
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,040
The evidence is clear.

61
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,240
How dare you say no?

62
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,240
No.

63
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,280
It's not like that.

64
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,040
Duan Sheng is a member of the cat demon killer.

65
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,320
He's a servant.

66
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,800
He deserves it.

67
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,320
Duan Sheng may be guilty,

68
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,680
but he's not guilty of death.

69
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,920
You should find an excuse for your behavior.

70
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,160
I didn't provoke him or offend him.

71
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,120
I used to hide from him when I saw him.

72
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,200
But that night,

73
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,080
I met a scoundrel like him.

74
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,360
He came up without saying a word

75
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,080
and broke my plate.

76
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,160
He beat me with his neck

77
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,400
and cursed me as a cat demon.

78
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,800
Mr. Duan.

79
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,520
Cat demon!

80
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,040
I almost got killed by him.

81
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,400
I used all my strength

82
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,160
to knock him down.

83
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,240
Mr. Duan.

84
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,760
I was so scared at that time.

85
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,040
I was afraid that he would die

86
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,760
and I was afraid that he would wake up and take revenge.

87
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:12,840
Mr. Duan.

88
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,160
Mr. Duan.

89
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,640
Let go.

90
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:18,800
Let go.

91
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,720
Let go.

92
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,280
I was so scared after Duan Sheng died.

93
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,200
Luckily, fewer people came to the backyard.

94
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,880
But someone found out early in the morning.

95
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,480
You must clean it up as soon as possible

96
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,400
Brother Gou

97
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,200
Fan

98
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,600
You didn't sleep well this night, did you?

99
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:57,960
Yes

100
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,680
How about this?

101
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,880
I'll help you

102
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,480
You go back and rest

103
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,120
Thank you

104
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,240
Stop laughing

105
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:35,640
I thought I could do something without knowing if I transferred the body

106
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,440
As long as no one finds out the real crime scene

107
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,760
There will be no clue

108
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,800
But you forgot

109
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,000
There is a piece of cash in the flower bed

110
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,120
The cash in the flower bed is exposed

111
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,440
It's true

112
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,680
God is watching

113
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,120
Xiaoyun

114
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,280
Don't come here

115
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,400
Don't come here

116
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,760
Xiaoyun

117
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,040
Put down the knife

118
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,080
What are you doing?

119
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,400
Young master

120
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,720
I'm sorry

121
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,360
I killed them

122
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,280
I'm sorry

123
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,480
But I still don't understand

124
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,120
Why did you kill Mr. Zhang and Huang Sheng?

125
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,520
Huang Sheng saw me kill people

126
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,440
I can only kill him

127
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,880
As for Mr. Zhang

128
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,520
He bought the students' strategy

129
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,440
And said otherwise, he would seal the moon

130
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,440
Let all the students lose the opportunity to be a official

131
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,040
My son's biggest wish is to be an official

132
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,240
Since I killed Duan Sheng

133
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,640
It doesn't matter if I kill another Mr. Zhang

134
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,280
Xiaoyun

135
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,320
Why are you so stupid?

136
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,240
It's just like this

137
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,400
Young master

138
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,760
We made the same mistake

139
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,760
I don't want to be a burden to more people

140
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,800
As long as I die

141
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,120
It's the best ending to fight with my life

142
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,040
Who wants to fight with his life?

143
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,520
Duan Sheng is the most capable

144
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,120
Even if the people from the government come

145
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,320
I can be your witness

146
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,800
All the students in our school can be your witness

147
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,280
Am I right?

148
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,920
Am I right?

149
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,520
Okay, young master

150
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,520
Don't say anymore

151
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,920
Mr. Tao is right

152
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,320
Duan Sheng shouldn't die

153
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,320
I should have this ending

154
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,320
Young master

155
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,040
I believe you

156
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,800
You can be promoted

157
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,120
Remember me

158
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,520
Come to my grave and tell me

159
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,280
It's a wish for me to end my life

160
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,640
Xiaoyun

161
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,520
No

162
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:17,560
The flower blooms and the world is re-enacted

163
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,600
Brother Tao

164
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,040
The case is solved

165
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,560
Why are you still so confused?

166
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,760
I always feel that the matter is not so simple

167
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,800
You mean the murderer has another person

168
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,040
No, he is the murderer

169
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,280
Duan Sheng should be killed by him

170
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,640
But Mr. Zhang is eight feet tall

171
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,000
He is a big monster

172
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,080
Fan Shutong is thin

173
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,320
How did he fall on the beam?

174
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,280
I suspect that the murderer is more than one

175
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,640
Fan Shutong committed suicide for the crime

176
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,920
The purpose is to protect this person

177
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,520
Zhou Shang
