1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The King of Blaze

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
What's going on?

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,800
You don't know?

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The King of Blaze

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Why are you here?

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You're so strong

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You followed me?

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You disappeared as soon as you woke up

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I was easy to find

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm tired

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Come out and take a walk

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Enough, go back

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Go

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
There are many cat sounds around

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I remember that

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
There are cat sounds

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The book says

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The original Green Hills Academy

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Is the present Green Hills University

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I heard

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The cave that sealed the cat demon is nearby

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The cat demon is a evil thing

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You're really not afraid

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I don't believe it

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And those sounds

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Don't scare me

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Should we thank him?

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Yes

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You really have to thank the cat

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You're welcome

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
No

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Who is it?

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You look familiar

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Are you crazy?

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You don't even know that there are thieves in your house

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I almost got robbed by the thief

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Sister?

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You?

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yes

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Tao Ran is my brother

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But he is always very low-key

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
He doesn't even know our relationship in school

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Are the friend he took in?

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Sister, this is Wang Hanzhi

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Let's not talk about this

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Are you hurt?

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I just came in

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The thief pushed me down

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I can't see it clearly

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But he also got me

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm badly hurt

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's a pity that I didn't catch him

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's good that he's fine

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'll go and check the monitor

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Take care of my sister

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
How old are you?

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
My brother said

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Your parents died and were left out

63
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It sounds very pitiful

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm the same as Tao Ran

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Twenty years old

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Your brother is a good person

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Thanks to him

68
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I have a place to settle

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Good people

70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So it's easy to be fooled

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yes

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I have to watch her more

73
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I remember

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I remember

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Your last name is Huang

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You don't know each other

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm with my mother

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
He is with his father

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Oh, no

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The surveillance wires are all cut off

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I didn't shoot anything

82
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Tao is a smart mouth

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Call the police

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'll deal with it

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I don't think anything was lost at home

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Or just forget it

87
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'll call you once

88
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'll go wash my face

89
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Fortunately, this thief didn't get hurt

90
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You usually talk to your sister like this

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Our parents died early

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The fewer tubes, the easier it is

93
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Let's not talk about this

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Everything is super-simple

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Yes

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The most important thing is to live now

97
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I woke up in 2005

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But I met Tao Ran in the library for 25 years

99
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Since Wang Hao died in 2005

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
If you want to find the real murderer

101
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You have to go back to the scene in 2005

102
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Little thing

103
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You listen to me every day

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I really thought I didn't know

105
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Don't worry

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I won't let anything happen to your master

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I've been waiting for this for a thousand years

108
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's just that the world after a thousand years

109
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's really a little bit different

110
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I really have to get used to it

111
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You just wait for me to break this life and death

112
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You said he was just a country boy who didn't get into college

113
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Take a closer look

114
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I found him at your house last night

115
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
He's a student at Qing Shan University

116
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And it's completely different from what it is now

117
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Maybe he has some difficulties

118
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Everyone has difficulties

119
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I have too

120
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You're different from him

121
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But I'm sure I'm going to help him

122
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Are you him?

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm familiar with the year 2005

124
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But 2005 is the key

125
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You have this book, too

126
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But you have my blood

127
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Hungry to the point of giving your finger

128
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yes, I'm waiting for you to take me to dinner

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What do you want to eat

130
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I want to eat

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Who cooked the fish

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I really love fish

133
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm going to eat

134
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm going to eat

135
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Let's go

136
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'll go first

137
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'll try it tonight

138
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's really useful

139
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What are you doing

140
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Get up

141
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What's going on

142
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Nothing

143
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Give it to me

144
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm talking to you

145
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I open the home of time

146
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
The sand in my fingers turns into a battlefield

147
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I hide the danger of the flowers

148
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
When the conflict is in the shadow of the autumn flowers

149
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I break all the time

150
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Waiting for a light to melt the window of memory

151
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I still remember the past

152
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
The fragrance of the green grass is in my hands

153
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Wandering for a thousand years, looking back

154
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Waiting for a light to bury the past

155
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The end of the world is over

156
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I finally walk out of the wall of the past

157
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
No more wandering, I will be by your side
