00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
Ein chol스템

2
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,220
Director of commander-in-chief Zhang was devastated

3
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,920
He had complaining with a enough eyes

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The one who destroyed the former emperor died in the wild

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The demon-slaying is true

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It seems that there is a demon-slaying

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The former emperor died, now it's Lord Zhang

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Who will be the next emperor?

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The next emperor is the one who will be the next emperor

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
One nose is not sharp, two eyes are not clear

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
One mouth is not clear, two ears are not clear

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
How do you know that the cat demon likes to eat these disgusting things?

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This has happened before

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
That year, Lin Wude died without a clear reason

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
His heart was hollowed out

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The people in the government did not find out the cause

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Then the chief sealed the back mountain

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Zhang Cheng, stop talking nonsense

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I closed the back mountain for the safety of the students

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Who told you it was because of the cat demon?

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You are not allowed to cause trouble

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Let's bring this matter to the level of threat

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Then the murderer can be released

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
OK, according to what you said, it's not the cat demon

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Then it can only be the emperor

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's true

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The death of Duan Sheng

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The emperor is the biggest evil person

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Then the direction has been unclear

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yesterday, someone was at the academy

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Found the evidence of the emperor

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Then Lord Zhang died

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What is it that he is not the cat demon?

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Everything is a speculation before the emperor was found

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The most important thing to investigate is evidence

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You are empty-handed and slanderous

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Who slanders?

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You have to say something

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Enough

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Zhou Sheng

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You saw Lord Zhang's body is well secured

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Dare to send a case in the academy

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So arrogant

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Even if it's a demon

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I have to get it out

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
One nose is not sharp

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Two eyes are not clear

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
One mouth is not clear

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Two ears are not loud

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Little cat, little cat, come quickly

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Eat this spirit heart

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
How can there be such a strange demon?

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
There is a little mystery in this life

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Since the murderer used the demon to kill people

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
There will be more victims

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Then we will get the murderer out

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I also want to know

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Who is it?

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Dare to marry me to the cat demon god

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Cat demon god

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You also believe in the demon blood

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
How is it impossible to know the world?

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The evil spirit said

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Believe it or not

65
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I will go to the cat demon god

66
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I still don't understand

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Who is Li Wude mentioned by Zhen Sheng?

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Li Wude is famous among the students of the previous books

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Is it because he is talented

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Or good character

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's because he doesn't take the exam every year

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But there are years to take the exam

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So the students in the academy have a deep impression of him

74
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Until that year

75
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He fell into the trap again

76
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Found the chief of the mountain to ask for mercy

77
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Chief, please give me another chance

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I can do it today, chief

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I didn't expect you to do such a thing

80
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Chief, please

81
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You disappointed me too much

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Chief

83
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Chief

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Chief

85
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Chief, please

86
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
After seeing him again

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He put down his body in the back hill

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
His face was completely burned

89
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
His heart was also dug away

90
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
There were also many cat claws on his body

91
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Since then

92
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The cat demon god's words are even more effective

93
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The chief sealed the back hill

94
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
This murderer may be a model

95
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Maybe he is the one who killed Li Wude

96
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The murderer

97
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Chief Zhou

98
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Just say it

99
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Zheng Sheng found the clue of the emperor

100
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And brought people there

101
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Why don't you stop him

102
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
What if he is a military snake

103
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Let's go

104
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Brother Zhou, can we go together

105
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The back hill is desolate

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You should stay in the academy

107
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
My brother and I are in close contact with the emperor

108
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
We may be of help if we go together

109
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Okay

110
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You go to report to the chief

111
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Go

112
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Say it

113
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Where is your brother

114
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You bad girl

115
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Let me go

116
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You

117
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Enough

118
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Zheng Sheng

119
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You said you knew the clue of the emperor

120
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Yes, brother Zhou

121
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
This bad girl

122
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
How do you know her brother

123
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
If it wasn't for Wang Sheng's stop

124
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I can definitely ask

125
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Ask what

126
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You have to make a big claim to a child

127
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Why do you talk about escaping

128
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I can't

129
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I have my own way

130
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Stop

131
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Make a move on a child

132
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Do you have any pity

133
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Child

134
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Do you live here

135
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You go back with Uncle Shan Zhe

136
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Arrange a place for you

137
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Wait for your brother to come back

138
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Okay

139
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Thank you, chief

140
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Fan Shutong

141
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yes

142
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You take care of the emperor and sister

143
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Make sure it's arranged

144
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yes

145
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Go back

146
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Go back

147
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Go back

148
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Go back

149
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Go back
