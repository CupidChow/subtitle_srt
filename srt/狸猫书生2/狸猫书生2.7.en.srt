1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
The

2
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,680
What do you want to say

3
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,280
July 12, 2005

4
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,520
It's not the first time I've seen him

5
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,240
What do you mean

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,000
The day mom got into a car accident

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,240
I saw him

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,200
The accessories around here

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,200
They're all quite complete

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,320
Everything

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,240
Did we fill the wrong name

12
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,360
Tao Ran is

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,280
That's right

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,400
I bought it for someone

15
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,160
Little friend, your ball

16
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,360
I saw you

17
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:01,920
Little friend

18
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,440
You have to be careful next time

19
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,320
Mom, mom

20
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,200
I saw the brother in the car

21
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,480
You go first

22
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,160
Okay, okay

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,120
It shouldn't be now

24
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,160
Where is he

25
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,360
He went up the mountain

26
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,440
Mom, go over and have a look

27
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,720
What happened today

28
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,960
You can't tell anyone

29
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:27,400
Good

30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,400
I'll go

31
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,960
He went out to find someone

32
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,160
Then there was a car accident

33
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,240
Since it's for me

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,360
Hong Yue, I'm sorry

35
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,440
When I was a kid

36
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,160
I thought I had to keep my promise to my mother

37
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,120
So I didn't tell anyone about this

38
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,600
Then I felt like I couldn't

39
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,000
The car accident was just an accident

40
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,680
But now

41
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,360
The time of the car accident

42
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,440
It was July 5, 2005

43
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,120
And I saw that snowman notice

44
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,880
Wang Hao's disappearance

45
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,000
It was also on July 5, 2005

46
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,200
Although the place where the car accident happened was not in the wild

47
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,360
But all this was too coincidental

48
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,480
Your mother's death

49
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,080
May not be an accident

50
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,400
You said

51
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,720
You were destined to meet after a thousand years

52
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,600
This thing did happen

53
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,840
But he is from 2005

54
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,640
Only when I go back to 2005

55
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,440
I can find the truth

56
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,280
I understand

57
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,400
Why does he know Wang Hao Zhi

58
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,000
Will definitely appear after a thousand years

59
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,920
What other secrets does he have

60
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,880
I don't know

61
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,520
I don't know the secrets

62
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,280
I have secrets with Chang Bu

63
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,600
Let's go to school

64
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,800
This book is the ring you passed through

65
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,400
I'm sure he can pass through if he's infected with blood

66
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,240
Not a few days ago

67
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,680
It was only successful last night

68
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,000
And

69
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,520
When we went back to 2005

70
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,120
He passed through again

71
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,920
Why didn't anything happen

72
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,080
Is it only your blood that can do it

73
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,400
I'll try

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:19,020
What if there was a

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,640
oll phones there.

76
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,040
In the number you gi snow there.

77
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,680
How can you do that?

78
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,240
Fight the war

79
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,240
and finally find a winner.

80
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,680
Don't fire your gun to me.

81
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,760
Ok, I won't fire anymore.

82
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,560
You won't arrest me?

83
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,640
Or are you going to give birth to a baby from me

84
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:53,500
and become

85
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,480
We exchanged flowers yesterday

86
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,680
How's your day?

87
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:57,980
Forever

88
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,940
And

89
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,460
How's your everyday life?

90
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,840
Fighting

91
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,260
What are you doing here?

92
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,740
I have something to do

93
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,680
Let me open the door

94
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,680
Your watch is broken into pieces.

95
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,680
Bring me a new one.

96
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,680
This watch is really pretty.

97
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,680
Your watch is broken into pieces.

98
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,680
It's 14.28.

99
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,680
It's time for you to be treated.

100
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,680
The murderer must have left a clue on the timeline.

101
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,680
It seems that we have to go back to 2005.

102
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,680
Everyone, close your eyes.

103
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,680
Start counting.

104
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,680
Wu Yuqing.

105
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,680
Here.

106
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,680
Tao Ran.

107
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,680
Here.

108
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,680
Here.

109
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,680
Who are you?

110
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,680
Who are you?

111
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,680
Here.

112
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,680
Tao Ran.

113
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,680
Pang Tingsheng.

114
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,680
Here.

115
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,680
How is that possible?

116
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,680
Is there a problem, Liu Zhenshuang?

117
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,680
Impossible.

118
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,680
Impossible.

119
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,680
I'm a little uncomfortable.

120
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,680
I won't be attending today's class.

121
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,680
Chen, I have a question.

122
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,680
Is the new student, Wang Haozhi,

123
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,680
not missing any information?

124
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,680
He?

125
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,680
He's a person that Qi Dong recommended.

126
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,680
Qi Dong said that his house is a confidential information unit.

127
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,680
He asked us to ask less.

128
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,680
Whose person?

129
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,680
I still have a clue about the missing of the pen.

130
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,680
Where?

131
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,680
The archive room.

132
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,680
All the information about the paper version that doesn't have electronic drawings are there.

133
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,680
But students can't enter the archive room.

134
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,680
How about I let Huang Yuexuan go on a date?

135
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,680
Why are you so troublesome?

136
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,680
Do you have a way?

137
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,680
Of course.

138
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,680
This is the method you said.

139
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,680
Steal the window and get in.

140
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,680
If you try,

141
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,680
how much of a trouble will it be?

142
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,680
What's wrong?

143
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,680
What are you doing?

144
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,680
Good.

145
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,680
It was you two last time, too.

146
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,680
Put down your things and raise your hands.

147
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,680
No, you misunderstood.

148
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,680
We are students at the school.

149
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,680
This is the student certificate.

150
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,680
Students?

151
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,680
Students can't enter the archive room.

152
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,680
You two, hurry up and call the ambulance.

153
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,680
Go, go.

154
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,680
Stop, you two.

155
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,680
I saw this on the crime scene.

156
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,680
It should be the murderer.

157
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,680
Four were bought by foreign buyers.

158
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,680
And one.

159
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,680
The murderer is the murderer.

160
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,680
The murderer is the murderer.

161
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,680
The murderer is the murderer.

162
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,680
The murderer is the murderer.

163
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,680
The murderer is the murderer.

164
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,680
The murderer is the murderer.

165
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,680
The murderer is the murderer.

166
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,680
The murderer is the murderer.

167
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,680
The murderer is the murderer.

168
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,680
The murderer is the murderer.

169
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,680
The murderer is the murderer.

170
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,680
The murderer is the murderer.

171
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,680
The murderer is the murderer.

172
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,680
The murderer is the murderer.

173
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,680
The murderer is the murderer.

174
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,680
The murderer is the murderer.

175
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,680
The murderer is the murderer.

176
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,680
The murderer is the murderer.

177
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,680
The murderer is the murderer.

178
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,680
The murderer is the murderer.

179
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,680
The murderer is the murderer.

180
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,680
The murderer is the murderer.

181
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,680
The murderer is the murderer.

182
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,680
The murderer is the murderer.

183
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,680
The murderer is the murderer.

184
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,680
The murderer is the murderer.

185
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,680
The murderer is the murderer.

186
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,680
The murderer is the murderer.

187
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,680
The murderer is the murderer.

188
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,680
The murderer is the murderer.

189
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,680
The murderer is the murderer.

190
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,680
The murderer is the murderer.

191
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,680
The murderer is the murderer.

192
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,680
The murderer is the murderer.
