Episode 16

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Isn't he dead?

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Why is he alive again?

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What do you mean by dead?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What are you talking about?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Replying to the County Governor,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
the County Magistrate was already dead,

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
but I don't know why he's alive again.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
He's alive, and he's alive better than before.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm definitely not mistaken.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The County Magistrate is the key to the escape case.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I remember it very clearly.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You go ahead.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yes, Magistrate.

A wise man with a pure heart,

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
his body is weak, his mouth is dry,

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
his blood is like medicine, his anger is like spring,

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
his heart is like poison, his death is like a curse,

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
his body is weak, his heart is like a snake,

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
his body is weak, his body is like a snake,

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
his body is like a snake,

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
his body is weak, his death is like a poison,

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,200
his star in his chest is an alchemist

27
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,460
his head is alchemy

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
He appears.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Abyssal-e condra.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Finally appears.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Don't worry, young masters.

32
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,800
Brothers, thank you for finding justice for me.

33
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,800
And clearing his name.

34
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,120
You must take good care of yourself.

35
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,120
So your brother can rest in peace.

36
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,320
Oh, right. Brother wants me to bring flowers to you.

37
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,680
When did you see my brother?

38
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,080
After the mountain chief told me to bring him back to the academy.

39
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,280
Brother, are you leaving again?

40
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,440
Go and bring Little Sister with you.

41
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,000
The place I'm going to is very dangerous.

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,600
You still want to listen to me, okay?

43
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,880
If you have a chance, leave the academy and go back to your hometown.

44
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,320
I'm not leaving.

45
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,240
Listen to me.

46
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:20,120
I'll come back to you after I finish my work, okay?

47
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,720
Little Sister, there's one more thing.

48
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,440
Tell Tao Sheng and Wang Sheng for me.

49
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,640
It's a poem I recently read.

50
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,080
The two sides of the same coin are always right and wrong.

51
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,680
I like to share it with them.

52
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,880
I miss the time when the lights were on and the silver coin was on.

53
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,680
I remember now.

54
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,880
Brother. Brother.

55
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,800
Brother.

56
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,800
The two sides of the same coin are always right and wrong.

57
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,120
Good is high, evil is low.

58
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,800
This is the truth of Taoism.

59
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,800
Good is high, evil is low.

60
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,000
The grudge in my heart

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,480
should be that the poem is clear and the mountain is high.

62
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,200
But the poems in the two poems are in the second half.

63
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:34,040
Why did you only mention the first half? What did he want to express?

64
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,120
The light is on. Could it be a riddle?

65
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,320
The two sides of the same coin are always right and wrong.

66
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,440
I know now.

67
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,600
This riddle is a poem.

68
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,040
Poem?

69
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,480
Brother Zhou.

70
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,920
Brother is confused.

71
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,760
It must be the scene he witnessed the crime.

72
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,920
The two sides of the same coin are always right and wrong.

73
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,520
The poem is clear and the mountain is high.

74
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,840
The poem is clear and the mountain is low.

75
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,960
The poem is clear and the mountain is high.

76
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,920
Yes. Master, he will believe me.

77
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,680
One, two, three!

78
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,520
Brother Zhou!

79
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,640
Brother Zhou!

Episode 21

82
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,320
Zhou Sheng, are you쳐 you worthy of punishment?

83
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,320
Zhou Sheng, are you呢 we punish for this?

84
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,840
Zhou Sheng, can you actually stand?

85
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,560
Move your stool identify as a serious case.

86
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,360
I don't know who did wrong.

87
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,700
Please give an explanation to me.

88
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,660
You must have worked to kill Duan Sheng?

89
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,900
But Master, Josey, Zizan never dared to do such

90
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,120
A bunch of nonsensical things.

91
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,360
Please tell me a case.

92
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,360
Get up.

93
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,360
If you don't tell the truth,

94
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,040
tomorrow,

95
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,960
you'll have to deal with the government.

96
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,280
Master.

97
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,760
I killed Duan Sheng.

98
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,760
He has nothing to do with our young master.

99
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,760
He did this

100
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,360
just to hide it from me.

101
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,440
Master.

102
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,960
I'm also guilty

103
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,160
of being bullied by Duan Sheng for a long time.

104
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,560
Please have mercy on me.

105
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,360
There's no reason

106
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,360
to go back on this case.

107
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,360
You've been a supervisor for years.

108
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,360
You're taking care of the academy for me.

109
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,760
You're the best assistant I have.

110
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,960
I can't bear to see you

111
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,960
being destroyed like this.

112
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,560
You just have to do something for me.

113
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,960
This person...

114
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,760
You do it yourself.
