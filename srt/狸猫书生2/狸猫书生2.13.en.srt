1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The King of Blaze

2
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,320
The cookie box

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,880
seems to be a little problematic

4
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,960
How did Liu Wanzhou know I went to the bedroom?

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,840
Did he prepare it in advance?

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,400
Killing me once

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,880
is not enough to kill me again

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,880
You reported him as soon as you got the evidence

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,360
What's going on?

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:42,640
What's wrong?

11
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,520
I'm sorry

12
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,000
Haoran, you

13
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,320
I'm fine

14
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,600
Your inner power is fading

15
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,480
You don't want to waste your time

16
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,320
Go

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,320
I

18
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,680
I'm not going

19
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,880
I want to find the truth with you

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,120
No, Mr. Tong

21
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,080
I'm not going

22
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,800
I can hold on

23
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,280
OK

24
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,680
You want the truth, right?

25
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:33,920
Listen carefully

26
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,760
Wang Haozhi is dead

27
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,120
What you're doing now is meaningless

28
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,920
What did you say?

29
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,920
I said Wang Haozhi is dead

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,800
She's dead, she's dead

31
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,880
You're obviously here

32
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,320
The King of Blaze

33
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,040
Brother Tong

34
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,160
I was a ghost from thousands of years ago

35
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,920
I was attached to her after Wang Haozhi died

36
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,600
Do you see it clearly now?

37
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,640
Don't be silly

38
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,800
Do you want to waste your energy on a dead person?

39
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,840
Can you get back into your world?

40
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,280
Where is she?

41
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,080
Where is she?

42
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,800
Where is she?

43
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,080
What you're doing now is useless

44
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,920
Because she's dead

45
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,520
I don't believe it

46
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,320
What did you do to her?

47
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,040
Where is she?

48
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,680
If you think I killed your friend

49
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,520
Then you can avenge your friend now

50
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,240
Come on

51
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,320
Kill me

52
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,920
Then you can avenge your friend

53
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,720
You're a liar

54
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,720
This is your friend

55
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,320
Are you crazy?

56
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,120
I know it's not you

57
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,560
Let's go

58
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,360
The King of Blaze

59
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,680
Since he is not Wang Sheng

60
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,800
Why would he know this?

61
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,760
So Liu Wanzhou is the murderer who killed him?

62
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,560
Mom

63
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,000
You knew I was awake?

64
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,880
Someone told me

65
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,000
that you could wake up now

66
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,160
So I came for the dinner

67
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,520
She lied to me

68
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,440
I'm not the person I need to look for

69
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,560
You really met the truth

70
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,680
She wanted to protect you

71
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,880
You think she lied to you

72
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,880
He just doesn't want you to be sad.

73
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,680
You know it all.

74
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,960
Li Mao?

75
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,320
If he didn't show his true feelings in front of me,

76
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,360
I wouldn't believe it.

77
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,160
Yu Yan has already been tested.

78
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,960
We've met again.

79
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,840
But I still haven't found a way

80
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,560
to break through this life-and-death barrier.

81
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,240
But Yu Yan was tested in 2025.

82
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,920
But Wang Haozhi died in 2005.

83
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,400
And the one who met you again

84
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,160
could be Li Mao.

85
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,760
I still haven't figured it out.

86
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,320
I think you don't need to think about it.

87
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,200
Wang Haozhi is indeed gone.

88
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,320
You should cherish him now.

89
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,520
Go and find Li Mao.

90
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,320
As for Liu Wanzhou,

91
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,480
if he really killed Wang Haozhi

92
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,480
and killed my mother's murderer,

93
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,800
I won't let him go

94
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,440
in 2025.

95
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,160
What do you want to do?

96
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,320
Wang Haozhi's body is gone.

97
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,240
My mother's case has no evidence.

98
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,920
Then I'll use the way of the man I love

99
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,200
to return the body of the man I love.

100
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,200
I'll find someone to kill him

101
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,320
and throw him into the sea.

102
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,720
You can't use your own life

103
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,040
to punish a murderer.

104
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,880
Wait till I see him

105
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,120
free from all the restrictions.

106
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,240
If he's still here,

107
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,200
we can find clues.

108
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,440
But the body is gone.

109
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,880
It's still impossible.

110
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,040
Wang Haozhi.

111
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,600
No.

112
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,160
Li Mao is the key.

113
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,200
She's right.

114
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,600
I'm the key.

115
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,920
It's all because of me.

116
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,560
Let me finish it.
