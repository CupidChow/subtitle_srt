The King's Avatar

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Look at yourself!

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
How can you fall?

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Young Master is dead!

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's all because of me.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
No.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's to cover up the crime of me killing Lord Zhang for you.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What else do you want?

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
With the King's mind and the intelligence of the escape,

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
do you really think they will believe all these?

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Is Fan Tu Zhuo doing all these alone?

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Look at you.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Even if I can hide it from the government,

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
they will find you sooner or later.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
They asked you to be fooled that day.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If it wasn't me,

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I would have been killed by the escape.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Leader.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Leader.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The escape trap is left.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I was fooled.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
His hand was cut off.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You...

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
How can it be good?

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Leader.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Go to the house and wait for me.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Bear with it.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
This is just a trick.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You can recover your original state after three hours.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You must not be so reckless in the future.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Leader.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The Emperor knows about our situation.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I want to catch him quickly.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's all your fault for being so rich.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
If you had killed the Emperor earlier,

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
you wouldn't have caused so much trouble.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The Emperor is so humble and modest.

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I really can't bear it.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
If you don't kill him,

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
will he let you go?

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Only the dead can keep the secret.

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I...

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I also said that.

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Only the dead can keep the secret.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
That's right.

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Only the dead can keep the secret.

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
If I die,

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Leader.

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I...

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Can Li's secret be kept?

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What did you say?

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I've always been curious about

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
the people in the mountain.

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
He's so vicious.

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Why did he cover me up

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
until I saw you

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
sneaking into the back mountain

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
and colluding with the evil spirits?

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I've never seen you so vicious.

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Leader.

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I have something important to tell you.

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Please show yourself, Lord God.

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Li Wu De.

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You're finally here.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I've been living my whole life

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
so that I can dedicate my life to you.

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I hope that you will be kind,

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
and give me a lot of talent.

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I will be like a mountain chief

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,600
but I know it's not wrong and I'm surprised.

74
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,600
Come to the east.

75
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,200
Come to the east.

76
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,360
I'll follow your heart

77
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,880
with my life.

78
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,880
If it wasn't for Lord Shen Jun,

79
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,120
I wouldn't have been able to

80
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,920
have the fame of the chief of the mountain.

81
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,120
Every time I think of you,

82
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,640
I miss Lord Shen Jun.

83
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,520
So I came to visit you.

84
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,320
Don't act so smart in front of me.

85
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,920
I can't see your hypocritical face.

86
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,000
If I hadn't been deceived by you,

87
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,960
I would have been a demon god.

88
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,400
Why would I be trapped in the temple?

89
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,120
Chief.

90
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:45,920
Li Sheng.

91
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,440
Chief.

92
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,080
You're here.

93
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,280
Help me up.

94
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,120
Come on.

95
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,560
I'll help you.

96
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,920
Slow down.

97
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,280
The contract is done.

98
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,240
I've exchanged you for the chief.

99
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,520
From now on,

100
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,440
you can enter the academy

101
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,640
under the name of the chief.

102
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,160
Thank you, Lord Shen Jun.

103
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,480
What's your last wish?

104
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,760
My last wish

105
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,080
is to see you stay here forever.

106
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,920
I'm Li Wu De's commanding officer.

107
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,360
He's protecting the chief for me.

108
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,000
Li Wu De.

109
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,080
As a reward,

110
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,800
I'll pay you every year

111
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,800
with the heart of a scholar.

112
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,440
You're so despicable.

113
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,640
You used me to make your wish come true.

114
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,560
I'm a demon after all.

115
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,560
The contract is done.

116
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,280
You can't hurt me.

117
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,920
Don't try to escape.

118
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,400
I just found out

119
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,080
that you killed the chief.

120
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,960
You're not a man of the knife.

121
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,080
What are you doing?

122
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,440
I'll kill you

123
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,160
and I'll atone for my sin.

124
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,400
What's the point of killing me?

125
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,120
I know that Fan Tang's death

126
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,200
is a great loss to you.

127
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,600
He did everything for you.

128
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,400
If you die,

129
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,920
his life will be in vain.

130
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,920
I'll explain to him after I die.

131
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,640
If I can help you,

132
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,400
I'll make Fan Tang's death come true.

133
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,680
What do you mean?

134
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,400
This is the ancient secret book

135
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,720
I found in the library.

136
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,840
It recorded the effect of the dragon heart.

137
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,240
I just want to find the dragon heart.

138
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,880
Fan Shu Teng will die.

139
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,080
The dragon heart is broken.

140
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,680
The heart is cold.

141
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,480
If it's injured,

142
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,800
the wound will heal.

143
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,560
The blood is like medicine.

144
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,880
The crying wood is like spring.

145
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,680
The heart is like a shadow.

146
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,520
The death is coming.

147
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,960
Where is the dragon heart now?

148
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,480
I haven't found it yet.

149
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,560
But I have a doubt.

150
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,440
Who?

151
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,480
It's between Wang Sheng and Tao Sheng.

152
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,040
Tao Sheng, Wang Sheng, Cai Qing, Guan Jue and Shu Yan

153
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,240
are different.

154
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,040
They are the same talent.

155
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,640
So many things happened in the library.

156
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,160
Only they dare to find out the truth.

157
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,000
This is the purest of them.

158
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,440
But they are both

159
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,280
a little skilled.

160
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,360
I'm not sure

161
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,480
I can kill them.

162
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,800
You don't need to kill them.

163
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,560
Besides, I can't be sure.

164
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,760
Because we don't want to cause more trouble.

165
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,560
We just need to kill them.

166
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,240
If the wound is healed,

167
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,200
we can tell

168
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,880
who has the dragon heart.

169
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,560
Whether you want to save Fan Shu Tong

170
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,720
depends on you.

171
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:40,920
True and false love always

172
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,120
Viele Gunists
