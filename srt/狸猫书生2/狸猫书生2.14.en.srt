Channel Full Moon

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,580
I'm going to make a

3
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:38,160
little bit of a

4
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,680
little bit of a

5
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,980
little bit of a

6
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,080
little bit of a

7
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,060
little bit of a

8
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,060
little bit of a

9
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,060
little bit of a

10
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,060
little bit of a

11
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,060
little bit of a

12
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,060
little bit of a

13
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,060
little bit of a

14
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,560
little bit of a

15
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,580
little bit of a

16
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,860
little bit

17
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:21,740
of Amazon

00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:25,640
buen

00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,140
2

20
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,920
come

21
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,920
Because you saved me

22
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,920
I know you don't want to see me.

23
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,920
But you just...

24
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,920
I didn't.

25
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,920
But what you said...

26
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,920
It's a big shock to me.

27
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,920
That's right.

28
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,920
Maybe you want to see me now.

29
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,920
I'll return his body to you.

30
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,920
I'll go back tomorrow.

31
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,920
But you didn't lose.

32
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,920
When I came back,

33
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,920
I took a more serious look.

34
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,920
Okay.

35
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,920
I'll go with you.

36
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,920
I'll go with you.

37
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,920
Before we leave,

38
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,920
let's finish the wine we didn't finish last time.

39
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,920
Wang Hao Zhen.

40
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,920
Let me tell you.

41
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,920
From the moment I met you,

42
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,920
I've been very happy.

43
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,920
Very happy.

44
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,920
I've already regarded you as a confidante.

45
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,920
If we had known each other a thousand years ago,

46
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,920
we would have been confidantes.

47
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,920
Actually, we knew each other a long time ago.

48
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,920
What?

49
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,920
I said,

50
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,920
we knew each other a long time ago.

51
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,920
When?

52
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,920
Where?

53
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,920
A thousand years ago.

54
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,920
You don't remember?

55
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,920
A thousand years ago?

56
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,920
Tell me.

57
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,920
I'll listen.

58
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,920
I'll listen.

59
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,920
It's all in the past.

60
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,920
I'll remember it.

61
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,920
No.

62
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,920
You tell me.

63
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,920
Then you listen.

64
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,920
A thousand years ago,

65
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,920
we studied together,

66
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,920
we did things together,

67
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,920
we played together.

68
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,920
I remember you fell into the water once.

69
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,920
I saved you.

70
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,920
Of course,

71
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,920
you saved my life.

72
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,920
We investigated the case together.

73
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,920
You're usually a smart person.

74
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,920
At a critical moment,

75
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,920
you can always find clues.

76
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,920
You always say that

77
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,920
you want to help the weak and help the righteous.

78
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,920
I thought you were a cold person at that time.

79
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,920
But you're a brave person.

80
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,920
You can always do what you want.

81
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,920
We did a lot of things together.

82
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,920
But we never drank together.

83
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,920
Taoran,

84
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,920
I don't like people.

85
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,920
But you're a person.

86
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,920
You like cotton.

87
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,920
Right?

88
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,920
After a thousand years,

89
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,920
the alcohol level hasn't improved.

90
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,920
Can't I use it?

91
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,920
After a thousand years,

92
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,920
the leather price of the cotton hasn't gone down.

93
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,920
It's you.

94
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,920
How dare you show up?

95
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,920
Do you understand, A-You?

96
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,920
I'm not a person.

97
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,920
I'm a person.

98
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,920
I'm a person.

99
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,920
What's wrong with you?

100
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,920
Explain to me.

101
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,920
After a thousand years,

102
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,920
the old man's blessing.

103
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,920
Why did I wake up

104
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,920
twenty years earlier than you said?

105
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,920
I'm right.

106
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,920
But you have to be careful

107
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,920
to understand the meaning of the business.

108
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,920
Make it clear.

109
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,920
Actually, I came today

110
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,920
to remind you, stupid cat.

111
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,920
You can't pay back your body

112
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,920
as you want to.

113
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,920
How do you know what we want to do?

114
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,920
Because I've always cared about you two.

115
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,920
Care?

116
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,920
I think you're a ghost.

117
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,920
You'll be scattered

118
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,920
if you lose your body.

119
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,920
So what?

120
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,920
I have to solve

121
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,920
the problem.

122
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,920
I have to solve it.

123
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,920
Young people are impulsive

124
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,920
and impatient.

125
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,920
I'm not playing with you.

126
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,920
It's possible

127
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,920
to be a ghost.

128
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,920
I've always

129
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,920
listened to this music.

130
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,920
I'll lie down later.

131
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,920
When I come out,

132
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,920
you can clean up the scene.

133
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,920
But remember to leave some clues

134
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,920
that can be found.

135
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,920
Then call the police.

136
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,920
I know.

137
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,920
Do you think I'll be

138
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,920
lying down like this?

139
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,920
Or like this?

140
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,920
Or...

141
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,920
I think lying down like this is the most handsome.

142
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,920
I'm not lying.

143
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,920
Where will you go in the future?

144
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,920
What will you become?

145
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,920
I might become a cat.

146
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,920
And I'll go to the mountains and the waters

147
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,920
and wander around the world.

148
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,920
Will you

149
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,920
come back?

150
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,920
I don't know.

151
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,920
What?

152
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,920
You don't want to leave me?

153
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,920
I don't want to leave you.

154
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,920
I hope we can meet again.

155
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,920
Let's see our fate.

156
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,920
Tao Ran.

157
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,920
Goodbye.

158
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,920
What's going on?

159
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,920
Wang Haozhi.

160
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,920
Wang Haozhi.

161
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,920
Li Meng.

162
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,920
I still remember the past.

163
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,000
The

164
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,920
sweet fragrance

165
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,920
is in my hands.

166
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,920
I wander around the world

167
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,920
for the last time.

168
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,920
When I meet you,

169
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,920
I'll forget the past.

170
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,920
I'm finally

171
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,920
able to say goodbye.

172
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,920
I finally

173
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,920
forget the past.

174
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,920
I'll be by your side

175
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,920
when you're not around.
