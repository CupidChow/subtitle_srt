1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,220
The

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:07,520
The

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,800
The

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,320
The

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,960
The

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,120
You mean

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,080
Duan Sheng's body

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,840
wasn't found on site?

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,680
It's very possible.

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,320
I've looked around the lake many times.

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,800
There's no clue about the body.

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,800
Let's go and check

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,960
Duan Sheng's body.

14
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,200
Maybe we'll find something.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
No, no, no.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,760
Wait.

17
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,560
Stop.

18
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,880
Without the command of the chief,

19
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,240
no one is allowed to enter.

20
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,440
Brother Zhou.

21
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,520
We're trying to find out the truth as soon as possible

22
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,120
to reassure the students.

23
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,840
The meeting is tomorrow.

24
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,640
You'd better

25
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,000
keep the time

26
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,160
above the warm-up.

27
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,360
The case is still unclear.

28
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,360
The Emperor's Commandery is innocent.

29
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:47,920
The students

30
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,920
can't control the school with peace of mind.

31
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,760
Brother Tao,

32
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,800
I was ordered by the chief.

33
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,280
Please don't make it difficult for me.

34
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,440
If I want to enter,

35
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,400
you can stop me.

36
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,800
Brother.

37
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,240
Let's go and ask the chief for permission.

38
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,960
Chief,

39
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,360
why don't you give me a face?

40
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,400
Who's outside?

41
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,840
Chief.

42
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,280
I'm Tao Shaozhou,

43
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,760
Wang Yi's friend.

44
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,040
I'm Tao Shaozhou,

45
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,640
Wang Yizhi.

46
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,080
What's up?

47
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,360
Didn't I say

48
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,240
I was discussing something with Lord Zhang?

49
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,840
Chief, we...

50
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,520
Chief,

51
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,160
we found

52
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,920
an important clue to Duansheng's death.

53
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,640
Lord Zhang came here

54
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,880
by his life.

55
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,760
There's no way out.

56
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,720
Your current mission

57
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,640
is to get out of the way tomorrow.

58
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,240
Go back.

59
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,320
OK.

60
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,440
Chief of Evidence

61
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,960
in order to limit

62
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,040
our power banned by the refresher service.

63
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,520
Losing the peace of mind

64
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,040
is like a Minecraft crossing political cross.

65
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,040
Don't come back, or I'll kill you

66
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,040
Don't kill me

67
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,040
No

68
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,040
Don't kill me

69
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,040
Where's the knife?

70
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,040
The cat demon

71
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,040
The cat demon is coming to kill me

72
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,040
Chen Shao

73
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,040
Where's the cat demon?

74
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,040
It's me

75
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,040
It's not him

76
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,040
I destroyed the witness, I deserve it

77
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,040
The test paper of the test of the test

78
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,040
It's for the test of the test

79
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,040
The cat demon is coming to kill me

80
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,040
How could you do this?

81
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,040
I know I was wrong

82
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,040
I really know I was wrong

83
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,040
I don't want to die

84
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,040
There's no cat demon

85
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,040
You don't have to scare yourself

86
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,040
Isn't this the universe?

87
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,040
Who said the cat demon was going to kill you?

88
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,040
You should see what's behind you

89
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,040
The cat demon is just because you have the stain on your back

90
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,040
You don't have to be afraid

91
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,040
But the demon

92
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,040
What happened?

93
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,040
Zhou Xiong

94
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,040
What's going on?

95
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,040
No we didn't

96
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,040
Go to the villa

97
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,040
Someone said that they saw Huang Sheng in the school.

98
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,440
Brother Huang showed up.

99
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,640
Yes.

100
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,440
The village head is worried about everyone's safety.

101
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,240
He ordered me to search carefully.

102
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,640
Sorry to bother you.

103
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,840
That's weird.

104
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,040
If Huang Sheng is the murderer who killed Duan Sheng,

105
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,440
then why would he come back?

106
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,240
If he's not the murderer,

107
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,640
then why would he not show up?

108
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,240
There's another possibility.

109
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,640
He saw the murder,

110
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,440
and recognized the murderer.

111
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,240
Don't worry.

112
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,840
After two more days,

113
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,040
the wound should be healed.

114
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,640
The wound should be healed.

115
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,240
Don't worry.

116
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,640
After two more days,

117
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,440
the wound should be healed.

118
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,040
What's wrong?

119
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,440
Do you think my medical skills are not bad?

120
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,240
No matter how good Tao Qiong's medical skills are,

121
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,040
I can't leave Jianing.

122
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,040
It seems that tomorrow,

123
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,040
I'll be disqualified.

124
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,040
You have to give up Yin Kang.

125
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,640
We both agreed to take care of each other.

126
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,040
If so, I...

127
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,240
What?

128
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,840
You won't do it without me?

129
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,440
Or,

130
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,240
when I'm not here,

131
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,240
you don't dare to go to the officialdom alone?

132
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,840
Of course not.

133
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,840
I'm just doing it for you.

134
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,840
It's a long journey.

135
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,840
It's just a bad thing.

136
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,840
Why bother?

137
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,240
Chief.

138
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,840
Tao Sheng.

139
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,440
The exam is coming soon.

140
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,440
What's the matter?

141
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,640
About Duan Sheng's death,

142
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,040
I need to find some clues

143
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,840
about his body.

144
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,840
I hope you'll agree.

145
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,440
I'll do it.

146
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,440
Tao Sheng,

147
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,240
you're the most important clue I care about.

148
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,840
The most important thing now

149
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,440
is the body.

150
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,840
I believe that you'll be able to do it.

151
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,640
I'll do my best.

152
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,640
You'll be able to win the title.

153
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,440
As for the rest,

154
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,440
we'll discuss it later.

155
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,440
But, Chief Zhang...

156
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,440
There are three levels of people.

157
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,440
This Chief Zhang

158
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,040
is not convinced.

159
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,840
Let's go in.

160
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,240
Brother Tao.

161
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,240
Brother Zhou.

162
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,240
Brother Tao,

163
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,040
I'm sure my brother

164
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,240
will win the title.

165
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,040
By the way, where's Brother Zhou?

166
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,040
He's injured.

167
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,040
What a pity.

168
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,240
With your talent,

169
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,840
you'll be able to win the title.

170
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,440
Brother Zhou, don't be so proud.

171
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,840
With your talent,

172
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,040
you'll definitely win the title.

173
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,040
I hope so.

174
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,840
Brother Tao, please.

175
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,640
Brother Zhou, please.

176
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,640
Chief Zhang,

177
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,040
why didn't Chief Zhang

178
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,240
show up?

179
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,040
I'm also curious.

180
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,640
It's almost time.

181
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,040
Why hasn't Chief Zhang come yet?

182
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,440
Go and invite Chief Zhang.

183
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,240
Chief Zhang.

184
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,640
Chief Zhang, Chief Zhang wants to see you.

185
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,040
Chief Zhang,

186
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,040
Chief Zhang is here.

187
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,440
Chief Zhang,

188
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,240
Chief Zhang is here.

189
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,640
Chief Zhang.

190
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,840
Chief Zhang.

191
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,040
I'm here to see you.

192
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,440
I'm here to see you.

193
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,840
