1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,840
The

2
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,400
Brother

3
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,400
I saw the tears on your face

4
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,760
When?

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,400
Where?

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,720
Stop looking

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,200
Here

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:30,800
pigs

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,400
So there's someone else

10
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,040
Your chance

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,480
was this

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:55,420
The

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,840
먹을 거 핏

14
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,220
어나

15
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:17,140
Intelligent

16
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,020
I wanna know

17
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,640
Hi, so what

18
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,020
I want to ask you

19
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:35,240
The truth95

20
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,700
If I tell you everything

21
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,280
can you tell me why?

22
00:01:44,280 --> 00:02:12,660
You were

23
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,220
I don't know

24
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,060
You don't believe me, do you?

25
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,940
What are you doing?

26
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,020
There's nothing written in the book.

27
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,060
The spiritual leader is a new person.

28
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,820
He's not old or injured.

29
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,820
I've lived like this for a thousand years.

30
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,620
This is the real person.

31
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,460
This is the real person.

32
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,420
For a thousand years,

33
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,020
I've been changing my identity,

34
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,020
my address, my surname.

35
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,620
I don't have a family or friends.

36
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,020
I've lived countless false lives like this.

37
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,820
Aren't we friends?

38
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,020
A thousand years ago,

39
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,220
I had a silent family.

40
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,220
Do you remember

41
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,820
the time we first met?

42
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,620
We were always together.

43
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,220
We knew each other well.

44
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,420
We were like a perfect match.

45
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,020
But he died because of me.

46
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,420
Is this friend

47
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,620
the one you drew in your house?

48
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,820
So you think we look alike

49
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,420
and that's why you took me in and helped me,

50
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,620
right?

51
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,420
No.

52
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,220
You're not like him.

53
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,620
You are him.

54
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,620
So this time, I must protect you.

55
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,620
Tell me the truth.

56
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,820
Then I can help you.

57
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,620
I... I forgot.

58
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,620
What did I see in the first five years?

59
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,420
What I told you is different.

60
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,020
I really forgot.

61
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:17,820
I forgot.

62
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:18,620
Yes.

63
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,820
I came in 2005.

64
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,620
After I was pushed down from the cliff,

65
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,820
I finally got my life back.

66
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,020
Then I don't remember anything.

67
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,020
Then I went to 2025.

68
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,420
Then we met.

69
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:27,820
I...

70
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,220
I didn't tell you that time.

71
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,420
I was afraid I would scare you.

72
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,820
I was afraid you wouldn't believe me.

73
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,820
Someone wanted to hurt you.

74
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:37,820
Who is it?

75
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,820
I don't think

76
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,620
I can see your face clearly.

77
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,020
So you came to the library

78
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,020
to find a way to get through?

79
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:46,620
Yes.

80
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,820
But I haven't summed up the rules.

81
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,620
Since you came in 2005,

82
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,820
you must find a way to get through.

83
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,420
But the murderer didn't find it.

84
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,220
Even if you go back, you'll still be in danger.

85
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,620
Indeed.

86
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,820
So I want to go back this time

87
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,020
and find clues.

88
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,420
Then what did you find?

89
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,220
I found this.

90
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,420
I saw this on the crime scene.

91
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,020
The murderer must have left it.

92
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,020
But you lost all your memories.

93
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,220
Maybe this is yours.

94
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,020
Look at the carving and the carvings.

95
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,020
They are so detailed.

96
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,420
I'm a student.

97
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,820
I can't afford it.

98
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,820
I can find its source.

99
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,020
I have a way.

100
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,420
This pen is a limited edition

101
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,820
of the gold factory in your name.

102
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,820
There were five of them in total.

103
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,620
Four were bought by foreign buyers.

104
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,020
And there is one more.

105
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,220
Xinshan University.

106
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,820
But the information from 20 years ago

107
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,020
is not in the electronic file.

108
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,420
We can't find the whereabouts of the pen.

109
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,820
Then can you check it?

110
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,620
Is it a polite risk

111
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,020
to talk to your friend's sister?

112
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,420
Stop pretending.

113
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,820
I knew you weren't her sister.

114
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,620
Time has passed.

115
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,420
I haven't had the time to tell you.

116
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,420
Brother Wang knows everything.

117
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,420
Brother Wang.

118
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,420
Her ancestor is Huang Xiao Mei.

119
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,420
Huang Xiao Mei.

120
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,820
A thousand years ago,

121
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,620
her brother and I studied in Xinshan Academy.

122
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,220
Then we were in danger.

123
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,420
I took over her.

124
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,820
The Huang family has been

125
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,220
helping me with business.

126
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,220
How did she know?

127
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,620
We went through something

128
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,820
extraordinary together.

129
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:55,620
We...

130
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,820
You went through it.

131
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,220
You remember?

132
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,220
I didn't have the time to check it yesterday.

133
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,820
But today,

134
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,220
I suddenly have more memories.

135
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,420
I remember

136
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,620
you came back from your mom's funeral.

137
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,820
She was with you.

138
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,220
This is extraordinary.

139
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,020
I thought you wouldn't believe it.

140
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:17,820
After all,

141
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,620
I've seen some incredible people since I was a kid.

142
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,420
Is it possible to be a bad person?

143
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,020
We don't have much time.

144
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,220
Let's go check it.

145
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,020
Wait.

146
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,220
I have some important documents.

147
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,620
I need you to sign it.

148
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,820
Wait for me outside.

149
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,420
I'll come to you when I'm done.

150
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,620
What do you want to say?

151
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,620
July 12, 2005.

152
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,620
It's not the first time I've seen her.

153
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,420
What do you mean?

154
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,420
I'm sorry.

155
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,420
I'm sorry.

156
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,420
I'm sorry.

157
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,420
I'm sorry.

158
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,420
I'm sorry.

159
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,420
I'm sorry.

160
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,420
I'm sorry.

161
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,420
I'm sorry.

162
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,420
I'm sorry.

163
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,420
I'm sorry.

164
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,420
I'm sorry.

165
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,420
I'm sorry.

166
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,420
I'm sorry.

167
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,420
I'm sorry.

168
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,420
I'm sorry.

169
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,420
I'm sorry.

170
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,420
I'm sorry.

171
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,420
I'm sorry.

172
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,420
I'm sorry.

173
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,420
I'm sorry.

174
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,420
I'm sorry.

175
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,420
I'm sorry.

176
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,420
I'm sorry.

177
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,420
I'm sorry.

178
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,420
I'm sorry.

179
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,420
I'm sorry.

180
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,420
I'm sorry.

181
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,420
I'm sorry.

182
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,420
I'm sorry.

183
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,420
I'm sorry.

184
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,420
I'm sorry.

185
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,420
I'm sorry.

186
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,420
I'm sorry.

187
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,420
I'm sorry.

188
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,420
I'm sorry.

189
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,420
I'm sorry.

190
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,420
I'm sorry.

191
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,420
I'm sorry.

192
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,420
I'm sorry.

193
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,420
