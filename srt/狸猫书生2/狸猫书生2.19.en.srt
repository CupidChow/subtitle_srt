1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
Whileoko

2
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,520
I wouldn't let you get Catecholitis

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,680
Let me do it.

4
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,720
Today, I invite you all here

5
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,120
to tell you a secret.

6
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,560
Didn't you keep saying

7
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,000
that there's a demon in the academy?

8
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,200
That demon

9
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,920
is the chief.

10
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,960
Chief?

11
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,360
Chief is a demon?

12
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,920
Are you a demon?

13
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:03,960
Your Majesty,

14
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,080
why are you so angry with me?

15
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,160
Today,

16
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,720
I'll expel you from the academy.

17
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,240
Expel me?

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,080
Thank you.

19
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:18,960
Let's go.

20
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,080
The one standing in front of us

21
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,640
is not the chief of our King of Yang.

22
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,280
It's Li Wude who threatened us

23
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,640
and took the chief's skin.

24
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,320
Why did you expel Li Wude?

25
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,040
Your Majesty,

26
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,280
my mother is so crazy.

27
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,640
Come on.

28
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,200
Tie him up.

29
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,000
Lock him up.

30
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,200
You take one more step.

31
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,040
Believe it or not,

32
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,680
I'll stab my own heart right now.

33
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,360
You don't want to get the Dragon Heart.

34
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,080
Don't do anything rash.

35
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,400
Back off.

36
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,400
After Li Wude and the demon threatened the trade,

37
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,040
he killed the chief

38
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,960
and started to sell the student strategy.

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,880
The whole province

40
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,240
has been used by Li Wude

41
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,280
and killed Mr. Zhang,

42
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,200
who was in discord with Li Wude.

43
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,160
Your story is really wonderful.

44
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,240
But you forgot the most important part.

45
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,840
Where is the evidence?

46
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,800
This is the evidence you want.

47
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,240
These things

48
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,280
are also evidence?

49
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,840
Also evidence?

50
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,080
I think you are not a man of your words.

51
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,640
Bring him up.

52
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:36,840
What?

53
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,000
You don't dare to do it?

54
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,320
Okay.

55
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,200
I'll go in and see.

56
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,800
No.

57
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,680
Chief Fan?

58
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,760
Chief Fan?

59
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,560
What's going on?

60
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,240
Why is it Chief Fan's body?

61
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,520
What's going on?

62
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,320
Maybe your Downtown comes.

63
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,660
I found it

64
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,080
in the moment when

65
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,280
I saw the body of Fanzhou Tong.

66
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,600
But I've also figured out

67
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,080
why that student Picco

68
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,680
killed himself.

69
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,440
That body

70
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,280
had no smoke.

71
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,960
Obviously not burnt to death.

72
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,520
It was buried by someone else.

73
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:22,600
That student

74
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,240
conducted a kinda high force work.

75
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,200
Zhou Sheng?

76
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,000
After Fan Shutong asked about it,

77
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,280
Zhou Sheng knew that Ling Longxi

78
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,280
could revive Fan Shutong.

79
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,600
So he killed Li Wude

80
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,640
and replaced the chief.

81
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,280
Am I right?

82
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,960
Zhou Sheng.

83
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,520
Zhou Sheng.

84
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,040
Didn't Zhou Sheng pass away?

85
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,120
I didn't expect that I did so well.

86
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,880
You found out my true identity.

87
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,200
The Last Supper

88
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,280
It's up to you

89
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,040
whether you want to save Fan Shutong.

90
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,240
You must save the person

91
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,440
but you must die.

92
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,840
You taught me that

93
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,120
only the dead

94
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,160
can keep secrets.

95
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,920
I will example by example,

96
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,400
and then injury will occur.

97
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,280
If you want to save the person,

98
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,120
come back and

99
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,240
say it.

100
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,840
Why do you come back?

101
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,160
I think

102
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,720
the time has come.

103
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,720
Not yet.

104
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,400
Don't wait for too long.

105
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,160
We'll talk in the dressing room.

106
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,840
InsãƒŸon doctrina,

107
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,840
I'm not afraid of you

108
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,840
Not bad

109
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,840
I killed him

110
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,840
Do you think you can stop me?

111
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,840
And us

112
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,840
Yes

113
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,840
Today all students of our Qing Shan Academy

114
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,840
will not allow you to harass the Academy

115
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,840
and the people

116
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,840
Yes, we will not allow

117
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,840
You can't stop me

118
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,840
Go

119
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,840
Wang Shen

120
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,840
I will use the lives of these students today

121
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,840
to exchange your spirit

122
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,840
Right?

123
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,840
If you can't bear it

124
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,840
I will kill them one by one in front of you

125
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,840
You are despicable

126
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,840
I will scold you as you like

127
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,840
As long as I can revive the school

128
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,840
So what if I am sad and scolding the people?

129
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,840
I will ask you again

130
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,840
Will you exchange your spirit or not?

131
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,840
The youth exchanged their eyes

132
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,840
Stop

133
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,840
The common innocence

134
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,840
is a good chance to have a good dream

135
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,840
In fact, I didn't want to come back alive

136
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,840
The lonely spirit willing to be a threat

137
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,840
I can give you the spirit

138
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,840
But you have to promise me one thing

139
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,840
The only possibility

140
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,840
From now on

141
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,840
Give me a place to go to Qing Shan Academy

142
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,840
It's a deal

143
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,840
Xiao Yi, I'm coming

144
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,840
The dragon and the beast will come back to life

145
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,840
The dragon and the beast will come back to life

146
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,840
The dragon and the beast will come back to life

147
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,840
Where are you?

148
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,840
Why?

149
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,840
No

150
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,840
Don't smoke me

151
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,840
Give me

152
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,840
I have been away from you

153
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,840
You are free now

154
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,840
You know

155
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,840
Taoist won't do this to me

156
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,840
The fake mountain chief thinks you are the one who has the spirit

157
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,840
If he uses your heart to activate the seven-death revival

158
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,840
He will be counteracted by the formation

159
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,840
And destroy himself

160
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,840
Of course, you can also stay away from this place

161
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,840
You don't have to sacrifice yourself to live your free life

162
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,840
You are so mean

163
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,840
You have planned everything

164
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,840
Who knows if you will break the idea of saving the spirit

165
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,840
That's my business

166
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,840
It's over

167
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,840
God

168
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,840
What can you do to me?

169
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,840
Of course, you can also stay away from this place

170
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,840
You don't have to sacrifice yourself to live your free life

171
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,840
Whether you want to be the one who has the spirit

172
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,840
It's your business

173
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,840
I'm here

174
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,840
I'm here

175
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,840
I'm here

176
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,840
I'm here

177
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,840
I'm here

178
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,840
I'm here

179
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,840
I'm here

180
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,840
I'm here

181
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,840
I'm here

182
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,840
I'm here

183
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,840
I'm here

184
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,840
I'm here

185
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,840
I'm here

186
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,840
I'm here

187
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,840
I'm here

188
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,840
I'm here

189
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,840
I'm here

190
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,840
I'm here

191
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,840
I'm here

192
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,840
I'm here

193
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,840
I'm here

194
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,840
