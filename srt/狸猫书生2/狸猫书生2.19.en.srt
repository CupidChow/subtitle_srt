00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
Hello Mr. Jia

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:15,920
Mr. Qing

3
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,160
What are you doing?

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm hungry.

5
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,160
I want to eat.

6
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:33,920
Tao Ran,

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,920
live well.

8
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,040
I want to eat.

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,480
Li Bai!

10
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,000
Why

11
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,900
are you filming this?

12
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,600
I will take it home.

13
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,680
It's over.

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,620
Jacket.

15
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,380
Rstellen

16
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,600
Li Meng

17
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,600
You're still here?

18
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,600
I'm too tired.

19
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,600
I won't accompany you any longer.

20
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,600
It's too late to say goodbye.

21
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,600
I think...

22
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,600
Your tears this time...

23
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,600
are for me, right?

24
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
I really want to tell you...

25
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,600
about the past.

26
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,600
So...

27
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,600
you've always been in my life.

28
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,600
I'm sorry, Brother Tao.

29
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,600
Then why did you save me?

30
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,600
The path to the future...

31
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,600
is for you to go alone.

32
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Can we...

33
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,600
see each other again?

34
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,600
Brother Tao...

35
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
I'm sorry.

36
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,600
The path to the future

37
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
Hey, you!

38
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,600
You lied to me!

39
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,600
What did I lie to you about?

40
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Didn't he solve his life and death knot?

41
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
Why didn't he come back?

42
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
I didn't lie to you.

43
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,600
It's just that if you have a new choice,

44
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,600
you'll have a new cause and effect.

45
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,600
A new choice?

46
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,600
The moonlight is shining in the dark night

47
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,600
The endless spring and autumn are waiting

48
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,600
The snow-colored leaves are speaking on the ground

49
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,600
I open the home of time

50
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,600
The sand building in between turns into a battlefield

51
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,600
The old words are hiding the words of danger

52
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,600
The old words are hiding the words of danger

53
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,600
I pick up all the mistakes

54
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,600
Waiting for a light to light up the window

55
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,600
I still remember the past of the moon and the mountains

56
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,600
The heartbeats will be engraved in my palm

57
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,600
I will travel for a thousand years to exchange for a look

58
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,600
Waiting for a light to light up the past

59
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,600
I was finally able to say goodbye

60
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,600
I finally walked out of the wall I had forgotten

61
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:06,600
I will be by your side when there is no more waves
