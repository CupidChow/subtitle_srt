1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,360
Xia Woah

2
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,800
I won't be back

3
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,520
I can't go back

4
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,720
Shou are you alright

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,720
Let's go after Zhou Shen.

6
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,720
When you drink, you should drink.

7
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,720
How is life?

8
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,720
I've been studying and building my wisdom since I was young.

9
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,720
I will have a great achievement in the future.

10
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,720
I didn't expect to be like this.

11
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,720
God, why are you so unfair to me?

12
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,720
You got all of this.

13
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,720
I got all of this?

14
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,720
If it wasn't for Duan Shen bullying and bullying my young master,

15
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,720
how could I kill him?

16
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,720
If Zhang Daren is a good official,

17
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,720
why did he threaten me?

18
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,720
I was forced to do all of this.

19
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,720
I and the little hidden men are the people of Dunhuo.

20
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,720
I never thought I would be so killed.

21
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,720
If you are really people of Dunhuo,

22
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,720
after Fan Shutong killed Duan Shen,

23
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,720
what you should do is not to hide it for him,

24
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,720
but to let Fan Shutong take the responsibility.

25
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,720
You should be responsible for what you did.

26
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,720
Fan Shutong took the responsibility.

27
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,720
If Fan Shutong killed the wrong person,

28
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,720
the government will punish him.

29
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,720
I dare not to bet.

30
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,720
Duan Shen is a member of the official family.

31
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,720
His family won't let us go.

32
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,720
I'm afraid the officials will protect each other.

33
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,720
I will be the first to read the mirror.

34
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,720
The officials will protect each other and kill each other.

35
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,720
These are just your guesses.

36
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,720
You did this for nothing.

37
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,720
The result is

38
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,720
Xiao Yin's secret. You are going to regret it.

39
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,720
Duan Shen,

40
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,720
can you promise me

41
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,720
if Xiao Yin was caught for killing Duan Shen,

42
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,720
the officials will protect each other?

43
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,720
I can't promise.

44
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,720
But we are students of Qingshan Academy.

45
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,720
Our original goal is to be an official

46
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,720
who is loyal to the people and does good for the people.

47
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,720
If you suspect all this,

48
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,720
what you should do is to change him.

49
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,720
Now,

50
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,720
it's too late to say anything.

51
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,720
Xiao Yin died for me.

52
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,720
Today, I will give my life back to him.

53
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,720
Give it back to the emperor.

54
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,720
The Emperor of anti-intr uncontrollable

55
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,000
No!

56
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,120
No!

57
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,720
I'm really fine.

58
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,480
Look.

59
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,280
Such a magical event.

60
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,280
You were bleeding yesterday.

61
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,120
But you don't have any scars today.

62
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,720
I've been like this since I was a kid.

63
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,400
When I was a kid,

64
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,320
I was playing with my friends in the village.

65
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,120
I was accidentally cut by a grasshopper.

66
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,640
The wound healed

67
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,080
after I put on the clothes.

68
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,200
They were afraid of me.

69
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,640
They said I was a demon.

70
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,720
Gradually,

71
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,480
Iоеd cut off the nerve.

72
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,760
I…

73
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,080
The knife didn't cut off

74
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,320
it right in my West Rebel's face.

75
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,800
Are you afraid of me?

76
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,680
Don't you?

77
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,160
No.

78
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,960
I was afraid I was a monster

79
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,320
and I might hurt you.

80
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,320
I don't have time to think about it.

81
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,320
I'm just afraid you'll get hurt.

82
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,320
You're really not wrong.

83
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,120
You're scarier than a monster.

84
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,520
Because I was called a monster since I was little,

85
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,520
I can understand people's misunderstanding of monsters.

86
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,320
Whoever says that a monster is evil,

87
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:06,720
then some people are worse and more fierce than the monster he calls a monster.

88
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,120
That's right.

89
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,120
Humans are worse and more cunning than monsters.

90
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,720
It's not entirely true.

91
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,120
Most of the students in our academy are pure people.

92
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,520
They are all hardworking and hardworking,

93
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,120
so that they can do something for the sake of the future and help the people.

94
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,320
Aren't we the same?

95
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,320
I don't know about others.

96
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,920
I only know that you are.

97
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,320
Bear with it.

98
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,120
What?

99
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,920
Chief.

100
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,720
Sit.

101
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,520
I heard that Tao Sheng got hurt.

102
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,120
I asked the kitchen to cook some soup for you.

103
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,720
Thank you for your concern.

104
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,720
I don't know if Suo Ye got hurt.

105
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,520
Why are you still in the room?

106
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,320
I used some medicine just now.

107
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,520
The wound is now open.

108
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,520
It's good that you're fine. You should rest well.

109
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,920
These days, you've been working hard for the academy's case.

110
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,920
The academy should give you a good lesson.

111
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,720
After you finish the rest of the work,

112
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,720
I'll report it to the court

113
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,320
to leave a good impression for your future.

114
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,320
Thank you, Chief.

115
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,120
I heard that Wang Sheng was also injured in surgery.

116
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,720
How is he now?

117
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,720
He's fine now.

118
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,520
Look. There are no traces.

119
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,520
That's good.

120
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,920
You and Tao Sheng are both my favorite students.

121
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,720
Tao Sheng will definitely win this year.

122
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,520
You should add more warm welcome.

123
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,120
Next time, it will be your turn.

124
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,320
Thank you, Chief.

125
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,720
Okay. I won't disturb you.

126
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,920
Goodbye, Chief.

127
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,720
Why are you like this?

128
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,720
You'll get better soon.

129
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,520
I can't just come here.

130
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,320
If others know your ability,

131
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,120
I'm afraid it will be bad for you.

132
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,920
I know you're a good actor.

133
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,320
But you're not a person without knowledge.

134
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,320
You should be fine.

135
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,520
The more good-natured you are, the more evil you are.

136
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,120
You're talking behind my back again.

137
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,720
I've told you, Chief.

138
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,320
Okay.

139
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,120
Let's not talk about him.

140
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,320
Let me see how your hand is.

141
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,820
delay

142
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,720
I'm willing to sacrifice my life for the sake of the world

143
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,320
I'm willing to sacrifice my life for the sake of the world

144
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,720
To fight for justice for the world

145
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,920
I'll break free from the maze and find the only possibility

146
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,920
Young people in the world are as free as the wind

147
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,920
The blue sky is as gentle as the stars

148
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,120
Even if the gold and the gold are left behind

149
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,920
We will never surrender

150
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,120
Young people who live in the waves

151
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,320
As time goes by, things may go wrong

152
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:19,320
But we will make the world better
