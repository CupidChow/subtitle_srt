00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Liu Wanzhou

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
He was a student in Qing Shan University in 2005

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
He was found by Wang Haozhi

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
for stealing from students

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
He was killed

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
On July 5th, 2005

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Liu Wanzhou accused Wang Haozhi of being uneducated

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and pushed Wang Haozhi down the cliff

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This is the place mentioned in the book of Li Mao

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Xi Bin, Wang Haozhi's roommate

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
For the only study abroad

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
he was still defeated by Wang Haozhi

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
When he knew Wang Haozhi was going to tell this

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
he kept observing in secret

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
but found Liu Wanzhou killing people

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Later, he found Wang Haozhi still had a breath

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
so he moved the stone and smashed it

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
causing fatal injury

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
He was killed by Wang Haozhi

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and his body was found on the hill

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So after I came back to Wang Haozhi

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I saw a big wound on my right ear

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
At that time, the royal mother stopped

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
to look for Wang Haozhi in the mountain

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I was so scared

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I was so scared

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I was so scared

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I was so scared

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I was so scared

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I was so scared

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I was so scared

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I was so scared

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I was so scared

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I was so scared

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I was so scared

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I was so scared

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I was so scared

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I was so scared

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I was so scared

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So he quickly went to the nearby

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
the tools of the five-storied palace

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and touched the car

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
causing the second murder case

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Everything is as he thought

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Liu Wanzhou thought he was the murderer

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and the car accident of royal mother

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
was considered an accident

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He got the study permit like this

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
and spent 20 years in a safe place abroad

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Twenty years later

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Qi Bin saw Wang Haozhi who was killed by him

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
appeared again

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
This student is

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Liu Wanzhou, who is a thief, sneaked into my house

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I want to figure out who you are

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Finally, you entered the college as a student

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
He was in a mess but there was nothing to lose

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I just didn't expect

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Qi Bin is the one behind this

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Until the incident

64
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
In 2005, Qi Bin saw Wang Haozhi who was killed by him

65
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
and returned to the campus alive

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Many people were following me

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So in 2005

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
except Liu Wanzhou

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
there was Qi Bin

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
He kept watching our crossing

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
and he kept refreshing his memory

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So when you returned to the student's dorm

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
to find evidence

74
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Qi Bin was already

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
in a state of shock

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
When he got nothing

77
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
he was so determined

78
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
to burn all the evidence

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
just in case

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
He saw me again

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
so he took a step back

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Who is it?

83
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So the fire was on the scene

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
He was there too

85
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The key is here

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The jar is made of a dinosaur shell

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The inside is made of human bones

88
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Why do we need to use the amazic acid to make the fiber?

89
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Amazic acid is used to make the fiber

90
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and it can be used to make the fiber

91
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
What is the white powder?

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's white spirit

93
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
White spirit will slow down the oxidation

94
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What temperature?

95
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It controls oxygen flow

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Less than ten minutes

97
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The murderer designed it like this

98
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
He wanted to burn the whole dorm

99
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
so he just burned the whole dorm

100
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
One last question

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Where did the murderer get so many white spirits?

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Qi Bin

103
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Wang Hao Zhi knows how to read

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
But he has to try to plan

105
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
and chemical chemistry

106
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
He has the right to enter and exit the chemistry lab

107
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's very simple to find the white spirit

108
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Through the location of white spirit's remains and fingerprints

109
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
we can judge

110
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Qi Bin must have used the amazic acid

111
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So we have to go back

112
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But with Wang Hao Zhi's death

113
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
can we convict Qi Bin?

114
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
After all, I

115
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
As long as the whole evidence chain is formed

116
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
even without the body

117
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
the police can also make a case

118
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Through the evidence we found

119
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
and his motive for murder

120
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
we can find out the truth

121
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Are you sure?

122
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
After seven days

123
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
we can bring the murderer to justice

124
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Wait for a light to light up the window

125
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I still remember the past

126
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The heart will be engraved in my palm

127
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Let a thousand years of wandering

128
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
change a look

129
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Wait for a light to light up the past

130
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
The end has also been fulfilled

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I finally walk out of the wall of the past

132
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I will be by your side
