1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The King of Blaze

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Episode 1

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,000
I'll lie down later.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,320
When I come out, you can clean up the scene.

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,280
But remember to leave some clues that can be found.

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,000
Then call the police.

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,240
Tao Ran.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Goodbye.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Wang Xiao Zhi.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Wang Xiao Zhi.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,240
Are you calling Li Mao or Wang Xiao Zhi?

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What's wrong with Li Mao?

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Li Mao can still be saved for a while.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
As long as you are willing to give out your heart.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
My heart.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Li Mao can only be reborn in Wang Xiao Zhi.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
He just forced himself to leave his body.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
In fact, he is already in a state of mind.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I can't refuse.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
If you are willing to give your heart to him.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Li Mao will be able to avoid death.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm willing.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Then you...

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm willing.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
As long as you can save him.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Wait, I haven't finished talking yet.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
But you can only become an ordinary person.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
After all, the pain of being old and dying.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Then I'm willing.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I already understand.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The old man that Yu Yan pointed out is not Wang Xiao at all.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But Li Mao.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm willing.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
As long as you can save him.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Even if you become an ordinary person, so what?

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Still the same old look from a thousand years ago.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Wang Xiao Zhi.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Li Mao.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm willing.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm willing.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm willing.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm willing.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Li Mao.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Li Mao.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Last time you decided to show your soul.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Not only did you break his life and death knot.

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You also broke his prophecy.

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Li Mao changed the past.

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So the bad guy got punished.

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The other people in 2005 don't remember you two.

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But I helped a lot with this.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
If the one who is suspicious of me.

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The other person will be forced to live and die.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So as long as I'm alive.

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
He must still be somewhere.

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But without the spirit.

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You are just a mortal.

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Will die and forget.

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Maybe he hasn't come back yet.

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You have forgotten him.

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I won't forget him.

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I won't forget him.

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Please line up behind us.

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Don't be so crowded.

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Welcome to the new book release of Li Mao's Book of Life.

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's a story about the truth.

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The Li Mao written in the book is not a bad guy.

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
He changed the past with a young man.

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Teacher, can you sign for me.

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Xu Zhi Shao is Liu Yun Zhi.

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The top of the Jin Zhao paper.

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Sign it.

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
My name is Wang Yi Zhi.

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
How old are you?

75
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Teacher Tao.

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Today is his twenty-first birthday.

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Sign a happy birthday for him.

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Okay.

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Teacher Xin.

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Really.

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Look at it.

82
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Look at it.

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Look at it.

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Good.

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Brother.

86
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Your chest seems to be glowing.

87
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
My chest has been glowing for twenty-one years.

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Good boy.

89
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Don't run around.

90
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You're leaving.

91
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
How is it?

92
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I just said this signing event was not bad.

93
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Of course.

94
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I just said that they would like to write my story.

95
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's our story.

96
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
The first autumn flower

97
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I pick up all the poems

98
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Waiting for a light and clear window

99
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I still remember the past

100
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The heart beats and the smile is in my hands

101
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Wandering for a thousand years

102
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I still remember the past

103
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Wandering for a thousand years

104
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I still remember the past

105
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The end of the past is over

106
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I finally walk out of the wall I have forgotten

107
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I will be with you when you are not wandering

108
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I will be with you when you are not wandering

109
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The End
