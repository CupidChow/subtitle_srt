1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
otras

2
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,760
ups

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,080
What's that?

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,900
Maybe..

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,360
you can

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,040
make a fresh start

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,240
No

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:28,900
No

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If you could survive, I'd rather not see you.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hey, Lin Longxin, I didn't approve of your death.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Who are you? How do you know I have a heart?

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Wang Xiong!

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What did you do?

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What did you do?

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
There's a place for him to go.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Fate is unpredictable.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Don't be too persistent.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Listen to me.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You two are destined to be entangled.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Just like this thread.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Remember my words.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
After a thousand years, the old man will meet again.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
He will try again.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Whether this thread can be untied or not,

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
it will still depend on your choices.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Will I appear again after a thousand years?

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Why do you both like to ask questions?

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You're so wrong.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But why should I believe you?

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I've shown you so many love stories.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You still don't believe me?

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Wang Xiong?

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Tao Xiong, see you after a thousand years.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Tao Xiong.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Tao Xiong.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Tao Xiong.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Tao Xiong.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Tao Xiong.

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Tao Xiong.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Tao Xiong.

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Tao Xiong.

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Tao Xiong.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Tao Xiong.

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Tao Xiong.

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Tao Xiong.

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Tao Xiong.

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Tao Xiong.

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Tao Xiong.

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Tao Xiong.

52
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Tao Xiong.

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Tao Xiong.

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Tao Xiong.

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Tao Xiong.

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Tao Xiong.

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Tao Xiong.

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Tao Xiong.

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Tao Xiong.

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Tao Xiong.

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Tao Xiong.

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Tao Xiong.

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Tao Xiong.

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Tao Xiong.

65
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Tao Sh Spy.

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Tao Sh S pepper man, Tao Shiri.

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,920
Bell D Listenome,

68
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,040
Feeling the menu,

69
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,760
You ready for a trepidation

70
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,000
To get it right with the best

71
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Together,

72
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
We'll make itisters

73
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,800
Brother.

74
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm too nervous.

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,360
It's okay. We'll wait together.

76
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,560
Lie down now.

77
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,560
Every time I go through the hospital, I lose my ability.

78
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,960
I have to hurry up.

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,720
Let's go.

80
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,160
If we walk all the way from the library,

81
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,600
will there be no one following us?

82
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,000
No.

83
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,400
We are much more cautious this time.

84
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,200
Wang Haojun!

85
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,000
What's wrong?

86
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,800
I think someone is calling you.

87
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,400
Where?

88
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,600
Come here.

89
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,200
You brat.

90
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,800
Do you know how much I worry about you?

91
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,400
I'm not going to tell you.

92
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,000
You didn't answer my call.

93
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,200
Your mom can't eat or sleep these days.

94
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,000
She cries at home all day.

95
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,600
Be quiet.

96
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,400
Wife, I know.

97
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,200
Hurry up and come in and help me.

98
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,600
Eat more later.

99
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,200
Wife, I'm coming.

100
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,400
You have a good future in this life.

101
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,400
I'm going to help you.

102
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,600
I'm going to help you.

103
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,200
You have good parents in this life.

104
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,200
They all love you.

105
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,400
Your mom is too fierce.

106
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,800
She's soft-hearted.

107
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,200
Look at those pictures on the wall.

108
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,000
They are all beautiful memories.

109
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,200
If you can't remember, it's too sad.

110
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,800
Eat.

111
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,600
You didn't like fish before, but now you like it.

112
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,600
You know your family is doing well, right?

113
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,400
Yes.

114
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,600
Good student, you're quite private.

115
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,400
Watch her more often.

116
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,000
Hao Zhi is a good student.

117
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,400
Don't worry, uncle and aunt.

118
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,200
Okay, I'll go.

119
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,400
Stop talking. Your son is back.

120
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,000
You have to open a business for me tomorrow.

121
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,800
Okay.

122
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,800
Uncle, are you familiar with cars?

123
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,600
Of course. I'm an old technician for 20 years.

124
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,600
Do you see cars falling from high places,

125
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,400
crashing and exploding?

126
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,800
If the fuel tank is seriously damaged,

127
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,600
it will hit a very serious hit.

128
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,200
But the probability of this explosion is very small.

129
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,800
Is there a possibility that...

130
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,800
I mean,

131
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,400
the car will fall from a very high place,

132
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,000
but it will definitely explode.

133
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,200
In that case,

134
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,600
if the fuel tank is hit by low-pressure fuel,

135
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:55,200
even a small hit will cause a serious explosion.

136
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,800
But the premise is that the fuel tank will be damaged,

137
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,600
even a small hole is enough.

138
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,200
If there's a small hole in the car,

139
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,000
can it still start?

140
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,400
If the distance is not far, it can run for a while.

141
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,800
What kind of fuel is that?

142
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,400
For example, the low-pressure fuel is very low,

143
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,200
but the possibility is very small.

144
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,800
Think about it. How can the fuel tank be hit by this kind of low-pressure fuel?

145
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,200
Son, what do you want to ask?

146
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,600
Nothing. Just casually asking.

147
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,800
Just eat. What are you chatting about?

148
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,400
Eat. Eat more.

149
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,000
Okay. Eat more.

150
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,200
From here, we will go to the Ye Shan parking lot. It's about three minutes.

151
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,000
The time the car will leave the parking lot is 3.10 pm.

152
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The murderer has enough time to buy the tools.

153
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,400
Now, make a small hole in the fuel tank and apply the low-pressure fuel.

154
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
We will arrive at the car accident scene in five minutes.

155
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,200
First, put the driver's seat on the car. Then, release the brake and let the car fall off.

156
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,600
Then, Monk, the time of the explosion is 3.45 pm.

157
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,600
Let's go ask the owner. Is there anyone suspicious?

158
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,000
Let's go.

159
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,000
Wake up.

160
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,800
Boss, is there a low-pressure fuel sale in your store?

161
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,800
Yes.

162
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,200
Did anyone come on July 5th?

163
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,400
Of course, I remember.

164
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,000
Buy it or not, buy it or not, then let's go.

165
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,600
Can you film that surveillance camera?

166
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,600
Why should I show it to you?

167
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,400
Buy it or not, buy it or not, then let's go.

168
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,400
This? Can you see it?

169
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,600
Okay. You guys are always fighting.

170
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,000
I will monitor it for 30 days and cover it.

171
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,400
You won't be able to see it in two days. I will call you guys.

172
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,400
Go look around.

173
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,800
The murderer wanted this.

174
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,400
There was a man who came to buy a low-pressure fuel.

175
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,400
He also bought a small table. Hurry and come in and take a look.

176
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,600
Oh no!

177
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,000
You guys...

178
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,200
Where is he?

179
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,800
We are so close.

180
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,600
If we go back next time, we will definitely not be able to get the footage.

181
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,400
Because of the restrictions of the crossing, we are too passive.

182
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,000
What else can we do in 2025?

183
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Do we have to wait for another few days?

184
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,200
The longer we wait, the more we hope for?

185
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
We will still have a chance to go back next time.

186
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,800
Didn't you also promise your parents that you will go back?

187
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,900
People said once you let parents see you come back,

188
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,800
you can be at ease.

189
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,480
I just can't let you put us through.

190
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,280
東西

191
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,200
That's true.

192
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,720
On a safe journey,

193
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,000
you don't always need to it.

194
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,360
console father

195
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,760
Give him this is a joke.

196
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,160
He bit me for unusual reasons.

197
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,720
Actually I was angry,

198
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,360
I'll keep it in my hands

199
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,840
Wandering through the thousand years

200
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,600
I'll look back once again

201
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,480
I'll wait for the light to bury the past

202
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,720
I was finally able to say goodbye

203
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,200
I finally walked out of my past

204
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,720
I'll be by your side when you're not wandering anymore
