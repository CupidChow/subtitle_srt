1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
Man's 50's

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,000
King's 100

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,540
King's 50

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,540
Firstly, phase two

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,660
All I take is this

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:19,040
Wait

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,380
Excuse me. Make way

8
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:22,540
Make way

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,960
Back there,

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,280
they had a special invention.

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,660
The dial lounge.

12
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:48,880
It is the body matter.

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:49,800
We found it!

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,560
It was written on aggression.

15
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,380
galera!

16
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:54,360
Done!

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,680
I signed!

18
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,780
Can't believe you're that cunning,

19
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,640
UNDY!

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I blame the murderer for being too cruel.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's because I pity Xiao Mei.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
She lost her only family in this world.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Brother is dead.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We have a test against Xiao Mei.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Protect the brothers!

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Let us out!

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Stop!

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What are you doing?

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Please let us go.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yes, if you don't let us out, we will die.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yes.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You are all cowardly.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
How can you be my students?

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Now the government hasn't sent people to come.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You are in the academy.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You can't escape from it.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The murder case is one by one.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Everyone says it's a murder.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
We dare not stay.

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yes, we can't stay.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Students, listen to me.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
We are in the Qing Shan Academy.

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We are in the academy.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We will be officials in the future.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The evil and evil we face

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
are more dangerous than today's situation.

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
If you are afraid of this,

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
you should quit the academy.

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You can talk about your good words.

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You can talk about your revenge.

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Well said.

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Applause.

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I never believed in the evil.

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The more so, the more I want to find out the real murderer.

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Today, I will tell you the truth.

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I will be your student.

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I promise you.

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I will find the murderer in three days.

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I will find out the truth.

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Please allow me.

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Tao Sheng's words are very touching.

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's the students' vision.

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Supervisor Zhou,

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
cooperate with Tao Sheng to solve the case as soon as possible.

65
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes.

66
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Go back.

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But the murder is so dangerous.

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Who knows if I will be the next one to be killed?

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yes.

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The murderer's most strange way of killing is not to pull the snake and bend its eyes

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
and cut the ears.

72
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Instead, he issued a murder notice in advance

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
to make the victim guilty.

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Duan Sheng did have the role of a classmate in the forest.

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Mr. Zhang's story of destroying people's future is also interesting.

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm afraid that only you can solve this mystery now.

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Interesting.

78
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's really interesting.

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Why is it interesting?

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You just agreed to investigate the case.

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
He must not have thought that the first case you investigated was him.

82
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm not investigating you.

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I just want to figure out the motive of the murderer

84
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
to destroy people's future.

85
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Maybe it's like what Yu Yan said.

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The murderer is doing this to spread justice and kill people.

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Then is my brother's death also spreading justice?

88
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Let's go.

89
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Supervisor.

90
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Sit down.

91
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The tea is really good for you.

92
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Supervisor, you know that I will come.

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You probably want to ask me

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
why Mr. Zhang is the one who destroyed people's future.

95
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Supervisor is really a very deep person.

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Actually, this matter will be exposed sooner or later.

97
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Speaking of which, I also want to investigate this case.

98
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm afraid that I can't do it.

99
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm afraid that I can't do it.

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Speaking of which, I also feel ashamed.

101
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Mr. Zhang came here this time.

102
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
His name is the governor.

103
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
He only wants to read the book and buy the students' theory.

104
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Buy the theory?

105
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Although I refused many times,

106
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
he was reluctant to give up.

107
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
He even threatened the school.

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I remember now.

109
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
That day, my brother and I went to find the mountain chief.

110
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
We were just about to meet.

111
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You were arguing with Mr. Zhang.

112
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Could it be that you were doing this?

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You can't even read the book.

114
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Mr. Zhang has already retreated many times.

115
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Today, I personally came here.

116
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Mr. Zhang still doesn't give me the face.

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Mr. Zhang, calm down.

118
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
This matter concerns the students' future.

119
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I really can't bear it.

120
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Future?

121
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Without the future of the Qing Mountain Academy,

122
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
where does it come from?

123
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You don't want to know.

124
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The academy just had a murder case.

125
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
If I report it to the police,

126
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
and investigate it,

127
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm afraid that the students will not even exist.

128
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
In order to protect the academy,

129
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I deserve to be punished.

130
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I will try to protect the students

131
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
who are not born and die.

132
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You talented students

133
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
are very upright.

134
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But no matter what,

135
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I can't keep all the students' future.

136
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I can only beg for help.

137
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I can't be ashamed.

138
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Why are you laughing?

139
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's ridiculous to think of the mountain chief crying and crying.

140
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Why do you keep talking bad about the mountain chief?

141
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I know the face but not the heart.

142
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Brother Tao is too pure and kind.

143
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But the world is dangerous.

144
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm afraid Brother Tao will be tormented by pure and kind sooner or later.

145
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
My thoughts are exactly the opposite.

146
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
If the world is dangerous,

147
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
then pure and kind

148
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
should be the best weapon for the dangerous.

149
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The horse is always in the way.

150
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
The horse is always in the way.

151
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The horse is always in the way.

152
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
The horse is always in the way.

153
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The horse is always in the way.

154
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The horse is always in the way.

155
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The horse is always in the way.

156
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The horse is always in the way.

157
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The horse is always in the way.

158
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The horse is always in the way.

159
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The horse is always in the way.

160
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The horse is always in the way.

161
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The horse is always in the way.

162
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The horse is always in the way.

163
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The horse is always in the way.

164
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The horse is always in the way.

165
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The horse is always in the way.

166
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The horse is always in the way.

167
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The horse is always in the way.

168
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
The horse is always in the way.

169
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The horse is always in the way.

170
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The horse is always in the way.

171
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
The horse is always in the way.

172
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The horse is always in the way.

173
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The horse is always in the way.

174
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
The horse is always in the way.

175
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The horse is always in the way.

176
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
The horse is always in the way.

177
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The horse is always in the way.

178
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The horse is always in the way.

179
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
The horse is always in the way.

180
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The horse is always in the way.

181
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
The horse is always in the way.

182
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The horse is always in the way.

183
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The horse is always in the way.

184
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The horse is always in the way.

185
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
The horse is always in the way.

186
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
