1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
Three months ago

2
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,080
What are you doing?

3
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,800
Well

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Why did you then Chinese the word

5
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,160
Stripist

6
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,000
Stripist

7
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,320
We are in Florida

8
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,000
It's great

9
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,400
retreat

10
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,200
What do you want to see next time

11
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,560
Just tell me

12
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,720
I want to see nothing

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Okay, okay.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Then, I'll ask you the last question.

15
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,000
Why does the person on the painting

16
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,800
look so much like me?

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,600
It's a family heirloom.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,800
Does it look like me?

19
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,000
Not bad.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Wait.

21
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,200
I feel like

22
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,400
there's something missing on the painting.

23
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,800
I think this is better.

24
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,800
Why did you add this cotton?

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,200
Hero under the tree, hero road.

26
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,800
This cotton flower

27
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,000
is also called hero flower.

28
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,600
Its flower language is

29
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,600
to stand on the top of the sky and stand on the ground,

30
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,000
to be brave in the street,

31
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,200
and to be sincere in friendship.

32
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,000
Friendship is the most important thing

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,200
when they are honest with each other.

34
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,600
If you have any difficulties,

35
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,800
just tell me.

36
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,200
I'll solve them for you.

37
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,600
In this world,

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,800
how can there be anything that can be difficult for me?

39
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,600
Wait.

40
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,000
Why don't I

41
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,600
draw a picture on the sky here?

42
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,000
This is a family heirloom.

43
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,400
You can't paint it randomly.

44
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,000
Anyway, I think

45
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,400
it looks better this way.

46
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,000
What are you doing tomorrow?

47
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,600
I have class tomorrow.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,800
If you're free,

49
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,000
go to the library.

50
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,000
Who is the most

51
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,600
familiar in this school?

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Men Wei.

53
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,800
He's very open-minded.

54
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
He's very open-minded.

55
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,200
Why do you ask this?

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,400
Nothing. Just chatting.

57
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,600
I'm sleepy.

58
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,200
This door

59
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,800
seems a little different.

60
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,000
Do you know this person?

61
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,800
What are you doing? You scared me.

62
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,400
Do you know him?

63
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,600
Is this a person?

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Who do you rely on?

65
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,600
Look carefully. Do you know him?

66
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,400
Go away.

67
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,200
I'll go alone.

68
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,400
Wait a minute.

69
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Let me see.

70
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,200
Your drawing is really like

71
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,400
the student from the middle school 20 years ago.

72
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,800
20 years ago?

73
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,400
I remember it was 20 years ago.

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,600
He came back that night.

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,200
He pushed me.

76
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,800
You're strong.

77
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,200
You have to be healthy.

78
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,600
What are you doing?

79
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,000
This portrait is very important.

80
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,400
Don't take it out again.

81
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,000
I know.

82
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,200
I'm just curious.

83
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,400
It's so similar to me.

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Have you read this book?

85
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,800
Not only have I read it,

86
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,400
it's a love that never fails.

87
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,400
It's perfect.

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,400
You must remember the story in this book.

89
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
A stupid scholar named Tao

90
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,600
and his good friend Wang Sheng

91
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
were investigating the murder case in the Qing Shan Academy.

92
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,600
But

93
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,400
someone made a deal with the cat demon.

94
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,600
This story is indeed suspicious.

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,800
Tao Sheng has a heart of a bell.

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,800
I heard that

97
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,600
he can recover from any injury.

98
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,400
In the end, the murder case came to light.

99
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,200
But Wang Sheng still died.

100
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
Everything

101
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,000
is because of the cat demon.

102
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,000
Do you think

103
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,400
Tao Sheng will blame the cat demon?

104
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What the cat wants is just freedom.

105
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,400
What it wants

106
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,800
is the personal desire of people.

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,800
This is not a perfect ending.

108
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,400
I don't like the ending of this book.

109
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I don't want my good friend to die for me.

110
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,200
On the contrary,

111
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,800
I will protect it with all my life.

112
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,200
The tragedy in the story

113
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,800
shouldn't happen again.

114
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,400
You are

115
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,000
Tao Ran,

116
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,800
the good student of Dean Liu.

117
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,600
Hello, President Qi.

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,200
This student is...

119
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,200
He is my friend.

120
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,200
I heard that our library is full of books.

121
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,800
He asked me to bring him here.

122
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,600
I know it's not appropriate.

123
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,600
But don't worry.

124
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,000
We won't disturb others.

125
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:47,800
Good.

126
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,000
You are all book lovers.

127
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,600
That's why you can be good friends.

128
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,800
Okay.

129
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,800
Take your time.

130
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,200
Take care of your books.

131
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,000
Let's go.

132
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:56,800
Okay.

133
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,400
You are honest.

134
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,000
I am a student, too.

135
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,000
That's good.

136
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,000
He is the president of the school.

137
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
He knows everyone.

138
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,200
It's not good to lie.

139
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,800
It's better to tell the truth than to lie.

140
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,600
But...

141
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,200
You never lied once in your life.

142
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,800
I have a class to go.

143
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Read the book first.

144
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,000
Read the book first.

145
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,800
Okay.

146
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,800
Where is he?

147
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,800
Hello.

148
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,200
The number you dialed is power off.

149
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,800
This is where I dug up the soil.

150
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,400
The soil is wrong.

151
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,200
The tree is also wrong.

152
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,600
Hey, student.

153
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,800
Which school?

154
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The student in the middle school 20 years ago.

155
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,000
After a thousand years, we meet again.

156
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,200
I get it.

157
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,200
The time I woke up

158
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,400
was in 2005.

159
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,400
The time I woke up

160
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,400
was in 2005.

161
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,400

The time I woke up

166
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,400
was in 2005.

167
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,400
The time I woke up

168
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,400
was in 2005.

169
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,400
The time I woke up

170
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,400
was in 2005.

171
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,400
The time I woke up

172
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,400
was in 2005.

173
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,800
The time I woke up

174
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,800
was in 2005.

175
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,800
The time I woke up

176
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,800
was in 2005.

177
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,800

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,800
was in 2005.

179
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,800
The time I woke up

180
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,800
was in 2005.

181
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,800
The time I woke up

182
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,800
was in 2005.

183
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,800
The time I woke up

184
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,800
was in 2005.

185
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,800
The time I woke up

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,800
was in 2005.

187
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,200
The time I woke up

was in 2005.

191
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,200
The time I woke up

192
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,200
was in 2005.

193
