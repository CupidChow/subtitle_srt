1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
After she goes back to sleep.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:09,480
The king of spirits is crying and smiling angrily.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,620
The first digit is now ten thousand.

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:24,840
The king of spirits

5
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,300
Someone!

6
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,760
There is no one, sir.

7
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,200
You're really something.

8
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,300
Brother Tao, are you okay?

9
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,800
I'll never die.

10
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,840
Let me go.

11
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,620
You want to get me killed?

12
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,480
Don't forget our deal.

13
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,400
If he know about our deal,

14
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,120
I'll ruin myself

15
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,240
and you'll be devastated.

16
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,600
Don't forget that

17
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,360
without me,

18
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,940
Who did it?

19
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,200
Where's your Bai Qiang?

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,280
Do you wanna save him?

21
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,020
You must be a base often used by demons.

22
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,640
Why are you not the same?

23
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,040
It seems that you won't believe anything

24
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,800
after seeing it in person.

25
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,560
It was you.

26
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,840
Stop.

27
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,120
Are you a angry imp?

28
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,000
Please stop they cannot hurt us.

29
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,560
You are a good man.

30
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,880
Neptulian surgery stays for three days

31
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,680
if you can' Burial World.

32
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,520
And you are a horrible horse-back.

33
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,440
Who knows it's us?

34
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,020
But Brother Duan, he's our classmate!

35
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,120
He found it himself!

36
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,360
Brother Tao! Brother Tao! Where are you?

37
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,400
I'm here to save you!

38
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,840
You? A mortal?

39
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,480
I'm afraid he's already in the netherworld when you reach him.

40
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,840
What on earth are you trying to do?

41
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,440
I can help you save him,

42
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,000
but... there's a condition.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,400
You must save him.

44
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,960
You can't let him escape.

45
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,320
There's a condition.

46
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,160
What condition?

47
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,040
Let me help you.

48
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,680
What happened?

49
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,280
You're almost drowned.

50
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,240
You're asking me what happened?

51
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,480
Duan Shengjing is a despicable son.

52
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,200
He's as cruel as a grasshopper.

53
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,520
Who saved me?

54
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,440
Of course, it's me. Who else could it be?

55
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,240
I can't repay you for saving me.

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,920
Please accept my apology.

57
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,000
Brother Tao, you're awake!

58
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,080
Drink this bowl of soup. It's the best for your cold.

59
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,800
Thank you, Brother Hong.

60
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,360
I feel even more guilty.

61
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,840
If it weren't for me, you wouldn't have been in this plight.

62
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,240
You almost got yourself killed.

63
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,640
Brother, it's not your fault.

64
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,560
Duan Shengjing is a despicable son.

65
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,240
I just didn't expect him to be so cruel.

66
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,480
Duan Shengjing, if Brother Tao has a good idea,

67
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,840
I'll kill him to atone for your sin.

68
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,320
Brother, you're too much.

69
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,640
You really want to kill him?

70
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,960
Brother, what are you thinking?

71
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,000
It's not easy to kill someone.

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,880
You wait.

73
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,520
Brother, I was just angry. Don't take it seriously.

74
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,120
Let him be.

75
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,040
I'm afraid he'll do something stupid.

76
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,520
Brother, I understand. He's a good man.

77
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,560
He's just a talker. He won't do anything unexpected.

78
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,520
I didn't expect Tao Shengjing to be so cruel.

79
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,680
He can't die like this.

80
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,960
It's a good thing that he didn't kill anyone.

81
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,320
So what if he really died?

82
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,160
This time, I'll give him a good reason.

83
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,160
I'm so angry.

84
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,960
Who dares to oppose me?

85
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,640
Who dares?

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,160
Wang Sheng,

87
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,280
I've seen your father and my father

88
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,240
have been tolerant of you.

89
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,280
I hope you have the guts.

90
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,440
What if I don't?

91
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,320
If you dare to oppose me again

92
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,720
with the name of Tao Sheng and Huang Sheng,

93
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,640
How?

94
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,240
I won't give face to anyone.

95
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,560
I'll clean up with you.

96
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,840
Then try it.

97
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,440
What are you afraid of? I'm here.

98
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,040
You don't want power, do you?

99
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,040
Go.

100
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,240
Stop.

101
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,040
What are you afraid of?

102
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,640
Wang Sheng.

103
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,240
And you.

104
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,840
What do you want?

105
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,640
What's going on?

106
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,440
You're cold.

107
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,640
Shall we JEA kalbonatha?

108
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,240
You sure can't take it.

109
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,840
Ji You

110
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,240
it's a healing box.

111
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,840
Really?

112
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,900
Come, sit down here.

113
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,180
I prepared chicken soup for you.

114
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,100
You're thoughtful.

115
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,460
You asked me to be the school's supervisor.

116
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,180
I'm ashamed of what happened today.

117
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,660
Young Master, how does this matter concern you?

118
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,020
It's obviously the internal affairs of the Duans.

119
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,980
Shut up. Xiao Ying, don't talk nonsense.

120
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,740
Who is that?

121
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,460
Royal Brother.

122
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,140
What's going on?

123
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:13,260
Royal Brother.

124
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,100
Something bad happened.

125
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,940
What's so panic?

126
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,460
Duansheng...

127
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,420
Duansheng is dead.

128
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,780
What?

129
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,900
The horse is always angry and the horse is always angry.

130
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,600
When the sound of the

131
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,640
The young man on the ground

132
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,400
As free as the wind

133
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,440
The blue sky is like the stars

134
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,680
Even if the gold and gold are left behind

135
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,400
You and I will not give up this life

136
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,680
The young man on the main street

137
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,320
The proud and the cold

138
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,200
Always turn around and don't say anything

139
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:38,400
When the flowers bloom, the world will meet again
