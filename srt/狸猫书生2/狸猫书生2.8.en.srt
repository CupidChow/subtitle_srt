1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
Combine with Watch

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You ran so fast. Who said you were good?

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not born yet to be able to run against someone like you.

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Take a look.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This is a pen. You gave it to Professor Liu.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That murderer could be him.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But what's his motive?

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You don't have any memory now.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You can't verify what happened back then.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
When a person is lying, there are symptoms of a big mouth, a big pupils, and a crooked tongue.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
These symptoms often reflect the most real psychological activity of a person.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Ask me how I know.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
This tone doesn't sound like you.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The library saw it. Psychological expression.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Psychological expression.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I know.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
How about this? I'll try it today. Wait for me downstairs.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Isn't the line I just said handsome?

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'll go.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Professor Liu.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Why didn't you knock?

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I've been knocking for a long time.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Maybe you didn't hear me when you were working.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What's up?

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I didn't take your file. I sent it to you.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Put it here.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Is there anything else?

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You haven't been to class. The students are worried about you.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's just a little old disease. It's okay.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And the new student, he also wants to listen to you.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That student Wang Hao Zhi?

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yes.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Are you familiar with him?

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yes. We've known each other for a long time.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Really?

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What does his family do?

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Are his parents still there?

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Professor, you care about him so much.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's okay. Just ask. I have something to do.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You can go back first.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Okay, Professor.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
How is it?

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
There's something wrong.

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So it's very suspicious.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
If he's really the person who hurt you in 2005,

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
we have to be careful.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You're bleeding.

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What's wrong?

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What's wrong?

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What's wrong?

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's okay.

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You're not dizzy.

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Let's go to the infirmary.

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'll go to the infirmary.

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Liu Wan Zhou's office is indeed on the second floor.

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But looking at the force of the flowerpot falling,

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
it should be at a higher place.

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But she has the time to leave the office.

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
This is just what she had back then.

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But...

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Her reaction just now is so strange.

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Liu Wan Zhou's office

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Tao Ran, what are you doing here?

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Professor Liu.

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I was thinking how to change your report.

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I indeed have some questions that I don't understand.

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
If you don't understand, the teacher can teach you.

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
But you are one of the best students in my school.

69
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You should take good care of the new students.

70
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You are talking about Wang Hao Zhi?

71
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yes.

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Wang Hao Zhi.

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I think I saw you bring him here before.

74
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
No.

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Today is your first time meeting him.

76
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Do you know Professor Liu Wan Zhou?

77
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Something happened at home.

78
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
What happened? Tell me.

79
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The other day, he came to get the medicine.

80
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
He said he had a fight with his wife.

81
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
He kicked her and got hurt badly.

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Really?

83
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I can't see that there is a sweat in the house.

84
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
What's wrong with you?

85
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
He kicked her?

86
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But he also got hit by me.

87
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
He should be badly hurt.

88
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's a pity that he ran away.

89
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Something is wrong.

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I can't smell his scent at all.

91
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
How long have you known Wang Hao Zhi?

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I've known him for a long time.

93
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I've known him for a long time.

94
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
How long have you known Wang Hao Zhi?

95
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Have you seen his family?

96
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I can tell you.

97
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But you have to tell me first.

98
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Why did you ask him?

99
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You always answer when I ask you.

100
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I can answer.

101
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But you have to tell me first.

102
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
What's your relationship with him?

103
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I told you before.

104
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I've known him for a long time.

105
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Professor Liu, do you know him?

106
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Do you know him?

107
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm asking you.

108
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Who is Wang Hao Zhi?

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You know him, right?

110
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Are you against me?

111
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Are you against me?

112
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
No.

113
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Tell me who he is.

114
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Or I...

115
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Are you pushing me down?

116
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Or you were pushed by someone else?

117
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The moonlight sprouts in the dark night

118
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The night is silent, the autumn is cold

119
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
The snow-colored leaves are speaking on the ground

120
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I open the door of time

121
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
The sandstorm turns the pages of the paper

122
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The old paper is hidden, the blood is still flowing

123
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The cat is waiting for the flower to bloom

124
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I pick up all the poems

125
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Waiting for a light to light up the window

126
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I still remember the past

127
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The heart is in my hands

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Wandering around for a thousand years

129
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Waiting for a light to light up the past

130
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The end of the dark night is saying goodbye

131
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I finally walk out of the wall I have forgotten

132
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I will be by your side when you are no longer wandering
