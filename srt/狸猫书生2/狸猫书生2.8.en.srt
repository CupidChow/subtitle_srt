Episode 1

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You are so righteous and kind.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
As a scholar, I'm honored.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm afraid it's just a misdeed.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Why are you like this?

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Did you misunderstand the King?

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I just think it's better to be more careful.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You are too kind.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
In the past, the King donated all his assets

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
to the disaster relief.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
How could such a selfless person

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
be so careless?

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
If the King is so selfless,

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
how could he let the blood of the broken life

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
enter the Academy?

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You are coughing behind my back.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You must have been cursed.

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Brother, why are you here?

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Do you know that

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
the entire Academy is looking for you?

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I don't have much time.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You are a good friend of mine.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I only ask you to do one thing.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Take care of my sister for me.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm here. Go after them.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What did she say to you?

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I didn't have time to say it.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So you came here.

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What do you mean?

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Nothing.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I know you are friends with the King.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But he is a murderer now.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You must not cover up for him.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Brother Zhou, you are thinking too much.

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You didn't say anything.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You must have caught a cold in the mountain.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's okay.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Actually, my brother

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
told me secretly

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
where he was hiding.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Brother?

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
How could I not know?

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
If one person knows,

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
it will be less dangerous.

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Where is he now?

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
He is in a very safe place.

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
When the people from the Academy come,

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I will let him show up.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I will go out for a while.

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You can check your case.

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Childe, this is the food you asked for.

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I have prepared it for you.

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Thank you.

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You are welcome.

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Do you want to see someone?

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
A friend.

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Goodbye.

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Go.

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Go.

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I don't know what's going on.

63
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Tao Sheng, you are so worried.

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You invited everyone here.

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What's going on?

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Chief,

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I have found the murderer.

68
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Tell me about it.

69
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I used the clue of the King as a bait.

70
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I successfully led the murderer out

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
and fought with him.

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Although he escaped,

73
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I hit his arm.

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Now,

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
as long as everyone

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
talks about their own skills,

77
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
the murderer will naturally reveal himself.

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I don't know

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
if you are a thief or a thief.

80
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Whether you are a thief or a thief,

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
talk about your own skills,

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
and share it with others.

83
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Since Tao Sheng is so handsome,

84
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
let's follow his example

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
and prove his innocence.

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Brother Zhou, this way.

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm the school's principal.

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I've been investigating

91
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
the disappearance of Huang Shen.

92
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You suspect me?

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The person I fought with

94
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
is an extraordinary person.

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
He is not a man of many names.

96
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Brother Zhou is also a cunning man.

97
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Before the truth is revealed,

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
everyone has a suspicion.

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Even...

100
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Including the principal.

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The principal also dares to investigate?

102
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
How could it be the principal?

103
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's definitely not the principal.

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Come.

105
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Thank you, principal.

106
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Brother Zhou.

107
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
We won't give up.

108
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The young men who live in the cold

109
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
always return to the world.

110
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
When the flowers bloom, the world will be reunited.
