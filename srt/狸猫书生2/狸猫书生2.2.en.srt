1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
End of the first part

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,040
What kind of violence did Nanny Huang experience in the first episode

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,340
Dangerous

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,320
Nicole was responsible for the escape

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,380
Who is the murderer

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,180
You cheaper punks

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,760
I am not scared.

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,200
Even if she dies

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,740
just get some salt for her

10
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:28,920
Well

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,620
Who is there?

12
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,840
Are you feeling happy?

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,300
I...

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:37,960
I...

15
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:38,920
I can...

16
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,060
Disappear?

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:43,360
Who's there?

18
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:44,640
Who's there?

19
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,760
Use my life

20
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,640
to payback your past sins.

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:52,480
Wen Sheng!

22
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,400
Don't blame me.

23
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,340
A direction!

24
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,260
Don't stare,

25
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,820
but tell them where I am!

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Give me back my life.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Brother Duan, I'm sorry.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I won't do it again.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Brother Duan.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Brother Duan.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Brother Duan.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Who is pretending to be a ghost?

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Hurry up and show yourself.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
If you don't show yourself,

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I will kill you.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Don't be angry.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Wang Shen, why are you here?

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
If I say I'm here to catch the ghost,

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
do you believe me?

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What do you think?

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Duan Sheng is dizzy. Come out.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Wang Sheng, you...

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You are a ghost.

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Brother, I'm out of breath.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
How many times have you done this?

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It has nothing to do with me.

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I just let them teach me a lesson.

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I didn't want to kill him.

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's good that you're afraid.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Today is a small and big event for Duan Sheng.

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I hope he will be a good person in the future.

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Don't hurt your fellow members again.

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You are so silly.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's so funny. It's really funny.

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Do you remember that he peed his pants?

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yes.

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:27,840
I was really happy to see Duan Sheng's

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm afraid he will do bad things.

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Well said.

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Brother Tao, good milk.

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Nana is better than Wang Sheng.

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Little Bo is a good man.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
This word

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
doesn't sound like it's complimenting me.

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Drink.

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
No, no, no.

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
No, no, no.

68
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Is this the forbidden area of the academy?

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I heard there are monsters behind us.

70
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I often go up the mountain to pick herbs for the snake sister.

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I've never seen any evil spirits.

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's okay if you're afraid.

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'll go to the border myself.

74
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Brother, we must have picked the herbs after we lost.

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
How can we waste half of it?

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
If you're afraid,

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
wait here again.

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Who said I was afraid?

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm not really a coward Duan Sheng.

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Wait for me.

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Why are you awake?

82
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Don't underestimate these herbs.

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
There are many rare things.

84
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The snake sister and I are basically

85
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
relying on these herbs.

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Brother Tao.

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Brother Wang.

88
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Where are you?

89
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Brother, are you going to scare me again?

90
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm not afraid.

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Brother, where are you?

92
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Why did you disappear in a blink of an eye?

93
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Where are you?

94
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Where are you?

95
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
This incense.

96
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's almost done.

97
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You're really a bastard.

98
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You made me angry.

99
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You made me go out and was punished by the chief.

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You're unlucky to have met me today.

101
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm sorry.

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You're unlucky to have met me.

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
God Duan.

104
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You're the one who abandoned your friends first.

105
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You're so ungrateful.

106
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You're going out today.

107
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You're not going home.

108
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Beat him.

109
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Beat him to death.

110
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
If you kneel down to me and kowtow to me,

111
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'll spare your life.

112
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Tao Wushang and I are all on the same level.

113
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
The next Qu Xing is a fairy.

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But he never kneels to me.

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I...

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I...

117
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
What are you doing?

118
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I think Tao Wushang is not a water star.

119
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm going to get him up here.

120
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
In case he's a human.

121
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
No one is allowed to save him.

122
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's very popular here.

123
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I won't say anything if you don't say anything.

124
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Who knows it's made by us?

125
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But Brother Duan,

126
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
he's one of our schoolmates.

127
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
He found it himself.

128
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Brother Tao.

129
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Brother Tao, where are you?

130
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Brother Tao.

131
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Go.

132
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Go.

133
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Brother Tao.

134
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Where are you?

135
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Brother Tao.

136
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Are you in there?

137
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm here.

138
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm here.

139
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm here.

140
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm here.

141
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm here.

142
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm here.

143
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm here.

144
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm here.

145
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm here.

146
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm here.

147
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm here.

148
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm here.

149
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm here.

150
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm here.

151
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm here.

152
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm here.

153
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm here.

154
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm here.

155
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm here.

156
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm here.

157
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm here.

158
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm here.

159
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm here.

160
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm here.

161
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm here.

162
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000

166
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm here.

167
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm here.

168
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm here.

169
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm here.

170
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm here.

171
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm here.

172
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm here.

173
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm here.

174
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000

I'm here.

182
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm here.

183
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm here.

184
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm here.

185
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm here.

186
