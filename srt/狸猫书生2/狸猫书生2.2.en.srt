1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:27,600
Psycho

2
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:29,540
Soft medicine

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,760
I can live like a normal person

4
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,560
Brother

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,920
You hold on

6
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,920
I'll go find a doctor

7
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,680
Brother

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,000
How about this

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,600
Maybe you can

10
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,400
Let a normal person live

11
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,160
No

12
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,160
No

13
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,160
If you can live

14
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,160
I'd rather not stand in your way

15
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,160
Brother

16
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,160
Little Li, you're not good

17
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,160
You're a two-edged sword that never fades

18
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,160
You've been in my way for so many years

19
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,160
You still want to control me?

20
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,160
You have to mess with people

21
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,160
Then you have to be punished according to our rules

22
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,160
This naughty cat

23
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,160
Want to enter these two countries from a distance

24
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,160
But you know what

25
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,160
This is the 999th time

26
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,160
If you don't believe me

27
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,160
Then let's see the last time

28
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,160
Who saved me?

29
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,160
Of course it's me

30
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,160
Who said the 999th time must be evil?

31
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,160
Taosheng is too stupid

32
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,160
He doesn't know what kind of danger he's in

33
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,160
The evidence is early

34
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,160
You still dare to say no

35
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,160
No, it's not like that

36
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,160
I can't go back

37
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,160
Linglong Star City

38
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,160
There is really a way to revive the dead

39
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,160
Yes, I am also Linglong Star

40
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,160
I've only seen a gentle and cute little cat

41
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,160
Who is threatening

42
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,160
Ah

43
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,160
Ah

44
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,160
Ah

45
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,160
You want to escape from the dust

46
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,160
Reviving the dead is a first-class accident

47
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,160
And the end is always the escape

48
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,160
For the dead

49
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,160
You don't want to lose your life here

50
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,160
Every time I try to turn back time and space to change my fate

51
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,160
But fate can't be changed

52
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,160
What fate

53
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,160
I don't care

54
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,160
What 999th time

55
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,160
None of them is wrong

56
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,160
I want to escape today

57
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,160
With Wang Shen's identity

58
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,160
With Taosheng's birth and death

59
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,160
You really treat him as a confidant

60
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,160
Ah, what a pity

61
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,160
In his memory

62
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,160
It's all Wang Shen who has experienced all this with him

63
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,160
There is no you at all

64
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,160
Ah

65
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,160
Ah

66
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,160
Aren't you afraid that he will die again

67
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,160
To save people

68
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,160
Don't worry, he won't die at this moment

69
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,160
He won't be the same as he was 1000 years ago

70
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,160
1000 years

71
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,160
Yes, after 1000 years

72
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,160
The old man will meet again

73
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,160
If the wife dies

74
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,160
The other will die

75
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,160
You mean

76
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,160
After 1000 years

77
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,160
One of them died

78
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,160
The other will die

79
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,160
Is it

80
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,160
You are mistaken

81
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,160
Stop talking

82
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,160
Want to escape

83
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,160
I'm afraid you don't have this ability

84
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,160
Wait for 1000 years to turn into a human

85
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,160
Let me go

86
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,160
After 1000 years

87
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,160
Is it really fate

88
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,160
I have to find out Wang Hao Zhi's last name first.

89
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,260
Then I can unlock this handkerchief.

90
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,060
Are you done?

91
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,460
I'm done.

92
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,860
What do you want?

93
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,060
Put it on.

94
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,460
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,260
I'm sorry.

96
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,960
I'm sorry.

97
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,560
I'm sorry.

98
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,160
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,660
Put it on.

100
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,560
I thought you fainted because you didn't say anything for a long time.

101
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,360
Don't worry. I'm very happy right now.

102
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,160
Why are you talking so slowly?

103
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,160
It's like a play.

104
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,960
I... I'm a teacher.

105
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,760
You study Chinese literature?

106
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,760
Yes.

107
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,560
Which university?

108
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,560
Qingshan University.

109
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,360
Qingna University?

110
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,160
That's good. We can go to school together tomorrow.

111
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,160
What a pity.

112
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,560
I didn't get into the exam.

113
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,560
Then why did you go to our school's library?

114
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,360
Oh, right. I haven't asked your name yet.

115
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,960
I...

116
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,160
My name is Wang Haozhi.

117
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,360
Wang... Haozhi?

118
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,160
Here. I'll choose some clean clothes for you to wear.

119
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,160
Your clothes are so heavy.

120
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,560
Why don't you take it easy? I'll buy you a new one another day.

121
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,360
No need. I think this one with flowers is good.

122
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,560
Let me help you. Don't hurt yourself.

123
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,560
Be careful.

124
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,560
How is it?

125
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,160
Not bad.

126
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,960
You haven't had any surgery yet?

127
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,560
No.

128
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,760
You don't have a phone yet. You can trust me.

129
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,560
Phone?

130
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,960
You don't even know about phones, do you?

131
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,560
Phone.

132
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,160
What are you going to do next?

133
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,960
It's a big world. I don't have any place to stay.

134
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,160
I'll stay with you.

135
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,560
It's okay.

136
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,960
Stay at my house first. We'll talk about it later.

137
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,160
Brother Tao is really a kind person.

138
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,760
Since Wang Haozhi is a student at Qing Shan University,

139
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,360
why don't we follow this clue?

140
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,560
Phone?

141
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,160
Little thing.

142
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,960
Will you use this?

143
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,760
Come and teach me.

144
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,360
Hello, sir.

145
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,760
Why are you here?

146
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,160
It's so boring to be alone at home.

147
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,360
I secretly followed you here.

148
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,960
Our teacher is very strict. Don't get caught.

149
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,560
How strict? It's nothing compared to what happened before.

150
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,760
You're all here. Where's Tao Ran?

151
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,360
Here.

152
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,960
Professor, this is our class' second report.

153
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,960
I think our class needs to...

154
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,760
Which class is that?

155
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,360
About this report...

156
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,360
Move aside.

157
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,960
Professor Liu.

158
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,160
Professor Liu, the bell has rung.

159
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,760
Aren't you going to start class?

160
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,760
Ms. Huang, you misunderstood.

161
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,360
I'm just...

162
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,560
I'm just checking the students' class report.

163
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,760
Here.

164
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,160
Why are all the students here?

165
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,960
I heard that they're studying for the apple.

166
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,760
I'm sorry.

167
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,760
I'm sorry.

168
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,760
I heard that they're studying for the apple.

169
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,960
Students, go back to your seats.

170
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,160
Ms. Huang, it's a misunderstanding.

171
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,960
It's all a misunderstanding.

172
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,960
Professor Liu, it's time to start class.

173
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,160
Yes, yes, yes.

174
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,760
Class, class.

175
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,760
It's not this one.

176
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,760
The data on the phone is all here.

177
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,160
Why isn't Wang Hao Zhi here?

178
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,760
Who did this?

179
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,760
Who did this?

180
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,960
No.

181
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,760
Gosh.

182
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,960
meat poison.

183
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:36,760
Chinese reason preventing toxin is fabulous.

184
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:41,560
I hopefalse moves can Mr. lubricated my teeth.

185
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,760
What are you doing?

186
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,760
I finally walked out of the wall I had forgotten

187
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,760
I will be by your side when there is no more waves
