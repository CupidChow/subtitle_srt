00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
Season 2 & 3

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Where is this place?

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
How would I know?

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Wasn't it night time just now?

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Why is it daytime now?

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What is going on?

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hello!

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Hello!

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hey, where are you going in such a hurry?

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's the final tonight.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You don't even know that?

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hurry up!

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What competition?

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
2005?

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
How did we end up in 2005?

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What's going on?

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You ask me?

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Who am I asking?

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You don't know how to pass the exam?

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm still confused.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Then why did you go to the library in the middle of the night?

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I...

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I can't sleep.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I went to the library to read.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What about you? Why did you follow me?

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I...

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I saw you going out alone at night.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I was afraid you might have something on your mind.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I didn't want to disturb you.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Then just tell me you care about me.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You're so sneaky.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You're sneaky?

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Where is this place?

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But I don't know yet.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You really don't know where this is?

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I really don't know.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You think I want to stay here?

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Does it have something to do with the library?

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
2005?

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Qing Shan University should still be here.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Let's go back and take a look.

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I think it's okay.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Are you going to buy it or not?

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Annoying.

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Buy it.

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What do you want?

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Boss, I want this.

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Okay.

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Which one do you want?

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I want this.

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
How much?

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Ten yuan.

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Here you go.

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Sometimes I really miss you.

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You're not in a hurry?

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What if we're stuck here forever?

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What should we do?

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You know better.

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You know there are fewer and fewer people in the county.

60
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm definitely not late.

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
2005.

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
How old are you?

63
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Three years old.

64
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But I also remember.

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
How do I investigate with him?

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But should we change clothes?

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The way out is a bit hasty.

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's a bit sneaky.

69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,960
Pence's

70
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,960
How nice of you.

71
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,960
Where is my friend?

72
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,960
He went to the bathroom.

73
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,960
Liar.

74
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,960
I'm going to see you again.

75
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,960
I'm not going to chase him anymore.

76
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,960
It's here.

77
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,960
So that's how it is.

78
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,960
When I was born, he was already dead.

79
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,960
And he was buried here.

80
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,960
It's a pity that I was sealed.

81
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,960
I didn't see the killer.

82
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,960
His blood helped me break the seal.

83
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,960
I eventually gave in to him.

84
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,960
After the rain, the blood will no longer exist.

85
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,960
I'm free because of you.

86
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,960
I don't know if it's fate or you.

87
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,960
This is the well-known female entrepreneur, Ms. Huang Ruoyu.

88
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,960
She was hit by a car accident at 3.45 pm on July 5.

89
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,960
She died by accident.

90
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,960
The investigation committee will be...

91
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,960
In the end, she didn't have time to see you off.

92
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,960
I'm so sorry.

93
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,960
Hello?

94
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,960
Are you Wang Hao Zhi's parents?

95
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,960
Yes.

96
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,960
I saw the blood needle.

97
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,960
What about him?

98
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,960
You found out my son?

99
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,960
Hao Zhi has already been out of touch for over a week.

100
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,960
You saw him?

101
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,240
Yes, yes.

102
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,760
Did you see my child?

103
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,760
Where is she?

104
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,440
Hello?

105
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,400
Hello?

106
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,480
S3-2025.

107
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,280
Finally, I have something to show you.

108
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
Why is she around here?

109
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,880
Isn't she the father of the library?

110
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,480
Yueyue.

111
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,200
I miss you so much.

112
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,200
Brother,

113
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,840
mom is gone.

114
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,280
You said you couldn't buy the ticket.

115
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,480
You said you would come back tomorrow.

116
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,160
I'm sorry to be with you for a few days.

117
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,160
Brother, don't leave, okay?

118
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,480
I don't know how long I can stay,

119
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,520
but don't worry.

120
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,080
I will definitely come back.

121
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,160
I will take good care of you.

122
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,560
Don't be afraid, okay?

123
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,560
Yueyue, come here.

124
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,560
Brother,

125
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,560
I saw the tears on your face.

126
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,560
When?

127
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,560
Where?

128
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,560
Stop looking.

129
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,560
It's here.

130
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,560
You said you should be honest with your friends.

131
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,560
Sister-in-law,

132
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,560
you are not honest.

133
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,560
I'm sorry.

134
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,560
I'm sorry.

135
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,560
I'm sorry.

136
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,560
I'm sorry.

137
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,560
I'm sorry.

138
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,560
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,560
I'm sorry.

140
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,560
I'm sorry.

141
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,560
I'm sorry.

142
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,560
I'm sorry.

143
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,560
I'm sorry.

144
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,560
I'm sorry.

145
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,560
I'm sorry.

146
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,560
I'm sorry.

147
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,560
I'm sorry.

148
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,560
I'm sorry.

149
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,560
I'm sorry.

150
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,560
I'm sorry.

151
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,560
I'm sorry.

152
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,560
I'm sorry.

153
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,560
I'm sorry.

154
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,560
I'm sorry.

155
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,560
I'm sorry.

156
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,560
I'm sorry.

157
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,560
I'm sorry.

158
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,560
I'm sorry.

159
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,560
I'm sorry.

160
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,560
I'm sorry.

161
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,560
I'm sorry.

162
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,560
Wait for a light to light up the window.

163
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:14,560
I still remember the past.

164
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,560
The heart beats and the smile is in my hands.

165
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,560
Wandering through the clouds,

166
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,560
I look back once again.

167
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,560
Wait for a light to bury the past.

168
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,560
The end of the world has also been fulfilled.

169
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,560
I finally walked out of the wall of the past.

170
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:44,560
I will be by your side when you are not wandering.
