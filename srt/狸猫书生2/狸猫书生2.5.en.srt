1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Tell me

2
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,400
I have come to report on the possibility

3
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,040
of Adam's arrow

4
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,840
I pour the water

5
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:36,760
Stfu

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,320
You drink it

7
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,520
I statistically think

8
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,600
that we came here as a five-man force

9
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,340
for a test

10
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,240
to get out of the palace

11
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,240
we Ont racing

12
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,160
Yes

13
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,200
Not a success

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,080
I'm a little worried

15
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,720
OO

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What did you do to her?

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Ling Longxin is indeed a good person.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You promised me... You promised me that you wouldn't hurt her.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Did I say that I hurt her?

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Or you said that you wouldn't hurt her at all.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I will let her hand over Ling Longxin.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You...

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You...

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You...

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You...

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
My brother is not a bad person.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I believe that your brother is not a bad person.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We will find him as soon as possible and bring him back to Qingtai.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Take this.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Brother, this is for you.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I have begged Xiao Mei to give it to you.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
She will protect you.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Brother Tao is really generous.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
He didn't even leave me a money bag.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I saw Xiao Mei being lonely and lonely.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
She was in love with someone.

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But the man was too shy.

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
She could only rely on her brother.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
A bag of money can change a god to protect a tiger.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's also a good deal.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But what's the use?

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
She can only put hope on these wooden dolls.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
She can only ask for comfort.

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's possible.

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Maybe the god is listening.

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
He doesn't deserve to be kept in this world.

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Did so many things happen to you?

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But you or it doesn't change any thing.

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
That's why I asked Xiao Mei and Zhao Yunkeng to find you again.

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
A sentence is enough.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Jia 우와

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
That day someone told us,

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But this is about to happen.

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
How can you be in this state?

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
If it wasn't for the mountain chief's order to not be allowed to leave the hospital,

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
the students would have run away.

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Who would still come to the exam?

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You think it's all your fault?

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You're acting like you're fine.

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Zhen Sheng, you seem to have a prejudice against Taoist.

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What prejudice?

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I just don't like you.

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Duan Sheng wasn't killed by you.

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It was you who caused it.

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
At least you should be clean.

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Is it a life sentence?

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What?

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Threaten me?

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You want me to be killed too?

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You're not even qualified to be a scholar.

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You're just useless and unworthy.

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Zhen Sheng, if you don't agree, why don't we have a competition?

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Let's have a competition.

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Okay, what do you want to compete with?

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Poetry, singing, and painting.

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'll let you choose.

77
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Why should I choose from your project?

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Tohu, we're just like Tohu.

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Do you dare?

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Tohu is not what I want.

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'll admit it if you're afraid to say it.

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
One year, just like Tohu.

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm here.

84
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You and Wang Shen are a team.

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm a team with Brother Zhou.

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Zhen Sheng, you're so cunning.

87
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Who doesn't know that Zhou Shen is the best Tohu in the Academy?

88
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
This has nothing to do with me.

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Please.

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm sorry, Brother Tao.

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Brother Zhou, don't be.

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
We're just playing together.

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Just a Tohu.

94
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Don't be so mean.

95
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm sorry.

96
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Brother Tao, you're so mean.

97
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Let's play together.

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Just a Tohu.

99
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Don't be so mean.

100
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'll go first.

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What are you laughing at?

102
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm just going to do my job.

103
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Good.

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
How is that possible?

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It was a bad shot.

106
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Brother Zhou, you're wrong.

107
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's that Hu.

108
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
That's weird.

109
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I was aiming for that Hu.

110
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I think so.

111
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You don't need me anymore, do you?

112
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'll give you one.

113
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So good.

114
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Brother Wang is so good.

115
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
He's so good.

116
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Zhou Shen, let me think about

117
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
how to punish you.

118
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Forget it.

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I just want to see you guys

120
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
have fun.

121
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You're all students of the Academy.

122
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Besides the academic strategy,

123
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
why do you have to be so good?

124
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Well said.

125
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Chief.

126
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Chief.

127
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
This is Mr. Zhang.

128
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Mr. Zhang.

129
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Mr. Zhang.

130
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
In my eyes,

131
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
this young man is so young

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
and has such a great vision.

133
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
He'll be a great man one day.

134
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm Tao Shaozhong.

135
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Nice to meet you, Mr. Zhang.

136
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You're Tao Shaozhong?

137
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You know me.

138
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I've read your strategy of water control.

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
There are practical examples.

140
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
There are strategies of water control.

141
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
There are strategies of peace.

142
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's really hard to get

143
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
a talent like you.

144
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I believe you can win this time.

145
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

146
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Okay.

147
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I have something to discuss with Mr. Zhang.

148
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You guys go back to the Academy.

149
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Take your time.

150
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's weird.

151
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Zhu Qiu's sword skill

152
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
was like this.

153
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
How could he use that lake?

154
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Zhou Shen was too focused on the lake.

155
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But he used another lake.

156
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yeah.

157
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Maybe it's not the same place.

158
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I see.

159
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I see.

160
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I see.

161
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I see.

162
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I see.

163
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I see.

164
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I see.

165
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I see.

166
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I see.

167
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I see.

168
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I see.

169
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I see.

170
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I see.

171
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I see.

172
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I see.

173
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I see.

174
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I see.

175
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I see.

176
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I see.

177
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I see.

178
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I see.

179
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I see.

180
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I see.

181
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I see.

182
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I see.

183
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I see.

184
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I see.

185
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I see.

186
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I see.

187
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I see.

188
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I see.

189
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I see.

190
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I see.

191
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I see.
