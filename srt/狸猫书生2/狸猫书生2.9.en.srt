1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
Sure!

2
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,080
Dou Ran!

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,240
Are you going against me?

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Qin Tian Ting!

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,400
He wants to kill you.

6
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,000
Calm down.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,200
He kept asking me about your situation.

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,200
He was very emotional.

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,000
That's because he has a ghost in his heart.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,200
But we can't stop him now.

11
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,800
But...

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,200
If we can only cross the river after seven days,

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,200
then we can't wait like this?

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,200
No.

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,800
He might not have a single type of evil spirit.

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,800
We still have other clues to investigate.

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,800
It's the car accident of Huang Yun Bu.

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,600
Let's go.

19
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,200
Let's go.

20
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,600
Let's go.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,800
The royal family is a thousand years away from me.

22
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,600
If he really died because he was looking for you,

23
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,200
I must take revenge for him.

24
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,200
Wait.

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,200
You want to look for me?

26
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,600
Why?

27
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,400
He saw your portrait.

28
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,400
He knows you are important to me.

29
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,200
I mean this.

30
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,600
Okay.

31
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,000
There was an accident with the car.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,800
It exploded after falling.

33
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,000
The time of the accident is certain.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,800
He came to look for me then.

35
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,800
And the time I was chasing the cliff is also certain.

36
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,200
So he might have seen the murderer push you down the cliff

37
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,600
and was found by the murderer.

38
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,800
The murder secret passage?

39
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,000
We have to find the place where the murderer pushed you down.

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,400
The mountain is complicated.

41
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,400
It's hard for us to find the exact location.

42
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,200
What's wrong?

43
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,800
I think I remember the scene.

44
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,000
I was chasing the cliff that day.

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,800
The murderer came back again.

46
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,800
He...

47
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,800
He hit me with a stone.

48
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,200
So the day we met,

49
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,600
you had a wound on your forehead.

50
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,400
Yes.

51
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,800
Huang Yun's mother might have seen the murderer kill someone

52
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,400
and then be killed.

53
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,000
I think I remember.

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,400
I think I remember.

55
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,400
There's definitely anoles at the base.

56
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,900
Where there's anoles?

57
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,400
Here.

58
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,200
It's close enough even for a short person.

59
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,800
Even this way?

60
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,000
It's dangerous concrete by the edge.

61
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's easy to get caught.

62
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,000
The Gesack plot

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,600
is quite near the campsite except for five minutes.

64
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,600
There is only one track from the situation to gets a машинаoler filming site.

65
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,560
Can you, consider that you can?

66
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,400
Brother MV

67
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,680
Vinegar

68
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,320
instrumental

69
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,560
?

70
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,280
Do not push emphasizes

71
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:11,460
Backуж

72
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,220
e

73
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,440
I see

74
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,440
I'll just change to another car.

75
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,840
According to the speed and the distance between the two places,

76
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,040
the distance between the two places is about 6 to 10 minutes.

77
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,240
If we can find the exact time of the car from the wild mountain parking lot

78
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,040
and match the monk's words, then our previous theory is correct.

79
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,440
But now the car has been burned and no evidence.

80
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,440
This person is so obvious.

81
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,240
How about...

82
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,840
You want to kill him? That won't do.

83
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,240
Then how can we guarantee your safety?

84
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,640
Now you seem to be more dangerous.

85
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,240
I'm just joking. How can I really kill someone?

86
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,640
Let's go. We'll just wait for a few more days.

87
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,440
Hey, wait for me.

88
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,040
Hey.

89
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,840
I can't see.

90
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,040
Stop.

91
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,640
The last time we crossed, it was 11 p.m. in the evening 7 days ago.

92
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,640
Last time we went through the hospital, it was 11 p.m.

93
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,640
Let me.

94
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,640
The school broadcast is broadcast live.

95
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,640
Today is July 19, 2005.

96
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,640
The noon break time is 12 p.m.

97
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,640
Let us listen to a song that we want to sing.

98
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,640
Last time we went through the hospital, it was July 12, 2005.

99
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,640
Today is July 19.

100
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,640
It's past zero.

101
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,640
It seems that the hospital is very busy.

102
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,640
It's past zero.

103
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,640
It seems that the key to the crossing is your blood.

104
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,640
Books, library.

105
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,640
And...

106
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,640
Time.

107
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,640
And I found that the first time we went through the hospital in 2005, the location was random.

108
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,640
But the time we went through the hospital was the library.

109
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,640
That crossing is really unreasonable.

110
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,640
It seems that we need to wait seven days for this crossing.

111
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,640
But the time we arrived this time is 12 hours in advance.

112
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:15,640
This time, we must accurately measure the time we stayed.

113
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,640
The crossing...

114
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,640
So annoying.

115
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,640
This is the car plate of Huang Yunmeng.

116
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,640
3.10 p.m.

117
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,640
The time after the car accident is 3.45 p.m.

118
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,640
The murderer has enough time to drive the car to the scene.

119
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,640
And he has time to do the car.

120
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,640
How much time do we have left?

121
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,640
We have to wait for the car to arrive.

122
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,640
We have to wait for the car to arrive.

123
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,640
How much time do we have left?

124
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,640
The first two times were about two hours.

125
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,640
According to this calculation, there should be one hour left.

126
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,640
We can still go back to the school and check.

127
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,640
Although Liu Wanzhou is teaching at Qishan University,

128
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,640
it's summer vacation now. He should not be in the school.

129
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,640
We still need to find the place he decided to stay.

130
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,640
Sorry, I made a mistake.

131
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,640
It's okay.

132
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,640
Wang Haozhi?

133
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,640
Come here, everyone. Wang Haozhi is back.

134
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,640
Wang Haozhi.

135
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,640
Where have you been these days?

136
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,640
You're so worried about us.

137
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,640
You're worried?

138
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,640
I think you're afraid that Wang Haozhi won't do your homework.

139
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,640
You're afraid that I'll always give him a meal card.

140
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,640
Is your girlfriend out of school?

141
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,640
She ran out to play.

142
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,640
Your parents are worried about you.

143
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,640
I went out for a walk. I told my parents.

144
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,640
Brother Wang, it's been a long time. Let's play a game.

145
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,640
That's right.

146
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,640
Next time, next time.

147
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,640
You're the one who likes to play basketball.

148
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,640
Okay, okay.

149
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,640
Let's play a game.

150
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,640
After all, this is your life.

151
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,640
I'll be the referee.

152
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,640
Let's play a game together.

153
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,640
Go!

154
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,640
The End

155
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,640
The rain is really good.

156
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,640
What? You're jealous of me?

157
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,640
I haven't been back for so long.

158
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,640
Everyone misses you.

159
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,640
I'll go back and play for a while.

160
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,640
I'm leaving.

161
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,640
I'm kidding.

162
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,640
Wait.

163
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,640
There are people following us.

164
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,640
Let's go.

165
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,640
They're still following us.

166
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,640
The warehouse has been following us.

167
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,640
Let's go separately. You go to the library.

168
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,640
I'll lead you to the small alley in the lab.

169
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,640
Be careful.

170
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,640
That's it.

171
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,640
Let's go.

172
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,640
Let's go.

173
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,640
Let's go.

174
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,640
Let's go.

175
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,640
Hurry.

176
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,640
Oh, no.

177
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,640
You're the one who's doing this.

178
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,640
Hey, let's go.

179
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,640
Hey, let's go.

180
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,640
Let's go.

181
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,640
Hey, let's go.

182
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,640
Let's go.

183
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,640
Go.

184
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,640
Then...

185
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,640
I'll go to the bathroom.

186
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,640
So far, it's just a heart attack.

187
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,640
It's true.

188
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,640
What if Wang Haozhi is lying?

189
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,640
Impossible.

190
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,640
You don't have any information about Liu Wanzhou.

191
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,640
The reason for Wang Haozhi is that he lost his memory.

192
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,640
But is he really lost his memory?

193
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,640
Huang Yuan, you're not making sense.

194
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:41,640
Don't tell your master that the real Wang Haozhi is already dead?

195
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,640
How can he be so suspicious of that person?

196
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,640
Why do you believe him so much?

197
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,640
Because I knew from the beginning that we would meet again a thousand years later.

198
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,640
So...

199
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,640
Open the door of time and space

200
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:48,640
The sandstorm in my fingers turns the battlefield

201
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:53,640
I hide the flowers of danger

202
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:59,640
When the conflict is in the shadow of the autumn flowers

203
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:05,640
I'll break all the barriers

204
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:11,640
Waiting for a light to light up the window

205
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,640
I still remember the past

206
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,640
The heart is in my hands

207
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:25,640
Wandering for a thousand years to change a look

208
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:30,640
Waiting for a light to bury the past

209
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:35,640
The final farewell is granted

210
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:40,640
I finally walk out of the wall of the past

211
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:45,640
I will be by your side
