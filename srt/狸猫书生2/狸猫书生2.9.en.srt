1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,640
The masks

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,480
This refrigerator

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:06,560
Beautiful

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,140
How coils

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,920
do we take a look

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,440
It's z wieder

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,160
These

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,320
Z

9
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,700
Why

10
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,040
Are there lots of tomatoes

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,400
These

12
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,080
Let's do it

13
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,600
Come here

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,520
Where are the killers?

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,800
Are everyone in the academy here?

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,960
Except for the little four and the school's students,

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,000
they're all here.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,920
No, Wang Sheng and Liu Sheng aren't here.

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,880
Wang Sheng is impossible.

20
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,520
Why is Wang Sheng impossible?

21
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,400
Is it because you two are close?

22
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,000
Wang Sheng and I investigated the case together.

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,560
We almost never left each other.

24
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,200
When did he come to the crime scene?

25
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,000
You're reminding me.

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,320
Before Duan Sheng died,

27
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,840
Wang Sheng had a hard time with him.

28
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,280
He even ran away with all of us.

29
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,440
Duan Sheng was the only one left.

30
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,240
You really want to kill him?

31
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,760
Brother, what are your thoughts?

32
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,000
Killing someone isn't that simple.

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,560
You guys wait.

34
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,200
Why aren't you talking?

35
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,000
Did you think of something?

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,320
Wang Sheng is impossible.

37
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,840
What about the killer?

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,280
You called all of us here,

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,240
and nothing happened?

40
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,680
This proves that the killer is afraid of Wang Sheng.

41
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,360
Then Wang Sheng can't be the killer.

42
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,640
How do we know if you're covering up for Wang Sheng

43
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,760
and deliberately trying to kill him?

44
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,600
Alright.

45
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,480
I believe that Tao Sheng's original intention is good.

46
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,720
During this time, you've done your best for the Academy.

47
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,280
This matter ends here.

48
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,240
Tao Sheng, go back and rest.

49
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:54,560
Leave the investigation to Zhou Sheng.

50
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,280
But Chief.

51
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,920
Alright.

52
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,880
Let's all leave.

53
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,680
Did I really find the wrong direction?

54
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,720
Tao Sheng!

55
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,960
Why are you drinking alone?

56
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,920
Why aren't you waiting for me?

57
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,320
Oh, right.

58
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,240
On the way here today,

59
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,120
a few students were calling me.

60
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,600
That look in their eyes is really strange.

61
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,080
On that day,

62
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,000
the students were all tested.

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,680
Only me, who said that my hand was injured,

64
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,000
didn't go to Yan Da College.

65
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,600
I didn't go to Yan Da College.

66
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,600
Why is your cold so severe?

67
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,400
Where did you go?

68
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,360
I went to the back hill.

69
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,360
What for?

70
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,600
What kind of tone is that?

71
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,760
Tell me the truth.

72
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,120
Where did you get this injury?

73
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,560
What did you do?

74
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,360
These herbs have been in the house for three days.

75
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,160
The wind is still blowing.

76
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,080
You haven't answered my question.

77
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,040
Who did this?

78
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,040
In my house,

79
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,200
I'm the one who wrote this.

80
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,560
What's the point of writing this?

81
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,480
It's your fault.

82
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,600
What's the point of my fault?

83
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,640
I'm a thief.

84
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,440
I don't even know myself.

85
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,400
I don't even know you.

86
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,240
I'm the one who wrote this.

87
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,880
I'm a cook.

88
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,640
What else can I do?

89
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,480
It's not a good thing.

90
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,520
You know what?

91
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,440
Stop arguing.

92
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,480
Listen to me.

93
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,560
Go back to your room and close the windows.

94
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,720
If there are any other issues,

95
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,440
report it to me in time.

96
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,480
Zhong Zi.

97
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,600
Let's go.

98
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,800
Let's go.

99
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,200
Let's go.

100
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,320
Zhong Zi, check it.

101
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,120
It's so scary.

102
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,320
Let's go.

103
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,200
OK.

104
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,560
Hi.

105
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,000
Brother Tao.

106
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,880
Brother Liu, how come you're here?

107
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,120
Please sit down.

108
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,200
Brother Tao, where's Brother Wang?

109
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,360
Doesn't he just come back?

110
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,800
Why isn't he home yet?

111
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,720
Why are you looking for him?

112
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,160
Brother Tao, let me tell you

113
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,200
I went to the back hill to pick herbs secretly today

114
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,000
Brother Wang insisted on going with him

115
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
He said he went to pick some herbs to cure cold

116
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,480
He was clumsy

117
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,920
His hand was cut by the sickle

118
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,120
You didn't see it

119
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,400
The blood kept flowing

120
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,720
I came here today

121
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,160
to give him this

122
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,360
The medicine

123
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,200
It's most effective for knife wounds

124
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,080
You let him apply it

125
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,920
I'll put it here

126
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,480
I'll go first, Brother Tao

127
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,080
Brother Tao, I'll go first

128
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,000
Yes

129
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,600
Why did you sleep at the door?

130
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,200
To be honest

131
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,680
I was worried that

132
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,400
I'm the next target of the murderer.

133
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,920
It's safer to stay at the door.

134
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,920
I'm the next one?

135
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,400
Why?

136
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,520
Usually,

137
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,760
you like to call me Gao Xia.

138
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,160
I'm good at reading.

139
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,120
You're good at talking back to the chief.

140
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,560
So you think it's me.

141
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,840
In this case,

142
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,040
I think it's you.

143
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,080
You and I are good at writing.

144
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,840
I'm good at reading.

145
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,360
You're good at it, too.

146
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,440
You're good at reading.

147
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,760
You're not a mule.

148
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,160
I doubted you today.

149
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,640
I shouldn't have done that.

150
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,800
Why don't I remember?

151
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,000
Let's go.

152
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,680
Hurry up.

153
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,440
Hurry up.

154
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,160
Let's go.

155
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,800
What's the matter?

156
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,560
A man saw His Majesty

157
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,760
in the downhill.

158
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,600
What's wrong with the downhill?

159
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,480
Let's go and talk to him.

160
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,440
He's dead.

161
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,680
I should find the only possibility to solve the mystery

162
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,680
The youth in the world are as free as the wind

163
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,680
Bright and gentle stars

164
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,680
Even if the season ends

165
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,680
You and I will not give up

166
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,680
The youth who live in the waves

167
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,680
Are proud and cold

168
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,680
Always turn back and don't give up

169
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:52,680
When the flowers bloom, the world will be reborn
