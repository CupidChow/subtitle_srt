1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The King of Blaze

2
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,800
You want me to burn that book for you

3
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,800
seven days later?

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,120
This may be a way

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,480
to keep me in 2005.

6
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,720
You've thought it through?

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,280
Of course.

8
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:34,920
First,

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,040
I can find a reason

10
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,160
to prove Liu Wanzhou.

11
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,080
Second,

12
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,440
I have more time

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,760
to find more clues.

14
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:41,760
I can also

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,760
learn for your mother.

16
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,360
If I can't come back,

17
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,360
it doesn't matter.

18
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,080
I'll go alone anyway.

19
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,200
You don't usually

20
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,560
look down on me.

21
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,760
I've been a good boy

22
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,520
since then.

23
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,520
I'll disappear from here.

24
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,680
Isn't it a good idea?

25
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:04,760
Okay.

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,400
I'll help you.

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,920
Seven days later,

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,120
I'll lure Tao Ran away

29
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,400
and we'll meet at the library.

30
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,560
Wang Haoji.

31
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,440
Don't be a fool to judge others.

32
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,240
I've been over you.

33
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,440
After a thousand years,

34
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,680
we'll meet again.

35
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,400
The King of Blaze

36
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,560
will be born again.

37
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,320
I'll help you

38
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,240
solve this problem.

39
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,600
Even if

40
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,800
it's Wang Haoji's job.

41
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,120
What are you thinking about?

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm thinking

43
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,040
that since we have to wait seven days,

44
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,080
why not

45
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,960
go out and have fun?

46
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,520
Where do you want to go?

47
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,440
A place with less people and more fish.

48
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,000
What's the matter with you?

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,160
I'm not interested in that.

50
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,600
I don't know how to say it.

51
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,440
What?

52
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,080
You can't find a place like this?

53
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,880
As long as you want to go,

54
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,000
I'll find it.

55
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,960
Are you hungry?

56
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,360
Give it to me.

57
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,760
Open it up.

58
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,440
I want to see who can vacate the classical school.

59
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,440
Brother Wang is really a great person.

60
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,440
Playing needs physical strength, okay?

61
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,440
The taste is gone.

62
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,440
What? It's not good?

63
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,440
Do you want to trade with me?

64
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,440
I think your one is better.

65
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,440
Okay.

66
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,440
Only two of us today.

67
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,440
Too many people.

68
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,440
You think I'm upset?

69
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,440
Boss is generous.

70
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,440
Do you know?

71
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,440
Mr. Ren said only seven seconds left.

72
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,440
It's not worth it at all.

73
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,440
How long was it?

74
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,440
According to the latest research, it was one to three months.

75
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,440
That's actually quite short.

76
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,440
Do you miss home when you stay here?

77
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,440
I do. So what?

78
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,440
I can't go back anyway.

79
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,440
2005 should be very important to you.

80
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:17,440
Your classmates, friends, family,

81
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,440
and those people and memories are all very important.

82
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,440
Actually, there are important people here.

83
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,440
Actually, sometimes I envy you.

84
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,440
What do I have to envy?

85
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,440
A thousand years ago, I was an orphan.

86
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,440
Until I met you, I was the only one I knew.

87
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,440
During this time, I always remember

88
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:52,440
the memories of studying and solving cases together in the academy.

89
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,440
When people have memories, it seems that they don't have too many.

90
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,440
Memories are indeed very important.

91
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,440
Actually, I think the tricycle is more exciting.

92
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,440
I think so too.

93
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,440
The faster the better.

94
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,440
Let's go again next time.

95
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,440
Find something more exciting.

96
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,440
Boss, I want this.

97
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,440
One hundred and one.

98
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,440
The head is not a set circle.

99
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,440
It's too dark. How do you throw this?

100
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,440
Does it hurt?

101
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,440
Give it to me.

102
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,440
The head is not a set circle.

103
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,440
The head is not a set circle.

104
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,440
I'm afraid to admit it.

105
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,440
One year is not a set circle.

106
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,440
I'm here.

107
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,440
I'm here.

108
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,440
Where else do you want to go?

109
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,440
Let's drink.

110
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,440
We haven't drunk yet.

111
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,440
Okay, let's continue drinking.

112
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,440
Forget it.

113
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,440
Next time.

114
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,440
Let's send her to the hospital first.

115
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,440
You have this cat.

116
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,440
I'll give you the photo as a souvenir.

117
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,440
Thank you.

118
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,440
Look.

119
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,440
Good boy.

120
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,440
Good boy.

121
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,440
Let's pretend we have a memory.

122
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,440
It's the seventh day.

123
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,440
I'll go back.

124
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,440
Burn the tree.

125
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,440
The End

126
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,440
Xiao Qing.

127
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,440
The End

128
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,440
The End

129
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,440
The End
