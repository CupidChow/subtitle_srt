Episode 1

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
When Lord Zhang died,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
the students were discussing in the exam room.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The only ones who had time to do so were Xiao Si and Shu Hong.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Let's go to the backyard and take a look.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Who is this?

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
A good-looking fan is pouring so much water.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Xiao Ge, what's going on?

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This fan is very durable.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Normally, it wouldn't pour so much water.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Look over there, it's broken.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's not even alive if you want to save it.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Has this happened before?

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's not going to happen.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Why would this happen when it's a crime?

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Are you okay?

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm fine. Just a little bit of a stab wound.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Brother Tao,

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
you said it's the same thing.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Look at this.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's like someone washed it.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It has the taste of blood.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
There must be other clues.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Let's look for them.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The black stain on this cloth

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
must be the ashes.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But this can't prove that

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
the cloth was left by the murderer.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
At least it proves that there was a fierce fight.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It could be a crime scene.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Let's go ask who has been in the backyard recently.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Let's go.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The backyard is where we servants come out.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Even Mr. Zhang and the students are rare.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I've seen Mr. Zhang in the backyard.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I didn't find anything suspicious.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
There are also students.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Duan Sheng often comes back from the backyard.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It seems that your guess is right.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You mean Duan Sheng's clothes

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
is not a crime scene?

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's very likely.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I've looked at the lake many times.

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
There's no clue.

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Let's go check Duan Sheng's body.

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
We'll know.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The back of the head was hit by a fierce blow.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
There are no other obvious wounds on the body.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The wounds on the back of the head

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
must be the cause of death.

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Look at his white clothes.

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
There are obvious black marks.

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's indeed ashes.

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Ashes?

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Duan Sheng is so self-righteous.

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
He's not a murderer.

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
He's a murderer.

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
He's a murderer.

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
He's a murderer.

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
He's a high-ranking official.

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
He won't go to the back of the head.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I think

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
he must have fought with the murderer.

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He must have fought with the murderer.

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Then he must be

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
a person who often goes to the back of the head.

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And he will directly

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
get in touch with the back of the head.

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Do you know who the murderer is?

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm not sure.

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The fire in the academy

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
has always been managed by the school.

74
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Plus,

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
the blood in the back garden.

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
No matter which one,

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
we should go to the back of the head.

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
If he's a murderer,

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
he's playing the whole school.

80
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's a great opportunity.

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Please wait, young masters.

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The back of the head is a place for servants.

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You can't come here.

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's cold.

85
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We want to get some charcoal to warm up.

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'll go back and get some.

87
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I wonder who's the master of the back garden?

88
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You're not here at the right time.

89
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The charcoal is

90
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
managed by Fan Shutong.

91
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Fan Shutong is not here.

92
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Do you know where he is?

93
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Where can he go?

94
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Maybe he's sent food and water

95
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
to his son.

96
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What's the relationship between Fan Shutong and Zhou Sheng?

97
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's not about the master.

98
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Zhou Sheng is in trouble.

99
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
He's only left to visit his son.

100
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
How is Zhou Sheng's life?

101
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's good.

102
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'll give you an example.

103
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
One night,

104
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I need to clean the yard.

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Fan Shutong didn't rest well.

106
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
He asked me to change the time

107
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
of work.

108
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
When?

109
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The day of Duan Sheng's death.

110
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Fan Shutong is here.

111
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Fan Shutong,

112
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
wait.

113
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Hello,

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
what can I do for you?

115
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Why are you avoiding us?

116
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You're kidding.

117
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm a student.

118
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm sorry to see you.

119
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
How can I avoid you?

120
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Don't be nervous.

121
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
We just want to ask you something.

122
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Please go ahead.

123
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The charcoal fire

124
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
in the academy

125
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
is managed by you?

126
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yes. But sometimes

127
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
other students and students come to help.

128
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Where were you that night?

129
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I was in the yard.

130
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That night, my son gave me

131
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
a soup.

132
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm afraid your son didn't drink

133
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
the soup you gave him.

134
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Do you know this?

135
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
According to the color

136
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
and material,

137
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
it should be Shutong's clothes.

138
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You're in charge of the charcoal fire.

139
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
How do you explain the charcoal fire?

140
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm not the only one

141
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
in charge of the charcoal fire.

142
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Besides, my clothes are intact.

143
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It proves

144
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
that I'm related to the broken cloth.

145
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Your clothes are intact

146
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
because you recently

147
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
got a new Shutong's clothes.

148
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
There are records of it everywhere.

149
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So what?

150
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You're saying that the broken cloth

151
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
is not allowed to be changed?

152
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
That's because

153
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
you were in a fight with Duansheng.

154
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So you had to change it.

155
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You...

156
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You're just saying that

157
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
the cloth

158
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
was found at the scene of Duansheng's crime.

159
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Isn't that enough evidence?

160
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
How could it be?

161
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I haven't been to the lake recently.

162
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
How could I leave it there?

163
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Stop arguing.

164
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I don't care about the lake.

165
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I want to see the lake from the back.

166
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm sorry.

167
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm sorry.

168
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm sorry.

169
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm sorry.

172
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm sorry.

173
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm sorry.

174
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm sorry.

175
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm sorry.

176
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm sorry.

177
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm sorry.

178
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm sorry.

179
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm sorry.

180
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm sorry.

181
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm sorry.

182
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm sorry.

183
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm sorry.

184
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm sorry.

185
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm sorry.

186
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm sorry.

187
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm sorry.

188
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm sorry.

189
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
