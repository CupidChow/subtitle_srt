1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,960
The Navigator

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,160
Episode 06

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,660
One itch.

4
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,460
Five itches.

5
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,840
Six itches.

6
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,060
Apply some medicine to your feet.

7
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:17,960
Touch.

8
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:18,940
After the ride,

9
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,240
servants go to bed.

10
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,500
F Dü cool.

11
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:27,880
After the ride,

12
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,120
Kind from looking at the hands.

13
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,960
Students,

14
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,360
you're too kind.

15
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,800
The champion of the Academy?

16
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,400
I don't think so.

17
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,560
I heard that the Academy

18
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,080
can compete with Brother Shao Zhong

19
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,520
in the competition.

20
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,240
There's only one brother.

21
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,640
I have a question.

22
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,280
I wonder if Brother Tao

23
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,000
can get in.

24
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,880
Tell me.

25
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,600
Here's the question.

26
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,960
The word

27
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,840
is being deceived.

28
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,000
Entrif Who do you promote

29
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,760
this name?

30
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,740
It should be

31
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,260
Qur'an.

32
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,560
Don't botherостom.

33
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,480
Can't talk about this.

34
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,240
Good.

35
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,080
I have a question.

36
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,680
Paper, light, music.

37
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,280
Tao Shaozhong, you scolded me

38
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,840
Why?

39
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,480
Shao Zhixiong, explain

40
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,200
The last sentence of Yi Zhixiong

41
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,160
The young man left home and the old man returned

42
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,560
The old man and the young man

43
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,400
Only one bell was missing

44
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,560
That is Shaozhong

45
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,680
This means my name

46
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,360
Tao Shaozhong

47
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,800
Shaozhong

48
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,000
Interesting

49
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,640
Then this sentence

50
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,160
Wushe Kongkong, dog-calling

51
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,120
Why did you scold Yi Zhixiong?

52
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,200
I understand

53
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,680
Only one dog is left to be called dog

54
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,040
Yi Zhizhi

55
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,560
Wang Yi Zhizhi

56
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,320
Interesting

57
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,560
Don't laugh

58
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:14,920
Brother Wang

59
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,440
Are you angry?

60
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,040
You have to change another sentence for me

61
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,520
OK

62
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,880
I'll change another sentence for you

63
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,360
Wushe, I am here

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,360
Wusho, I am here

65
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,760
I know this sentence

66
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,880
Only one dog is left to be called dog

67
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,880
It's better

68
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,160
It is a loss for you

69
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,160
It's time to open

70
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,240
Open

71
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,600
For Hond judging

72
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,980
Hond

73
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,240
Wait there

74
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,640
Get out of my way

75
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,640
I'll let you go!

76
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,640
I'll let you go!

77
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,640
Stop!

78
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,640
Brother Duan, why are you so agitated over a little wild cat?

79
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,640
That's right.

80
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,640
What identity are you? How dare you teach me?

81
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,640
We are both students of the Academy. Why should we be divided into three or six?

82
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,640
Duan Shao, as the son of the Guan family,

83
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,600
you are so strong and weak. You really are a

84
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,640
bully.

85
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,640
A bully?

86
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,640
You're joking.

87
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,640
I, Duan Shao, am a bully too?

88
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,640
Or is it that this kind of cunning and mischievous boy is not worth it?

89
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,640
Duan Shao, don't go too far!

90
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,640
You asked him?

91
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,640
Am I going too far?

92
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,640
It's my fault. It's my fault. I annoyed Mr. Duan.

93
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,980
I'm like a

94
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,640
dog who is afraid of death.

95
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,640
You're so mean.

96
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:00,640
It's really hurtful to be with a cunning and mischievous boy like you.

97
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,640
You...

98
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,640
This leg is broken.

99
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,640
It's okay.

100
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,640
I can still eat even if I die. Thank you, Mr. Wu.

101
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,640
I heard that this Huang Shen is a rare talent.

102
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,640
He can only live in the grassland with his sister.

103
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,640
He is just a poor man. He actually did such a cunning and mischievous thing.

104
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,640
It shouldn't be.

105
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,640
Brother Huang lives in this place?

106
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,640
It's so dark. It's quite scary.

107
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,640
A nose is not able to smile.

108
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,640
Let the eyes see the wind and rain.

109
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:56,640
A mouth says it's crying.

110
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,640
The sound of the horn is not heard.

111
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,640
Who are you looking for?

112
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,640
Ah...

113
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,640
Brother, if there's anything you want to eat,

114
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,640
just tell us. We'll bring it to you.

115
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,640
That's right. We don't want to bother Duan.

116
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,640
No need. I'm used to it.

117
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,640
Used to it?

118
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,640
Brother, how can you say such a useless thing?

119
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,640
You can't say that I'm your brother.

120
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,640
Brother, I'm sorry.

121
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,640
I love you.

122
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,640
Brother, don't blame me.

123
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,640
Brother is straightforward.

124
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,640
Why don't you report to the mountain chief?

125
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,640
So what?

126
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,640
Duan Shen will only make a difference.

127
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,640
I'm afraid that I won't even have a chance to study.

128
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,640
As long as I can study in the academy,

129
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,640
I can suffer a little.

130
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,640
What's the harm?

131
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:05,640
Little cat, little cat, come quickly.

132
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,640
Eat this little heart.

133
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,640
What song is this?

134
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,640
Why does it sound strange?

135
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,640
It's a folk song.

136
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,640
This is a cat and a dog song.

137
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,640
If you bully people, they will eat them.

138
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,640
I think if there is really a cat in this world,

139
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,640
I won't say anything else.

140
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,640
Just scare Duan Shen like this.

141
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,640
Let him do things in the future.

142
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,640
Little cat, little cat, come quickly.

143
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,640
Eat this little heart.

144
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,640
Let's go.

145
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,640
Hey.

146
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,640
You leave when you see me?

147
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,640
What are you afraid of?

148
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,640
Did you steal something again?

149
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,640
No.

150
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,640
Young Master Duan, these are the herbs that I picked for my sister.

151
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,640
I didn't steal it.

152
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,640
Don't pick it.

153
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,640
I can pick it as I like.

154
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,640
Then I will go home.

155
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,640
You want to hit me or scold me.

156
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,640
I will stand it.

157
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,640
Okay, come.

158
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,640
Okay.

159
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,640
You drank a lot.

160
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,640
I owe you a favor.

161
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,640
I'll beat you.

162
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,640
Hit me.

163
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,640
I'll hit myself.

164
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,640
What's the matter?

165
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,640
Stop.

166
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,640
Get out of the way.

167
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,640
I don't have a chance.

168
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,640
You guys are so vicious.

169
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,640
This has nothing to do with me.

170
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,640
I just let them teach me a lesson.

171
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,640
I didn't want to kill him.

172
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,640
What is that?

173
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,640
The one who bullies his peers will die.

174
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,640
The one who bullies his peers will die.

175
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,640
The one who bullies his peers will die.

176
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,640
The one who bullies his peers will die.

177
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,640
The one who bullies his peers will die.

178
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,640
The one who bullies his peers will die.

179
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,640
The one who bullies his peers will die.

180
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,640
The one who bullies his peers will die.

181
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,640
The one who bullies his peers will die.

182
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,640
The one who bullies his peers will die.

183
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,640
The one who bullies his peers will die.

184
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,640
The one who bullies his peers will die.

185
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,640
The one who bullies his peers will die.

186
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,640
The one who bullies his peers will die.

187
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,640
The one who bullies his peers will die.

188
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,640
The one who bullies his peers will die.

189
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,640
The one who bullies his peers will die.
