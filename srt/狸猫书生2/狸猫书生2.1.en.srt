1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
THEleneK'Sala

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This is the place has I mentioned in the polite explanation

3
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:47,680
Who is it?

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,660
The time has finally arrived.

5
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,200
I remember Chondorodcle.

6
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,600
I didn't expect to lose a new body.

7
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,660
I should do something important now.

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I can't use magic anymore.

9
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What can I do?

10
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It seems that I have to get used to it.

11
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I have to get used to it.

12
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
After a thousand years,

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I really don't recognize this person.

14
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Qing Shan University?

15
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Is this the Qing Shan Academy from a thousand years ago?

16
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Hey, you!

17
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You're going to fight?

18
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm going to fight.

19
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Wait a minute.

20
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Which room?

21
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Close the door.

22
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
There are traces here.

23
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's her.

24
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's her.

25
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What's wrong?

26
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Qing Shan Academy

27
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
She really doesn't remember me.

28
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Qing Shan Academy

29
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Hello? Hello?

30
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Tao Ran?

31
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You...

32
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Are you okay?

33
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I...

34
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What do you mean, I?

35
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You have to go to the hospital.

36
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I...

37
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Hurry up.

38
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's okay.

39
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Just blow it up.

40
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Your head is broken.

41
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
What if your brain is blocked?

42
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Let's go.

43
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
No need.

44
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's okay.

45
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'll do it myself.

46
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Hey, classmate.

47
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What's wrong with you?

48
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
We're almost there.

49
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Where are we going?

50
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
We'll do a nuclear shock in the hospital.

51
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Nuclear?

52
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Why do we have to do it together?

53
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Have you ever done a nuclear shock before?

54
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I've never heard of it.

55
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Nuclear shock is a device that can detect five organs and six organs.

56
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm not going.

57
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
What if this is the only way to see the real body?

58
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I...

59
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I was attacked by bandits.

60
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I don't want to break the law.

61
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'll solve the previous problem.

62
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You don't have to worry.

63
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's just a small injury.

64
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Don't be so awkward.

65
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Do you have a family to take care of you?

66
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Give me the contact information.

67
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
My parents are dead.

68
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I came here alone.

69
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You live alone?

70
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's always been like this.

71
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Okay.

72
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'll go.

73
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Next classmate, pull the curtains.

74
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Okay.

75
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Let's go.

76
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
That was the smart housekeeper.

77
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Housekeeper?

78
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Who?

79
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Who's playing the piano?

80
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I just got a heart attack.

81
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Come on, Lian.

82
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Change hands.

83
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
This water is like a frozen pond.

84
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
This is an automatic water machine.

85
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
This is my baby, Li.

86
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The water is here.

87
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Let's take care of the wound first.

88
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What's wrong?

89
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Nothing.

90
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Thank you.

91
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Give me your hand.

92
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You broke the table.

93
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I don't want it.

94
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You've never seen smart furniture before?

95
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I...

96
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I was born in the mountains.

97
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You're from the countryside?

98
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
No wonder.

99
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I didn't mean to be impolite.

100
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Where did you get it?

101
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
How did you get the wound?

102
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I remember when I woke up,

103
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I couldn't remember clearly

104
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
in the mountains.

105
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Okay, okay.

106
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Don't think too much.

107
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's important to recover.

108
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm just doing it now.

109
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You should go to the hospital tomorrow.

110
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
No, I'm fine now.

111
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
What did you call me?

112
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Tao...

113
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I saw your trophy.

114
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's written Tao Ran.

115
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I was so surprised.

116
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I see.

117
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Go and take a hot bath.

118
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Don't get water on your wound.

119
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You're willing to take me in?

120
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You're injured.

121
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You're alone.

122
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
If I can help,

123
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
you don't have to...

124
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Thank you, Tao.

125
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Tao Ran

126
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000

Tao Ran

128
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm Wang Yi Zhi.

129
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Let me go.

130
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
What did you do to him?

131
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
From now on,

132
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm willing to take you in.

133
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
What's going on?

134
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It's really started.

135
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Tao Ran

136
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
