1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,400
S

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So this is the place that Li Mao mentioned in his book.

3
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Who's there?

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:50,020
Thanks for watching Jasper replay Special, and keep on some DCU fun!

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I can't use magic anymore.

6
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What can I do?

7
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It seems that I have to get used to it.

8
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I have to get used to it.

9
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
After a thousand years,

10
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I really don't recognize this person.

11
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Qing Shan University?

12
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Is this the Qing Shan Academy from a thousand years ago?

13
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Hey, you!

14
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You're going to fight?

15
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm going to fight.

16
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Wait a minute.

17
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Which room?

18
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Close the door.

19
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
There are traces here.

20
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's her.

21
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's her.

22
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What's wrong?

23
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Qing Shan Academy

24
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
She really doesn't remember me.

25
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Qing Shan Academy

26
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Hello? Hello?

27
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Tao Ran?

28
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You...

29
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Are you okay?

30
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I...

31
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What do you mean, I?

32
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You have to go to the hospital.

33
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I...

34
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Hurry up.

35
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's okay.

36
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Just blow it up.

37
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Your head is broken.

38
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
What if your brain is blocked?

39
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Let's go.

40
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
No need.

41
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's okay.

42
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'll do it myself.

43
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Hey, classmate.

44
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What's wrong with you?

45
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
We're almost there.

46
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Where are we going?

47
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
We'll do a nuclear shock in the hospital.

48
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Nuclear?

49
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Why do we have to do it together?

50
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Have you ever done a nuclear shock before?

51
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I've never heard of it.

52
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Nuclear shock is a device that can detect five organs and six organs.

53
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm not going.

54
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
What if this is the only way to see the real body?

55
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I...

56
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I was attacked by bandits.

57
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I don't want to break the law.

58
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'll solve the previous problem.

59
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You don't have to worry.

60
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's just a small injury.

61
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Don't be so awkward.

62
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Do you have a family to take care of you?

63
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Give me the contact information.

64
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
My parents are dead.

65
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I came here alone.

66
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You live alone?

67
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's always been like this.

68
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Okay.

69
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'll go.

70
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Next classmate, pull the curtains.

71
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Okay.

72
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Let's go.

73
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
That was the smart housekeeper.

74
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Housekeeper?

75
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Who?

76
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Who's playing the piano?

77
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I just got a heart attack.

78
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Come on, Lian.

79
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Change hands.

80
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
This water is like a frozen pond.

81
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
This is an automatic water machine.

82
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
This is my baby, Li.

83
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The water is here.

84
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Let's take care of the wound first.

85
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What's wrong?

86
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Nothing.

87
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Thank you.

88
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Give me your hand.

89
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You broke the table.

90
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I don't want it.

91
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You've never seen smart furniture before?

92
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I...

93
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I was born in the mountains.

94
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You're from the countryside?

95
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
No wonder.

96
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I didn't mean to be impolite.

97
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Where did you get it?

98
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
How did you get the wound?

99
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I remember when I woke up,

100
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I couldn't remember clearly

101
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
in the mountains.

102
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Okay, okay.

103
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Don't think too much.

104
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's important to recover.

105
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm just doing it now.

106
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You should go to the hospital tomorrow.

107
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
No, I'm fine now.

108
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
What did you call me?

109
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Tao...

110
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I saw your trophy.

111
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's written Tao Ran.

112
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I was so surprised.

113
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I see.

114
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Go and take a hot bath.

115
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Don't get water on your wound.

116
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You're willing to take me in?

117
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You're injured.

118
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You're alone.

119
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
If I can help,

120
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
you don't have to...

121
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Thank you, Tao.

122
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Tao Ran

123
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Tao Ran

124
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Tao Ran

125
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm Wang Yi Zhi.

126
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Let me go.

127
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
What did you do to him?

128
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
From now on,

129
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm willing to take you in.

130
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
What's going on?

131
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It's really started.

132
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Tao Ran

133
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Tao Ran

134
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Tao Ran

135
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
