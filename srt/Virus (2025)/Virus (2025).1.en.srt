1
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,429
WHAT'S HIS DEAL?
IT'S BEEN OVER 30 MINUTES

2
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:55,680
IS HE SITTING SOMEWHERE ELSE?

3
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,730
THERE'S ONE OTHER COUPLE HERE BESIDES ME

4
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,442
HE MUST BE STUCK IN TRAFFIC
BECAUSE OF THE RAIN

5
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:08,610
CAN YOU WAIT A BIT? PLEASE?

6
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,498
Hello.

7
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,794
MISSING THE SUNNY DAYS!
YOUR FOREVER PRESIDENT, KIM YEON-WOO

8
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,420
Ms. Ok Taek-seon?

9
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,466
Hi, I'm Nam Su-pil. Your sister set us up.

10
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,470
-Hello.
-Hi.

11
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,268
The new student…

12
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,940
had a nosebleed.

13
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:51,402
Everyone is busy
with their theses these days.

14
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:55,615
Right. I need to check
how the enzyme was handled by lunchtime

15
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,742
and send the amino acid for sequencing.

16
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:02,455
Thanks to MERS and COVID-19,
researchers like us are in demand now.

17
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,960
Well…

18
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,045
What's your major?

19
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,132
I can't remember.

20
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,342
It's been over ten years
since I graduated.

21
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,514
I studied Korean literature.

22
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:20,849
I see.

23
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:24,060
I heard that
you attended a graduate school

24
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:27,021
for simultaneous interpretation
in English.

25
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:30,650
Right. I wanted to write a novel,
but I learned it wasn't for me.

26
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,193
So I switched to English.

27
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:35,113
I wanted to be an interpreter,
but that wasn't for me either.

28
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:36,614
So I'm a translator now.

29
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,784
Looks like translation was meant for you.

30
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,623
Do you like mice?

31
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,544
I wouldn't say I like them.
It's more like grief.

32
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:51,546
Grief?

33
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:56,175
I once had a mutant mouse from Japan
for a diabetes project,

34
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,135
named Masako.

35
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,344
"Masako"?

36
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:02,181
We usually name the mice
that we work with.

37
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:06,144
And Masako's last words were,

38
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:09,355
"Remember my death.
Make sure it wasn't for nothing."

39
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,983
-The mouse said that?
-In my dream.

40
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,067
In your dream?

41
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:15,486
I see.

42
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,740
She may have been a lab mouse,

43
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:22,076
but she was quite ill before she died.

44
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:26,623
Lab mice live and die solely
for the sake of humans.

45
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,208
They die
when we draw blood from their hearts

46
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,960
and when their body temperature drops.

47
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,129
And sometimes,
they just die for no reason.

48
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,342
What's your favorite animal?

49
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,093
Cat.

50
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:48,019
Excuse me.

51
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,562
Hey, Jeong-hun.

52
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,731
Just turn the machine and take it out.

53
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,067
Just leave it.

54
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,236
I'm sorry, but I need to leave now.

55
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,154
Sure, go ahead. Work is important.

56
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,656
It's an important experiment.

57
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:03,451
I'm sorry.
I wanted to grab some food with you.

58
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,828
I'll call you another time,
Ms. Ok Sin-taek.

59
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,247
-It's Taek-seon.
-Pardon?

60
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,999
-Never mind. Please go ahead.
-Okay.

61
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,919
What if Jennifer dies too?

62
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,838
No, don't feed her.

63
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:19,008
No! First,

64
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,970
put those things back and…

65
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:23,972
That's right!

66
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,480
Have you seen a long green umbrella here?

67
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,358
I think the man took it earlier.

68
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,318
He took my umbrella?

69
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,120
Damn it.

70
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,249
All I remember
from the date today is the mouse.

71
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,625
The mouse?

72
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,836
He said he heard the mouse's last words.

73
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:37,920
What?

74
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,589
The mouse's name was Masako.

75
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,799
Masako?

76
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,760
He asked me why she said those words.

77
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,304
He's kind of weird,

78
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:49,474
but it means he takes his work seriously.

79
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,768
He's always either at home or in the lab.

80
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,312
I bet he hasn't dated many girls either.

81
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,898
That only makes him weirder.

82
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,149
But he's a doctor.

83
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:00,860
He makes good money,
and he's never been married.

84
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,363
-At your age, he's a pretty good--
-Are you on his side?

85
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,448
Of course.

86
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,534
Jeez, snap out of it.

87
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,746
I told you not to take these.

88
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,956
I only take them when I can't fall asleep.

89
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,834
Just give him one more chance.

90
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,003
This could be your only chance
to date a doctor.

91
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:22,590
Apparently, human translators won't be
needed anymore because of AI.

92
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:25,802
When you lose your job,
don't expect me to help.

93
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:30,139
Look. No matter how good AI gets,
only humans can handle the details.

94
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:34,143
And you're still single because
you're hung up on the stupid details.

95
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,436
Look at your sister.

96
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,063
She never got good grades,

97
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:40,024
but she got a nice husband
with that smiley face.

98
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,193
He even opened a hair salon for her.

99
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,445
And stop drinking alone at home.

100
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,614
Why drink alone? It's pathetic.

101
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:49,534
Jeez, could you two leave now?

102
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:53,579
Seriously, what's with
all the cooking and cleaning today?

103
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,956
Today's not my birthday.

104
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,917
And you. Why did you put
makeup on my face at this hour?

105
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,337
It only added to my stress.
My face isn't your practice dummy.

106
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,506
And you look prettier now. Oh, he's here.

107
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,343
-Hello.
-Hello.

108
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:10,179
Oh, my. You really came.

109
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,140
Was it difficult to find?

110
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,349
No, it was all right.

111
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,518
-Did you plan all this?
-Please come in.

112
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,770
Oh, my.

113
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,982
Did you run? You're all sweaty.

114
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:23,151
-Mom, let's go.
-Okay.

115
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,821
You're a doctor,
so you know what to do, right?

116
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:29,282
You're both grown-ups.

117
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,200
Go ahead and have a heart-to-heart, okay?

118
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,536
Are you really going to
leave me alone here?

119
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,829
You told us to leave.

120
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,998
Right. Don't talk about mice, okay?

121
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,543
-Let's go.
-The stove's on. Watch out for the pot.

122
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:42,879
Now, come on.

123
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,729
Taek-seon, I'm not a bad person.

124
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,898
That's what all the bad ones say.

125
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,820
Look, Mr. Nam.

126
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:08,905
Yes.

127
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,282
Please leave now.

128
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,201
I don't think this is going to work.

129
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,453
We barely know each other.

130
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,705
We can't be doing this here
at this time of night.

131
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,707
This is where I live by myself, you know.

132
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,791
Right.

133
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,419
I'm sorry.

134
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,754
-I'll leave.
-Okay.

135
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,549
Can I ask you one thing, though?

136
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,136
Sure, go ahead.

137
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,514
Could you say your name and mine backward?

138
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,474
Su-pil…

139
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:38,601
Pil-su?

140
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,521
"Choice required"?

141
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,147
-It's not funny, right?
-No.

142
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,899
Right. I'm sorry.

143
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,664
Are you crying?

144
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,589
Mr. Nam.

145
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:11,801
Mr. Nam?

146
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:17,014
The world's a tough place, you know.

147
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,684
You're more of a softie than I am.

148
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:23,854
I thought we were on the same page.

149
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,359
Is this some sort of a power game?

150
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,322
What's a power game?

151
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,866
Never mind. Don't worry about it.

152
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,827
You said you were studying

153
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,204
molecular virology, right?

154
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,958
People usually forget that
after hearing it once.

155
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,003
You talked about it for a long time.

156
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,673
Let me tell you a secret.

157
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:54,760
I'm actually studying
something very important.

158
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,722
It's about human happiness.

159
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,515
-Happiness?
-Yes.

160
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:03,352
The person who was in charge
went to the US, so I took over.

161
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,730
If this succeeds, it's going to be huge.

162
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,237
What…

163
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,822
CHECK OUT OUR UPDATED CATALOG!

164
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:15,823
Who is it?

165
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,160
It's a message
from my elementary school group chat.

166
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,870
Oh, that's a relief.

167
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,041
I wish today was Christmas.

168
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,210
Why?

169
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,796
Well…

170
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,592
That's my birthday, and I've never had
a girlfriend to spend it with.

171
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:39,305
Do you know the book
Around the World in Eighty Days?

172
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,433
That's always been my dream.

173
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:45,394
Traveling the world
with my girlfriend for 80 days.

174
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,271
Taek-seon.

175
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:49,899
You're so beautiful.

176
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,067
I put on makeup.

177
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,568
Why don't we do it together?

178
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,819
Let's travel the world.

179
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,530
Your pupils are dilated.

180
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,824
Shall we celebrate this day?

181
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,619
It's the day we became a couple.

182
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,665
Hey! What are you doing?

183
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,042
What the…

184
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:13,798
Let's…

185
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:17,510
get married.

186
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,845
I'm serious.

187
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:21,347
Get off me.

188
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,725
-What do you take me for?
-Taek-seon, don't get me wrong.

189
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:26,811
Taek-seon.

190
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,398
Taek-seon.

191
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,109
I'm sorry.
I'm not the kind of person you think I am.

192
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,568
I didn't feel anything at first,

193
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:37,696
but then my heart raced
and I couldn't stop thinking of you.

194
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,115
-I--
-Su-pil.

195
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:42,451
You seem like a good person.

196
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,787
But please leave now.

197
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:47,665
Or I'll have to call the police.

198
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:51,210
You don't even know me.
I'm not a good person.

199
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,421
You mentioned
Around the World in Eighty Days.

200
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:57,133
I've once stayed home for over 80 days.

201
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,135
Can you imagine what that's like?

202
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,388
When I'm hurt,
I hold the resentment for 100 years.

203
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,098
That's the kind of person I am.

204
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,727
So don't do this to me

205
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,313
because of a momentary feeling.

206
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,065
Okay?

207
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,660
What a strange man.

208
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,750
"If you had seen him
without knowing that he's in love,

209
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,586
you would've thought he was crazy."

210
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,046
Love? As if.

211
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,216
Did he go crazy because of love
or is it the other way around?

212
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:41,760
Jeez.

213
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,613
What a waste.

214
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,926
Are you having a great day?

215
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,011
Test-drive our new car.
First come, first served.

216
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,097
I'll see you at the store.

217
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,600
Your forever president, Kim Yeon-woo.

218
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:15,354
PHARMACEUTICAL DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT CENTER

219
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,439
LABORATORY ANIMAL CENTER

220
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,484
-Don't we look good together?
-Come on. Let me see.

221
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,404
-She looks upset.
-What are you talking about?

222
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,197
She's being shy.

223
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,700
-And that's her place?
-Yes.

224
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,077
On the first day you met her?

225
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,161
Yes.

226
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,497
Did you stay the night?

227
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,208
That's enough.

228
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,960
She's wild.

229
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,671
I'm actually worried about you.

230
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:44,717
I literally only slept there.
And I'm going to marry her anyway, so…

231
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,136
You talk about marriage
on the day you met her?

232
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,431
I guess that's what it's like
when you found the one.

233
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,894
-I miss her so much.
-Jeez.

234
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,356
You got a hickey.

235
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,734
You weren't sleeping.

236
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,987
You had a wild night.

237
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,364
Our seniors said
people like us should be careful.

238
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:10,284
Because we only hang out with mice,
we don't know people.

239
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,407
-Can I just do it?
-As you wish.

240
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,159
-Okay, then…
-Yeon-u!

241
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,621
Taek-seon?

242
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,582
First, press the start button.

243
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,461
Your foot.

244
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,089
-The brake.
-Right.

245
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,843
-That was stupid of me.
-Not at all.

246
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:13,555
Now, this will make you more comfortable.

247
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,849
Because you have long legs.

248
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:19,019
Compared to other models,

249
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,771
-this model's interior--
-Yeon-u.

250
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:21,689
Yes, ma'am?

251
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:22,773
I mean, yes?

252
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,316
This is awkward.

253
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,319
You're being too polite,
almost like a stranger.

254
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:31,198
Of course. You're my customer.

255
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,410
Speaking of which,
you've changed a lot too.

256
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,912
You look much brighter and prettier.

257
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,206
Did you get some work done?

258
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,666
Come on.

259
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,293
Just kidding.

260
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:46,797
But seriously, you pretty much
never showed up to our reunions.

261
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,174
I was wondering how you were doing.

262
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,221
You were wondering about me?

263
00:16:56,098 --> 00:17:00,394
Of course. What car do you drive now?

264
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:03,814
-You'll have to sell it. I know someone--
-I don't have a car.

265
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,482
-This will be your first car?
-Yes.

266
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,194
What did you say you did for a living?

267
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,863
Yeon-u, can I test-drive this car?

268
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:15,868
Right, test-driving.
That's the process, for sure.

269
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,336
Seriously, I recommend
that you test-drive it yourself.

270
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,922
The car owner should test-drive it…

271
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,507
You have a driver's license, right?

272
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,469
Step on it.

273
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,887
How about the Olympic Expressway?

274
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,346
Let's go to the beach.

275
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:41,018
Taek-seon, I get that you're excited,

276
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,437
but you need to stay

277
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,523
within three kilometers of our branch
for the test-drive.

278
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:41,203
What do you think of the color?
Do you want the same color?

279
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,205
Do you have a specific color in mind?

280
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,959
You know what I think?

281
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,670
We all live to be a hundred,

282
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:53,048
but your memories can keep you alive

283
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,550
or kill you.

284
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,219
For us, it's just a few contracts
that determine our lives.

285
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,097
Take it easy.

286
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:01,765
Do you remember

287
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,810
how I cried my eyes out

288
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:07,437
when we had to dissect frogs
in fifth-grade science class?

289
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,648
As the class president,
you stood up and said

290
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,984
that we couldn't go on like this,

291
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,778
and that we should take a vote and decide.

292
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:15,863
For me.

293
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,115
Right.

294
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,909
Then we won the vote,

295
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,495
so we let all the frogs go
in the school lake.

296
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:27,082
You remember a lot of things, don't you?

297
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,585
You were so cool then.

298
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:35,007
Talking to you makes me feel
like I'm a class president again.

299
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:37,509
One second.

300
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,929
This is Kim Yeon-woo from Iseong Auto.

301
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:44,433
Right. I'm now at Eurwangni Beach.

302
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:47,311
The customer wanted to go to the beach.

303
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,940
I know salt isn't good for the car.

304
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:56,945
I'll make sure to wash the car
and seal the deal before I go.

305
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,031
DR. NAM SU-PIL

306
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,786
Don't worry. She's my friend from school.

307
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,539
Okay. Bye.

308
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,593
Ms. Ok.

309
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,640
Please.

310
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:28,810
Please answer the phone.

311
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,074
Hey, do you remember

312
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,077
that we kissed in the music room?

313
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,161
What?

314
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:47,788
No.

315
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,539
Come on.

316
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:55,087
We were practicing
for the school song singing contest.

317
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:59,091
It happened while we were waiting
for the teacher to come.

318
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,344
It wasn't you.

319
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,513
Was that in sixth grade?

320
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,975
Kim Yeon-woo.

321
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:13,230
Why are you still single?

322
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,859
Have you been waiting for me?

323
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:19,987
You're a fool.

324
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,540
Hey, Jeong-hun.

325
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,795
-What? When?
-Last night.

326
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,465
Su-pil sent me a message.

327
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,300
What did he say?

328
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:27,929
He said that
a woman might be infected with the virus.

329
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:34,478
Did Dr. Nam Su-pil show any symptoms?

330
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:35,395
Pardon?

331
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,856
Looking unusually happy
for reasons, for example.

332
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,234
Or getting excited for no reason.

333
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:45,697
-You two are on the same team.
-I'm not sure.

334
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,658
-How many went missing?
-Nine.

335
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,952
-And you were in charge of all of them.
-Yes.

336
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,914
So it's the same virus.

337
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:55,415
The Toxo virus.

338
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,876
I thought it was airborne.

339
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:02,047
Stay away from people
until the blood test results are out.

340
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,006
And keep quiet.

341
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,300
Do you know
this person named Ok Taek-seon?

342
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:06,843
What?

343
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,262
No, I don't.

344
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,056
Mr. Kim went to find her.

345
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:14,726
Let's get married.

346
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,855
Ms. Ok Taek-seon.

347
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,692
Ms. Ok Taek-seon.

348
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,948
Ms. Ok Taek-seon.

349
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,535
Who are you?

350
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,703
Are you Ms. Ok Taek-seon
from Unit 307 of Building B?

351
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,914
Yes. Who are you?

352
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,374
You know Mr. Nam Su-pil, right?

353
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,626
Yes. Why?

354
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,878
Mr. Nam Su-pil passed away
early this morning.

355
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,590
-What?
-We suspect a virus infection.

356
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,301
We're investigating everyone
who's been in contact with him.

357
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,345
We need you to cooperate
and get tested too.

358
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,973
Please get out of the car first.

359
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,226
Hey, get the protective suit ready.

360
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,436
Please stay away from the car for a bit.

361
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,647
This way.

362
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,816
Please stay away.

363
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,776
-Disinfection team?
-Yes.

364
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:06,862
-Start.
-Yes, sir.

365
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,869
Excuse me? What are you doing?

366
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,163
You can't do that without permission.

367
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,080
VOICEMAIL

368
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:20,584
You have three new voicemails.

369
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:24,212
Taek-seon, if anything
ever happens to your health,

370
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:27,424
find Dr. Lee Gyun.
Don't follow anyone else.

371
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:28,425
It's Dr. Lee Gyun.

372
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:30,886
What's your relationship with Ms. Ok?

373
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,012
We're friends.

374
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:34,598
I went out for a minute to buy some water.

375
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:37,392
How many protective suits do we have?

376
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,439
No.

377
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:44,232
Put your arms in first.

378
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,817
Then your head. Good.

379
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:49,863
Taek-seon.

380
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:51,698
Don't trust anyone.

381
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:55,368
He's the only person
who knows this disease well.

382
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:58,663
Remember. Find Dr. Lee Gyun.

383
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,333
It's not going to damage the car, is it?

384
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:04,628
We'll take your car.
Don't worry and get in the ambulance.

385
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:07,172
Is there anyone named Lee Gyun here?

386
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:09,633
What Gyun?

387
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,718
Dr. Lee Gyun.

388
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:14,221
There's no such person. Get in.

389
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,681
Where did you come from?

390
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,227
-Pardon?
-What's your affiliation?

391
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,062
I told you earlier.

392
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:24,689
We're from Seong Medical Center,

393
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,942
and yesterday, one of our researchers--

394
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:30,737
What was that?

395
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:32,822
Are they bad guys?

396
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,617
I don't know. He said
we should run if we want to live!

397
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,911
-Who said that?
-And find Dr. Lee Gyun!

398
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:40,038
-Who?
-They're running away.

399
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:42,415
-Stop the car!
-Damn it!

400
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:43,917
-Taek-seon.
-Get out of the car!

401
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:45,669
Get in.

402
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:56,680
The Ministry of Health and Welfare
has announced that,

403
00:25:56,763 --> 00:26:00,767
starting at 1:00 p.m. today,
all movement of people and livestock

404
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,770
is banned within five kilometers
of Panseo-ri, Osong.

405
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:04,938
Central Fire Service…

406
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:07,440
Yes. Nine lab mice.

407
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,402
I promise to resolve this
within five days, sir.

408
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:12,487
We have announced that it was deer.

409
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,863
Deer?

410
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:18,243
Not many people raise deer,
so it won't attract much media attention.

411
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:20,954
Sure. You know better. Thanks, anyway.

412
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:22,622
No problem. Please catch them quickly.

413
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:23,665
Sure.

414
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:27,168
We found Dr. Nam's girlfriend.

415
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:29,921
And it turns out

416
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,007
she was seeing another man.

417
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:34,759
Keep going.

418
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:39,014
And both of them fled. We're chasing them,
so they'll get caught soon, though.

419
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,558
Should we ask the police for support?

420
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:45,603
Why are these people so reckless?
Their lives are on the line.

421
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:50,066
Looking back on human history,

422
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:55,780
it's only after hundreds of deaths
from a pandemic

423
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,158
that a vaccine is developed.

424
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,454
Bring the two back here alive.

425
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:06,958
There are a lot of things we can try.

426
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,546
Wouldn't it be better to get tested?

427
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:13,715
He said we must not follow them.

428
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:16,009
I thought we were by the beach last night.

429
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,262
I drove us back early this morning.

430
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:22,057
By the way, who is this man called Su-pil?

431
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,391
How do you know Su-pil?

432
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,810
You were calling his name
all night last night.

433
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,521
-I was?
-Yes.

434
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:31,649
Apparently, he's dead now.

435
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,401
-What on earth is going on?
-Dead?

436
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,987
I should've kept my phone on.

437
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,741
You don't know the number, right?

438
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:40,825
No.

439
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,873
Hey, this car is for a test-drive.

440
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:47,999
I'm sorry.

441
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:52,128
-Maybe I should drive.
-Ms. Ok.

442
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:56,883
I must've pressed the button.

443
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,927
-What do I do?
-Ms. Ok Taek-seon?

444
00:27:59,010 --> 00:27:59,969
I'm Lee Gyun.

445
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,847
Lee Gyun? Are you Dr. Lee Gyun?

446
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,682
Are you infected?

447
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,267
I'm not sure.

448
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,477
Where are you now?

449
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,770
Where are we?

450
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:09,896
We are…

451
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:11,606
Go somewhere secluded.

452
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:13,566
Where could that be?

453
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,860
Does Palgakjeong still exist?

454
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,612
Palgakjeong?

455
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:19,531
The pavilion on Bugak Skyway Trail.

456
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,369
Ms. Ok.

457
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:26,579
We need both of you to get tested.

458
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:30,417
-Pull the car over.
-The ambulance is here to get us.

459
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,752
-Pull the car over.
-You must not follow them.

460
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,421
I'll meet you at Palgakjeong.

461
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,381
Ms. Ok?

462
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,153
Hey, are you sure
you have a driver's license?

463
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,280
Yes, I do.

464
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:01,990
I've just never driven on the road.

465
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,199
-What?
-Hold tight.

466
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,174
Hey, make way!

467
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:28,266
-Look closely.
-Okay.

468
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:29,559
It's a mouse, sir.

469
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:31,561
Someone caught it.

470
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:32,645
How many in total now?

471
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,814
-Four now.
-Great. Well done.

472
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,399
-Nice.
-What are you doing?

473
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,109
Pardon?

474
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,652
Is it for pigs, cows, or chickens?

475
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,571
You said it's foot-and-mouth disease.

476
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,573
We don't know about that.

477
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:44,949
Then what are you doing?

478
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:45,992
We're catching mice.

479
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,702
-Mice?
-Yes.

480
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:48,828
Mice carry foot-and-mouth?

481
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,916
I've never seen anyone catch mice
because of foot-and-mouth.

482
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:06,054
No.

483
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,264
Go away.

484
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:09,224
Go.

485
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,184
Go away.

486
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,895
Ouch! You bastard.

487
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,064
Jeez.

488
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,524
It hurts.

489
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,619
SENIOR CENTER

490
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:30,954
It's hot.

491
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,455
Come and have a bite.

492
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:36,960
Come on. I worked hard on this.

493
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:41,089
Come and have a bite.

494
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,091
Here.

495
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,410
How about one of us keep it on?

496
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:11,578
-For safety.
-Okay.

497
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:12,495
Sorry.

498
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:18,585
Around this time yesterday,
you came looking for me at the store.

499
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:23,047
I can't believe everything
I've gone through over the past 24 hours.

500
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,049
I'm sorry I put you through this.

501
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,552
Taek-seon.

502
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,140
Do you do drugs?

503
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,433
No.

504
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:36,102
Except for the occasional sleeping pills.

505
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:37,186
Why do you ask?

506
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:38,771
Yesterday,

507
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,649
you said we let the frogs go
in fifth grade.

508
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,067
-You remember?
-Yes.

509
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:44,694
We dissected the frogs.

510
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:46,905
We lost the vote.

511
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,364
We lost the vote?

512
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,450
No, you lost the vote.

513
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:52,410
I was on the pro-dissection side.

514
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:56,539
Also,

515
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,333
you remember coming to my wedding, right?

516
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:00,960
You're married?

517
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,796
Come on. You even caught the bouquet.

518
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,714
I did?

519
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:05,798
Taek-seon.

520
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:10,178
I'm saying this as your friend.
I think you should go see a doctor.

521
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,972
You're not the Ok Taek-seon that I know.

522
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,474
You're being weird.

523
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,060
I'm being weird?

524
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:19,687
Do you know me?

525
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,775
You know nothing! You have no idea!

526
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:26,486
We barely met once in the past decade

527
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:28,279
at that boring reunion!

528
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,782
And you only text me
when you want to sell a car!

529
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:33,201
I'm being weird, right?

530
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,913
Even I can't understand myself.

531
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,333
What's wrong with me?

532
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,637
This virus doesn't spread through the air.

533
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,100
-Dr. Lee Gyun?
-Yes.

534
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,521
I'm not infected, am I?

535
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:03,189
We'll have to run some tests.

536
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:05,566
Did you say
it doesn't spread through the air?

537
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,693
Yes.

538
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:08,486
So I don't need to be tested.

539
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,279
-Can I go now?
-What?

540
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,198
Because nothing happened.

541
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:15,284
Taek-seon, the doctor is here.
I should get going now.

542
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:18,121
I'm in big trouble at work now.

543
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:20,790
It can be spread through saliva
if you get unlucky.

544
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:22,834
If you have to cough in a closed space,

545
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:26,170
you have to look away,
cover your mouth, and cough like this.

546
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:30,174
Taek-seon, did you cough a lot
while you were asleep last night?

547
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,010
How would I know?

548
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:41,561
That man is likely infected if he spent
the whole night in the same car.

549
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:44,480
Why did Su-pil tell me to find you?

550
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,524
Please keep your face away when you talk.

551
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,819
Because I know best.

552
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:51,863
So where should we go now?

553
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:53,698
We should run a blood test first.

554
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:54,991
Where?

555
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,242
I know a hospital.

556
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,494
Where's your car, Doctor?

557
00:33:58,578 --> 00:33:59,537
I don't have a car.

558
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:02,832
I just arrived from the US.
I took a taxi here.

559
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,460
Is it easy to get a taxi here?

560
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:07,503
Yeon-u!

561
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:08,796
Hold on a second.

562
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,881
Just a second.

563
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,009
-Yeon-u!
-Hey…

564
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,971
-Yeon-u!
-Try calling him.

565
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,474
I'm near Palgakjeong.

566
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,100
What I see…

567
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,478
I see trees around me.

568
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,230
Trees are all I see.

569
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,649
Yeon-u, please pick up.

570
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,569
One of us is wearing
a full protective suit.

571
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,072
It's hot pink, I think.

572
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,200
We're not soldiers. Okay, bye.

573
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,621
I called a taxi, so let's stop walking
and sit while we wait.

574
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,251
When was your last
intimate contact with Dr. Nam?

575
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:51,339
Intimate contact?

576
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:55,051
Any sort of interaction
sharing saliva, bodily fluid, or blood.

577
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:56,344
When was it?

578
00:34:57,386 --> 00:35:00,473
Why should I tell you
about my private life?

579
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:03,643
Imagine I'm a medical doctor.
This is important.

580
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:06,604
So it can be transmitted
through the mouth?

581
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:07,688
Through the mouth?

582
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,068
Where?

583
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:14,987
I didn't do anything.
Not with my mouth, or anything else.

584
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,657
Are your pupils always so wide?

585
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:19,534
Are they?

586
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:23,287
If you really are infected with Toxo--

587
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,413
Toxo?

588
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,874
There's a parasite
called Toxoplasma gondii.

589
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,210
Its host lives in a cat's stomach.

590
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,921
A mouse that was infected with this virus

591
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:34,966
wants to be eaten by a cat.

592
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,178
Come on. I don't believe you.

593
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,141
That's what's unique about it.

594
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:44,934
The Toxo goes to the mouse's frontal lobe,

595
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:47,854
messes with its dopamine,
which makes the mouse depressed.

596
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:51,232
I'm always depressed.

597
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,942
But I'm not depressed at all now.

598
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:55,903
Right now, I feel like
everything will go my way.

599
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,698
You might be infected with the virus
that came from it.

600
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:00,116
The virus does the opposite.

601
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,659
It elevates the mouse's mood.

602
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:06,372
How does it work exactly?
Can you explain in plain language?

603
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:08,708
The virus makes you full of courage

604
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,084
and positivity.

605
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:13,171
If a human's infected with this,

606
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:15,339
they will grow really fond of someone.

607
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,301
They'll fall in love.

608
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,556
Me?

609
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,183
With you?

610
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:29,145
Not just with anyone.
You have to be interested in the person.

611
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,355
I think timing matters too.

612
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:34,609
When you meet the person
after you're infected also matters.

613
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:37,028
When Dr. Nam met you was probably

614
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,031
when the virus was spreading the most.

615
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:42,950
-At its peak--
-You're a funny man.

616
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:46,704
Just because I don't know anything
doesn't mean you can say anything.

617
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:49,749
Are you saying Su-pil liked me
because of the virus?

618
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,792
That's a scam.

619
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:52,877
A scam?

620
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:57,423
It's cutting-edge science,
which I've been studying for seven years.

621
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:59,425
Feeling fond of someone? Love?

622
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,427
Very funny.

623
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:08,059
So you thought Dr. Nam's symptoms
from the infection was love

624
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,977
and slept with him.

625
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,103
I said I didn't!

626
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,195
You're the pink suit, right?

627
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,079
Sorry, Yeon-u.

628
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,711
Wait. I'll get tested.

629
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:36,754
Put the mask on.

630
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:41,092
I said I'll get tested. Why…

631
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:44,762
-Do you have any spots on your body?
-What kind of spots?

632
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:48,432
After getting infected,
spots usually appear within a day.

633
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:51,227
Once the spots appear,
you won't survive past 24 hours.

634
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,520
So I'm going to die?

635
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,982
That's what happened with the mice.
We don't know about humans.

636
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:57,525
It has never happened before.

637
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,152
I don't think I have any. I don't, right?

638
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:03,531
I met Su-pil two days ago,
and I don't have any marks.

639
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,241
Maybe you aren't infected then.

640
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,452
The fish cake?

641
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,414
I ate the fish cake.

642
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,583
I ate the leftover fish cake.

643
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:16,961
Saliva transmission is unlikely.

644
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:20,047
Unless you have a wound
in your mouth or stomach.

645
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:22,842
Or unless you get really unlucky

646
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:25,261
and bite your tongue so hard it bleeds.

647
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:26,429
I bit my tongue.

648
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,639
You bit your tongue?

649
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:29,557
Yes.

650
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:31,475
-Did you bleed?
-Yes.

651
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,690
You'll cure me, right?

652
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:42,528
Hey, be careful. Cover it.

653
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:44,572
You said saliva was fine.

654
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,657
I have gastritis. It's stress-induced.

655
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,493
It can be risky.

656
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:50,661
Are you ill or something?

657
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:51,954
No.

658
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:38,250
Am I getting a blood test?

659
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:39,919
Yes.

660
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:42,088
I think I can just go in.

661
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,257
You can't just do it like that.
It's dangerous.

662
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:47,927
Someone's coming to help.

663
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,178
A doctor?

664
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:55,893
When did you get here?

665
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:57,353
Not long ago.

666
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,729
From the US, I mean.

667
00:39:58,813 --> 00:39:59,814
Right.

668
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:01,774
Today.

669
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:03,734
You motherfucker.

670
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:10,616
Young-hee, let me run one blood test.

671
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,243
Let me use your primer synthesizer.

672
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:16,205
Who are you?

673
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,207
I'm Ok Taek-seon.

674
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,085
-She's a patient.
-What patient?

675
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:25,923
A virus?

676
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:28,884
Is she infected now?

677
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,053
We don't know yet.

678
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,555
Take her to Professor Seong.

679
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:34,974
Those guys are hopeless.
Look at what happened to Su-pil.

680
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:37,393
Also, me and Professor Seong?

681
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,478
Do you even hear yourself?

682
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:42,273
You ran all the way to the US
to end up here? Nice job.

683
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,233
Why do you think I ran?

684
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:46,444
-I left.
-You didn't just leave.

685
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,737
You stabbed me in the back
and left me in the dump.

686
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:51,115
Hey, your mouth's gotten even harsher.

687
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,033
You said it was hot.

688
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,330
I left for your sake.

689
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:01,292
How's Dr. Kim Cheol-yeon doing?

690
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:02,418
How would I know?

691
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,086
What?

692
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,296
We got divorced.

693
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,423
Really?

694
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:09,133
But you just got married--

695
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,845
Did you think
we'd live happily ever after?

696
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:16,432
Why did you have to hit him again?
What is it that he did so wrong?

697
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:17,975
You don't know shit. Stay out of it.

698
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:19,101
Are you even a doctor?

699
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:20,936
I'm a resentful doctor
because of this jerk.

700
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,814
My life is a huge mess too.

701
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:26,066
Taek-seon, we're here to ask for help.

702
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,319
-You're here.
-How have you been?

703
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:30,571
Oh, the traitor is here.

704
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:31,947
What are you talking about?

705
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,408
-Here's the B-Cell Immune Booster.
-Thanks, man.

706
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:37,995
I can't believe I'm seeing this
as soon as I came back.

707
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:40,414
Are you okay, by the way?
Su-pil died, you know.

708
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,751
Su-pil told me
that you decided to get married.

709
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:46,587
We can't trust those words.
He was probably not in his right mind.

710
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,672
Strictly speaking, she's a victim.

711
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,842
I'm really sorry,
but I didn't know Su-pil well.

712
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,553
I saw a picture of them glued together

713
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:56,138
at her place.

714
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,057
-Her place?
-Her place?

715
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,236
What's this?

716
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,737
It's called PCR.

717
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,573
When your blood is spun in a centrifuge,

718
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:17,660
the red blood cells sink
and the yellow serum floats on top.

719
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,703
If we mix that with the primer here,

720
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:22,164
we'll be able to tell if you're infected.

721
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:23,249
Are you far-sighted?

722
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,962
Have you and Young-hee dated for long?

723
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,256
We dated in college.

724
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,258
Why did you break up?

725
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,679
Someone loved her more than I did.

726
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:39,431
Men are such fools.

727
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:40,849
What?

728
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:44,812
You pass women on to others who
like them more like they're some objects.

729
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,647
You don't know anything.

730
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:51,151
-Are you upset?
-I have to work.

731
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:58,534
I think I'm extremely lucky.

732
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:00,035
Because I met you

733
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:04,290
who knows this disease best.
It's perfect timing.

734
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:07,209
Plus, you flew in from the US for me.

735
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:08,502
-Right?
-What?

736
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:12,131
Why am I so talkative today?
Is this one of the symptoms?

737
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:15,301
I came to attend my sister's wedding.

738
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:18,012
Just after I arrived at Incheon Airport,

739
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,346
I got a call from Jeong-hun.

740
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,391
Did you know Su-pil too?

741
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:24,435
We used to be in the same research team

742
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,354
in Seong Medical Center.

743
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,772
Then Young-hee and I left.

744
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,192
Why don't you get some sleep?

745
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,111
I don't sleep very well.

746
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:48,876
What's the matter?

747
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,836
-Shouldn't you be catching the mice?
-We are.

748
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:53,130
-And?
-We found something strange.

749
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:54,214
What's strange?

750
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,720
Is this a shamanic ritual?
Or is it a party?

751
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:02,014
They've been doing that
since this afternoon.

752
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:04,892
-Why?
-They've been doing that the whole day.

753
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:08,646
They drank this whole jar
where a mouse fell in.

754
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:12,608
It can't be…

755
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,735
-Is it our mouse?
-Yes.

756
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,153
It's white.

757
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:20,074
You and me, we're one

758
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,119
Babe.

759
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:26,288
You're handsome.

760
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,207
Have a sip.

761
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:33,671
Oh, my.

762
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:37,383
Babe.

763
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:57,027
This is great!

764
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:08,789
Taek-seon.

765
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,170
Did we get the results?

766
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:17,965
The two lines here mean

767
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:19,925
that you're infected.

768
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:23,679
It's okay. I have you.

769
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:25,931
How many days has it been?

770
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:27,307
Since the fish cake?

771
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:28,392
Three days?

772
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:29,476
Hang on.

773
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:36,692
There are no spots.

774
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:38,777
We're in trouble.

775
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:41,488
Twenty people got infected in Osong-myeon.

776
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,118
BRIEFING ON INFECTED LAB ANIMALS

777
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:48,954
Nine mice escaped from our lab.

778
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:51,373
We've managed to capture five mice

779
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,917
and a cat that ate one of the mice.

780
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:57,880
There are currently three infected mice
yet to be captured.

781
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:00,090
We are doing our best
to resolve this issue

782
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:02,009
as quickly as possible.

783
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:03,552
Are they white mice?

784
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:06,930
Yes, all the lab mice we have are white.

785
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,850
Could you describe
the symptoms of the infection?

786
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:11,560
Sure.

787
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:16,648
According to our research,

788
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:21,653
once this virus infects you,

789
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:26,492
your body will develop
red spots within 24 hours.

790
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,119
And most of the infected people

791
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:30,954
have shown excessive emotions.

792
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:35,792
Against your will,

793
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:40,422
you will feel happy
for no particular reasons.

794
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:42,216
What do you mean, "feel happy?"

795
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,426
Do you mean
that they're extremely excited?

796
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,094
What was the infection process like?

797
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:49,181
Look here. They're totally stuck together.

798
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:51,892
The amount and the size
are much greater than the mice's.

799
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:54,102
This is why they didn't develop red marks.

800
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,813
What an interesting spectrum.

801
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:59,358
If it stays like this…

802
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:03,570
We might discover Complex A,
the protein that could lead to a vaccine.

803
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,656
Call Dr. Kim.

804
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,366
Hey.

805
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:09,618
I haven't talked to him in four years.

806
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:13,038
Other than Seong Medical Center,
they're the only ones with the equipment.

807
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:14,039
Please.

808
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:19,753
Hello?

809
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,631
I thought it was just a blood test.

810
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:27,970
Anybody there?

811
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:33,100
Hello?

812
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:36,645
Any red spots?

813
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:39,064
We haven't discovered any yet.

814
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:40,857
Should we give him some painkillers?

815
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:42,609
-It won't help.
-Pardon?

816
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:44,570
I said, it won't help.

817
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:48,865
These old people danced for seven hours
without food. Of course, they're tired.

818
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:50,409
It's not the virus.

819
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:52,703
I can't believe he's still doing that.

820
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:55,038
-Give him some food or IV nutrition.
-Yes, Doctor.

821
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:55,998
Babe.

822
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,460
-It's me.
-Is she talking to me?

823
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,337
-Yes.
-Is the door locked?

824
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:03,547
Yes.

825
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:05,549
They're showing all kinds of symptoms.

826
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:08,427
LAB MICE ESCAPE FROM OSONG RESEARCH LAB

827
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:09,886
Super antibody?

828
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:13,557
I had no idea I was such a special person.

829
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,851
Some people die from flu,

830
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:17,811
and some are totally fine
without any meds.

831
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:19,771
People have different immune systems.

832
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,774
So far,
you're the most resistant to this virus.

833
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:27,738
Hey, Ju.

834
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:28,905
Where are you?

835
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,157
Why aren't you coming yet?

836
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:32,951
Oh, I'm now…

837
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:35,454
Mom keeps asking where you are.

838
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:39,458
Something urgent came up, so--

839
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,043
Whatever. Hurry up.

840
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:45,172
Looks like

841
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:46,882
we'll have to stop by somewhere.

842
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:48,425
Where?

843
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:49,968
Today is the wedding.

844
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:51,595
My sister's.

845
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:59,144
Doctor, you look gorgeous.

846
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:03,315
-How do I look?
-What happened to the clothes you had on?

847
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:06,026
Over there. It's soaked in sweat.
I'm going to throw them away.

848
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:08,779
You can't just throw them away.

849
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:10,781
You need to burn them.

850
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:12,741
Right.

851
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,168
I'll be right back. Take some rest.

852
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:26,004
And avoid crowded places.

853
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:28,340
Fine. I get it.

854
00:49:29,966 --> 00:49:31,635
Do you want me to get you some ice cream?

855
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:33,553
Yes.

856
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:38,141
-Hey, you made it.
-Hi.

857
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:41,436
The groom has arrived
at the bride's house.

858
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:43,814
Oh, boy.

859
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:49,653
Excuse me.

860
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:14,177
THE UNION OF TWO IS THE BEGINNING
OF ENDLESS BLESSINGS

861
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:15,595
The bride and groom will raise

862
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,140
the wine cups
up to their chests to promise

863
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:22,394
to love and trust their partners
for the rest of their lives,

864
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:24,563
and drink half the wine.

865
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:40,746
I'm not back for good.
I'm visiting for the wedding.

866
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:49,546
No.

867
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:50,964
Why did you come out?

868
00:50:51,047 --> 00:50:52,215
-Bathroom.
-Bathroom?

869
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:53,592
What is it?

870
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:55,761
-Which one?
-The ice cream.

871
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:01,641
Just one gram of your stuff
can infect two million people.

872
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:02,851
Then what should I do?

873
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:04,394
-Hold it in?
-Can you do that?

874
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:05,395
No.

875
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:08,023
Flush as you start,

876
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:10,358
and keep flushing until you finish.

877
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:13,069
-Wash your hands ten times.
-One second!

878
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:17,199
Once they're out of your body,
they won't survive for long.

879
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:32,047
How could this happen in human bodies?
Such an odd structure.

880
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,799
Maybe we can…

881
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:37,135
It took three years
to develop the B-Cell Immune Booster.

882
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:39,888
Each bottle cost 200 million won.

883
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:42,307
Are you infected?

884
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:43,934
Why do you need this?

885
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:47,437
We haven't even tested it on animals yet.

886
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:50,607
Come on.
We should trust and help each other.

887
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,777
We should do everything we can

888
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:58,406
to help those infected patients
within the golden hour.

889
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:01,284
Our lab's future is on the line.

890
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:03,286
So is your life.

891
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,705
I'm already called a traitor.

892
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:08,041
Well, keeping your mouth shut like that
makes you one.

893
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:09,251
Where's that patient?!

894
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:11,795
It's okay.

895
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:15,715
The person who made this

896
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:17,843
is with that patient, right?

897
00:52:21,137 --> 00:52:22,681
Are you Ju's friend?

898
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:24,266
What?

899
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:25,934
No.

900
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:27,519
Oh, I see.

901
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:30,230
-I'm sorry.
-That's okay.

902
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,193
Are you the bride's mother?

903
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:36,778
Yes.

904
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,074
Mother.

905
00:52:41,157 --> 00:52:43,285
I'm here with Dr. Lee Gyun.

906
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:46,371
You are?

907
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:58,675
-You didn't introduce your guest to me.
-Mom.

908
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:02,095
-No, she's not my guest--
-We're on the same team.

909
00:53:02,178 --> 00:53:03,513
The virus research team.

910
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:05,974
Research colleagues get along well.

911
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:07,893
Please have a seat.

912
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:09,686
-But…
-Can I sit here for a second?

913
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,481
What's your name?

914
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:15,275
I'm Ok Taek-seon.

915
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:16,568
Your family name is Ok?

916
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:18,403
Oh, my. You're more than just okay.

917
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,907
Mom, Taek-seon is kind of sick now.

918
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:23,325
You should come to my place.

919
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:24,576
Come lie down and rest.

920
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:27,913
You must be so tired
traveling all the way from the US.

921
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:29,581
You must be still jetlagged too.

922
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:33,168
Should we just have your wedding today?

923
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:35,962
It's all set up. Having another one
shouldn't be a big deal.

924
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:37,923
I'm just kidding.

925
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:43,094
The bride's older brother
flew in from the US

926
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:45,055
to celebrate his sister's wedding.

927
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:46,806
We'll hear a few words from him.

928
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:47,807
Way to go!

929
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:57,108
I know how busy everyone is,
so thank you for being here today.

930
00:53:57,192 --> 00:54:00,987
I sincerely congratulate my sister,
Lee Ju, on her wedding.

931
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:05,075
I study viruses in the US.

932
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:08,411
One of the things I learned
from studying viruses is…

933
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:13,375
that falling in love is like

934
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,543
catching a virus.

935
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:20,298
You get infected by your partner,
and the fever kicks in.

936
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:24,761
You feel sick for a while,
but eventually, you build immunity.

937
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:29,349
Just when things start to feel easier,
you get infected all over again.

938
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:33,770
I'm sure my sister
knows what I'm talking about.

939
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:36,690
Every time I saw her,
she was going through a heartbreak,

940
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:39,651
-but she ended up with a nice guy.
-Gyun!

941
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:41,945
Enough.

942
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:48,410
Thank you for understanding.
I guess I'm still jetlagged.

943
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:57,085
Of course you're tired.

944
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:03,383
Hey, Jeong-hun.
Is the 3D analysis complete?

945
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:05,552
It's been a while, Dr. Lee Gyun.

946
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:10,098
Can we finally see the Complex A
that we've been looking forward to?

947
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:12,976
You still have the habit
of getting ahead of yourself.

948
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:15,478
We already talked with the lab in Texas.

949
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:18,273
-Come join us.
-Do it with the Texas lab.

950
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:20,108
Wait.

951
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:24,821
We have a lot of infected patients here
because of you.

952
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:26,614
Why is that my fault?

953
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:30,368
It was your idea to use Toxo virus
as an antidepressant.

954
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:32,704
And you made the B-Cell Immune Booster.

955
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:34,831
Next time someone gets infected,

956
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:38,668
your name will be the first
to hit the headlines.

957
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,771
The Texas lab did?

958
00:55:57,854 --> 00:56:00,482
It means they haven't reached
the clinical stage either.

959
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:05,695
So Lee Gyun hasn't really done
anything in the US.

960
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,615
That's why he came back.

961
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:12,410
If he had stayed here, he would've been
the head of the lab by now.

962
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:17,290
You're the one who fired him.
Do you regret it?

963
00:56:17,373 --> 00:56:19,209
You should know you're lucky.

964
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:22,962
Now, we've got plenty of subjects
for the clinical trial, by luck.

965
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:27,008
The Texas lab people say, if it goes well,
it's Nobel Prize material.

966
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:31,471
They say its market will be
as huge as Korea's yearly GDP.

967
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:34,390
So we need Dr. Lee Gyun.

968
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:38,353
No, it's not Lee Gyun that we need.

969
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,106
We need Ok Taek-seon.

970
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:44,526
That woman will take us to the top.

971
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:49,781
-You're taking many blood samples.
-We have a lot to test.

972
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:53,827
Each sample looks
about the size of a milk carton.

973
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:54,744
Will I be okay?

974
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:57,831
The older folks in the other rooms
handled it just fine.

975
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,041
Will I get anything to eat?

976
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:02,252
You need to fast
until the results are out.

977
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:05,755
Can I at least get some IV nutrition?

978
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:31,489
What's all this?

979
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:34,033
This is an ultra-high voltage
electron microscope.

980
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,577
There are only two of them in Korea.

981
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,996
This whole thing is a microscope?

982
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:40,039
Yes, viruses are too small

983
00:57:40,665 --> 00:57:42,542
to be seen with a regular microscope.

984
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:44,711
It looks like a boiler.

985
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:48,131
This generates ultra-high voltage,

986
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:50,842
allowing us to see viruses
at 10,000 times magnification.

987
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:56,055
Taek-seon, do you know
why people feel depressed?

988
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:59,434
Because depressing things happen.

989
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:01,060
The feeling of depression is regulated

990
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:04,147
by the chemicals in our brain
called dopamine and serotonin.

991
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:05,690
The key is to regulate them,

992
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:08,359
but current antidepressants
come with many side effects.

993
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:09,944
Because they're chemicals.

994
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:13,323
You saw my sister at the wedding earlier.

995
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:17,160
I used to have a younger brother
older than her.

996
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:18,411
His name was Yun.

997
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:21,122
"Used to"?

998
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:22,207
He killed himself.

999
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,168
I had no idea how ill he was.

1000
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:28,755
So my dream is

1001
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:34,260
to make biological antidepressants
with zero side effects.

1002
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:39,015
When our body fights off a virus,
a chemical called Complex A is produced.

1003
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:42,310
I've been working with the mice
for the past seven years,

1004
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:45,021
but they all died
before I found Complex A.

1005
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:50,360
But you're still alive and kicking,
not developing any spots after three days.

1006
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:55,240
The moment I find Complex A in your body,

1007
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:57,742
my dream will come true.

1008
00:58:58,660 --> 00:58:59,953
We're meant to be.

1009
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:04,290
Let's go down.

1010
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:06,793
Virology is a lot of fun.

1011
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:09,671
Taek-seon, do you know
how life begins on Earth?

1012
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:10,672
No.

1013
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:12,799
You know life came from water, right?

1014
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:14,217
No, I don't.

1015
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:17,220
I'm done for today.
I used my brain too much.

1016
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:21,140
Viruses might be the key
to the mystery of how life began.

1017
00:59:22,016 --> 00:59:24,185
They're half alive and half dead,

1018
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:27,397
so many still debate
whether they're truly living organisms.

1019
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,816
Do you realize
you're talking too much now?

1020
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:31,359
You're even chattier than me.

1021
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:34,070
Have you seen viruses
through an electron microscope?

1022
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:36,197
They're beautiful.

1023
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:39,450
The flu virus is shaped like a rose.

1024
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:43,746
And the tobacco virus
is nice and straight like bamboo.

1025
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:46,457
I wish I could show you.

1026
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:49,752
Goodness.

1027
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:53,631
I've spent the past three nights
with three different men.

1028
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:56,426
-This is a miracle to me.
-This is the second night with me.

1029
00:59:56,968 --> 01:00:00,346
I haven't held hands with any of the men

1030
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:03,016
in these past three days, though.

1031
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:04,642
Isn't that a curse?

1032
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:07,270
That's the right thing to do
as an infected person.

1033
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:08,605
Rest up.

1034
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:11,524
Once the results are out, you'll get busy
with the blood tests and all.

1035
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:16,070
Can you hold me until I fall asleep?

1036
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:18,531
You're not in your right mind right now.

1037
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:20,450
I don't care if it's the virus.

1038
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:23,119
I'm feeling so miserable I want to cry.

1039
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:34,505
We first met through our voices, right?

1040
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:36,758
What?

1041
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:40,887
When I first heard your voice
over the phone,

1042
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,891
it felt like I've known you
for a long time--

1043
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:47,185
That's the virus messing with your brain.

1044
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:48,811
Go to sleep.

1045
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:54,400
Close your eyes.

1046
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:02,950
What's with the racing heart?

1047
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,870
I told you, the virus excites you.

1048
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:07,622
You mean, my heart?

1049
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:10,083
I can hear the heart thumping.

1050
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:12,210
I should get up--

1051
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:19,926
Remember what you said?

1052
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:24,639
The virus

1053
01:01:24,722 --> 01:01:26,933
makes you full of courage.

1054
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:30,937
The infected human
will grow really fond of someone

1055
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:34,399
and eventually fall in love.

1056
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:39,028
I think

1057
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:40,988
I should get up.

1058
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:43,241
For your safety--

1059
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:48,204
Taek-seon, no. We shouldn't be doing this.

1060
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:49,914
-Come on.
-No.

1061
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:51,499
Stop it.

1062
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:53,668
You're doing this because of the virus.

1063
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,797
You're not in your right mind.

1064
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:03,803
Wait, the lights are out.

1065
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:08,057
Gosh, Dr. Lee.
What are you doing with your patient?

1066
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:09,600
Ms. Ok Taek-seon?

1067
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:13,229
It's such an honor to meet
a special person like you.

1068
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,316
Thanks, Dr. Kim Cheol-ung.

1069
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,317
No problem.

1070
01:02:20,361 --> 01:02:23,239
Did you know we've become
partners with this institution?

1071
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:25,199
Who are you?

1072
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:26,993
We used to be in the same team.

1073
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:29,495
So he's a doctor too?

1074
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:33,082
He's a doctor, a professor, a CEO,
and a rich man with a lot of stocks.

1075
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:36,627
-Turn the power on.
-Then what?

1076
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:39,380
Can I see Complex A?

1077
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:40,965
You need to give it time.

1078
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:43,885
Osong Lab can do it twice as fast.

1079
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:46,888
Don't you two need our lab?

1080
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:50,558
If we can't use the microscope,
we can't do anything here.

1081
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:52,894
All the infected patients

1082
01:02:52,977 --> 01:02:55,480
are waiting for your antibody.

1083
01:02:56,063 --> 01:02:58,983
You must save these people's lives.

1084
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:05,698
Osong Lab is your only option.
You know that.

1085
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:15,792
I'll lead this experiment.

1086
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:19,128
Without my permission,
you can't conduct anything.

1087
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:20,630
Okay?

1088
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:22,632
Dr. Lee.

1089
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:25,760
Why don't you come back

1090
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:29,013
after completing this project?

1091
01:03:29,096 --> 01:03:30,973
You can be the head of the lab.

1092
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:36,020
Complex A.
Let's make it a success this time.

1093
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:39,273
Taek-seon, I'll see you in the lab.

1094
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:44,487
Let's go.

1095
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:49,283
Are you sure we can follow them?

1096
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:51,327
It's okay.

1097
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:52,578
You'll be with me.

1098
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:01,504
This is truly a miracle.

1099
01:04:01,587 --> 01:04:06,509
Someone with a very unique antibody
decided to cooperate with our lab.

1100
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:10,972
This will not only help
the infected patients recover gradually,

1101
01:04:11,055 --> 01:04:15,518
but also dramatically increase
the chances of Korea developing

1102
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:20,398
the world's first biological
antidepressant with zero side effects.

1103
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:24,337
Nurse.

1104
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:26,881
It's finished.

1105
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:29,467
When can we leave this place?

1106
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:32,845
I feel so suffocated in here.

1107
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:36,891
Who is this super antibody donor
and where are they now?

1108
01:05:36,974 --> 01:05:41,771
We can't reveal their identity
for security reasons.

1109
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:45,358
But I can tell you that they are at

1110
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:47,568
a research institute under
Seong Medical Foundation.

1111
01:05:49,236 --> 01:05:50,404
Taek-seon.

1112
01:05:51,572 --> 01:05:53,574
What do you want to do when you get out?

1113
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:59,622
I've always wanted to publish a book.

1114
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:00,539
Oh.

1115
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:03,167
I want to write my own story,

1116
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:05,795
not something
I've read or heard elsewhere.

1117
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:11,676
I envy people like you.

1118
01:06:12,593 --> 01:06:15,054
Everyone has a dream when they're young.

1119
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:18,975
But many of them don't come true.

1120
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:22,103
This wasn't my dream.

1121
01:06:22,186 --> 01:06:23,521
-It wasn't?
-No.

1122
01:06:23,604 --> 01:06:24,647
Then what was it?

1123
01:06:28,275 --> 01:06:30,194
Tell me. What was it?

1124
01:06:31,445 --> 01:06:32,780
I wanted to be a singer.

1125
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:34,782
A singer-songwriter.

1126
01:06:34,865 --> 01:06:36,033
Really?

1127
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:45,376
We'll inject our medical center's product,
B-Cell Immune Booster,

1128
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:49,672
into the mouse
that carries Ok Taek-seon's antibody.

1129
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:08,566
If we succeed in making the perfect
antibody through this experiment,

1130
01:07:08,649 --> 01:07:11,277
we'll move on to the clinical trials.

1131
01:07:57,198 --> 01:07:59,450
Taek-seon has red spots on her body now.

1132
01:07:59,533 --> 01:08:00,826
I know.

1133
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:02,703
Dr. Lee Gyun.

1134
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:05,414
Let's move on to the clinical trials
for the booster.

1135
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:07,416
Give it time.

1136
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,335
I've been giving it time for five years.

1137
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:11,295
It's time to make a decision now.

1138
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:14,423
The animal testing isn't finished yet.

1139
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,383
You need to wait.

1140
01:08:16,467 --> 01:08:19,970
The elderly patients started developing
the spots on their bodies again.

1141
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:22,598
And it's progressing twice as fast.

1142
01:08:24,016 --> 01:08:27,645
We don't have time.
Ok's antibody is losing its power too.

1143
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:33,150
Mak-sun, you can't be doing this.

1144
01:08:33,234 --> 01:08:37,530
He's a doctor.
He works day and night for all of us.

1145
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:40,116
Honey, that's not fair!

1146
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:41,534
You're married.

1147
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:45,162
What are you talking about?
I'm married to you, you woman!

1148
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:46,455
We're not a good match.

1149
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:49,333
I can't get along with you.

1150
01:08:49,416 --> 01:08:51,836
-We should try. That's love.
-Out of the way.

1151
01:08:51,919 --> 01:08:54,130
It's learning to meet each other halfway.

1152
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:56,549
-I'll meet him halfway.
-Let go of me!

1153
01:08:59,426 --> 01:09:01,512
Blood! It's blood!

1154
01:09:01,595 --> 01:09:02,429
Are you okay?

1155
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:06,517
-Babe!
-Where was it? Where?

1156
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,435
Babe, let's meet each other halfway!

1157
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:10,729
Love is meeting each other halfway!

1158
01:09:11,772 --> 01:09:15,109
I'm now standing in front
of Osong's Seong Medical Center.

1159
01:09:15,192 --> 01:09:18,529
As you can see, the gate is shut tight.

1160
01:09:18,612 --> 01:09:20,906
As the condition of the elderly patients
has worsened

1161
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:23,409
and visits have been restricted,

1162
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:26,412
the atmosphere around the center
has grown heavy again.

1163
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:29,456
The director of Seong Medical Center,
Professor Seong Gi-hwan,

1164
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:32,293
stated that
it's part of the treatment process,

1165
01:09:32,376 --> 01:09:35,254
contrary to existing knowledge.

1166
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:38,716
He assured that their team
will continue working towards developing

1167
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:41,343
the world's first antidepressant
with zero side effects.

1168
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:42,428
CONSENT FORM

1169
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:44,805
The infected patient's family

1170
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:47,057
gave consent for the clinical trial,

1171
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:49,768
but to be honest,
I think B-Cell Immune Booster

1172
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:53,022
is too much for elderly people to handle.

1173
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:55,816
Did you make it?

1174
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,234
Yes.

1175
01:09:58,903 --> 01:10:00,446
But it's not complete yet.

1176
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:03,824
We enhanced it using your antibody.

1177
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:06,285
Will you do it?

1178
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:08,537
Yes.

1179
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:13,584
PATIENT SIGNATURE: OK TAEK-SEON

1180
01:10:39,276 --> 01:10:44,406
After the toxoplasmosis diagnosis,
we conducted the pigment test,

1181
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:46,659
using an insertion pad.

1182
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:50,788
The one using the indirect method
or latex-based method…

1183
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:18,107
Ji-seon.

1184
01:11:22,736 --> 01:11:26,115
Tell Mom that I'm okay

1185
01:11:26,198 --> 01:11:27,908
and that there's no need to worry.

1186
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:29,952
You…

1187
01:11:30,911 --> 01:11:34,915
This is all because you set me up
with this random doctor guy.

1188
01:11:38,919 --> 01:11:40,170
No.

1189
01:11:40,254 --> 01:11:41,463
Ji-seon.

1190
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:44,341
I said a lot of swear words to you

1191
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:47,970
and made fun of your bad grades,
but it's not because I hated you.

1192
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:51,849
I haven't done anything for you
as your older sister, you know?

1193
01:11:53,809 --> 01:11:56,103
I've only shown you my pathetic side,

1194
01:11:56,186 --> 01:11:58,272
so I just wanted at least you to do well.

1195
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:00,399
Actually,

1196
01:12:01,775 --> 01:12:04,320
I love you very much.
You know that, right?

1197
01:12:09,241 --> 01:12:11,910
Please tell Mom that I love her.

1198
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:19,043
I figured it wouldn't be long before
I couldn't even talk to you on the phone.

1199
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:20,753
Visitors are not allowed here.

1200
01:12:21,628 --> 01:12:26,342
I'm getting the treatment,
so don't worry. I'll call you again.

1201
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:34,516
Taek-seon, get some sleep.

1202
01:12:37,936 --> 01:12:41,231
You didn't bring me here
because of the antidepressant, right?

1203
01:12:42,816 --> 01:12:45,277
It was to help me.

1204
01:12:46,737 --> 01:12:53,202
As I get more and more spots,
the negative thoughts come back.

1205
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:57,247
If this gets worse,
it can lead to impaired vision

1206
01:12:57,331 --> 01:13:00,125
and auditory or visual hallucinations.

1207
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:04,713
Don't worry. I'm good at fighting viruses.

1208
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:17,559
Let's try the Russian method
by Dr. Kozlov.

1209
01:13:17,643 --> 01:13:18,644
Yes, Doctor.

1210
01:13:22,022 --> 01:13:24,650
Less than half of the countries
approved the Russian method.

1211
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:29,279
Dr. Kozlov suggests neutralizing
the host, Toxo, not the virus.

1212
01:13:29,363 --> 01:13:32,408
It's a very risky method
with potential unknown side effects.

1213
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:34,576
What about B-Cell Immune Booster?

1214
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:35,953
It keeps failing.

1215
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:39,164
Taek-seon develops at a different speed.
I need more time.

1216
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:42,126
If we don't take action now,
the antibody will lose its power.

1217
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:44,044
Then there will be no Complex A.

1218
01:13:44,128 --> 01:13:45,629
Can you handle all the ramifications?

1219
01:13:45,712 --> 01:13:47,506
The patient is still fighting it.

1220
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:49,633
She'll soon lose
her eyesight and consciousness.

1221
01:13:49,716 --> 01:13:52,803
Then a coma, then brain death.
And that's it.

1222
01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:55,222
You want to try Dr. Kozlov's method

1223
01:13:55,305 --> 01:13:57,307
because of Complex A,
not the patient, right?

1224
01:13:57,766 --> 01:14:00,144
You want to try all possible methods
while her brain's alive

1225
01:14:00,227 --> 01:14:01,687
even if it's extremely risky.

1226
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:04,606
You also suggested proceeding
without completing the animal testing.

1227
01:14:05,357 --> 01:14:08,235
You've been directing
this experiment from the start.

1228
01:14:11,405 --> 01:14:12,448
Make your choice.

1229
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:14,992
Are you with us or not?

1230
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:25,377
You just drew a bucket of my blood,
and you want me to just leave?

1231
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:26,587
That's just mean.

1232
01:14:27,212 --> 01:14:30,340
Isn't it such a relief that
you get to leave completely healthy?

1233
01:14:30,424 --> 01:14:31,758
Do I at least get milk or bread?

1234
01:14:31,842 --> 01:14:34,178
You should grab a meal
at the cafeteria before you go.

1235
01:14:34,261 --> 01:14:35,137
It's good.

1236
01:14:40,017 --> 01:14:41,810
Why do I feel so nasty?

1237
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:09,421
Taek-seon, wake up.

1238
01:15:10,297 --> 01:15:11,215
Doctor?

1239
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:14,134
I was wrong.

1240
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:15,928
We shouldn't have come here.

1241
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:17,012
Get up.

1242
01:15:19,723 --> 01:15:21,099
Let's get out.

1243
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:22,684
Where are we going?

1244
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:25,562
We need to get out of here.

1245
01:15:33,278 --> 01:15:34,112
Taek-seon?

1246
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:37,574
LABORATORY ANIMAL CENTER

1247
01:15:47,918 --> 01:15:49,711
She developed the red spots.

1248
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:52,422
-We don't have anywhere else to go.
-What do you need?

1249
01:15:52,506 --> 01:15:54,633
Get the test ready.
We'll be there shortly.

1250
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:56,468
How's Taek-seon doing?

1251
01:15:57,219 --> 01:16:00,097
She's okay now,
but we need to hurry and find a way.

1252
01:16:01,473 --> 01:16:03,684
Wait, I know that ambulance.

1253
01:16:09,856 --> 01:16:11,108
That's…

1254
01:16:13,527 --> 01:16:14,861
Excuse me, sir.

1255
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:29,334
Get out of the car.

1256
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:36,883
I was discharged.

1257
01:16:36,967 --> 01:16:38,635
What did I do wrong?

1258
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:41,138
Giving a patient a ride?

1259
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:48,103
This lab has

1260
01:16:49,730 --> 01:16:51,690
some serious human rights problem.

1261
01:16:58,363 --> 01:16:59,990
Please come back if we call you.

1262
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:04,369
What's the charge?

1263
01:17:04,453 --> 01:17:06,204
Attempted abduction of a patient.

1264
01:17:06,288 --> 01:17:07,372
Great.

1265
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:09,958
I shouldn't have joined hands
with Professor Seong.

1266
01:17:10,042 --> 01:17:12,210
I must be obsessed with Complex A too.

1267
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:14,338
What do we do with Taek-seon?

1268
01:17:14,421 --> 01:17:17,799
Stop whining and get in the car.
I have something to show you.

1269
01:17:41,865 --> 01:17:43,200
Immunity booster, 2cc.

1270
01:17:44,534 --> 01:17:45,494
All good?

1271
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:49,289
Inject when ready.

1272
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:51,458
And get ready for a cardiac arrest.

1273
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:54,252
2cc more, slowly.

1274
01:18:01,718 --> 01:18:03,679
Keep an eye on the EEG.

1275
01:18:14,481 --> 01:18:15,357
Yeon-u?

1276
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:16,608
Kim Yeon-woo!

1277
01:18:23,073 --> 01:18:25,742
Su-pil! What happened?

1278
01:18:26,326 --> 01:18:29,621
This is my wife.

1279
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:31,832
Hello, I'm Masako.

1280
01:18:31,915 --> 01:18:35,085
Masako? Wasn't that a mouse?

1281
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:41,007
You're right,
my zodiac sign is the mouse.

1282
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:43,885
We're going on our honeymoon.
An 80-day trip around the world.

1283
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:45,554
Congratulations.

1284
01:18:46,263 --> 01:18:49,057
Are you going to be
wearing that on the trip?

1285
01:18:49,141 --> 01:18:52,769
There are so many viruses
that we don't know of in the world.

1286
01:18:53,478 --> 01:18:55,397
You said you like cats, right?

1287
01:18:56,356 --> 01:18:58,400
How cute!

1288
01:19:02,446 --> 01:19:05,240
His name is Gyun.

1289
01:19:05,323 --> 01:19:06,158
Bye!

1290
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:10,787
So your name is Gyun.

1291
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:13,248
Lee Gyun?

1292
01:19:23,258 --> 01:19:26,219
Abnormal brain activity.
The heart rate is spiking!

1293
01:19:26,303 --> 01:19:28,597
Kosev, 2nd stage. She's rejecting it.

1294
01:19:34,686 --> 01:19:36,605
Dr. Lee.

1295
01:19:38,064 --> 01:19:38,982
I like you.

1296
01:19:39,733 --> 01:19:40,609
I really do.

1297
01:19:40,692 --> 01:19:42,235
You won't remember this later.

1298
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:44,196
You think I won't remember you?

1299
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:45,697
I don't know about that,

1300
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:49,367
but you'll forget the feelings.
Because they're fake.

1301
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:52,412
There are no fake feelings.

1302
01:19:52,996 --> 01:19:54,539
Once you're fully recovered,

1303
01:19:55,665 --> 01:19:57,250
they'll be gone.

1304
01:20:04,508 --> 01:20:05,884
What's this?

1305
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:08,094
Taek-seon's antibody
you left the other day.

1306
01:20:08,178 --> 01:20:10,972
The antibody healed
and started attacking the viruses again.

1307
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:12,057
How did you do that?

1308
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:14,518
I didn't do anything but watch.

1309
01:20:14,601 --> 01:20:15,894
That doesn't make sense.

1310
01:20:15,977 --> 01:20:17,979
I think Taek-seon has the ability

1311
01:20:18,063 --> 01:20:21,817
to regenerate the antibody
and heal even after developing spots.

1312
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:25,946
We need an inhibitor
to remove the booster.

1313
01:20:26,029 --> 01:20:27,072
Inhibitor?

1314
01:20:27,155 --> 01:20:29,491
The B-Cell Immune Booster
has only been in the way.

1315
01:20:29,574 --> 01:20:32,577
The problem was that we artificially
increased the number of antibodies.

1316
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:34,246
You have the TGF-beta, right?

1317
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:43,505
Hurry up.

1318
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:45,465
You need to hurry.

1319
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:49,344
The security is tighter
since the Russian team's arrival.

1320
01:20:49,427 --> 01:20:50,846
Do you think this will work?

1321
01:20:50,929 --> 01:20:54,850
It's a perfect plan.
I'm not a traitor anymore, right?

1322
01:20:55,934 --> 01:20:57,435
What's your purpose here?

1323
01:20:57,519 --> 01:20:59,396
We're the backup for the Russian team.

1324
01:21:06,987 --> 01:21:08,196
Snacks?

1325
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,282
Yes, snacks for after the disinfection.

1326
01:21:22,836 --> 01:21:25,297
-What's that?
-In Russian…

1327
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:33,847
What happened?

1328
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:37,058
Why did the lights go out?

1329
01:21:37,142 --> 01:21:40,103
This is the control room. What happened?

1330
01:21:40,186 --> 01:21:42,814
-It's not working.
-Call the security.

1331
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:44,900
-And Mr. Kim too.
-Yes, sir.

1332
01:21:46,776 --> 01:21:48,111
Hello.

1333
01:21:52,699 --> 01:21:54,701
Hello. Are you sure you came
to right place, no confusion?

1334
01:21:54,784 --> 01:21:55,827
Mouse!

1335
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:56,953
Mouse?

1336
01:22:41,373 --> 01:22:42,916
Remove that.

1337
01:22:42,999 --> 01:22:44,000
Taek-seon.

1338
01:22:45,126 --> 01:22:46,169
Doctor?

1339
01:22:47,003 --> 01:22:48,797
You don't need these.

1340
01:23:04,312 --> 01:23:05,605
Are the mice infected?

1341
01:23:05,689 --> 01:23:08,775
No, I trained them,
so they'll come back in time.

1342
01:23:08,858 --> 01:23:10,735
I've been handling mice for 15 years.

1343
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:11,653
What's all this?

1344
01:23:13,822 --> 01:23:15,115
Why are you doing this?

1345
01:23:16,783 --> 01:23:19,327
Is this revenge
for firing you five years ago?

1346
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:22,706
Or do you want Complex A so much?

1347
01:23:22,789 --> 01:23:25,834
Neither the booster
nor the Russian method was the answer.

1348
01:23:26,334 --> 01:23:27,752
Then explain those spots.

1349
01:23:29,295 --> 01:23:30,922
We need an inhibitor.

1350
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:32,173
Inhibitor?

1351
01:23:32,257 --> 01:23:34,843
To remove the poison
we have put into her body.

1352
01:23:34,926 --> 01:23:37,012
Our enemy's defeating us,

1353
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:39,097
and you want to remove our ally?

1354
01:23:42,559 --> 01:23:44,144
Do you think I'll buy that?

1355
01:23:44,227 --> 01:23:45,478
Professor Seong.

1356
01:23:45,562 --> 01:23:47,647
Please, just trust me this once.

1357
01:23:48,314 --> 01:23:52,402
Taek-seon's already at Kozlov's stage two,
so let's talk once that's done.

1358
01:23:52,485 --> 01:23:53,570
Move the patient.

1359
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:56,031
Do you think I'm a mouse?

1360
01:23:56,781 --> 01:23:58,450
Says who?

1361
01:23:59,951 --> 01:24:01,703
I'll make the choice.

1362
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:07,125
I have the right to be treated
by the doctor I choose.

1363
01:24:07,751 --> 01:24:10,462
I want Dr. Lee Gyun to treat me.

1364
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:14,215
He left the project.
Now, I'm the director.

1365
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:17,218
Now, move her.

1366
01:24:19,095 --> 01:24:20,221
Wait.

1367
01:24:21,347 --> 01:24:22,182
Wait.

1368
01:24:33,943 --> 01:24:35,236
Taek-seon.

1369
01:24:37,447 --> 01:24:38,782
Do you trust me?

1370
01:24:43,203 --> 01:24:44,954
Then give your virus to me.

1371
01:24:51,002 --> 01:24:52,504
What's he doing?

1372
01:24:54,506 --> 01:24:56,299
What are you doing?

1373
01:25:06,851 --> 01:25:09,854
Taek-seon's virus and antibody
are all in here now.

1374
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:13,775
Take me and let her go.

1375
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:15,777
He's lost his mind.

1376
01:25:16,694 --> 01:25:18,238
Take both of them.

1377
01:25:20,907 --> 01:25:21,991
Hold him.

1378
01:25:23,243 --> 01:25:24,077
What…

1379
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:25,537
-Hey!
-What are you doing?

1380
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:28,206
-Let go of me.
-You haven't changed at all.

1381
01:25:28,289 --> 01:25:30,291
-Stop it!
-You only care about money.

1382
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:33,628
-Let go of me.
-Jeez!

1383
01:25:43,638 --> 01:25:46,933
Is this Osong Lab in Seong Medical Center?

1384
01:25:47,517 --> 01:25:49,519
I'm the head of the lab.
How can I help you?

1385
01:25:49,602 --> 01:25:50,603
We got a report.

1386
01:25:50,687 --> 01:25:52,021
What report?

1387
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:55,692
False imprisonment.

1388
01:25:55,775 --> 01:25:58,403
-Violation of pharmaceutical law.
-I made the report.

1389
01:25:58,486 --> 01:25:59,737
Hey, Yong-man.

1390
01:26:00,446 --> 01:26:04,576
These people locked up this innocent woman
to do some weird experiment.

1391
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:05,869
Go now.

1392
01:26:05,952 --> 01:26:09,289
There are old people dancing
and mice going around here.

1393
01:26:09,372 --> 01:26:10,206
It's crazy.

1394
01:26:10,290 --> 01:26:13,042
He's a patient. He's infected.

1395
01:26:13,126 --> 01:26:14,043
Are you infected?

1396
01:26:14,127 --> 01:26:15,503
No.

1397
01:26:15,587 --> 01:26:19,090
Yong-man, I heard
there were Russians here too.

1398
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:21,634
They're doctors from Russia.

1399
01:26:21,718 --> 01:26:23,469
-They--
-Please be quiet.

1400
01:26:25,054 --> 01:26:25,889
Bring them.

1401
01:26:27,724 --> 01:26:28,766
Wait.

1402
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:31,144
-Do you have a warrant?
-Yes.

1403
01:26:31,227 --> 01:26:33,605
I do. Are you going to stop us?

1404
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:36,149
Politely show them the way.

1405
01:26:37,233 --> 01:26:39,110
-This way, Detective.
-Thanks.

1406
01:26:40,904 --> 01:26:44,324
I'm the board director
of Seong Medical Center.

1407
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,744
The future of this country
depends on this project.

1408
01:26:48,369 --> 01:26:50,538
You're making a big mistake.

1409
01:26:50,622 --> 01:26:53,625
Who's responsible
for this illegal clinical trial?

1410
01:27:11,935 --> 01:27:13,394
After getting this injection,

1411
01:27:14,437 --> 01:27:16,814
will I be going back to normal?

1412
01:27:17,690 --> 01:27:18,691
Yes.

1413
01:27:24,155 --> 01:27:26,741
Does it mean

1414
01:27:28,159 --> 01:27:29,744
I'm going back to being alone?

1415
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:32,997
Right now,

1416
01:27:34,123 --> 01:27:37,168
I can feel I'm being loved by you.

1417
01:27:39,629 --> 01:27:43,591
If it weren't for this virus,
I would've never known this feeling.

1418
01:27:46,678 --> 01:27:49,430
Right now, my dream is your full recovery.

1419
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:57,146
What if I can't remember this feeling
after being fully recovered?

1420
01:27:57,689 --> 01:27:58,815
Taek-seon.

1421
01:27:59,941 --> 01:28:02,652
I need to heal you
while I'm in my right mind.

1422
01:28:03,653 --> 01:28:05,905
I've been infected by you.

1423
01:28:07,198 --> 01:28:08,616
Why did you do that?

1424
01:28:13,579 --> 01:28:14,831
I wanted to feel

1425
01:28:15,957 --> 01:28:18,126
everything that you've felt.

1426
01:28:20,586 --> 01:28:23,214
You may not remember this feeling
once you're healed,

1427
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:26,968
but our bodies will remember this moment,

1428
01:28:28,303 --> 01:28:29,721
whether as immunity

1429
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:32,473
or something else.

1430
01:28:33,224 --> 01:28:34,767
I'll remember it.

1431
01:28:36,978 --> 01:28:40,106
That you came to treat me,

1432
01:28:41,357 --> 01:28:44,861
I fell in love with you,

1433
01:28:47,238 --> 01:28:48,114
and…

1434
01:28:50,199 --> 01:28:52,744
that I've been ill for a while,

1435
01:28:55,079 --> 01:28:56,539
but I was happy.

1436
01:29:58,851 --> 01:30:01,354
Taek-seon finally made a full recovery.

1437
01:30:01,437 --> 01:30:03,022
And all the infected people

1438
01:30:03,106 --> 01:30:05,983
returned to normal thanks to her antibody,

1439
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:08,945
receiving generous compensation
from Seong Medical Center.

1440
01:30:12,698 --> 01:30:16,244
I admitted to rushing the clinical trial

1441
01:30:16,327 --> 01:30:19,997
and revealed all the wrongdoings
done by Seong Medical Center.

1442
01:30:23,292 --> 01:30:27,296
SEONG MEDICAL CENTER'S
OFFICIAL APOLOGY PRESS CONFERENCE

1443
01:30:28,381 --> 01:30:30,967
The biggest news is

1444
01:30:31,050 --> 01:30:33,594
that we've discovered Complex A
from Taek-seon's antibody,

1445
01:30:35,138 --> 01:30:39,350
which will finally allow us to develop
an antidepressant with zero side effects.

1446
01:30:40,184 --> 01:30:42,103
As the owner of Complex A,

1447
01:30:42,186 --> 01:30:46,440
she decided to distribute it
worldwide for free.

1448
01:30:46,524 --> 01:30:48,860
And she wished to return
to her normal life quietly,

1449
01:30:48,943 --> 01:30:51,821
without exposing this to the media.

1450
01:30:57,451 --> 01:30:59,328
STAY HEALTHY
YOUR FOREVER PRESIDENT, KIM YEON-WOO

1451
01:31:01,873 --> 01:31:08,588
HI, CLASS PRESIDENT.
SEE YOU AT THE REUNION THIS SATURDAY!

1452
01:31:09,922 --> 01:31:11,716
How have you been, Su-pil?

1453
01:31:12,925 --> 01:31:14,260
Su-pil.

1454
01:31:14,343 --> 01:31:17,221
You did a wonderful job
for the happiness of humanity.

1455
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:21,309
Don't just hang out with mice there.
Go on dates, okay?

1456
01:31:34,405 --> 01:31:35,907
It's a beautiful day.

1457
01:32:05,186 --> 01:32:11,943
NAM SU-PIL

1458
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:28,000
Dr. Lee.

1459
01:32:29,669 --> 01:32:32,546
I thought it might be your car,
and I was right.

1460
01:32:34,632 --> 01:32:36,133
How are you doing?

1461
01:32:36,217 --> 01:32:39,053
I'm doing well.
I've been teaching at a university.

1462
01:32:39,762 --> 01:32:41,347
-Is it fun?
-No.

1463
01:32:42,765 --> 01:32:44,100
How are you doing?

1464
01:32:44,183 --> 01:32:45,935
Well…

1465
01:32:46,018 --> 01:32:47,687
-I'm writing these days.
-Oh.

1466
01:32:48,646 --> 01:32:51,399
Is it like an autobiography,
like you said before?

1467
01:32:51,482 --> 01:32:54,193
-I said that?
-Yes.

1468
01:32:55,236 --> 01:32:58,114
I remember everything
that happened before I got infected.

1469
01:32:58,197 --> 01:32:59,365
I see.

1470
01:32:59,949 --> 01:33:04,203
Everything feels vague to me.

1471
01:33:05,454 --> 01:33:07,623
I can't remember what happened

1472
01:33:08,791 --> 01:33:12,586
or how we even met.

1473
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:14,088
I can't remember.

1474
01:33:17,216 --> 01:33:19,510
So I was scared to reach out to you.

1475
01:33:20,136 --> 01:33:22,847
It's kind of embarrassing too.

1476
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:25,683
Don't worry.
Nothing embarrassing happened.

1477
01:33:29,145 --> 01:33:30,521
That's good to hear.

1478
01:33:31,856 --> 01:33:33,190
Are you okay now?

1479
01:33:33,858 --> 01:33:34,984
Of course.

1480
01:33:36,819 --> 01:33:38,446
I mean, is everything okay?

1481
01:33:39,363 --> 01:33:40,364
Yes.

1482
01:33:41,073 --> 01:33:42,241
Everything's okay.

1483
01:33:44,744 --> 01:33:46,370
Now,

1484
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:47,872
I wish you the best of luck.

1485
01:33:52,626 --> 01:33:54,837
It was nice seeing you, Professor.

1486
01:34:01,135 --> 01:34:03,387
Do you really feel nothing?

1487
01:34:30,831 --> 01:34:32,249
Where's your car?

1488
01:34:32,333 --> 01:34:33,918
I don't have a car.

1489
01:34:34,001 --> 01:34:35,711
Because I'm flying to the US soon.

1490
01:34:36,212 --> 01:34:37,380
I can give you a ride.

1491
01:34:43,469 --> 01:34:46,347
You should tell me everything on the way.
And I mean everything.

1492
01:34:47,181 --> 01:34:50,476
I want to know.

1493
01:34:56,774 --> 01:34:58,109
Dr. Lee.

1494
01:34:58,192 --> 01:34:59,485
Yes?

1495
01:34:59,568 --> 01:35:01,362
Were you always wearing glasses?

1496
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:06,200
Sometimes, as protection.

1497
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:21,145
