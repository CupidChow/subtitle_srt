Where are you going?

00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:46,670
Quick!

6
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,310
Stop them!

Mi Lan.

8
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,130
She's having a fever.
Bring her to the hospital right away.

9
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,670
What on earth are you doing?

10
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,790
Who let you in?

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,480
Mi Lan?

12
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,080
What's going on, Mi Lan?

13
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,950
Get your hands off my daughter!

14
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,560
What are you doing? Put her down!

15
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,150
Move aside.

16
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,480
What... What are you doing?

17
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,950
We're going to the hospital.

18
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:18,790
Sure.

19
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:25,950
I told you to keep an eye on her.

20
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:26,790
What were you doing?

21
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,610
How could you let Shen Zhiheng
take her?

22
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,200
What will others say
about the Mi family?

23
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,600
Please don't be mad, Madam.

24
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,670
I didn't have a choice.

25
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:33,920
You told us to lock the door

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,200
and not give her any water or food.

27
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,200
I didn't want Miss Mi to starve,
so I brought her some water.

28
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,270
What nonsense is that?

29
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,670
Why would I do that?

30
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:40,920
Listen.

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,790
If you dare tell another lie
and the words reach Mr. Mi,

32
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,950
I will slap you in the face.

33
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,390
Yes, Madam... I won't do that again.

34
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,760
I won't. I'm so sorry.

35
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,480
Madam!

36
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,600
Madam, what happened?

37
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,440
Madam!

38
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,040
Madam...

39
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,670
Madam! Help!

40
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,880
Madam fell down.

41
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,950
Help!

42
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,040
Madam!

43
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,750
How did that happen?

44
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,740
- Be careful.
- Help her up.

45
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,990
Send her to the hospital.

46
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,880

and send her to the hospital.

Yes.

Yes, I have.

64
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,440
I failed to keep

the flowers you gifted me alive.

66

Did your mom do this to your hair?

I cut it myself.

72
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,240
She likes to pull my hair

She can't do that anymore

You look like the villain.

113
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,400
Liang, tell me the truth.

114
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,280
Is someone trying to assassinate you?

115
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,400
You always do shady things
for Chi Shanying.

116
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,080
It's not doing you any good,

117
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,200
except gaining notoriety.

118
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,710
If I don't work for Chi Shanying,

119
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,440
will anyone else hire me as an official?

120
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,200
Why do you insist on being an official?

121
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,750
You can start your own business.

122
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,040

I will try to live a life
longer than yours,

127

so that I can provide for you
until your last breath

128
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,640

in the palm of my hand forever.

129

Miss Jin, is there any misunderstanding?

130
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,160
Misunderstanding?

131
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,920
I am a man,

132
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,350
not a cat or a dog.

133

Other than daily necessities,

136
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,110
I will become a father
and need to put bread on the table.

137
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,990
Miss Jin, do you want
to support my whole family too?

138
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,990
I won't provide for your whole family,

139
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,950
so I forbid you to get married.

00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,950
Shen Zhiheng brought a generous gift

190
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,200
to Mi Mansion two days ago.

191
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,520
He had a brief chat with Mrs. Mi
at the hall

192
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:27,330
and was ready to leave.

193
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,220
But, before we could react,

194
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,830
he came out with Miss Mi in his arms

195
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,190
and headed straight to Keats Hospital.

196
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,040
Isn't Mr. Mi on a business trip?

197
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,630
Shen Zhiheng met Mrs. Mi in private...

198
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,110
Shen Zhiheng
has always lived in seclusion.

199
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,470
He doesn't have a family,
nor does he visit any dance clubs.

200
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,990
He basically shows no interest
to any female.

201
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,160
They are certainly not having an affair.

202
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:48,630
What did they talk about?

203
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,110
There was a distance between us,

204
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,200
so we couldn't hear their conversation.

205
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,320
Then, what's going on
between him and Miss Mi?

206
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,470
I'm still observing.

207
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:59,080
But he's obviously very concerned
about Miss Mi's well-being.

208
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,680
For the past few days,

209
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,160
he's visited her
at the hospital every day.

210
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,710
Fine. Keep an eye on them.

211
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,830
What about Haidong Daily?

212
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,160
Haidong Daily hasn't done anything.

213
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,350
They're not criticizing us either.

214
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,710
I sent one of our men

215
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,220
to the Shen Mansion
to work as a servant.

216
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,720
We'll probably receive a letter soon.

217
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,080
Fine.

218
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:21,870
As long as they don't make us
the headline,

219
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,280
they can publish whatever they want.

220
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,590
Well done.

221
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,230
Liang.

222
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,160
I'm here.

223
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,470
Miss Jin, you're here.

224
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,830
Miss Jin, what brings you here again?

225
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:39,750
What do you think?

226
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,320
You don't like apples,

227
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,830
so I brought some oranges instead.

228
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,080
See how much

229
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,710
I care for you.

230
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:47,560
Eat some.

231
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,230
Miss Jin, I really don't want to.

232
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,470
Liang, when we were kids,

233
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,920
you ate everything I gave you.

234
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,110
You were never picky about food.

235
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,950
Why did you change

236
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,320
after you joined Chi Shanying?

237
00:14:59,440 --> 00:14:59,990
Eat it.

238
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:07,920
Don't worry.

239
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,790
From now on, I'll come here every day
to take care of you.

240
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,750
I will help you regain your appetite.

241
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,320
Mr. Li. Miss Jin.

242
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,750
I'll excuse myself first.

243
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,400
Liang, have another one.

244
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,710
What's the matter? Is it sour?

245
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:39,160
It's really sweet.

246
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,300
Liang.

247
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,470
- The blood test of the patient...
- Give it another taste.

248
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,520
Keep an eye on him.

249
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,750
If you don't want it,
I'll tell Sheng to eat it.

250
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,280
Give it a taste.

251
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,680
Sir.

252
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,040
I think they're asking for you.

253
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,280
(Airen Hospital)

254
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:01,950
Miss Jin.

255
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,710
You don't have to come here every day.

256
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,630
We'll take care of Mr. Liang.

257
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,200
That's not enough.

258
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,660
What does a bunch of big guys know

259
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,730
about taking care of others?

260
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,710
Of course,
we're not as good at this as you.

261
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:14,950
Here.

262
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:16,470
Li Guisheng.

263
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,920
I have to give you a scolding.

264
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:22,400
I asked you to work for Liang,

265
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,710
hoping that you could protect him.

266
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,990
And look what you did.

267
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,470
You did all sorts of shady stuff,

268
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,040
ruining your reputation.

269
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,710
And now Liang
is in the hospital, injured.

270
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,160
What were you doing?

271
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,520
Miss Jin, I'm sorry.

272
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,040
I didn't look after him well
and had you worried.

273
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,750
I will be more careful next time.

274
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,560
Next time?

275
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,800
Be more vigilant.

276
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,590
Don't worry.

277
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,800
It will never happen again.

278
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,520
I will make sure of his safety

279
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,400
at all costs.

280
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,040
Sir.

281
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,830
What are you doing?

282
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:36,430
Hurry up.

283
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,000
I...

284
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,870
The wheelchair...

285
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,720
The wheelchair...

286
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,910
My... My backside.

287
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:47,590
Be careful.

288
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,240
You should've waited for me
if you wanted to use the wheelchair.

289
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,680
Why did you do this to yourself?

290
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:52,430
Hurry up.

291
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,590
Hurry up.
Help me with the discharge procedure.

292
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:55,430
Hurry up!

293
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,990
You haven't recovered yet.
How can you be discharged?

294
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,960
Didn't you hear Jin Jingxue?

295
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,590
She'll be here every day.

296
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,910
How can I stand seeing her every day?

297
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,960
I can't stay in the hospital any longer,

298
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,190
but I can't go home either.

299
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,350
She'll definitely come over to my place.

300
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,560
Let's go to your place.

301
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,320
My place?

302
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,390
Shut it. Let's go.

303
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:22,960
Hurry up!

304
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,280
Hold this.

305
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Let's go.

306
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,320
It's all right.

307
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:48,870
Settle down first.

308
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:49,760
I'll clean the place.

309
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,960
Your place looks pretty decent.

310
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,080
All thanks to you

311
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,760
who've been taking care of me
for the past years.

312
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:04,720
This one.

313
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,590
I got you a new one.

314
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:07,910
Oh.

315
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,320
Look.

316
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:19,960
This...

317
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:21,800
My mom made this for me.

318
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,110
I can use it when...
When that day comes.

319
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,830
It's of superior quality.

320
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,870
Made with clean fresh cotton.

321
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,160
It's new. I'll change it for you later.

322
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,310
Don't mind the color.

323
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,890
Where are you sleeping
if I take the bed?

324
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,710
I'll sleep here.

325
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:38,750
This...

326
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,030
We can just lower the curtain

327
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,290
and I won't invade your privacy.

328
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,790
Just tell me if you need anything.

329
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,160
What else do you need?

330
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,030
I will go and buy it for you.

331
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,120
It's fine.

332
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:53,680
It's all good.

333
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,550
I'll boil you some water.

334
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,220
(Keats Hospital)

335
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,470
Stop.

336
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,020
(Keats Hospital)

337
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:22,750
Mr. Shen.

338
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,550
Youwen.

339
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,510
What are you doing at the hospital?

340
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,120
I'm here to visit my coworker.

341
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,600
He fractured his leg a few days ago

342
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,510
when he was hiking.

343
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:31,990
How careless.

344
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:32,920
Speaking of that,

345
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,030
he had his fortune told
by an expert a while ago.

346
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,640
He said that the expert knew everything

347
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,600
and had traveled everywhere.

348
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,650
The expert told him that he would run
into some minor accidents very soon.

349
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,370
Perhaps he would end up
with some injuries.

350
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,470
Turns out he was right.

351
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,360
Therefore, I'm planning

352
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,710
to visit the expert tomorrow

353
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,200
and have my fortune told too.

354
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,550
How superstitious. Go on.

355
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,680
Youwen.

356
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,360
What's the matter, Mr. Shen?

357
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,750
I'll do the interview

358
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,360
on your behalf tomorrow,

359
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,360
so that you don't have to rush over.

360
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,950
(A hundred years have passed.)

361
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,510
(I have never missed any opportunity)

362
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,030
(to find my little brother.)

363
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,200
(I don't know)

364
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,840
(if this attempt
will end up in vain too.)

365
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,160
(Regardless,)

366
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,230
(one should never lose hope.)

367
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,220
(Zhanyun Pavilion)

368
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:06,680
I'm Shen Zhiheng from Haidong Daily.

369
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,230
Is anyone home?

370
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,360
I've been waiting for you. Come on in.

371
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,400
Mr. Shen.

372
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,510
I've been waiting for you.

373
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,640
Please come in.

374
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,160
Thank you.

375
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:16,640
My last name is Mo.
You can call me Mr. Mo.

376
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,270
Mr. Shen,

377
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,030
what is the purpose of your visit?

378
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,640
You are a knowledgeable man,

379
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,550
who knows everything,

380
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,950
including fortune-telling.

381
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,850
I'm wondering if you can answer
a few questions of mine.

382
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,790
Who are you looking for?

383
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,440
How do you know
that I'm looking for someone?

384
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,750
You've lived a hundred years,

385
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:41,510
and naturally do not dwell on anything.

386
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,080
The person you can't get over with

387
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:46,270
must be someone
who has a profound influence on you.

388
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:47,950
Set the fire!

389
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,710
Let him go!

390
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,640
- My boy...
- Mother!

391
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,790
Mother...

392
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,840
Mother...

393
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,710
(I can't read this man.)

394
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,030
(Both him and the crow)

395
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,950
(carry a menacing aura.)

396
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,880
(Who exactly is him?)

397
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,080
Don't worry, Mr. Shen.

398
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:08,360
I'm not your enemy.

399
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,310
If I had any ill intentions,

400
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,120
I wouldn't have been here today.

401
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,080
I want to find my younger brother,

402
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,680
Shen Zhiqian.

403
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,080
Before that,

404
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,790
I have a question for you.

405
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:26,360
Who did this to you?

406
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,270
Wei Qiu,

407
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,840
my aunt.

408
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:35,510
Indeed, it was Wei Qiu
from the Three Outer Families.

409
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:38,510
Three Outer Families?

410
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,890
(During the year 970
of the Chao Calendar,)

411
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,160
(the Three Stars fell from the sky
and broke into rock fragments,)

412
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:50,510
(namely Profound Yang Stone,
Blood Amber Stone, and Fantasy Stone.)

413
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,080
This space debris

414
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,120
contains great energy.

415
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,680
The three families
who laid their hands on them

416
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,510
also gained
some extraordinary abilities.

417
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,270
Not wanting to cause panic,

418
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,790
the three families agreed
to stay out of public sight

419
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,360
and never mingle with the world again.

420
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,680
That's why they are called
the Three Outer Families.

421
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,200
Wei Qiu, your aunt,

422
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,790
is one of their members.

423
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,640
How did the meteorite

424
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,790
make my aunt different from others?

425
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,100
(Shen Residence)

426
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,470
(Wei Qiu)

427
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,750
(was always a gentle and quiet woman.)

428
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,950
(Since she got ahold
of the Blood Amber Stone,)

429
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,230
(she changed drastically.)

430
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:26,990
(The Blood Amber Stone)

431
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,230
(represents lives in outer space.)

432
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,310
(It gave Wei Qiu's body
an extraordinary power.)

433
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,230
(However,)

434
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,510
(the power also wore out
her body very quickly.)

435
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:40,640
(To maintain
the normal function of her body,)

436
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,600
(she needed blood supply very urgently.)

437
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,790
Just like your current state.

438
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,710
Strictly speaking,

439
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,270
you are just a patient now.

440
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,230
Does it mean that I can cure my illness

441
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,400
if I find the Blood Amber Stone?

442
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,680
Perhaps.

443
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:59,160
But we don't know

444
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,950
if the Blood Amber Stone

445
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,360
is with the Mu family or Wei Qiu.

446
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,640
The Mu family

447
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,400
is one of the Three Outer Families too?

448
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:07,880
That's right.

449
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,600
The Mu family was originally
a tribe from the southwest.

450
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,470
(When they got the Fantasy Stone,)

451
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,270
(they gained the ability
to control others' minds.)

452
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,920
(But it also put
a curse on their family.)

453
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,030
(None of their family members)

454
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,790
(could live past the age of 30.)

455
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:22,950
(They thought)

456
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,700
(they might be able
to resolve their crisis)

457
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,640
(if they were able
to combine the three stones.)

458
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,680
(Back then,
they had a fight with Wei Qiu,)

459
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,360
(trying to snatch
the Blood Amber Stone.)

460
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,920
(It ended with no winner.)

461
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,160
Eventually, the entire family moved
to a foreign country.

462
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,270
If putting three stones together
can solve the problem,

463
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,750
why don't the three families
work together?

464
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,510
Everyone is greedy.

465
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,750
They all want
to keep things for themselves,

466
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,030
especially
when it's such a precious item.

467
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,080
It's very difficult for them
to work together.

468
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,030
Mr. Mo.

469
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,030
Are you one of them too?

470
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,510
If fate brings us together again
in the future,

471
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:57,600
you will find out.

472
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,360
Now, all you need to know

473
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,440
is that I'm a friend, not a foe.

474
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,550
Thanks for your time, Mr. Mo.

475
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,310
I have another question.

476
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,600
You have so much power.

477
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:12,890
You could've just taken the opportunity

478
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,600
and done as you wished.

479
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:16,360
Why are you waiting so patiently?

480
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,440
I chose this path.

481
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,160
I have only one principle in life.

482
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,160
As a human,

483
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,080
you can cultivate or help others.

484
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,510
You can be like water.

485
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,790
Keeping your goodness
in the darkest abyss.

486
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,120
And you won't be blamed.

487
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,030
And you won't be blamed.

488
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:40,600
Mr. Shen.

489
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,600
There are millions of paths.

490
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,680
Yet, you chose the rockiest one.

491
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,310
If that's the case,

492
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,400
I hope

493
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,600
that you'll have company
for your journey ahead.

494
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,470
Drink it.

495
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,550
Aunt.

496
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,990
Where did you and Qian go?

497
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,330
I've spent a hundred years
looking for you.

498
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,440
What am I

499
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,030
to do now?

500
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:54,200
How am I going to keep living
in this mortal world?

501
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,270
Look at it.

502
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,880
Thousands of years ago,

503
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:13,270
it was
the legendary Three-Legged Golden Crow.

504
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:16,710
Now, it has become an ominous creature
that everyone abhors.

505
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,270
Time has changed.

506
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,920
People have changed.

507
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:22,920
But it hasn't.

508
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,600
Protecting yourself

509
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,360
is the priority.

510
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,230
(We have great chemistry.)

511
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,750
(Here's a gold crow for you.)

512
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:13,920
(This golden grow is harmless.
It brings joy and listens to you.)

513
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,510
(It's also smart enough to be able
to locate its master wherever he goes.)

514
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,080
(Please take care of it.)

515
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,310
Mr. Zhang.

516
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,080
Where is Mr. Shen?

517
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:55,990
Over there.

518
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:57,510
All right.

519
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:04,470
Mr. Shen.

520
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,640
Did the interview go well?

521
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,550
How was the interview with the expert?

522
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,750
Nothing interesting.

523
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,840
He only said nonsense

524
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,080
and doesn't deserve
to be called an expert.

525
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:21,230
Add another article in tomorrow's press.

526
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:21,990
Sure.

527
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:25,840
Go ahead.

528
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,710
The title should read,

529
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:31,120
"Beast Reappeared,
Biting Humans and Sucking Blood."

530
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,840
We released this article before.

531
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,270
Do it again.

532
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,400
Add another line.

533
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,510
"The body is kept in the morgue.

534
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,440
The family of the deceased
is demanding an autopsy."

535
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,510
Sure.

536
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,640
I'll go back first, Mr. Shen.

537
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:01,360
If you're still in Haidong,

538
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,790
you'll show up
when you read this news, right?

539
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,030
Shen Zhiqian...

540
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:20,750
I think...

541
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,600
Look!

542
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,230
Look at this.

543
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,680
Beast reappeared,
biting humans and sucking blood.

544
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,230
Why is the beast back again?

545
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,510
What beast is it?

546
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:27,980
Look.

547
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,910
Who knows? They didn't find out
anything the previous time either.

548
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:30,790
It's scary.

549
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:31,950
We come to work every day.

550
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:32,990
I'm scared to leave home.

551
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:36,600
The body is kept
in the coroner's office.

552
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:37,710
The coroner's office...

553
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:40,030
Wait a minute.

554
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,510
Beast? Which newspaper is this?

555
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,750
Dr. Situ, there's another beast.

556
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,400
- Yes. Look.
- What do we do?

557
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,080
It's terrifying.

558
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,950
- I'm scared to leave home.
- (Is it Shen?)

559
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,060
Freeze to death?

560
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,440
(Xinpu Coroner's Office)
There are only bodies here.

561
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,790
Why do we have to guard this place?

562
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:40,950
Who knows?

563
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,160

I'm the doctor here.

591
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,600
(Xinpu Coroner's Office)
Look at my work pass.

592
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:57,830
Just let me in to collect my report.

593
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:58,960
I'll leave right away.

594
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,040
Go away.

595
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:01,960
Everyone has gone off work.

596
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,430
Please, sir.

597
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,600
Come again tomorrow.

598
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:05,640
Sir, I really am the doctor.

599
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,430
Shut it. Come again tomorrow.

600
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,790
What a stubborn man.

601
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:10,710
Shen.

602
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,040
What brings you here?

603
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,230
Our dean insists

604
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:19,080
that I collect the autopsy report.

605
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,480
Why are you here?

606
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,000
I saw him.

607
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,200
Who?

608
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:53,310
Shen.

609
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,120
We've been friends
for more than three years,

610
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:00,350
and I've never seen you this angry.

611
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:02,600
I've spent a century looking for him.

612
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,270
A full century.

613
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:11,600
How can you be sure

614
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,390
that he is your younger brother?

615
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:15,270
I called his name

616
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:16,390
and he reacted to it.

617
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,830
He knew it was me
but he didn't want to admit it.

618
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:20,640
Why?

619
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,200
Is it because

620
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,230
you turned into a beast
and bit a human unconsciously?

621
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:29,430
Who?

622
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,910
I read the newspaper this morning.

623
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,640
A beast bit a human.

624
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,270
It was you, right?

625
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,910
I made Youwen publish the article

626
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,790
so that I could lure him out.

627
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,600
Are you looking for him

628
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,560
to repay his kindness

629
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,830
or for revenge?

630
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:49,910
Do you think I owe him any kindness?

631
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,480
It's not all bad.

632
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,430
After all, you will live a long life.

633
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:02,430
How long can an average person live?

634
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,710
Think positive.

635
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,760
You can't solve everything
with violence.

636
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:08,200
You can't beat him anyway.

637
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,080
I can't beat him?

638
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,560
How do you know?

639
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,230
No.

640
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:17,000
I only let him win
because he was my junior.

641
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,830
That's not what I meant.

642
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,080
I made a mistake.

643
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,080
I mean

644
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,600
if you could beat him,

645
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,230
then you would've long captured him.

646
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,350
And you won't be sulking here.

647
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:32,160
I'm only upset
because he didn't admit my presence.

648
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:33,910
He may have forgotten

649
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:37,040
that he and his mother
ruined the Shen family.

650
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:39,230
It's all his fault

651
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,710
that I am like this.

652
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,060
He may have forgotten this,

653
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:46,830
but I was the one
who saved him from the fire.

654
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:48,390
He may have forgotten

655
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:50,960
that I'm his only family now.

656
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,720
He must be looking at me

657
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,000
in a dark corner right now.

658
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:00,880
All these years,

659
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,350
he has been mocking me in secret.

660
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:06,600
He wants

661
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,560
to see me struggle in this world,

662
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,710
like a living dead.

663
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,040
Shen.

664
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:22,200
Think positive.

665
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,830
At least, now you know

666
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:25,970
that your brother is still alive.

667
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,640
Perhaps

668
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,350
he's not ready to face you yet.

669
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,750
Besides, he knows that you're here.

670
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,310
Why not

671
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,310
wait a little longer?

672
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:40,830
Will he come?

673
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,120
I guess

674
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,790
so...

675
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:08,140
(Shen Mansion)

676
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:55,740
(Memorial Tablets
of Shen Family ancestors)

677
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:12,430
(Shen Zhiqian)

678
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:13,520
Let him go!

679
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,870
Mother, help!

680
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:15,830
My boy...

681
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:16,310
Mother.

682
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:17,270
Help!

683
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:19,640
Save me!

684
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:22,160
Grandma, please let them go.

685
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,640
They didn't hurt anyone.

686
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,020
- It'll be too late when someone's hurt.
- Mother...

687
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:26,750
Help!

688
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:27,230
Get up!

689
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:27,910
Grandma...

690
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:29,350
My boy...

691
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,230
Grandma!

692
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:31,790
- Help!
- Let him go!

693
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:33,120
He is innocent.

694
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:34,520
Big Brother.

695
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,560
Mother.

696
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:41,430
Are you all right, Big Brother?

697
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,560
Are you all right?

698
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,750
Are you all right?

699
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,640
Are you all right?

700
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,310
(Please get up.)

701
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,270

702
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,600
(Shen Zhiqian)
(and waiting for you.)

703
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:00,870
(Do you really have the heart
to keep hiding from me?)

704
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:13,120
Please have mercy.

705
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:14,200
Please have mercy.

706
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,000
Please have mercy.

707
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,310
Monster...

00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:27,640
Monster!

00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,160
It's a monster!

710
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:30,230
There's a monster!

There's a monster in the backyard.
