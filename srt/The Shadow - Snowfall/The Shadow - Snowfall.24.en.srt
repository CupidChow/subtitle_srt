=Snow Fall=
=Episode 24=

3
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:41,940
(This is a work of fiction.)

4
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:49,120
(Shen Mansion)

5
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,030
Later,

6
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,280
I want to make more dumplings.

7
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,360
I'm not eating them.

8
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:56,920
They are all yours.

9
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,190
Today is the second day
of the Chinese New Year.

10
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,080
Prepare more dumplings.

11
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,080
She's alone in Mi Mansion.

12
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,080
You should go back
and visit her on a day like today.

13
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,780
Why are you back?

14
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,190
Today is the second day
of the Chinese New Year.

15
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,950
Mr. Shen and I
made some dumplings for you.

16
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,800
We were worried
that you had nothing to eat.

17
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,510
You can have this.

18
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:49,910
It tastes great.

19
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:51,880
Delicious.

20
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,560
I never thought

21
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,390
that I could eat the dumplings
you made for me.

22
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,670
How did I end up like this?

23
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,160
Do you remember

24
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,880
when my birthday is?

25
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,100
The 20th day of the 11th month.

26
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,760
On the day I gave birth to you,

27
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,630
I almost died due to obstructed labor.

28
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,880
Your father didn't even look at us

29
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,030
and took his fifth wife in.

30
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,880
Last year, on the 20th day
of the 11th month,

31
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,670
he held a one-month-old birthday feast
for his eighth wife's son.

32
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,920
I will never forget this day.

33
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,470
This is the most humiliating day
in my life.

34
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,120
The 20th day of the 11th month

35
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,880
is also the day I was reborn.

36
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,590
I met Mr. Shen on this day.

37
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,590
He lets me know

38
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,830
that someone in this world

39
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:13,240
holds me so dearly.

40
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,000
He teaches me how to read, write,

41
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,070
and behave in life.

42
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,240
He teaches me how to love myself

43
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,880
and others.

44
00:05:26,442 --> 00:05:28,882
You are supposed to teach me those.

45
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,510
Sorry.

47
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,030
So sorry.

48
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,070
I heard your conversation
with Mr. Shen yesterday.

49
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,440
He hoped that I could learn
to forgive and let go.

50
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,200
I don't wish to disappoint him.

51
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,470
But I really don't know

52
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,950
if you deserve my forgiveness.

53
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,630
Also, I don't know
how to let go of my resentment.

54
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,030
This is my doll.

55
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,440
I saw it in your room. It's wretched,

56
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,470
so I mended it.

57
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,800
I didn't think

58
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,560
you still have it with you
all these years.

59
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,680
This is the only thing you left me.

60
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,390
After giving birth to you,

61
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,830
I fell sick.

62
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,070
I was afraid that I might infect you,

63
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,440
so I stopped feeding you.

64
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,830
I could only put you
in the attic next door.

65
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,710
But they told me

66
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,270
you wouldn't stop crying.

67
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,390
I was so worried.

68
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,800
I didn't know what to do.

69
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,240
So I struggled

70
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,830
to make this doll

71
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,800
from my clothes

72
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,830
to keep you company.

73
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:22,920
After having this doll,

74
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,240
you became calmer.

75
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,030
I like this doll very much.

76
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,390
Because you didn't like me

77
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,510
and refused to hold me.

78
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,240
Only this doll stays with me.

79
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,270
To me,

80
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,030
this doll has the scent of my mother.

81
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,000
Afterward,

82
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,760
I realized that you lost your sight.

83
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,630
Who is to blame?

84
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,710
Your father kept on marrying new women.

85
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,470
I couldn't help but become resentful.

86
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,680
I couldn't help but beat you.

87
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,760
I... I couldn't control myself.

88
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,700
I just couldn't.

89
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,240
Every time when you beat me,

90
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,760
I would hold it.

91
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,000
That way, my resentment

92
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,270
would lessen.

93
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,640
I even used it to comfort myself

94
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,350
that you didn't mean to beat me.

95
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,870
You did it

96
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,470
because you were heartbroken.

97
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,160
I know you didn't have a happy life.

98
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,070
And I couldn't help you to keep Father.

99
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,400
No,

100
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,320
it's my fault.

101
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,920
Everything was my fault.

102
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,870
Mi Lan,

103
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,830
I shouldn't have been trapped
in my own world

104
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,590
and pushed all the blame on you

105
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,040
to put you through all this.
It's all my fault.

106
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:14,470
Forgive me.

107
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,870
I forgive you.

108
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,680
I forgive you.

109
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,320
Mother.

110
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,400
Mi Lan.

111
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,110
Mi Lan.

112
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,400
Go upstairs.

113
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,590
Now.

114
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,200
Don't come down.

115
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:04,990
Go upstairs.

116
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:05,800
All right.

117
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,440
Miss Mi Lan,

118
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,800
it has been a long while.

119
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,200
Mu Lihua,

120
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,200
you haven't died yet.

121
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,320
Hello?

122
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,320
(Mr. Shen,)

123
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,040
(Mi Lan was taken away
by a horrible woman.)

124
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,470
What does she look like?

125
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,590
She has a mask on half of her face.

126
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,110
(When she turns her rings,
Mi Lan can't move.)

127
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,750
Only you two were sent?

128
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,200
The clan leader said it was your order,
he didn't dare to slight.

129
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,520
Ten Shadow Warriors
have been dispatched,

130
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,200
together two of us,

131
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,800
it should be enough for you.

132
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,990
You unhelpful bunch.

133
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,560
I never expected them to help much.

134
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:36,800
Come with me.

135
00:11:54,185 --> 00:11:55,400
Stop struggling.

136
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,230
I have drugged you.

137
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,950
Even Shen Zhiheng couldn't resist it,

138
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,990
let alone you.

139
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,230
What method did Shen Zhiheng use

140
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,040
to restore your sight

141
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,440
and give you such power?

142
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,320
Do you expect me to tell you that?

143
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,280
Do you think I won't know

144
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,320
if you don't tell me?

145
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,920
Mi Lan,

146
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:24,750
you are a young girl, and I don't wish
to make it difficult for you.

147
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,590
If you can tell me
where the Blood Amber Stone is,

148
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,560
I will release you

149
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:31,990
so you can reunite with him.

150
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,400
What do you say?

151
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,950
I have ways and means to deal with you.

152
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,070
Except for telling me the truth,

153
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,320
you have no other choices.

154
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:50,920
Mi Lan,

155
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,560
everything is arranged by fate.

156
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,920
It's only a matter of time

157
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,560
to find out your secret.

158
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,680
Bring Li Yingliang here.

159
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,590
Yes.

160
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,920
You know Li Yingliang, right?

161
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,070
His mind has been manipulated

162
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:39,400
by my Fantasy Stone.

163
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,640
You may catch up with him

164
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,560
once he wakes up.

165
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:41,900
(Wei Qiu)

166
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:45,950
Wei Qiu.

167
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,200
Mu Lihua took Mi Lan away.

168
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,280
What?

169
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,440
Mu Lihua hasn't died yet?

170
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,190
Doesn't that mean Mi Lan is in danger?

171
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,830
I found this at Mu Lihua's place.

172
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,950
But I'm not sure
if she left this on purpose.

173
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,650
It's about the secrets
of the Mu family's past generations.

174
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,230
The Mu family is gifted
and possesses the divine ring

175
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,800
that can lure people into illusory.

176
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,920
To ensure the lineage flourishes,

177
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,470
the ancestor stole a hibiscus tree
from Mr. Mo

178
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,810
and worshipped it for generations.

179
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,470
They sincerely prayed for longevity

180
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,070
but failed to get rid

181
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,280
of the death curse at the age of 30.

182
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,520
Wei Qiu?

183
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,870
They move like ghosts

184
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,870
and can kill in a flash.

185
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,470
The Mu family crafted Shadow Warriors

186
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,160
to injure Wei Qiu in the Year of Shen.

187
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,350
Wei Qiu

188
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:43,830
escaped.

189
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,350
It seems your mother
has kept many secrets

190
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,310
that you are unaware of.

191
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,750
Blood Amber Stone.

192
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,510
Where's the Mu family's ship?

193
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:50,920
According to the plan,

194
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,330
they should reach Haidong very soon.

195
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,400
The Mu family's ship travels in secret
this time,

196
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,470
they can't dock.

197
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,400
Take Mi Lan to the ship first.

198
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,360
Meet with our ship at sea.

199
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:06,950
With her,

200
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,200
Shen Zhiheng
will hand himself over to us.

201
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,080
I have some past grudges

202
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,920
that need to be settled
with Shen Zhiheng.

203
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,470
Why are there so many crows?

204
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,600
Urgh.

205
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,200
Haidong Army is insane!

206
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,140
Run!

207
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,140
Run now!

208
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,760
Hurry!

209
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,640
Run!

210
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,180
Liang.

211
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,080
Jingxue, this is the key to my home.

212
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,920
Stay inside and do not come out.

213
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,560
If I see Li Yingliang,

214
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,860
I will definitely bring him back.

215
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,540
Weilian.

216
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,480
It's also important

217
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,550
that you can come back safely.

218
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:09,750
Zhiheng,

219
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,790
did Mu Lihua

220
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,920
gather all three meteorites?

221
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,030
If she does,

222
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,270
will you still come with me
for the rescue?

223
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,180
I see you as my brother.

224
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,470
I go where you go.

225
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,080
Even though we might die?

226
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,200
I am not

227
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,920
a coward.

228
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,030
I may have been before,

229
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,400
but now I have someone
I want to protect.

230
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,080
As of now, no one can fight
against Mu Lihua.

231
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,800
Her power is beyond a human being.

232
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,120
The karma caused by the three meteorites

233
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,310
should end on us.

234
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,710
Locate Mu Lihua first.

235
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:43,880
All right.

236
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,120
- Mr. Mo.
- Mr. Mo.

237
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,120
Finally, I found you.

238
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,230
Mu Lihua has likely

239
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,600
gathered all three meteorites.

240
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,510
No, she only got two.

241
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,440
I have found her.

242
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,050
She's in the volcano cave
outside of the city.

243
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,190
She manipulates many Haidong soldiers
with the Fantasy Stone

244
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,180
and is hurting everyone.

245
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,840
Two of you, come with me.

246
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,230
I believe if we join hands,
we can stop her.

247
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,440
But the traffic outside the city
is paralyzed.

248
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:04,840
How do we get there?

249
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:05,710
I have an idea.

250
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,480
(Emergency news!)

251
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,820
(Acting Superintendent Wu
has dispatched the Haidong Army)

252
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,750
(to patrol all the streets of Haidong)

253
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,510
(to ensure the safety of the citizens.)

254
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,680
(Citizens, please do not panic.)

255
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,440
(Stay at home and take precautions.
Lock the doors and windows.)

256
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,030
(Do not go out
without necessary reasons)

257
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,640
(Emergency news!)

258
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:26,840
Move back, everyone.

259
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,550
Run this way! Quick.

260
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,080
Over there.

261
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,710
Save the injured first.

262
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,680
Save the injured first.

263
00:21:59,080 --> 00:21:59,880
Run!

264
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,950
I will go and stop them.

265
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,270
Two of you, go and save her.

266
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,030
Be careful.

267
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:20,470
All right.

268
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,200
Hyah!

269
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,200
Hyah!

270
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:30,680
Hyah!

271
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,420
What...

272
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,310
What is this sound?

273
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,190
I encountered it when I was little.

274
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,640
This is an omen
of the falling Heavenly Fire.

275
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:54,880
Heavenly Fire?

276
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,790
Save us!

277
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,310
Let us out!

278
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,880
Is anyone there?

279
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,950
- Let us out!
- Is anyone there?

280
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,440
Anyone?

281
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,840
Please save us!

282
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,510
Save us!

283
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,470
Is anyone there?

284
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,270
Let us out!

285
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:21,990
Go!

286
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,470
Now!

287
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:24,920
Leave this place!

288
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,550
Be careful. Go now.

289
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,080
Mind your step!

290
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:28,920
Hurry!

291
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:30,510
Be careful!

292
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:32,360
Go now!

293
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,080
Where is Mi Lan?

294
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,790
Shen Zhiheng,

295
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,710
the energy of Blood Amber Stone
and Fantasy Stone

296
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,360
has been absorbed by me.

297
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,880
You can't do much now.

298
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,550
If you want Mi Lan back,

299
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,230
return to the Mu Residence with me.

300
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,640
I will take you and your tragic lover

301
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,950
away

302
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:14,600
and make you the slaves
of the Mu family forever.

303
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,550
Mr. Shen, let me serve you.

304
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,480
Thank you, Liang.

305
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:12,750
You are welcome.

306
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,030
Mr. Shen!

307
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,550
Liang!

308
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:36,400
Are you confused about
why can't the Mu family

309
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,950
use the Profound Yang Stone?

310
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:39,680
Today, I will let you know

311
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,550
who can manipulate its power.

312
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:42,840
Stop her.

313
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,400
Mr. Mo,

314
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,340
are you all right?

315
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,160
Profound Yang Stone is powerful.

316
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,470
Why don't you use it yourself?

317
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,270
No one can own

318
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,270
every power.

319
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,840
Some opportunities

320
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:56,600
are beyond you in your whole life.

321
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,400
I have already sent

322
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,880
Mi Lan out to sea.

323
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,920
The curse of the Mu family

324
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,600
will be lifted soon.

325
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,640
Shen Zhiheng,

326
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,310
you didn't win.

327
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,640
Mi Lan.

328
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,510
Mr. Shen.

329
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,080
Mi Lan.

330
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,430
Mr. Shen.

331
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,630
I thought I was sent
to the Mu Residence

332
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,190
and be away from you.

333
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:23,240
I wouldn't let you drift away

334
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,320
alone.

335
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,240
No matter where you go,

336
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,560
I will find you.

337
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:31,910
Have you handled Mu Lihua?

338
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:34,350
Yes.

339
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:39,320
I know my Mr. Shen is amazing.

340
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,080
Is Haidong

341
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,320
safe now?

342
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,110
Yes, it is.

343
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,150
Everyone is safe.

344
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,280
Wonderful.

345
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:58,430
Can you sail?

346
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,670
Let me try.

347
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,760
Wait for me here.

348
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,150
Mr. Shen.

349
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,520

Jingxue!

366
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,560
Jingxue!

367
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,790
I'm sorry.

368
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,080
I couldn't fulfill my promise to you.

369
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,700
I said

370
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,960
it's also important
that you come back safely.

371
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:13,270
It's also

372
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,590
very important.

373
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,000
Finally, we can go home.

374
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,840
Finally, we can go home.

375
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,480
But this is too far away from the shore.

376
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,440
How do we get back?

377
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,960
The shipping industry of Haidong
is advanced.

378
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,630
There will surely be a ship passing.

379
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,000
Where

380
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,320
do you think

381
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,920
we will go in the future?

382
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,270
Where do you want to go?

383
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,480
I want to go to a small island,

384
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:02,520
where

385
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,400
no one can find us.

386
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,110
Then we can live

387
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,190
a free life there.

388
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,270
What do you want to do in the future?

389
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,190
You run a newspaper house,

390
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,520
and I play the piano.

391
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,230
That would be wonderful.

392
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,880
Letters and music

393
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,520
can give people hope.

394
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,790
But promise me.

395
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,590
Be a musician

396
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:39,150
and travel everywhere.

397
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,400
Settle in a new place

398
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,880
and live freely there with Weilian.

399
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,400
What about you?

400
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,230
Promise me.

401
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,920
Please.

402
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,360
What about you?

403
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,310
The sun is rising, Mi Lan.

404
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,440
The Blood Amber Stone has gone.

405
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,590
I struggle to rely on
the power Mr. Mo gave me

406
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:25,840
and hold up till now.

407
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,840
I'm at the end of my tether.

408
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:29,360
Mi Lan,

409
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,110
I can't make it back.

410
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,630
No, we will make it back.

411
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,790
You and I will row.

412
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,270
We will survive.

413
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,110
Mi Lan,

414
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,670
stop struggling.

415
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,400
Mi Lan.

416
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:09,190
Mi Lan.

417
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:12,020
Let go of me. Let's row.

418
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,100
Mi Lan,

419
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,710
stop that.

420
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,540
We are not rowing, Mi Lan.

421
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,000
Mi Lan.

422
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,280
Stop it already, Mi Lan.

423
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,790
I don't want you to die.

424
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,230
Don't leave me alone.

425
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,150
Mi Lan.

426
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:31,860
Mi Lan.

427
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,400
You can't die.

428
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:35,880
I don't want you to die.

430
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,840
You gave me your word.

431
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,230
You said

432
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:47,400
you would

433
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,360
stay with me forever.

434
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:53,670

Word has it that a couple
who watch the sunrise together

437
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,560
will be together forever.

438
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,000
