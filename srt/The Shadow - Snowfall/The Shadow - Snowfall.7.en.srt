3
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:41,940
(This drama is purely fictional.)

4
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,840
Ignite the charcoal, a bronze mirror,
and send a living.

5
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,710
Mr. Li, how did you grow up
in such a manner?

6
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,670
How are you so naive?

7
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,880
I only said that to scare you.

8
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:15,950
Did you really believe it?

9
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,880
I take everything you say seriously.

10
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,880
So why didn't you listen

11
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,230
when I said that we should mind
our own business?

12
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,270
My feelings for you

13
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,270
make it impossible for me to forget you.

14
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,360
I feel restless

15
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,990
and cannot bear you might disappear
from the world.

16
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,550
Save me.

17
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,510
I don't want to die.

18
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:42,880
Help me.

19
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,110
Help.

20
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,230
Mr. Shen, stop holding back.

21
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,640
Just get on with it.

22
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,040
Help me, help.

23
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,600
I don't... I don't want to die.

24
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,990
Do you even know he's human?

25
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,460
But aren't you the one
who preys on people?

26
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,830
Do you even understand
what it means to be human?

27
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,950
To live with dignity is human,

28
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,790
to live without is also human.

29
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,550
A human should live

30
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,230
and die with dignity.

31
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,320
Just because you have some power,

32
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,460
you think you control
the lives and deaths of others.

33
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,160
It's disgraceful

34
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,270
to feed on your own kind.

35
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,200
Everyone has parents and loved ones.

36
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,640
But to you,
a condemned prisoner isn't human.

37
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,760
He's just a plaything
to be disposed of at will.

38
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,640
You don't see me or them as human.

39
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,920
But what are you then?

40
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:43,710
All right.

41
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,390
You are cultured,

42
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,880
you are refined,
and you have high standards.

43
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,390
You have high standards, huh?

44
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,390
We'll see how long that lasts.

45
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:27,780
(Keats Hospital)

46
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,240
Dr. Situ, a patient with chest injuries

47
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,590
from broken glass just arrived.

48
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,190
The patient's blood pressure
is very unstable.

49
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,070
It looks like the heart
and pericardium are injured,

50
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,290
creating pressure on the heart.

51
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,860
What is his blood pressure now?

52
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,910
It's 75 over 40.

53
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:54,990
Prepare for surgery.

54
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,590
All right.

55
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,830
Mi Lan?

56
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,650
What are you doing here?

57
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,240
Dr. Situ, do you know the police
have arrested Mr. Shen?

58
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,440
Police station?

59
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,270
Shen abides by the law.

60
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,240
He'll be fine.

61
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,120
Dr. Situ, everything is prepared
for surgery.

62
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,080
I'll be right over.

63
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,640
All right.

64
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,200
Mi Lan, listen to me.

65
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:18,140
Shen is the most upright person
I've ever known.

66
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,070
He will be fine.

67
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,090
Don't worry about him.

68
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,320
Aren't you worried about him?

69
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,920
Of course, I am.

70
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,070
No one cares for him more than I do.

71
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,190
Are you refusing to help him?

72
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,470
Please be reasonable.

73
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,270
Clearly, you're overreacting.

74
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,270
But he's in danger.

75
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,300
Dr. Situ,
the patient is losing blood rapidly

76
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,460
and the blood pressure is dropping.

77
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,820
Administer
the blood transfusion immediately.

78
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,240
Mi Lan,

79
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,510
I have more urgent patients to attend to.

80
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,830
Shen doesn't need anyone's help.

81
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,880
All he needs is blood.

82
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,690
Wait for me.

83
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,270
Get the reporters here now.

84
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:49,800
Okay.

85
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,360
Help...

86
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,640
Help me.

87
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,470
Save... Save me.

88
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,120
Help...

89
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,830
You had it hard in this life.

90
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,800
But I hope you'll find a good family
in the next.

91
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,120
Mr. Zhang.

92
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,880
Carry those suitcases to the car.

93
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,150
Coming.

94
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,390
And don't forget the other two.

95
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:42,150
All right.

96
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,240
Sort them out by color.

97
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,080
Mi, we should leave.

98
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,590
We'll miss the train if we don't leave.

99
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,030
Master.

100
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:52,710
Madam.

101
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,910
Miss Mi is here.

102
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:06,200
Mi Lan, it's probably for the best

103
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,380
that your mother has left.

104
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,180
At least, no one will hit you anymore.

105
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,240
Is someone taking care of you?

106
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,320
Don't worry.

107
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,590
I'll make sure

108
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,560
the living expenses are sent regularly.

109
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,470
Are you leaving?

110
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,590
We're escaping to stay in the south
for now.

111
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:27,880
All this chaos

112
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,030
and wild animals attacking people

113
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,470
is causing panic.

114
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,320
Your brother is still a baby.

115
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,080
I understand.

116
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,940
How about

117
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,080
you leave with us?

118
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,230
Mr. Li, you can't
continue doing this anymore.

119
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,910
If you keep tormenting him like this...

120
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,470
This is Shen Zhiheng
we're talking about.

121
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,040
What will happen next?

122
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,630
I'm not feeling well.

123
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,590
I need to see my personal doctor.

124
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,800
Mr. Shen, no problem.

125
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,680
No.

126
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,630
Mr. Li, calm down.

127
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,990
Seeing a personal doctor is no big deal.

128
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,800
Smell the place. I...

129
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,390
I can't stand it.
Let him see his doctor.

130
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,320
In your dreams.

131
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,230
Mr. Li.

132
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:30,990
What's the matter?

133
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,430
There are people
from Haidong Daily outside

134
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,560
protesting our illegal detention of Shen Zhiheng.

135
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,990
The press is protesting. It's...

136
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,830
Unlawful detention!

137
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,200
Release Mr. Shen!

138
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:43,800
What's going on here?

139
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,380
It seems they've detained Shen Zhiheng.

140
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,980
Is it Mr. Shen who donated a large sum
during the locust plague?

141
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,470
He's a truly good person.

142
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,230
Exactly.

143
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,690
- Release Mr. Shen!
- Release Mr. Shen!

144
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,190
- Unlawful detention!
- Unlawful detention!

145
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,620
- Unlawful detention!
- Unlawful detention!

146
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,940
- Release Mr. Shen!
- Release Mr. Shen!

147
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,160
- Release him!
- Release him!

148
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:00,040
Unlawful detention!

149
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,920
Everyone, please calm down!
Don't make a fuss!

150
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,400
Mr. Shen is completely innocent
and breaks no law.

151
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,350
On what grounds are you detaining
him illegally?

152
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,750
Exactly!

153
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,230
Everyone, listen!

154
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,520
- Release him!
- Release him!

155
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,630
We only asked Mr. Shen to come in
for a few questions.

156
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,680
We never intended
to detain him illegally.

157
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,990
You've already held him

158
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,200
for over twenty-four hours!

159
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,520
Why haven't you released him yet?

160
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:24,920
Release Mr. Shen!

161
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,620
- Unlawful detention!
- Unlawful detention!

162
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,700
Unlawful detention!

163
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,590
Can you release him now?

164
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,520
We really can't handle this anymore.

165
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,950
Those outside are all journalists.

166
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,870
If they write some articles
and publish more papers,

167
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,920
I won't be able to explain this
to the higher-ups.

168
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,680
Are they from Haidong Daily?

169
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,400
Yes.

170
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,350
But they are just
a group of rioters to me.

171
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,200
Chief Lin, aren't you going to arrest them?

172
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,200
They didn't fire any guns or cannons.

173
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,800
Arresting them will only stir up
public anger.

174
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,470
Is that so?

175
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,350
Sheng.

176
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:04,800
Understood.

177
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:07,800
Wait...

178
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,990
It's been over twenty-four hours.

179
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,350
The time is already up.

180
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,810
Why haven't they released him yet?

181
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:23,750
That's the scum!

182
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,830
Release him!

183
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:25,440
Open the gates.

184
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,230
Open the gates.

185
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,750
You two are in cahoots
and you still claim to be...

186
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,480
What are you doing?

187
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,590
I'm going to fight you head-on!

188
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:08,040
Chief Lin, can we arrest them now?

189
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,520
Come, let's arrest them.

190
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,990
Shameless.

191
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,830
That's because you're not cooperating
with me.

192
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,590
So long you cooperate with me,

193
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,160
I guarantee I won't hurt

194
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,710
those from Haidong Daily.

195
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,160
What do you say?

196
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,590
So do you still want
to see your personal doctor?

197
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,320
Can you help Mr. Shen?

198
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,200
He doesn't even need my help.

199
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,520
With his influence,

200
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,950
the police can't do anything to him.

201
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,520
Then can you think of a way
to get him out of there?

202
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,280
Dear, we should leave now.

203
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,190
We'll miss the train
if we don't leave now.

204
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,800
You can't leave.

205
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:00,350
Think of a way to help Mr. Shen.

206
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,950
Just mind your business.

207
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,350
- Why are you meddling in his affairs?
- I have to.

208
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:06,400
What?

209
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,560
When did you two get involved
with each other?

210
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,710
I don't know any other wealthy people
in Haidong.

211
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,800
You're the only one I know.

212
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,750
Are we leaving or not?

213
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,830
Are we?

214
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,200
Can't you see I'm talking
to my daughter?

215
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,160
I understand.

216
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,280
I just remembered something.

217
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,470
I know someone from the police station.

218
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,590
I'll make a call to ask him.

219
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,400
You can stop grabbing my hand.
I need to make the call.

220
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,320
Hello.

221
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,520
Is this Chief Wang speaking?

222
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,350
Yes, speaking.

223
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,750
It's me, Mi.

224
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,110
I'd like to ask you something.

225
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,590
Was Shen Zhiheng captured by you?

226
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,350
No.

227
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,790
He's being held by Li Yingliang
at the police station in Annan District.

228
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,760
That area is within the influence
of the Haidong Army.

229
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,160
Not under the Xia District's jurisdiction.

230
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,080
Li Yingliang?

231
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,520
Mi, you shouldn't get involved.

232
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,870
No one can help him.

233
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:07,990
Oh, thank you very much.

234
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,520
I'll come by to visit another day.

235
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,080
All right.

236
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,830
Okay, see you.

237
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,040
Did you hear that?

238
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,990
He offended someone

239
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,400
and got arrested by Li Yingliang.

240
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,160
I have no way.

241
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,160
I can't help
because I have no connections.

242
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,200
Can you find a way?

243
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,590
How can I think of a way
when I don't know anyone?

244
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,280
Madam.

245
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,920
We must go.

246
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,990
It's very cold outside

247
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,630
and the baby keeps crying.

248
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,710
All right. Enough talking.

249
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,400
- The baby is crying.
- All right.

250
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,230
We'll miss the train.

251
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,110
I have to go now.

252
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,230
Or else we'll miss the train.

253
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:36,870
Enough talking.

254
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:37,870
All right.

255
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:38,400
Let's go.

256
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,950
Let go of my hand first.

257
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,240
Mi Lan, I'm going to miss my train.

258
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,380
Let go of my hand, okay?

259
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,920
I am going to be late.

260
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,870
Who does this child take after?

261
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,750
Go, you guys go along first.

262
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,350
Have you figured out a way?

263
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,750
What could I even come up with?

264
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,920
Take this money.

265
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,560
Stay safe.

266
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,750
Don't get involved with them.

267
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,320
This child is unbelievable.

268
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,230
Mi Lan, listen to me.

269
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,560
Shen doesn't need anyone's help.

270
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,830
All he needs is blood.

271
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,160
(Blood?)

272
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,470
(Where do I get blood?)

273
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,590
Are you saying Liang took
Shen Zhiheng captive?

274
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,160
Yes.

275
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,750
I may not agree

276
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,040
with Liang's approach.

277
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,720
But I can't do anything
about him.

278
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,110
I don't know what grudges

279
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,200
he has with Shen Zhiheng.

280
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,200
I also don't think
he will do me this favor.

281
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:40,990
You need to think carefully.

282
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,230
Do you really want my help?

283
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:45,750
Jingxue,

284
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,230
Shen is really important to me.

285
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,400
Other than you,

286
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,870
there's really no one else in Haidong

287
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:50,920
who can help me.

288
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,400
Also, Shen isn't in perfect health.

289
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,320
He needs regular medical check-ups.

290
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,470
I'm not asking too much.

291
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,440
I just need you to take me inside

292
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,750
and let me see him.

293
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,400
But didn't you say
you don't have any friends?

294
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,870
He's not just a friend.

295
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,680
He's my family, the closest person
to me in the world.

296
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:11,800
Jingxue,

297
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,470
please help me with this once.

298
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,400
We want to file an appeal!

299
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,990
- Release him! Release him!
- Shut up!

300
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,320
Shut up!

301
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:28,560
Mr. Shen.

302
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,920
If you don't want your employees

303
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,470
to know that you came back to life

304
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,630
and attempted to murder me
at Dongya Restaurant,

305
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,520
you'd better watch your manners.

306
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,230
Even if you're unhappy with me,

307
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,630
you need to bear with it
for your employees' safety.

308
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,680
What are you doing?

309
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,660
- Mr. Shen.
- Let him go!

310
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,680
Let go of him!

311
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,590
Put down your gun.

312
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,440
Mr. Shen,

313
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,110
I know it's easy for you
to kill me right now.

314
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,180
But you should think twice.

315
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:01,320
Mr. Shen, please reconsider this.

316
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:04,910
Mr. Li.

317
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:07,560
Mr. Li, are you all right?

318
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,670
See if the reporters are here.

319
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,720
Put down your weapons.

320
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:27,560
Chief Lin,

321
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,480
the rioters who caused the commotion
are Shen Zhiheng's employees.

322
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,280
Can the employer escape responsibility
when the employees cause trouble?

323
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,800
Besides, this person assaulted me

324
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,910
in front of everyone.

325
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,590
Shouldn't I file another report?

326
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,240
Excuse me, Chief.

327
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,430
Li Yingliang is taking personal revenge

328
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,080
because Haidong Daily offended him.

329
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,190
Anyone with a conscience knows

330
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:55,150
what kind of person Mr. Shen truly is.

331
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,560
He has genuinely saved many lives

332
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,140
and given hope to countless people
in Haidong.

333
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,830
How can you treat him so disgracefully?

334
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:01,960
That's right!

335
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:03,760
- Release Mr. Shen!
- Release him!

336
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,560
Quiet!

337
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,110
Silence!

338
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,320
- Release him!
- Release him!

339
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:08,910
Shut up!

340
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,630
Mr. Li, they are right.

341
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,240
Shen Zhiheng has done so much charity.

342
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,430
Haidong Daily has countless supporters.

343
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:19,430
If you keep this up,
it could get really bad.

344
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:23,720
- Release him!
- Release him!

345
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,480
Shut up!

346
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:31,080
- Release him!
- Release him!

347
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:35,560
This way.

348
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,060
(Jin Mansion)

349
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,760
(Annan District Police Station, Haidong)

350
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,960
(Annan District Chief Inspector
of the Police Department)

351
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,290
Miss Jin, what are you doing here?

352
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,320
I've been worried
about your injury every day.

353
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,560
But you don't even tell me
you're all better.

354
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,150
Instead,
you come to this stinky police station.

355
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,040
Shen, are you all right?

356
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,870
How did you get hurt again?

357
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,760
Miss Jin, I'm at work now.

358
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,070
You shouldn't be in a place like this.

359
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,630
Jingxue.

360
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:28,320
Liang, I came today

361
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,000
to plead for Shen Zhiheng.

362
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,180
Miss Jin, you've come
to the wrong person.

363
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,990
I'm not the one
who arrested Shen Zhiheng.

364
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,980
I'm the one who reported him.

365
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,320
You reported him?

366
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,080
What did you report him for?

367
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,190
You saw it at the hospital
a few days ago.

368
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,110
He did it to me.

369
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,150
How could you not tell me
about such a big issue?

370
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,350
And you.

371
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:52,830
You knew about it all along.

372
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,720
Yet, you want me to plead for him?

373
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,830
Well done! He deserved to be arrested.

374
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,150
Jingxue,
it's a misunderstanding.

375
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,100
Don't speak to me.

376
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,260
I'll explain the whole story
to you later.

377
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,280
Annan District Police Station.

378
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,590
I am the Commissioner of Xia District.

379
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,390
Oh, the Commissioner of Xia District?

380
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,390
Commissioner, hello.

381
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,720
I heard you've detained Shen Zhiheng

382
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,830
and the employees of Haidong Daily.

383
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,420
Why are you arresting the people
from the Xia District?

384
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,590
They injured people
from the Annan District.

385
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,430
That's not for you to handle.

386
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,040
Release them!

387
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,040
Yes, sir.

388
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,830
Mr. Li, that was the Commissioner
of Xia District.

389
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,290
This is becoming a big issue.
I can't handle it here.

390
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,560
Li Yingliang,

391
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,000
the Commissioner has called.

392
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,090
Why aren't you releasing him yet?

393
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:49,760
Shut up!

394
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,430
What are you doing?

395
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,320
- Shut up!
- Release him!

396
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,320
Liang, step back for now.

397
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,190
If the Commissioner
of Xia District gets involved,

398
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,630
this will blow up even more.

399
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,590
Do you think I'll let him go just
as what you say?

400
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,690
Even if the King of Heaven comes,
I won't release him!

401
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,150
This is not a place for you.

402
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,760
Go back to where you came from!

403
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,190
How dare you treat her this way?

404
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,790
I'll stand my ground no matter what.

405
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,910
No one is leaving!

406
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:15,760
Jingxue.

407
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,480
Jingxue, wait for me.

408
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,280
Shen Zhiheng,

409
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,520
I'll stick with you through this.

410
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,560
Jingxue, don't leave yet.

411
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,350
Situ Weilian, you lied to me.

412
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,720
I did not lie to you, Jingxue.

413
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,190
I don't find you trustworthy anymore.

414
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:32,870
I...

415
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,630
Miss Mi, we have arrived.

416
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,520
Okay.

417
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,350
Thank you.

418
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,040
Thank you, miss.

419
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:45,830
Be careful.

420
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:50,830
Miss,

421
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,430
what business do you have here?

422
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:54,240
Is this
the Annan District Police Station?

423
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,240
Yes.

424
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,150
I'll file a report.

425
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,190
File a report?

426
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,190
File what?

427
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,720
Are you going to make me
stand outside and talk?

428
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,090
Then come inside with me.

429
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,190
Open the gate.

430
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,080
Chief,

431
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,490
this lady is here to file a report.

432
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,040
Miss Mi?

433
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,110
Miss Mi, what are you doing here?

434
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,150
I want to file a report.

435
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:34,240
File a report?

436
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,790
Come if you want to file a report.

437
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,290
- Follow me.
- Over here.

438
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:46,530
What's the matter?

439
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:47,910
Do you know her?

440
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,590
So tell me what happened.

441
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,080
I was violated.

442
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,760
Who bullied you? Tell me,

443
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,870
and I'll make them pay.

444
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,110
It was Shen Zhiheng,

445
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,280
the one who owns Haidong Daily.

446
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:44,870
Mi Lan.

447
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,520
Stop messing around.

448
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,320
That's the voice.

449
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,720
I recognize it.

450
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,720
That day, we were celebrating
my brother's full-month ceremony.

451
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,190
My mother got mad and kicked me out.

452
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,350
I was walking alone on the street.

453
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,830
He suddenly appeared

454
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,830
and charged at me
like he was out of control.

455
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:26,430
(He didn't fall in love with her
but he owes her.)

456
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,430
(Could it really be
because he violated Mi Lan?)

457
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,190
Uncle Li,

458
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,590
you saved me that day.

459
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,630
Do you remember?

460
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,430
You took me home.

461
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:43,720
Heavens...

462
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,910
The renowned Shen Zhiheng

463
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:48,150
actually did something so inhumane.

464
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:49,830
How could a grown man

465
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:52,160
do this to such a young blind girl?

466
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,110
She must be mistaken!

467
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,870
It's impossible.
This is definitely slander!

468
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:55,830
Quiet!

469
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,280
Keep it down!

470
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,670
Mr. Shen is not that kind of person.

471
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,150
How did he lose control?

472
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,830
I'm blind, so I couldn't see.

473
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:05,240
He suddenly charged at me.

474
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:08,480
It seemed like he was bleeding a lot.

475
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,630
He even hit me.

476
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:11,760
But

477
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,800
didn't you say
that it was your mother who hit you?

478
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,800
It was him who hit me.

479
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,560
I was so scared that day

480
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,080
so I lied and said it was my mother.

481
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,480
I only dared to report it now

482
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,560
because I heard he was locked up.

483
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,840
Are you sure

484
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,390
it was Shen Zhiheng,
the owner of Haidong Daily?

485
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,670
I wonder what's going on.

486
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:46,180
I'm curious too.

487
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,150
- Who knows?
- Let's go.

488
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:47,870
Let's go.

489
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,040
I hope it's a big scoop.

490
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,690
Then there's hope
for this month's bonus.

491
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:01,150
I couldn't recognize him
just by his voice.

492
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,390
That day,

493
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,870
I touched his face

494
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:07,190
while struggling.

495
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,560
If

496
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,000
I could touch him again,

497
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,040
I'd be able to confirm.

498
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,080
That person is in the cell here.

499
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:32,040
I'll take you over so you can check
to see if it's him.

508

Shen Zhiheng,
the owner of Haidong Daily,

509
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:30,350
a renowned media tycoon,

510
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,140
is not only accused of assaulting me
but also of violating a blind girl.

511
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,830
Now, she has come forward to report him.

512

Mr. Shen, I've come to rescue you.

520
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,880
Hurry. What's going on here?

521
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,760
They're kissing.

522
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,670
It's a big scoop.

523
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,430
Get it on camera.

What's happening here?

526
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,280
Mi Lan, are you trying to trick me?

527
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,920
I mistook him for someone else.

528
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,080
It's not him.

529
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,000
Mi Lan.

530
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,390
I knew Mr. Shen couldn't be
that kind of person.

531
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:40,080
Open the door.

532
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,790
Superintendent Chi is here.

533
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,670
- Oh, hello.
- Superintendent Chi.

534
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:50,910
- Hello.
- Superintendent Chi.

535
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:51,870
Hello.

536
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,570
- Superintendent Chi.
- Hello.

537
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:54,320
Superintendent Chi.

538
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,280
- Superintendent Chi.
- Hello.

539
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:58,520
Superintendent Chi.

540
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,000
All right.

541
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,760
Mr. Shen,

542
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:07,630
I apologize for not keeping
my subordinate in check

543
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:08,870
and causing you such trouble.

544
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,560
Release him now.

545
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:16,910
Mr. Shen.

546
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:21,430
Li Yingliang is indeed one
of your favorite aides.

547
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,080
Last time, you chased a car for him.

548
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,430
Now, you're making amends for him.

549
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,480
What about next time?

550
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,870
Next time?

551
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:32,750
There won't be a next time.

552
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:34,630
Sir,

553
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,110
you saw Mr. Shen injured me

554
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,550
at Dongya Restaurant with your own eyes.

555
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,280
Mr. Shen is one
of the most distinguished people

556
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,150
in Haidong City.

557
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:46,350
So what if Mr. Shen hit you?

558
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:48,890
Being injured is actually
a blessing for you. Just accept it.

559
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,520
Just apologize to him
and it's all settled.

560
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,870
Mr. Shen, I'm sorry.

561
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,040
Please forgive me.

562
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,520
You can punish me however you want.

563
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,350
Can I really punish him

564
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,390
however I want?

565
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:16,720
Just kidding. Please calm down.

566
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,910
This isn't a joke.

567
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:22,350
Returning favors, right?

568
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,320
I'll personally visit

569
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,480
and properly thank Mr. Li.

570
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,080
Of course.

571
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,430
It's getting late.
So we'll be on our way now.

572
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,320
All right, take care.

573
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,830
That's easy.

574
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,620
Are you still not releasing them?

575
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:42,280
Release them all.

576
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,090
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

577
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,040
All right.

578
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:39,720
I...

579
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,660
I told you to investigate Shen Zhiheng,

580
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,670
not to create chaos.

581
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,830
I've only been away from Haidong
for a few days.

582
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,280
Now the newspapers are talking

583
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,630
about how foolish you are

584
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,670
and how I instigate you

585
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:12,760
behind the scenes.

586
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,190
I gave you some face
at the police station earlier.

587
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,080
But you let me down tremendously.

588
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:23,040
Sir, this time was really close.

589
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,040
And the result?

590
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,960
Where's the evidence?

591
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:29,390
How did Shen Zhiheng leave
the police station?

592
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,870
He left unharmed and intact,

593
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,430
with the public on his side.

594
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,280
You said you were close to getting him?

595
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,280
You almost lost it just by a hair.

596
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,280
You messed up something so simple.

597
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:48,080
Listen, the Mu family has agreed to my request.

598
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:50,520
Miss Mu will come
to Haidong immediately to assist us.

599
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,110
If you lose Shen Zhiheng

600
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,760
when Miss Mu arrives,

601
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,350
I'll have you executed.

602
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,670
Sir, Miss Mu is...

603
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:21,720
She's the 32nd generation heir
of the Mu family.

604
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:24,320
She volunteered to come to Haidong

605
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,560
after hearing about Shen Zhiheng.

606
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:28,390
Listen.

607
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,040
Don't provoke Shen Zhiheng
during this time.

608
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,480
Make sure to prepare well
for Miss Mu's arrival.

609
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,080
Do you hear me?

610
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:40,240
Yes, sir.

611
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,760
Mi Lan, how did you come up
with this plan?

612
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,000
Weilian said you could live
if you had blood.

613
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,390
But you were locked up.

614
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:51,720
I had to pretend
to report a case to get in

615
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,040
and try using my own blood.

616
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,150
That was really clever.

617
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,480
Mr. Shen?

618
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,270
Mr. Shen, are you okay?

619
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:21,560
Mi Lan, I was already at my limit
in the police station.

620
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,110
I might need to sleep for a few days.

621
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,040
You'll need to stay by my side.

622
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:31,190
When the servants come tomorrow,

623
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,110
ask them to find Weilian...

624
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,110
Okay.

625
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:34,980
To take over for you.

626
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,000
You're clever.

627
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,660
You can definitely do it.

628
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,660
Mr. Shen.

629
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,590
Mr. Shen.

630
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,110
Mr. Shen.

631
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,190
Mr. Shen.

632
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,560
Mr. Shen.

633
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,360
Mr. Shen.

634
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,150
Mr. Shen.

635
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,270
Mr. Shen.

636
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:30,150
I will keep watch over you.

637
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:53,480
I've liked him
since I was twelve years old.

638
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,150
Until now, my feelings have never changed.

639
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,400
You're so devoted to him.

640
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,590
But he treats you so coldly.

641
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:03,360
Is it worth it?

642
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,750
Weilian.

643
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,680
Put aside whether you deceived me today.

644
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,880
Let's talk about going
to the police station.

645
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:18,680
We've gotten along so well

646
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,270
because we haven't had
too many conflicting interests.

647
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,310
But now that you've come to ask for my help.

648
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:25,750
You should know

649
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,750
that once we cross this line,

650
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,830
there's no going back.

651
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:31,310
Do you understand?

652
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,710
That's why I say,

653
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,520
you really don't understand love.
