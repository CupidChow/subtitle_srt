1
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,890
(From Chronicles of
the Nine Domains of Taiping.)

2
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,740
(In the 970th Year
of the Chao Calendar,)

3
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,580
(shooting stars beyond the sky
were split into three.)

4
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,120
(They fell to the southwest area)

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,680
(into three families.)

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,060
(The three shards
granted them divine power.)

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,300
(However,
there were side effects as well.)

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,480
(The Wei family,
who obtained the Blood Amber Stone,)

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,220
(gained super speed and strength.)

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,920
(However, they will die
without the stone.)

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,380
(The Mu family, who obtained
the Fantasy Stone,)

12
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,840
(gained the power to control minds.)

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,680
(However, they will go berserk easily.)

14
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,660
(The Mo family, who obtained
the Profound Yang Stone,)

15
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,360
(needed to overcome ordeals)

16
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,380
(in order to gain
the strongest power of all.)

17
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,280
(Rumor has it
that gathering all three stones)

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,820
(will nullify their side effects.)

19
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,990
(Thus, the Three Families
have been in conflict)

20
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,320
(for the past millennium.)

21
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,220
(Shen Mansion)

22
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,560
(On the day
of the Shen family's tragedy,)

23
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,950
(I contracted a strange disease.)

24
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,430
(I could only survive
by consuming blood.)

25
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,840
(In order to protect me,)

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,430
(my grandmother kept migrating
and hid me in various places.)

27
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,350
(She stole chicken blood
so that I could get by.)

28
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,150
(I've traveled all around the world.)

29
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,480
(I was used to death and separation.)

30
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,680
(My desires lessened gradually.)

31
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,950
(My only desire)

32
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,950
(was to find her,)

33
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,280
(the person
who turned me into this monster.)

34
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,580
(I also wanted
to find my younger brother,)

35
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,510
(Shen Zhiqian.)

36
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,840
(In the long river of time,)

37
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:43,670
(my acquaintances have become
few and far between.)

38
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,230
(And I've traveled the world alone,)

39
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,560
(without any roots or causes.)

40
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,060
(Fantasy Stone)

41
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,540
(Profound Yang Stone)

42
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,780
(Blood Amber Stone)

=Snow Fall=
=Episode 1=

44
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,220
(This drama is purely fictional.)

45
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,740
(Mi Mansion)

46
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,870
GM of Zhongxing Mining Bureau,

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,640
Mr. Wang Tieshan.

48
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,760
A cash gift of 500 yuan.

49
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,520
Chairman of Jixiang Flour Mill,

50
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,240
Mr. Ji Bowen.

51
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,240
One jade ruyi.

52
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,480
I already turned a blind eye

53
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,120
to your affairs.

54
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,390
And now, you actually brought

55
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,600
that wretch to my courtyard

56
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,390
and held a full-month celebration
for her son?

57
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,160
Everyone holds a party for their child
during their full-month celebration.

58
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,560
It's been tough on my eighth wife
all these years.

59
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,790
She had to swallow
her grievances in silence.

60
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,240
She said she would
use the full-month party

61
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,950
as an official ceremony for her child
to acknowledge you as her mother.

62
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,870
Mi Lan is just a girl.

63
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,070
And she's blind.

64
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,460
How would she be of any good to you
in any way?

65
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,430
Do you detest me just because

66
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,920
Mi Lan is blind?

67
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,680
It has nothing to do with that.

68
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,070
What has this got to do with Mi Lan?

69
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:49,800
Come back!

70
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,600
Where are you going?

71
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,240
How could you treat me like this?

72
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,160
How could you?

73
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,160
How could you treat me like this?

74
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,180
(Mi Mansion)

75
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,240
Mr. Shen.

76
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,360
Mr. Shen.

77
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,840
A pleasure to meet you.

78
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,680
I didn't expect

79
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,360
to see you here, Mr. Shen.

80
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,120
Everyone, long time no see.

81
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,480
Mr. Shen, you're the only person
in Haidong whom I'm impressed with.

82
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,600
You're the only person
who dares to criticize

83
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,280
Chi Shanying's tyrannical actions
on Haidong Daily.

84
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,950
Is he Shen Zhiheng?

85
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,800
That's Shen Zhiheng.

86
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,870
He's the owner of Haidong Daily.

87
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,390
I heard that he has a weird fetish.

88
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,700
He waters his flowers with blood.

89
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,430
Is that true?

90
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,750
Our charity association

91
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,820
is very thankful for your contribution,

92
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,750
Mr. Shen.

93
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,630
I'm just doing my duty.

94
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,870
Owner of Haidong Daily,

95
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,600
Mr. Shen Zhiheng.

96
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,280
A cash gift of 1,000 yuan.

97
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,870
(Full Month Celebration)
Mr. Shen is so generous.

98
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,360
The show has begun.

99
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,310
Dear guests, please take your seats.

100
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,040
Are you Mr. Shen?

101
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,800
Hello, Mr. Shen.

102
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,360
I'm the chairman of
the Economic Development Committee, Li Yingliang.

103
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,310
I came here to make your acquaintance.

104
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,070
You can give us any price you like
as long as your newspaper doesn't go against us.

105
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,510
I'm...

106
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,430
Mr. Li.

107
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:47,950
Shen Zhiheng has arrived.

108
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,120
Should we get rid of him?

109
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,430
The superintendent wants him dead.

110
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,040
However, we can't afford
to create a commotion.

111
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,430
Of course,

112
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,280
if he knows what's good for him
and cooperates with us,

113
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,550
it'll be a happy ending

114
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,750
for everyone.

115
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,720
Let's go.

116
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,390
- Excellent!
- Excellent!

117
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,390
- Excellent!
- Excellent!

118
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,240
- Excellent!
- Excellent!

119
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,430
- Excellent!
- Excellent!

120
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,990
Mr. Li, your seat is over there.

121
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,390
Let me take you there.

122
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,040
Mr. Shen, here's a toast to you.

123
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,390
Thank you for your assistance.

124
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,190
Here.

125
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,750
Is this the guy Chi Shanying supported?

126
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,800
He didn't admit it.

127
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,050
He published a newspaper notice
and disassociated himself from him.

128
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:04,290
He has committed plenty of crimes
in Haidong all these years.

129
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,270
He extorted money from the public
and murdered people.

130
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,070
From a nobody, he became the chairman
of the committee in just three years.

131
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,280
He rose to his position by stepping on
the bodies of others.

132
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,800
He's dangerous.

133
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:14,920
Why don't scums like him

134
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,190
die earlier?

135
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,600
The world is unfair indeed.

136
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,680
Come. Let's drink.

137
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,870
Cheers. Come.

138
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,240
Where are you going?

139
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,100
Don't leave.

140
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,800
All of them are waiting for us.
Why are you doing this?

141
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,480
How could you do this to me?

142
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,920
How could you do this to me?

143
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,720
Stop it!

144
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,510
Your family is the same, right?

145
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,390
This is very common.

146
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,990
Let's drop the topic.

147
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,580
Here. Let's drink.

148
00:08:47,820 --> 00:09:00,000
♪Only to see enemy camps swarming
like ants and surging like tides♪

149
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,790
Mr. Mi.

150
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,750
Congratulations.

151
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,440
Excellent!

152
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,670
Sorry for the long wait.

153
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,600
Excellent.

154
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,270
Congratulations.

155
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,270
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

156
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,910
Everyone, I'm honored
to welcome you guys

157
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,600
to my humble shack.

158
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,510
I've done business for several decades.

159
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,510
Now, I only have one daughter.

160
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,440
And, she's partially disabled.

161
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,870
There's no one to inherit my assets.

162
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,030
But now, everything is great.

163
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,030
My eighth wife is capable.

164
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:32,990
She gave birth to a son.

165
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,120
Show him to everyone.

166
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,670
Congratulations.

167
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,720
Mr. Mi, you're successful.

168
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,910
Thank you.

169
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,030
Mr. Mi,

170
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,990
what happened to your face?

171
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,560
A stray cat wandered into
the second floor just now.

172
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,670
I chased it away.

173
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,480
But it scratched me.

174
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,840
I don't think a stray cat did that.

175
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,840
It looks like the work of a lioness!

176
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,840
That's right.

177
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,790
You may leave with our child.

178
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:56,840
Come.

179
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,750
Let me offer you all a toast.

180
00:09:58,990 --> 00:09:59,630
Come.

181
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,560
Thank you for coming.

182
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,840
- Come.
- Thank you.

183
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,440
- Congratulations, Mr. Mi.
- Thank you so much.

184
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,670
- Congratulations, Mr. Mi.
- Thank you so much.

185
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,540
- Alright.
- Congratulations, Mr. Mi.

186
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,440
Please enjoy your meal.

187
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:08,910
Cheers.

188
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,910
- All right!
- Come.

189
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,580
Bottoms up.

190
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,320
Have a seat.

191
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,600
Everyone, sit down.

192
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:15,990
Come.

193
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,120
Alright.

194
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,150
Eat up. Enjoy your meal.

195
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,480
Come.

196
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,670
Excellent.

197
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,870
Come.

198
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,060
Mi Lan!

199
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,240
Why did I give birth to a jinx like you?

200
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,630
Get up!

201
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,440
I shouldn't have
given birth to you at all!

202
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,150
You're such a burden!

203
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,240
You're a living burden!

204
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:44,790
I'll kill you!

205
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,630
You're the reason

206
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,600
I'm in this state!

207
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,220
Here.

208
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,980
Cheers.

209
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,620
Come.

210
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,560
- Fill up his cup.
- Let's drink.

211
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,380
Let's drink.

212
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,480
Come. Let's continue.

213
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:16,750
Get up!

214
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,630
Get up!

215
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,030
You jinx!

216
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,870
Harbinger of misfortune!

217
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,630
Do you and that wretched father of yours

218
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,670
have no conscience at all?

219
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,200
I'll kill you!

220
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,360
I'll kill you!

221
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,080
You guys have no conscience at all!

222
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,200
You jinx!

223
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,390
Harbinger of misfortune!

224
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,440
Get up!

225
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,840
You better get up!

226
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,150
Which scoundrel did this?

227
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,510
Someone!

228
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,030
Madam!

229
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,030
You're bleeding!

230
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,790
You have to get your wound dressed!

231
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,200
Hurry!

232
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,560
Mr. Shen. I'm the chairman of
the Economic Development Committee,

233
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,320
Li Yingliang.

234
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,080
Isn't this a new car?

235
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,870
Why is it broken?

236
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,390
(Haidong Army HQ)

237
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:23,790
Has Shen Zhiheng agreed
to cooperate with us?

238
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,510
Superintendent Chi,

239
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,960
he didn't give me a chance
to speak with him.

240
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,080
Therefore, I'm proceeding
with our plan.

241
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,560
Alright.

242
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,120
Go and check it out.

243
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,480
Who sent you guys here?

244
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,360
Who sent you guys here?

245
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,630
Who was it?

246
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,990
There were gunshots
around this area, right?

247
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,710
Yeah.

248
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,120
There's no one nearby.

249
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,710
Let's check the vicinity.

250
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,630
Mr. Li, I'm Guisheng.

251
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:52,760
Come in.

252
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,360
Why are you back only now?

253
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,140
The car light was broken.

254
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,790
And the front of the car
was covered with blood.

255
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,730
I cleaned it before returning it
to the parking lot.

256
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,760
And, Mr. Li,

257
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,120
I came back alone.

258
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,760
Where are the two of them?

259
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,560
Dead.

260
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,910
Dead?

261
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:11,990
Did Shen Zhiheng bring reinforcements?

262
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,320
Everything was according to plan.

263
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,670
Shen Zhiheng did go home alone.

264
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,050
His car broke down
on his way home as well.

265
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,600
When we caught up to him,
he was walking alone on the street.

266
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,320
If so, how did the two of them die?

267
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,390
Mr. Li, you see,

268
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:26,870
I think the incident

269
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,150
was kind of spooky.

270
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,470
I crashed into him with the car.

271
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,760
I even ran over him.

272
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:33,710
He was shot in the forehead as well.

273
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,430
Even so, he rose and
killed the two of them.

274
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,120
Were you mistaken?

275
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,600
How could he get up and kill them

276
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,080
when he was seriously wounded?

277
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,600
I wasn't mistaken.

278
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:48,840
I don't care about anything else.

279
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,840
I just want to know

280
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,560
if Shen Zhiheng is dead or not.

281
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,870
He's definitely dead.

282
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,280
With the way he died,
it'll be difficult to collect his body.

283
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,280
It's good as long as he's dead.

284
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:09,950
It's best if he dies a terrible death.

285
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:13,280
It can remind people about the consequences
of going against us.

286
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:14,760
Go and rest now.

287
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,670
You should rest too.

288
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,390
Go now.

289
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,390
Mr. Shen.

290
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,390
Logically speaking,

291
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,800
I should collect your body for you.

292
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:05,840
Hello?

293
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,490
Is this the police station?

294
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,320
Captain Li!

295
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,350
Mr. Li wants you
to head there immediately!

296
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,760
Were you looking for me?

297
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,190
Did you lie to me?

298
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,630
No, I didn't.

299
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,430
Mr. Li, why would I lie to you?

300
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:24,560
Where's his body if he's dead?

301
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,360
Who do you mean?

302
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,950
Who else? It's Shen Zhiheng!

303
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,870
That's impossible!

304
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,630
Didn't you alert the cops when you left?

305
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:30,430
I did.

306
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,120
The police siren was so loud

307
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,630
that I thought it was next to me.

308
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,600
The place where we killed him,
not mentioning people,

309
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,320
didn't even have
any stray animals nearby.

310
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,000
Shen Zhiheng is definitely dead.

311
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,230
I saw him dying myself.

312
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:42,120
I ran over him three times.

313
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,600
I'm not lying.

314
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,430
Shen Zhiheng is definitely dead!

315
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,360
I know you won't lie to me.

316
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,360
But now, his body is missing.

317
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,040
How can I give
Superintendent Chi an account?

318
00:21:58,530 --> 00:21:59,710
I'll look for his body right now.

319
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,840
Find him no matter
if he's dead or alive!

320
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,950
Understood!

321
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,600
(Everything will finally end)

322
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,120
(after tonight.)

323
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,280
(Where did his body go?)

324
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,840
(Where shall I die?)

325
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,320
It smells like something's burning.

326
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,630
No one should find out if I die here.

327
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,710
Who's there?

328
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,280
Who's there?

329
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,040
Don't come near me.

330
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,230
Such a thick stench of blood.

331
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,000
Are you blind?

332
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:12,950
Are you injured?

333
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:14,560
Yes.

334
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,840
I'm injured.

335
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:20,710
Are you okay?

336
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,000
I'm fine.

337
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,000
Someone is pursuing me.

338
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:28,360
I can't go anywhere right now.

339
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:30,080
Can you do me a favor?

340
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,430
Call my friend for me.

341
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,080
He has a way to save me.

342
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:36,710
You...

343
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,120
Are you seeking help from me?

344
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:45,560
I think you're the only person here
right now.

345
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,430
It's a shame that I'm blind.

346
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,190
I can't help you out.

347
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,710
At least you're better than me.

348
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,840
I can't even move now.

349
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:59,150
You're full of life

350
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,320
while I'm almost dead.

351
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:09,040
I'm here to seek death.

352
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,710
If so,

353
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,040
can you please not die for now?

354
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:27,470
What?

355
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,390
I mean,

356
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,120
can you save me first?

357
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,870
Can you put your death

358
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,470
aside for now?

359
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,910
You...

360
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,280
You need me to save you?

361
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:43,910
Yes.

362
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,950
I need you,

363
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:48,120
young lady.

364
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:57,870
Alright.

365
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,390
Do you know where Keats Hospital is?

366
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:07,870
I don't.

367
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:09,760
Usually, the number of Keats Hospital

368
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,760
is listed in standard phone books.

369
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,950
Call them

370
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,320
and look for a doctor
called Situ Weilian.

371
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,360
Tell him that I'm here.

372
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,660
There are only
a few abandoned temples in Haidong.

373
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,430
I'm sure he can find me.

374
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:22,390
Remember,

375
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,040
don't tell anyone about this.

376
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:31,840
You must keep it a secret.

377
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,150
If someone finds me before Situ Weilian,

378
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,080
I'll be dead.

379
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:40,800
You mustn't tell anyone about me

380
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,520
unless it's Weilian.

381
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:46,150
If not, I'll die too.

382
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:53,190
So, are you just going to lie here?

383
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,520
My legs are broken.

384
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,470
I can't walk.

385
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,800
What's your name?

386
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,280
My name is Mi Lan.

387
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,000
Thank you,

388
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,630
Miss Mi Lan.

389
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,080
Don't worry.

390
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,560
I'll definitely call your friend.

391
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,150
Please don't freeze to death,

392
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,150
Mr. Shen.

393
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:29,760
Miss,

394
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:31,470
why are you walking on the street alone?

395
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:32,150
Are you lost?

396
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,360
I was planning to go home.

397
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,120
Where do you live? I'll send you home.

398
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,320
Young girl, you can't see, huh?

399
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,910
Don't worry. I'm not a crook.

400
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:58,910
Where do you live?

401
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,040
I'll send you home.

402
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,120
I live in Mi Mansion.

403
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,520
Are you one of his maidservants?

404
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,360
He's my father.

405
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,760
You're Miss Mi?

406
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:10,600
Sorry about that.

407
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,520
I was just shocked.

408
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,320
I didn't expect to see you
in a place like this.

409
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,190
My name is Li Yingliang.

410
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,150
I'm considered one
of your father's acquaintances.

411
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,280
I just came from your family banquet.

412
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:23,600
Hello, Mr. Li.

413
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,670
Miss Mi, why are you

414
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,490
walking alone on the streets
at midnight?

415
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,760
And, what's with the wound on your face?

416
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,080
I...

417
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,600
My mother gave me a beating.

418
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,710
I ran out because I couldn't take it.

419
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,570
If so, why did she give you a beating?

420
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,690
Did you do something wrong?

421
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,760
I didn't do anything wrong.

422
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,120
She was just upset that Dad held
a full-month party for my half-brother.

423
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,080
You shouldn't do this in the future.

424
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,390
It's dangerous out here.

425
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:54,230
What if a crook abducted you
and sold you off?

426
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,230
Even if there's no crook,
the weather is cold.

427
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:57,800
You'll freeze out here.

428
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,000
Okay.

429
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,320
Thank you, Mr. Li.

430
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,320
Get in. I'll send you home.

431
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:35,740
(Mi Mansion)

432
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:38,840
Miss Mi, we're here.

433
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,520
Thank you, Mr. Li.

434
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,800
Miss Mi.

435
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,280
You don't need to call me that.

436
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,870
I'm only a few years older than you.

437
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,600
Alright.

438
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:52,000
Goodbye, Mr. Li.

439
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,360
Miss Mi.

440
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,470
Thank you.

441
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,800
Miss Mi,

442
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,710
you scared me.

443
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,270
It's snowy outside.

444
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:11,190
How could you go outside alone?

445
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,220
(Mi Mansion)

446
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,150
Madam Zhang,

447
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:24,290
are there doctors working
in the hospital at night?

448
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,560
Miss Mi,

449
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:26,960
do you know what time is it?

450
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,880
Where can we get a doctor now?

451
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,880
If Madam finds out,

452
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,120
she'll scold us again.

453
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:37,080
Later, I'll clean your wound
and apply some ointment on it.

454
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:40,080
Come. You should wash up.

455
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,790
Try and see if the temperature is right.

456
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:48,830
Yeah.

457
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,520
Alright. Take your time.

458
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,880
I'll lay your bed for you.
