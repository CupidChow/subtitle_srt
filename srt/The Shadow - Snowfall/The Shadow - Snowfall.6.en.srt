=Episode 6=

3
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,040
(This drama is purely fictional.)

4
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,720
Are you really too idle?

5
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,420
You don't like him bothering Mi Lan.

6
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,570
Why don't you just kill him
and be done with it?

7
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,720
Why all this fuss?

8
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,920
I'm no match for God.

9
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,690
God forbids me from being a human.

10
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,600
Fighting human

11
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:11,670
requires human methods.

12
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,670
Besides,

13
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,390
I find

14
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,880
Li Yingliang interesting.

15
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,160
Wait for me in the car.

16
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,200
Mr. Shen.

17
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,390
What a rare guest.

18
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:03,880
Mr. Li.

19
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,990
Aren't you going to invite me in?

20
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,600
I'd have it no other way.

21
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,080
Mr. Shen, this way, please.

22
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,110
I came prepared this time.

23
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,600
After you go in,

24
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,790
I'll kill you if you play any tricks.

25
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:23,040
Do you need these people
if you want to kill me?

26
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,080
Mr. Shen, please.

27
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,640
So this guy is Li Yingliang.

28
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,230
He's nothing.

29
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,950
Mr. Shen, I'm pleasantly surprised

30
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,390
that you took the time to come today.

31
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,200
I thought you resented me.

32
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,950
I didn't get a chance to make peace
and clear up the misunderstanding.

33
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,390
Making peace or not is between us.

34
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,480
You shouldn't have
encouraged Miss Mi to persuade me.

35
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,360
She's young and has trouble moving around.

36
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,440
That's taking advantage of her, isn't it?

37
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,000
Are you here to question me?

38
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,200
Mr. Shen.

39
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,240
It's rare for us to sit here
and talk calmly.

40
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,830
I've done something cruel to you.

41
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,390
You didn't spare me either.

42
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,390
You're lucky you're not dead.

43
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,120
I'm lucky I didn't die.

44
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,000
God has arranged for us
to sit here and talk.

45
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,560
I think we should just accept

46
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,830
and cherish this opportunity.

47
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,350
You've seen my attitude these days.

48
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,440
I really tried to get close to you,

49
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,320
but you didn't give me the chance.

50
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,510
I had no choice but to go to Miss Mi.

51
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,950
I know Miss Mi is important to you.

52
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,150
She saved you.

53
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:05,320
I just wanted Miss Mi
to pass you a message for me.

54
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,270
I didn't mean to intimidate
or threaten you in any way.

55
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,070
Besides, why should I scare a little girl?

56
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,320
You got it wrong.

57
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,470
It's not that she saved me.

58
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,150
I saved her.

59
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:22,630
Without me, she would have died
in the hospital.

60
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,150
You're right.

61
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,570
She would have died
if you hadn't taken care of her.

62
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,800
And if she hadn't saved you that night,

63
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,920
you could have survived too, right?

64
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,000
Don't get me wrong.

65
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,710
I'm just being honest.

66
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,560
I meant no harm.

67
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:51,880
Mr. Shen.

68
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,560
Can you tell me if you...

69
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,950
Why you...

70
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,120
What I'm saying is...

71
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,880
Logically speaking,

72
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,120
you should be dead that night.

73
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:13,000
But how did you come back safe and sound

74
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,470
after vanishing for ten days?

75
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,470
You didn't die.

76
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,560
Why?

77
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,510
Do you want to know why?

78
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,510
I swear what you tell me today

79
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,190
will be kept strictly confidential.

80
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,880
If I violate this oath,

81
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,880
I will be struck by lightning,
have no children,

82
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,800
go to hell, and never be reincarnated.

83
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,470
How could Mr. Li
curse himself like this?

84
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,920
Mr. Shen, don't get me wrong.

85
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,800
There's no ambush here.

86
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,630
They all obey my orders.

87
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,760
Actually, I'm a monster.

88
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,150
No.

89
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,800
Mr. Shen, can you stop messing with me?

90
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,470
I even swore a solemn oath.

91
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,760
You told me you're a monster.

92
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,510
You're too unserious.

93
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,320
I'm really a monster.

94
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,470
Come to my house tonight
if you don't believe me.

95
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,470
I'll show you what I am.

96
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:31,390
I wouldn't dare.

97
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:39,000
It's a good thing to be cautious.

98
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,390
Better safe than sorry.

99
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,710
But don't worry.

100
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,390
You can get your promotion
while I make my money.

101
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,510
If we don't stand in each other's way,

102
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,800
I won't hurt you.

103
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,200
But if you can't control your curiosity,

104
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:58,360
don't blame me for being impulsive.

105
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,950
It doesn't matter who I am.

106
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:08,880
What matters is whether you can live well.

107
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,000
Mr. Shen, are you here to warn me today?

108
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,920
I'm not that kind.

109
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,270
I never give warnings.

110
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:27,030
If I warn you, won't you be wary?

111
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,320
I'm not that foolish.

112
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,040
Well... Mr. Shen.

113
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,920
Can I treat you to dinner?

114
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,110
It's late.

115
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,110
The time is just right.

116
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,630
I don't eat food.

117
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,040
I eat people.

118
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,110
Please escort me out.

119
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,350
Don't hold Mr. Li Hostage again.

120
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,160
Shut up.

121
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,860
Put the gun down.

122
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,440
What's your name?

123
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:03,990
My name is Li Guisheng.

124
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,690
What's the matter?

125
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,970
Come at me if you need anything.

126
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,950
I'll remember you.

127
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:09,750
Mr...

128
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,230
Mr. Shen.

129
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,040
I think we need to talk.

130
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,230
Superintendent Chi
would love to be your friend.

131
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,990
And I would love to...

132
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,110
Shut up!

133
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,590
Mr. Li.

134
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,560
Let's not see each other again
after today.

135
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,080
Otherwise...

136
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,680
I'll eat you up.

137
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,320
Scumbag.

138
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,040
How dare he scold you like that?

139
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:25,950
What's so weird about that?

140
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,320
He can even kill me.

141
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:36,870
Well...

142
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,590
Are we still following him?

143
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,520
Follow him?

144
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:46,870
Disperse.

145
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,710
What happened to you?

146
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,680
Help me come up with a solution.

147
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,230
Li Yingliang
discovered my relationship with her

148
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,520
and wants to go after her.

149
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,110
It's inconvenient for her
to go out and be seen now.

150
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,710
If she stays at home,

151
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,040
I'm afraid Mrs. Mi
will continue to abuse her.

152
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,320
I have a good idea.

153
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:26,220
(Shen Mansion)

154
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,680
No!

155
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,230
I won't do it.

156
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,800
- Don't run. Come back.
- Stop following me.

157
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,680
We're not done.

158
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,400
Stop following me.

159
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,560
One last bit.

160
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,680
Let me finish.

161
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:51,590
No.

162
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,680
- Last one. Stop.
- Stop.

163
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,180
You're an adult.
How can you be afraid of this?

164
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,630
You know, right?

165
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,680
You know I'm actually quite old.

166
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,830
It's fine. You look young.

167
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,280
After all, I'm a newspaper tycoon
and a Haidong dignitary.

168
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,950
I've been respectable
for over a hundred years.

169
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:09,400
How can you make me do such a thing?

170
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,350
Didn't you want a permanent solution?

171
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,040
Look at how good this is.

172
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,350
As humans, let's do it the way humans do it.

173
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,710
You'll look ugly,
but it will be good for Miss Mi.

174
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,470
But this is so ugly.

175
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:21,560
Stop nagging.

176
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:22,750
Or it'll be dawn soon.

177
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,390
Will you let me draw or not?

178
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,870
No way.

179
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,350
Mr. Shen, is it you?

180
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,470
I knew you would see me.

181
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,470
Did she hit you again?

182
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,320
She drank too much last night,

183
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,470
but I dodged her.

184
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,690
So I didn't get any serious injuries.

185
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,630
I promised you that you
would have nothing to worry about.

186
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,680
As a result,

187
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,190
Li Yingliang came to you because of me.

188
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:40,990
I don't mind.

189
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,680
He knows no boundaries.

190
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,680
If we keep seeing each other,

191
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,110
he'll keep coming to you.

192
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,520
You'll be in danger.

193
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,470
I'll find a way to get your mother
to stop bothering you.

194
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,560
You can keep going to choir.

195
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,870
Mr. Shen.

196
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,280
Are you bidding me goodbye?

197
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,590
It's just temporary.

198
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,320
I have to solve some things first

199
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,400
if I want you to live a normal life.

200
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,120
But this is normal to me.

201
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,630
It's not normal, Mi Lan.

202
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,350
No one is in danger every day.

203
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,400
And no one gets beaten
and scolded by their mother all the time.

204
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:21,950
I'm not scared.

205
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,830
But I can't allow it.

206
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,710
Mr. Shen.

207
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,400
Why are you wearing a veil?

208
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:54,800
Are you injured?

209
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:58,350
Yes.

210
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,110
I didn't want to scare you.

211
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,110
I can't see.

212
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,400
You're right.

213
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,040
I forgot.

214
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,950
Mr. Shen.

215
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,160
You must live well.

216
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,590
Don't let bad guys hurt you again.

217
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,750
I promise you I'll live well.

218
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,280
Take good care of yourself.

219
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,200
Where is your mother's bedroom?

220
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,040
Second floor.

221
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,590
What's the matter?

222
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,440
Nothing.

223
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,750
I'll talk to her.

224
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:44,950
You should go to bed soon.

225
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,280
Go.

226
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:48,680
Hurry.

227
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,040
Shut up.

228
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,440
I'm the Mi family's ancestor.

229
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,680
You wicked wench.

230
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:46,080
Do you know what you did wrong?

231
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:08,760
You torture the Mi family's descendant
day and night.

232
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:14,720
I came back to life today
just to take your life.

233
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,720
I'm sorry.

234
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,910
Since you're the mother
of the Mi family's descendant,

235
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:27,150
I'll spare your life if you repent.

236
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,430
I'm willing to repent.

237
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,320
If you commit the same offense again,

238
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:37,870
I'll take you to
the Mi family's ancestors

239
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,350
to suffer in hell.

240
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,100
I won't do it anymore.

241
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,350
I won't do it. I won't do it anymore.

242
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,910
I'll never do it anymore.

243
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,280
- Madam.
- Madam.

244
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,080
Madam, how are you?

245
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,350
Did you have a nightmare, Madam?

246
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,190
Are you all right?

247
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,960
Go get a glass of water.

248
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,580
I'll get the towel.

249
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,080
Madam.

250
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,150
Are you okay?

251
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,870
Are you okay? Let me see, Madam.

252
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:37,800
Madam, how are you?

253
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:38,870
Madam.

254
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,350
Madam, you can't drink any more.

255
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,390
No.

256
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,150
I can't sleep without drinking.

257
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,870
Our family is considered lucky.

258
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,320
I heard a few days ago

259
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,080
that there's a beast attack

260
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,590
that even killed someone.

261
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,830
It was on the news.

262
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,800
I heard it was scary.

263
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,500
Just like a monster.

264
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:18,150
Stop!

265
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:19,870
Madam Xu.

266
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,520
Madam Xu, what do I do? Save me.

267
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,350
Help me. I'm scared.

268
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,910
Calm down.

269
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:25,770
Where are you going?

270
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,870
Madam, don't be scared.

271
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,560
I heard
that monsters are afraid of strong men.

272
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,080
Let him stand guard at your door.

273
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,590
Madam, I'll protect you.

274
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,110
I'm here, Madam.

275
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,560
Come in.

276
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,000

278
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,560
Mrs. Mi eloped with someone.

279
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,260
Newspaper for sale!

280
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,190
- Here.
- Sir, buy a newspaper.

281
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,040
Give me one.

282
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,960
Cigarette.

283
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,280
Sir, buy a newspaper.

284
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,320
Give me one.

285
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:08,350
Here.

286
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,190
Give me one too.

287
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,390
Cigarette for sale.

288
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:10,800
Here.

(Economic Development Committee)

294
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,240
Ever since Miss Mi

295
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,280
got out of Shen Zhiheng's car
in tears that day,

296
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,870
she never went out.

297
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,480
Her classmates
came looking for her a few times,

298
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:25,670
but she refused to meet them.

299
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,590
She stayed in her attic

300
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,090
and wouldn't even go to the courtyard.

301
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,670
Mrs. Mi eloped.

302
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:33,180
Shen Zhiheng didn't even

303
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,680
go to Mi Mansion to visit Mi Lan.

304
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,820
Did I overestimate Mi Lan's place
in Shen Zhiheng's heart?

305
00:21:58,910 --> 00:21:59,910
Miss Mi.

306
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:02,320
I sent someone to inform Mr. Mi.

307
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,150
Do you want to move downstairs?

308
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:05,390
No.

309
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:06,760
I'll stay in the attic.

310
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,080
Mi Lan.

311
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,590
Dr. Situ.

312
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:26,240
Why are you standing so high up?

313
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,480
Are you not afraid?

314
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,320
Did your mom really leave?

315
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,280
I won't suffer now that she's gone.

316
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,350
Did Mr. Shen send you?

317
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,480
Mi Lan, don't worry.

318
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,960
Shen will take good care of you.

319
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,430
Take this.

320
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,240
Here, everyone gets one.

321
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,870
This is for you.

322
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,100
- Thank you, Mr. Situ.
- Yours.

323
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,000
Thank you, Mr. Situ.

324
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,640
Yours.

325
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,720
- Thank you, Mr. Situ.
- Madam Zhang.

326
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,980
Thank you, Mr. Situ.

327
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,670
Please take good care of Mi Lan.

328
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:06,630
- Yes.
- Yes.

329
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,820
- Don't worry.
- Don't worry.

330
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,430
Please tell Mr. Shen

331
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,000
that I'm thankful.

332
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,320
Okay.

333
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:38,390
Shen.

334
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,480
I've been to Mi Mansion.

335
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,760
I told them everything.

336
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,240
Thanks.

337
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,330
Are you still messing around
with these antiques?

338
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,320
But how long do you plan to
look after Mi Lan?

339
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:56,080
You're not going to repay her forever,
are you?

340
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:59,080
Aren't you afraid
that Miss Mi will misunderstand you

341
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,250
and fall in love with you?

342
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,350
Nonsense.

343
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,040
Love?

344
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,480
I'm old enough
to be her great grandfather.

345
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:08,190
Age is just a number.

346
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,720
I'm not like you.

347
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,150
How are you different?

348
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,670
Not to mention that someone like me
will be harming others

349
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:14,720
by being in a relationship.

350
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,590
If I really love someone,

351
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,080
I'll take full responsibility.

352
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,590
Shen.

353
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:23,080
Have you been romantically hurt
in the past?

354
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,190
That's why you keep pushing Miss Mi out.

355
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,560
Besides romance,

356
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,350
I've had my share
of family and friendship.

357
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,320
By the way you put it,

358
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,480
I should cut you off sooner

359
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,350
to avoid future heartbreak.

360
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:37,800
No.

361
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,670
If you do cut me off, I'll die of sadness.

362
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:43,110
Don't worry, Shen.

363
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,480
If you can fix this clock,

364
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,430
I can fix you.

365
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,240
Science is advancing
and medicine is developing.

366
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,080
Nothing is impossible.

367
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,830
Do you know what happened
in the 970th year of the Chao calendar?

368
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:58,760
Does that have anything to do

369
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,860
with what's wrong with you?

370
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:02,760
All right.

371
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,190
You can go back now.

372
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,040
You're right.

373
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,190
If I cut you off, I'll be sad.

374
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,320
You do have a conscience.

375
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,630
My illness began that year.

376
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,190
How are you going to cure me?

377
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,240
I asked you to investigate Shen Zhiheng.

378
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,720
How's the investigation going?

379
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,990
I still haven't come up
with an effective method to arrest him.

380
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,350
Why do I think you're incompetent?

381
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,240
Superintendent.

382
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,040
You know what I did.

383
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,590
I used both hard and soft tactics.

384
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,040
I used all the tricks I could.

385
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,290
But Shen Zhiheng isn't someone
that ordinary people can handle.

386
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:01,560
I'm meeting the Mu family later.

387
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,960
I'll ask them for help.

388
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,590
I hope they'll send us

389
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,480
someone useful and capable.

390
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,800
You're wise.

391
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,520
Let me go.

392
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,670
What are you doing?

393
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,630
Why did you arrest me?

394
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:19,560
Let me go.

395
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,280
This is Mr. Ji from the flour mill.

396
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:24,560
He used a small factory
to brush us off last week.

397
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,080
I locked him up.

398
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,290
Mr. Ji, have you thought it through?

399
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,870
This is illegal imprisonment.

400
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,580
I'm going to report to the police.

401
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,730
I want to lodge a complaint.

402
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,350
I want to sue you.

403
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,800
Mr. Ji.

404
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,590
Our committee
has always been reasonable.

405
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,240
We invited you here

406
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:59,590
because of Oriental Flour Mill on paper.

407
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,800
But you went to a small factory overnight
to replace the brand

408
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:05,190
and pass it off as the genuine one.

409
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:07,390
Who do you think

410
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:09,520
should report to the police?

411
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,910
You're a robber and bandit.

412
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:13,800
You'll suffer karma.

413
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,480
Didn't I just give you a small factory?

414
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:17,800
What's wrong with that?

415
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,110
Aren't you stealing anyways?

416
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,800
You're right.

417
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,240
I'm a robber and a bandit.

418
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:43,190
Mr. Li.

419
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,350
- Mr. Li.
- Mr. Li.

420
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,040
- Mr. Li.
- Mr. Li.

421
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:46,670
Mr. Li.

422
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:47,630
Get up.

423
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,150
Get up.

424
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,590
Mr. Li, are you okay?

425
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,240
Scumbag.

426
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,480
I'll kill you.

427
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,150
Wait.

428
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,190
No, I don't want it anymore.

429
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,390
I don't want anything.

430
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,480
No, I don't want it anymore.
You can have it all.

431
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:17,280
No, you can have it all.

432
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:20,910
Take him away.

433
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,670
- Yes.
- Yes.

434
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:23,560
Go.

435
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,630
Mr. Li.

436
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,830
What did Mr. Ji say?

437
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:35,870
He called us

438
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,630
bandits, robbers and will suffer karma.

439
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:39,590
No, the one before that.

440
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:40,910
The one before that?

441
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,670
He wants to
file a report and a complaint.

442
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:52,630
Okay, we got a solution.

443
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:12,020
(Shen Mansion)

444
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,590
Hello, who are you?

445
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,690
We're from the police station.

446
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:18,800
Please come in.

447
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,820
(Shen Mansion)

448
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:30,980
(Calm Clouds and Clear Winds)

449
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:32,320
Mr. Shen.

450
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,350
I wonder what you need, Chief.

451
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,280
If I remember correctly,

452
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,830
I don't think
you're Xia District's chief police.

453
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,630
You have no jurisdiction here.

454
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,430
Mr. Shen, you have a good eye.

455
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:47,560
I'm Chief Police Lin Dongri
from Annan District.

456
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:50,000
We have an intentional assault case.

457
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,670
Please cooperate with us.

458
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:52,960
Intentional assault?

459
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,590
Yes, intentional assault.

460
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,760
We've already alerted Xia District.

461
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,590
We dare not mess around
beyond our jurisdiction.

462
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,240
This is the official document from them.

463
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,000
Please forgive us and come with us.

464
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:28,560
Sir.

465
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,220
(Haidong Annan District Police Station)

466
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,700
(Annan District Police Station
Inspector General's Office)

467
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:45,590
This way.

468
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,350
Please.

469
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,790
Isn't it just a normal questioning?

470
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,910
Are you putting me in jail
because of one man's words?

471
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,760
This is our inquiry process.

472
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,190
I know you'll suffer,

473
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,080
so I've rearranged it for you.

474
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,190
Look, a sofa.

475
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:15,390
I've done my best.

476
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,760
Sorry.

477
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,190
Mr. Shen, rest first.

478
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,480
We'll get ready.

479
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:40,520
Mr. Li.

480
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:42,670
Will it work?

481
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,590
We've dealt with Shen Zhiheng
so many times.

482
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:49,760
Except for the night of the assassination
when he revealed his true identity,

483
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,990
he's newspaper tycoon Shen Zhiheng
the rest of the time.

484
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,040
What do you mean?

485
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,720
I don't get it.

486
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,480
The newspaper tycoon
has his own business,

487
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,500
his own employees
and his own residence in Haidong.

488
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:06,150
I don't think
he would give up his assets in Haidong so easily.

489
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,960
But he almost killed you.

490
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:10,720
He had a chance to kill me,

491
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,110
but he only threatened me
instead of killing me.

492
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,110
What does this mean?

493
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,390
It means he won't kill people.

494
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,830
He doesn't kill people
and follows the rules.

495
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:23,480
So we have a chance.

496
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,590
Mr. Li.

497
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,760
Chief Lin called and said
Shen Zhiheng is willing to cooperate.

498
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,960
It's cold. Put on a coat.

499
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,240
I have only one request.

500
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:40,830
Lock Shen Zhiheng up.

501
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,080
The longer the better.

502
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:48,280
Intentional assault isn't a felony.

503
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,590
Even if you have
a medical report and witnesses,

504
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:54,480
I can't handle it if Xia District's
Director-General bails him out.

505
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,960
Lock him up as long as you can.

506
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:02,000
All right.

507
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:12,910
Mr. Li.

508
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,110
We finally got it.

509
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,350
It's not over yet.

510
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,000
What are we supposed to do with him?

511
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:23,350
The president of Haidong Daily,

512
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:28,870
Shen Zhiheng, is summoned by Annan District
Police Station for intentional assault.

513
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,190
This must be the front page news.

514
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,350
Get some reporters

515
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,080
to take photos.

516
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,520
Even if Shen Zhiheng wants to escape,

517
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,800
he has to figure out

518
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,280
if he can afford to jailbreak.

519
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,280
Got it.

520
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,190
(Now is the time to ruin)

521
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,350
(Shen Zhiheng.)

522
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,520
Don't you want to question me?

523
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:17,920
Where is he?

524
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,840
Where's Lin Dongri?

525
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,040
Ignore him.

526
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,560
Li Yingliang.

527
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,090
Since you dare to report to the police,

528
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:45,790
why won't you show up?

529
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,920
I'm here.

530
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,270
How could I?

531
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,360
We went to a lot of trouble

532
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,000
to invite Mr. Shen here.

533
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,880
I know you abide by the law.

534
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,150
Otherwise, it would be really difficult

535
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,190
to keep you here.

536
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,110
It seems
you finally got what you wanted.

537
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,270
Yeah.

538
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,440
You don't know

539
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,880
that you're all I'm thinking about

540
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,150
since we last parted.

541
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,840
I couldn't eat or sleep well these days.

542
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,440
There's a poem.

543
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,560
Even if I become thinner
and more haggard,

544
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:18,040
I don't regret it.

545
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,230
It's about you and me.

546
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,670
I didn't just get what I want.

547
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:25,310
Being able to hold my head high

548
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,440
is what I'm currently feeling.

549
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,150
Mr. Li, you don't have to say that.

550
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,310
I don't deserve it.

551
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:33,040
You deserve it.

552
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,880
I'm afraid you'll be cold and hungry.

553
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,790
I prepared four large stoves for you

554
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,270
to feel my enthusiasm.

555
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,710
Why aren't you eating?

556
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,480
No matter how much you dislike me,
you still have to eat.

557
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,080
Human is iron as if the meal is steel.

558
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,490
You'll feel hungry if you don't eat.

559
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,790
You haven't eaten for a day.

560
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,510
What should you do
if you starve yourself?

561
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,480
Li Yingliang.

562
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,310
I'll cooperate this time.

563
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,960
But you have to think carefully

564
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,790
about whether you can really
put me in prison forever.

565
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,310
If you can't...

566
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,690
The last time
he was at Dongya Restaurant,

567
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,790
he didn't eat either.

568
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:31,750
I thought he was afraid
I'd poison his food.

569
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,630
Now it seems

570
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,750
that he's afraid I'd poison him

571
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,520
or he can't eat.

572
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,670
Mr. Li.

573
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:43,440
Isn't it normal for us

574
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,560
to put him in jail
for three or four days without food?

575
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,300
No.

576
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,370
We must find a way
to make him reveal his true form.

577
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:53,040
If he makes it out alive,

578
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,440
I'll die.

579
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,110
Mr. Li, this is the observation record.

580
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,440
(Not scared of the cold.)

581
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,000
(Afraid of heat.)

582
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,750
Food is served.

583
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,480
Miss Mi, take your time.

584
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,150
I need to check the kitchen.

585
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,310
Did you know
that Mr. Shen was taken away?

586
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:34,270
Mr. Shen was taken away?

587
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,080
Yeah.

588
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,190
The news has got abroad.

589
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,480
Mr. Shen committed a crime

590
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:39,920
and was taken from Shen Mansion
yesterday afternoon.

591
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,150
He still hasn't come out.

592
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,290
What are you talking about?

593
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,160
What did you say happened to Mr. Shen?

594
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:47,960
Miss Mi.

595
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,670
I only heard that he committed a crime
and was taken away.

596
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,670
Where was he taken?

597
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,360
I don't know where he was taken.

598
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,920
The police took him away.

599
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,700
He's probably at the police station.

600
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,230
Miss Mi.

601
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,000
Miss Mi.

602
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:25,840
We tried everything.

603
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:29,000
We did the most unthinkable things,

604
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,360
but nothing changed.

605
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,710
Does he have too much self-control,

606
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,840
or he lied about him being a monster?

607
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,480
I don't eat food.

608
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,590
I eat people.

609
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,040
Or does he really eat people?

610
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:54,080
We can't believe that.

611
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,670
He said that to scare you.

612
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,110
It's fake.

613
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:58,590
I have no choice.

614
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,590
I'm doomed if I can't complete
Superintendent Chi's order.

615
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,560
If Shen Zhiheng comes out alive,
I'm also doomed.

616
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:07,960
Then...

617
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:09,840
I'll think of a way.

618
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:11,110
You...

619
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:15,270
You'll give me trouble if you do this.

620
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:16,080
Chief Lin.

621
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:18,080
When you accepted my case,

622
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,590
we're in this together.

623
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:21,560
No, you... I...

624
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:25,000
Don't worry.
This is Superintendent Chi's order.

625
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:03,880
What's the meaning of this?

626
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,270
So you're awake.

627
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:09,640
I saw that you're not eating or drinking
and was worried I mistreated you.

628
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,040
I went back and thought about it.

629
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,480
I'm indeed a bad host.

630
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,080
You said

631
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,790
you don't eat food and only eat people.

632
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,750
So I went down to the dungeon

633
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,190
and picked out a death row prisoner.

634
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:19,840
Don't worry.

635
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,520
He has no father, no mother,
no wife, and no daughter.

636
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,560
You can eat him.

637
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,750
No one knows he's dead.
