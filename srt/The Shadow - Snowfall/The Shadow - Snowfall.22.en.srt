You can crush those ants
with a snap of your fingers.

5
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:53,560
Don't you want to seek revenge?

Mr. Shen,

11
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,230
you're up.

12
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,480
Are you all right?

13
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,480
I'm fine.

14
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,710
How long have I been out?

15
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,040
It's been five days.

16
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,230
Did anything happen in Haidong
during these days?

17
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,790
I've saved the newspapers

18
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,160
from the past few days for you.

19
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,530

I want to go to the Haidong Army HQ.

54
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,820
But you haven't had your breakfast yet.

55
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:14,680
I'm not eating.

Second Uncle,

57
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,910
what's the meaning of visiting

58
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,750
with such a large group of people here?

59
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,240
Jingxue,

60
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,240
I didn't bring these people here

61
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,080
for a visit,

62
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,390
but to come home.

63
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,380
(Consent for Chairman Change.

65
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,800
We're not shipping any opium, right?

66
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,030
I guarantee with my life.

67
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,150
Sign it.

68
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,540
(Jin Jingxue)

69
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,910
Did I sign it that day?

70
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,590
Yes.

71
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,710
Even if you set me up,

72
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,830
I indeed have signed

73
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,640
this consent.

74
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:57,950
I accept it.

75
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,200
This is what I like about you.

76
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,890
You take responsibility
for your actions.

77
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,150
After all these years,

78
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,320
you've been living your life as a Jin

79
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,560
while I had to struggle out there.

80
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,120
I don't ask for your compliments.

81
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,120
But you kept sending people
to investigate my accounts regularly.

82
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,300
Is this an appropriate thing?

83
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,830
You're implying

84
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,560
that I'm not competent

85
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:30,030
and accusing me of dealing with opium.

86
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,230
How can you speak so lightly
of these things?

87
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,400
Jingxue, ask yourself this.

88
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,750
Haven't you hurt my feelings?

89
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:40,920
I care about kinship.

90
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,280
Everyone in Haidong knows this.

91
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,710
If someone else did such a thing,

92
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,680
they would have been kicked out.

93
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:49,870
But you're my uncle.

94
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,590
I can't possibly do that.

95
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,950
It's my own fault in this matter.
I don't blame anyone else.

96
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,680
Since you want the Jin family so much,

97
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
you can have it.

98
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,470
But I hope

99
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:09,800
you won't forget

100
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,520
the promise you made to my late father

101
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,680
and don't allow the things you're doing

102
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,230
to ruin the foundation

103
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,400
of our Jin family's years of hard work.

104
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,870
You don't need to worry
about this anymore.

105
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,400
Please see yourself out.

106
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,110
You just can't wait, huh?

107
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,710
Don't worry.

108
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,710
I'll leave after I pack my belongings.

109
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,160
Mister, do you want
to buy some cigarettes?

110
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,160
Make way, make way.

111
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:21,940
Cigarettes for sale!

112
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,230
Cigarettes for sale!

113
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,990
Cigarettes!

114
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,590
Miss,

115
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,630
you dropped something.

116
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,350
What's this?

117
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,790
It's the key to my house.

118
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,800
I mean,

119
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:26,950
the key to your house.

120
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,470
So, are you willing to take me in?

121
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,680
I have nowhere to go.

122
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,540
(Siming Insurance Company)

123
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:15,800
Have some hot cocoa.

124
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,400
So you'll sleep better at night.

125
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,920
I went to the hospital to look for you.

126
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,080
But they don't know where you live.

127
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,380
Did you go and find me again?

128
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,350
I want to ask you about Liang...

129
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,040
I know.

130
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,010
You're looking for Li Yingliang.

131
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,590
But how can you find

132
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,560
Li Yingliang here?

133
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,990
Before Liang left the Jin Residence,

134
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,440
he said he would solve
the predicament he was in.

135
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,870
Shen Zhiheng cooperated with his plan,

136
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,710
right? Yes.

137
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:51,560
Yes.

138
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,710
If that's the case,

139
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,990
it means his plan went smoothly.

140
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,320
Why did Chi Shanying suddenly die?

141
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,680
Where did things go wrong?

142
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,350
I did cooperate with Li Yingliang

143
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,680
to find Chi Shanying

144
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,280
and helped him negotiate with Shen.

145
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,680
But as for the rest...

146
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:17,680
I know

147
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,440
you've helped me a great deal

148
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,590
and I shouldn't be questioning you.

149
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,350
I noticed

150
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,990
the department store
outside is still open.

151
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,870
Let me buy
some daily necessities.

152
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,490
It has been a tiring day for you.

153
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,890
You should rest early tonight.

154
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,040
Thank you, Weilian.

155
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,500
(Second Principle)

156
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,520
Can I stop practicing writing now?

157
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,470
No.

158
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,680
If you don't learn to read and write,

159
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,190
people will laugh at you in the future.

160
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,830
But I have you.

161
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,800
We're not the same person.

162
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,230
What I can do will never become
what you can do.

163
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,950
I can overlook many things,

164
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,040
but not your studies.

165
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,080
Then can I write something else?

166
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,050
I don't want to write
the Six Principles anymore.

167
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,680
Then what do you want to write?

168
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:31,080
Shen Zhiheng.

169
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,230
What?

170
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,830
Zhiheng, Zhiheng. Shen Zhiheng.

171
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,400
What did I do to owe you this?

172
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,920
Heng, I need your help again!

173
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,230
I guess I really owe all of you.

174
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,080
Heng!

175
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:04,520
I've never been as happy as I am today
in over a hundred years.

176
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,470
Can you feel my joy?

177
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,520
No, I can't.

178
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,830
What's making you so happy?

179
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,140
Jingxue was kicked out of her home
by her uncle.

180
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,230
Now she's homeless

181
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,470
and has moved into my house.

182
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:16,830
How can you be so happy and laughing
that she's homeless now?

183
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,870
I did not make her homeless.

184
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:19,440
Heng,

185
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,870
I never had any girls living
in my house.

186
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:23,860
You're more experienced than me.

187
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,400
What should I prepare for her?

188
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,080
Who has experience? Behave yourself.

189
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,920
I don't know what she likes.

190
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,440
After pursuing her for so long,

191
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,590
how can you not know
her habits and preferences?

192
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,990
This time is different.

193
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,590
Jingxue grew up living a luxurious life.

194
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,070
She's used to using luxury things.

195
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,590
The things in my home

196
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,040
definitely won't suit her.

197
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,200
Then whose things would suit her?

198
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,470
Weilian wants money.

199
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,320
I know.

200
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:00,160
Keep writing.

201
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,560
I'll take you to get the cheque.

202
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:04,920
All right.

203
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,460
Didn't you say you'd take me
to get the cheque?

204
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,750
Weilian.

205
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,560
When there's an energy transfer
in the Blood Amber Stone,

206
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,920
I will become weaker.

207
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,630
Just like what happened
to your mother before.

208
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,590
Weilian,

209
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,470
please take good care of Mi Lan
in the future.

210
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,670
Liang!

211
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,080
Jingxue,

212
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,520
I'm back.

213
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,590
It seems I've been found out.

214
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,280
Jingxue, why are you running?

215
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,870
Why are you barefoot?

216
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:15,960
Are you cold?

217
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,800
Here, take my shoes.

218
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:20,800
Jingxue.

219
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,480
Stop! Stop!

220
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,590
Sir, open the door.

221
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:32,490
What's your problem?

222
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,240
Please give me a ride.

223
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,870
Where are you going at this late hour?

224
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,180
Anywhere will do. Just be quick.

225
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,830
Mister, sorry about that.

226
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,390
We quarreled.

227
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,560
You can leave now.

228
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,390
What's your problem?

229
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,110
Jingxue,

230
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,110
are you all right?

231
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,320
Did I scare you?

232
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,080
Who on earth are you?

233
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,000
Jingxue.

234
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:58,800
Don't come near me!

235
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,190
Don't follow me!

236
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:03,960
Jingxue!

237
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,040
Don't follow me!

238
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:32,000
Jingxue, your feet are injured.

239
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,110
Let me see.

240
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,560
I told you to stop running away.

241
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,790
I can always find you
no matter where you run.

242
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,240
Who are you

243
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,670
and what are you?

244
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,390
I'm Situ Weilian, you silly brother.

245
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,670
No, you're not!

246
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,240
I have nothing now.

247
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,910
I've lost everything

248
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:58,080
and even you're picking on me.

249
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,080
What have I done wrong?

250
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,240
What did I do wrong?

251
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,800
I swear

252
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,280
I will never hurt you.

253
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,820
Jingxue, come and have breakfast.

254
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,640
I told you

255
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,960
I won't do anything to you.

256
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,960
Then tell me.

257
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,160
What on earth are you?

258
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,790
I don't know.

259
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,640
When my mother gave birth to me,

260
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,070
I was already like this.

261
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,270
I need blood to survive.

262
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,750
I'm also stronger than humans.

263
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,310
Back when you were at my house,

264
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,510
you had been lying to me.

265
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,160
You can't say that, Jingxue.

266
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:17,270
My feelings for you are real.

267
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,360
Then did you lie to me

268
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,070
about Liang?

269
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,310
Would you believe me

270
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,640
if I said I didn't?

271
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,860
You're a liar! Liar! Liar!

272
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,400
You lied to me!

273
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:43,190
Not hitting me anymore?

274
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,760
Calm down and have your breakfast first.

275
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:55,580
We still have a long time ahead of us.

276
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,150
(He must know Liang's whereabouts.)

277
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,080
( He definitely knows.)

278
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,080
Eat up.

279
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,670
You're right.

280
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:28,400
I accept what's happening now.

281
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:31,430
Since there's a long time ahead,

282
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,980
why make things difficult for me?

283
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,390
As expected from the one I like.

284
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,350
Did they only mention
the new superintendent

285
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,670
and nothing else?

286
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:54,150
Yes.

287
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,430
You haven't returned that day.

288
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,680
I don't know the other party is
an enemy or a friend.

289
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,630
So I chose to calm everyone's emotions
and prioritize cooperating with them.

290
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:05,560
I think Superintendent Wu found out
you have returned.

291
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,780
So he specifically sent someone
to the press office

292
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,190
to ask me to bring the invitation over.

293
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,350
It's a Hongmen Feast.

294
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,080
I'm surprised you know about it.

295
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,870
Don't go.

296
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,590
Wu Zhongyi is different
from Chi Shanying.

297
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,990
He is trying to extend an olive branch.

298
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:28,960
Really?

299
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,890
He gave the invitation
through the press office.

300
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,080
So he's publicizing the matter.

301
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:36,660
If something happens to me,
he won't escape responsibility.

302
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,350
Doesn't this seem like
he's trying to make amends?

303
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,390
Does that mean

304
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,280
we don't have to leave Haidong anymore?

305
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,800
After the feast,

306
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,480
I'll take you out for a walk.

307
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:59,220
(Siming Insurance Company)

308
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,400
I like the clothes

309
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,910
you bought for me.

310
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,520
Why aren't you coming over?

311
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:37,830
Let's have a drink together.

312
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,800
You said you're not human.

313
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:47,350
Why is it

314
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,830
that you can't get close to me?

315
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:50,830
I guess

316
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,040
you're nothing much.

317
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,720
I'm keeping my distance

318
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,080
to avoid hurting you.

319
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,520
Haven't you already hurt me enough?

320
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,040
That's not the same.

321
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,590
Drink this wine.

322
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,630
Are you afraid I've poisoned this wine?

323
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:19,960
Not too fast

324
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,280
or you'll fall.

325
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,390
That movie was great.

326
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,480
What about the food?

327
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,350
They're delicious.

328
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,480
Which one is delicious?

329
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,870
The sausage tasted delicious.

330
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:32,910
Mi Lan,

331
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,890
what do you feel like doing now?

332
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,910
What do I want to do now?

333
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,630
I want to listen to all of your stories.

334
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:40,960
Everything?

335
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,320
That's going to be a long story.

336
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,630
After all, I'm over 100 now.

337
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,890
It doesn't matter.
I have ample time for it.

338
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:49,800
All right.

339
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,760
I'll keep it short then.

340
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,140
Since I was young,
I've prided myself on being smart.

341
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,160
I've been diligent in my studies,
hoping to serve the country.

342
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:01,390
I became a scholar at fourteen,

343
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:04,480
dreaming of entering officialdom
to contribute to the nation.

344
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,910
But after a hundred years,

345
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,800
I've become increasingly lonely

346
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,670
and desperate.

347
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:15,800
Yet, I'm still doing what I can.

348
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,660
There are still things
you haven't told me.

349
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,320
Is there?

350
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:23,520
What is it?

351
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,590
Have you loved someone else before?

352
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:30,870
No.

353
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,080
Really?

354
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,240
I can't say

355
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,720
there's no one.

356
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,960
What are you doing, Jingxue?

357
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:14,040
Did you kill Liang?

358
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:16,560
I did not.

359
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,150
Why won't you believe me?

360
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,430
Then where is he?

361
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,320
I don't know.

362
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,720
You're still not telling me.

363
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:29,870
Are you going to force me
if I said I don't know?

364
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,110
I would believe you
if you were the Situ Weilian I know.

365
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,670
But you're not.

366
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,000
You hide your true colors.

367
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,830
You made a deal with Liang only
to laugh at him.

368
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:40,830
Answer me.

369
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,320
What did you do to Li Yingliang?

370
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,000
If you don't believe me,

371
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,190
you can just stab me.

372
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,630
Do you think I don't dare? I...

373
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,670
I'm sorry. I...

374
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,040
Don't be scared.

375
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,760
I won't die.

376
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,000
It's because you can't die

377
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:20,830
that I'm afraid.

378
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,630
What on earth are you?

379
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:27,390
I want to be completely open with you.

380
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,190
But I'm scared of scaring you away.

381
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,080
Then tell me.

382
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,000
What did you do to Liang?

383
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,320
He's dead.

384
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,320
What did you say?

385
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,870
I said, he's dead.

386
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,390
You're lying to me again.

387
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,870
This time,

388
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,800
I'm not.
