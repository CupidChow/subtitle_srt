3
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:41,940
(This drama is purely fictional.)

4
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,390
It's already been two days.

5
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,890
Both Chi Shanying and Mu Lihua
haven't appeared yet.

6
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,230
Say,

7
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,590
could there be any changes?

8
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:27,880
It's me.

9
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:32,950
Mi Lan?

10
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,080
Mr. Shen?

11
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:35,990
What are you doing here?

12
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,100
I told you to stay at home.

13
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,050
I'm here to rescue you.

14
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,040
We have a plan.

15
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,830
What plan?

16
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,710
How could you still trust them?

17
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,880
Chi Shanying sent his men
to look for Mu Lihua.

18
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,380
Mu Lihua will definitely appear later.

19
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,950
I don't care about that. Open the door.

20
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,180
First platoon, equip yourself
with flamethrowers.

21
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,420
Second platoon, equip yourself
with poison bullets.

22
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,460
First platoon, in position.

23
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,560
Second platoon, in position.

24
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,110
Miss Mu, this is the mine
prepared by Chi Shanying.

25
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,670
What's his arrangement?

26
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,440
Chi Shanying ordered me
to rig the place with explosives.

27
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,320
Once we receive
Shen Zhiheng's confession,

28
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,640
I'll kill all of them.

29
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,790
Acting Superintendent Wu,

30
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,320
I've helped you to kill Chi Shanying.

31
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,270
Today, you must assist me
in capturing Shen Zhiheng alive.

32
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,860
I will definitely do my best.

33
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:57,600
Secretary Ding.

34
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,360
Yes, ma'am.

35
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,200
Take one team with you
and enter from this spot.

36
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,110
Use the flamethrowers
to force them out.

37
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,710
Yes, ma'am.

38
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,710
Team One, follow me.

39
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,100
Seal off all entrances, exits,
and ventilation openings.

40
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,360
I want Shen Zhiheng alive.

41
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,790
Kill everyone else.

42
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,990
Mr. Li!

43
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,830
This is bad!

44
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,120
We're in deep trouble!

45
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,800
Mu Lihua has murdered Chi Shanying.

46
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:20,470
What?

47
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,190
She's storming the place
with a huge squad.

48
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,680
Come, this side.

49
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,640
Hurry!

50
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,070
Don't fall behind!

51
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:17,710
Hurry!

52
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:19,320
Over here!

53
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,240
Over here!

54
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,150
Hurry!

55
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,320
Mr. Shen?

56
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:52,880
Mr. Shen.

57
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,540
I'm fine.

58
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,320
Heng.

59
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,490
Don't blame me
for not reminding you guys.

60
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,200
Now, Chi Shanying is dead.

61
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,080
Miss Mu is in charge now.

62
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,590
If you guys see Shen Zhiheng,

63
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,120
Li Yingliang, and the rest,

64
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,640
kill them directly.

65
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,510
Mr. Li, you guys should leave first.

66
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,150
Hurry!

67
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,150
Let's go!

68
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,680
I heard gunshots over there! Hurry!

69
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:56,120
Over here!

70
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,120
Hurry! Don't fall behind!

71
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,680
Hurry!

72
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:07,800
Over here!

73
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,350
It's me!

74
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,590
It's me!

75
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,000
The bolt.

76
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,030
Mr. Li, I'm fine.

77
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:52,950
Heng,

78
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,350
it hurts.

79
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,030
They used special bullets.

80
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,390
Mu Lihua came prepared.

81
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,710
Don't move!

82
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,800
How could they be prepared for us?

83
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:11,560
You duped me again!

84
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,760
It wasn't me. I have no idea either.

85
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,440
I planned to make
Chi Shanying lure Mu Lihua here.

86
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,470
I never expected Mu Lihua
to kill Chi Shanying.

87
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:19,890
She uses this chance
to kill you

88
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,200
after finding out about our plan.

89
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,230
But I don't know.
I didn't intend to harm you!

90
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,370
This time, this has nothing
to do with Mr. Li at all.

91
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,950
Don't kill me.

92
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,030
Give me another chance.
I'm still useful.

93
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,510
I know this place better than you.

94
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,370
I'll lead you outside.

95
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:32,630
Before we came,

96
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,440
Mr. Li told me to check the floor plan.

97
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,680
There should be another exit.

98
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,630
I can look for it.

99
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,800
But if you guys keep hurting him,

100
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,990
I won't look for it.

101
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,740
At most, we can die here together.

102
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,630
Stop arguing!

103
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,540
Let him look for the exit.

104
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,750
The pain is killing me.

105
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,950
I hate you to the core.

106
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,590
Mr. Shen, you guys
should take a break for now.

107
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,590
Mr. Li and I will look for the exit.

108
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,110
He'll stay.

109
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:07,710
You can look for it.

110
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,750
Go now.

111
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,560
Hang in there.

112
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,400
I remember there are
medical supplies here.

113
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,470
I'll look for them.

114
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,450
Go and check on Weilian.

115
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,870
What should we do?
They're coming for us!

116
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,630
Let's leave together! Hurry!

117
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,470
Mr. Li!

118
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,490
Let's go! It's over there!

119
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,470
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

120
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,110
Let's go!

121
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,020
You will carry me.

122
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:22,750
What?

123
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,440
I can't move.

124
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:24,440
Carry you on my back?

125
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,470
- Sheng!
- What?

126
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,800
- Do it!
- I...

127
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,630
Let's hurry!

128
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:29,680
Come.

129
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,590
Miss Mu, this gate is sealed off.

130
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,570
We have to blow it apart.

131
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,820
Why are you guys still standing there?
Place the explosives.

132
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,750
Didn't you guys hear Miss Mu?

133
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,230
Blow it up.

134
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:48,560
Yes, sir!

135
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,160
Hurry!

136
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,440
Mr. Li!

137
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,440
Mr. Li!

138
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:34,400
Mr. Li!

139
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:36,470
Sheng!

140
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:36,870
Weilian!

141
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:37,470
Sheng!

142
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,340
Mr. Li!

143
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:39,950
- Weilian!
- Sheng!

144
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:41,630
Weilian!

145
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:44,350
Weilian!

146
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,920
So, you're the same as them.

147
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,400
Were you

148
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,750
trying to kill me just now?

149
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,230
Luckily, I avoided your attack.

150
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,990
If not, you would've shot me.

151
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,080
Speak.

152
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,920
Who sent you here?

153
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,160
Was it Chi Shanying or Li Yingliang?

154
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,110
It has nothing to do with them.

155
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,990
I disliked you long ago.

156
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,560
I'm here just to kill you...

157
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,830
Sheng!

158
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,440
Sheng!

159
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,230
Sheng!

160
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,680
Run!

161
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,440
Sheng?

162
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:07,520
Sheng?

163
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,230
Sheng?

164
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,520
Sheng?

165
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:20,800
Weilian?

166
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,750
Sheng?

167
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,520
Sheng!

168
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,200
Sheng!

169
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,630
Sheng!

170
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,280
Sheng! Don't scare me!

171
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:37,440
Heng,

172
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,110
I heeded your advice.

173
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,690
I didn't intend to touch him.

174
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,950
He tried to kill me first.

175
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,470
I merely retaliated.

176
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,440
Sheng!

177
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,440
You're so...

178
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,200
Sheng!

179
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,470
Sheng!

180
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,520
Sheng!

181
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,320
Shen Zhiheng!

182
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,870
Who else is human besides me?

183
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,520
Is Miss Mi still human?

184
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,160
No.

185
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,630
Sheng!

186
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:34,630
Hurry and leave!

187
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,590
Go!

188
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,440
Come on!

189
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:41,920
Sheng!

190
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:43,990
Sheng!

191
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,200
Sheng!

192
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,320
Superintendent Wu.

193
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,590
Lower your volume.

194
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,680
Superintendent Wu,

195
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,080
should we continue the search?

196
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,400
What are you saying?

197
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:15,520
If we go deeper,

198
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,120
we'll be digging our own graves.

199
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:20,870
Follow me.

200
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,040
Yes, sir.

201
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:24,800
Hurry!

202
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,520
Don't fall behind!

203
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,590
Split up to check.

204
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,280
Mi Lan.

205
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,080
Do you know where to go?

206
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,710
Over there.
Sound travels further.

207
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,230
Let's go.

208
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:02,950
Let's go.

209
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,040
Over here!

210
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,950
Hurry! They're inside!

211
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,320
Hurry!

212
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:09,830
Hurry!

213
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:19,920
Go!

214
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,110
Mr. Shen?

215
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:30,830
I'm fine.

216
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,470
I dealt with them.

217
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,820
You should leave with
Mr. Weilian.

218
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,020
We should leave together.

219
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,080
Don't let Mu Lihua
find out about your true forms.

220
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,750
If not, there'll be dire consequences.

221
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:03,680
I'm not leaving.

222
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,150
I'll hold them off.
You guys should look for the exit.

223
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,900
Come and fetch me once you find it.

224
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,630
If not, all of us will die here.

225
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,630
I'm not leaving!

226
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,480
Weilian.

227
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:15,760
Mi Lan,

228
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,000
listen to Heng.

229
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,760
Look for the exit.

230
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,040
Let's go.

231
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,520
Come on.

232
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,350
Why aren't you leaving?

233
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,910
I have nowhere to go.

234
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,000
To Mu Lihua,

235
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,560
I'm an insignificant sacrifice.

236
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,830
To Mi Lan and Weilian,

237
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,390
I'm just a pack of walking ration.

238
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,870
Instead of dying like Sheng,

239
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,080
I would rather stay by your side.

240
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,040
Aren't you afraid that I'll kill you?

241
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,520
No.

242
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,240
It's because you cherish bonds.

243
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,040
At the end of last year,

244
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,350
during Mr. Mi's family banquet,

245
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,760
I wanted to say hi to you,

246
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,000
but you ignored me.

247
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,150
You looked down upon me.

248
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,980
Why don't I have
any impression of it?

249
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,390
Back then, I was standing beside you.

250
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,590
I wanted to offer you a toast.

251
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:45,800
Mr. Shen, I'm the chairman
of the Economic Development Committee,

252
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,390
Li Yingliang.

253
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:56,110
If you looked me in the eye back then,

254
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,080
maybe I wouldn't hate you this much.

255
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,760
And, all this nonsense
wouldn't have happened.

256
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,480
I should've killed you back then

257
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,280
had I known that all this would happen.

258
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,080
When?

259
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,830
On the Mi family's full moon party,

260
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,590
on the day when Mi Lan died,

261
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,110
and plenty of other occasions.

262
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,560
I've spared you too many times.

263
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,590
Did you send Li Guisheng
to kill Weilian?

264
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,040
Yes.

265
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,240
So, you hate me.

266
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,040
I hate you as well.

267
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,040
We're even now.

I had no attachments in the world.)

280

Come!

00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,280
All the people we killed,
all the dirty deeds we did,

315
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,630
were they the right choice?

316
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,190
If I can't repay you in this life,

317
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,000
I'll repay you in the next.

00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,250
I'll wait for your return.

319
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,190
Anyway, just wait for me.

320
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:51,830
Wait for my return.

321
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:55,280
If so, I'll trust you this time.

Liang,

00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,390
I'll wait for your return.

What are you doing?

325
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,350
We found the exit.

326
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:36,320
Let's save him.

327
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,080
Save him?

328
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:38,560
He told me to leave with you.

329
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,280
You'll be digging your own grave.

330
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,350
Even so, I'm heading back.

331
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:44,770
Have you lost your mind?

332
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,970
Or have you fallen for him?

333
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:47,150
Fallen for him?

334
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,580
Heng intended to stall them

335
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,510
himself so that I could escape with you.

336
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,670
If you head back now,

337
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,720
his effort will go down the drain.
Don't you care?

338
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,560
Follow me!

339
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:56,670
Stop dragging me!

00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,150
I care for him.

341
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,960
I only care for him.

342
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,480
Heng,

343
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,630
she's disobedient indeed.

344
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,110
I would've carried you on my back.

345
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:32,830
Miss Mu!

346
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,040
Mi Lan?

347
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:55,520
Miss Mu, be careful!

348
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:11,240
Superintendent Wu.

349
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:12,830
The detonator!

350
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,320
Press the trigger now?

351
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,150
But... But Superintendent Wu,

352
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,400
Miss Mu is down below with our men.

353
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,860
You're still calling her Miss Mu?

354
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,620
Do you think Mu Lihua is still human?

355
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:22,760
She killed Superintendent Chi

356
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,420
and plenty of our brothers!

357
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,820
If we let them leave the place,

358
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,800
Haidong will be in turmoil!

359
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,320
Give it to me!

360
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:30,910
Yes, sir.

361
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,830
As for our brothers,

362
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:44,110
they will die for the sake of Haidong!

363
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,670
They're the heroes of Haidong!

364
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,560
I'll definitely make it up
to their family members.

365
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:49,440
Sir.

366
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:50,430
Sir.

367
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:51,960
We're in huge trouble.

368
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,000
Huge trouble?

369
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,590
Did I lose them?

370
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:56,700
No.

371
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,300
The new superintendent

372
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,920
sent his men here to talk to us.

373
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,640
They want us to publish this news
on the headline.

374
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,540
The new superintendent?

375
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:07,680
That Superintendent Chi, passed away due to
an accidental discharge of firearms.

376
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,890
His deputy superintendent
took over his position.

377
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,230
Chi Shanying is dead?

378
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:12,640
What about Li Yingliang?

379
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,230
No one mentioned his name.

380
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,550
Publish Wu Zhongyi's report immediately.

381
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,440
The situation in Haidong has changed.

382
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,390
We have to notify
the people immediately.

383
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,790
- Hurry and publish it.
- Alright.

384
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,920
What should we do now?

385
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:32,420
(Chi Shanying, Leader of Haidong Army,
Died From Firearm Accident)

386
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:42,880
How is it?

387
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,230
Li Yingliang's
current situation is unknown.

388
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:48,270
The new superintendent dissolved
the Economic Development Committee.

389
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,750
But even so,

390
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,200
Li Yingliang didn't appear.

391
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,030
Head to the Jin Mansion.

392
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,740
(Chi Shanying,
Died From Firearm Accident)

393
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,260
(Transport Contract)

394
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,460
(Haidong Maritime Industry Association
Change of Chairman Consent Form)

395
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:23,950
Brother,

396
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,470
I'm doing this

397
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,710
for the sake
of the Jin family's business.

398
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,790
Jingxue!

399
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,510
We're in huge trouble!

400
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,950
Come down and take a look!

401
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,600
Second Uncle, I'm coming.
Stop rushing me.

402
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,840
I'm here to sign the form now.

403
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:43,600
It's not about that.

404
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,990
Jingxue, hurry and take a look.

405
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,470
Chi Shanying...

406
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,990
Chi Shanying is dead.

407
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,400
Chi Shanying is dead?

408
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,360
Don't you understand?

409
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,790
There are new officials for a new ruler.

410
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,510
Now that Chi Shanying is dead,
Li Yingliang no longer has any backers.

411
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,440
Liang?

412
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,270
That's right.

413
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,120
Chi Shangying is dead.

414
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,030
Don't tell me Liang is in trouble too?

415
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,640
Second Uncle, what should we do?

416
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,230
What did I say before this?

417
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,990
What did I say about you?

418
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:14,470
I said... I said you acted
on your own initiative.

419
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,950
We should've published
a notice in the newspaper

420
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,470
and cut our ties with Li Yingliang

421
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:19,990
- back then!
- Pick up the phone.

422
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:20,450
Am I right?

423
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,270
You argued with me.

424
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,440
You argued with me!

425
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,550
You threw the checkbook at me.

426
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:26,440
You throw the piano at me.

427
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,540
You went upstairs and ignored me.

428
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:29,230
You!

429
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:29,790
Second Uncle,

430
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,190
Liang didn't pick up the phone.
What should we do?

431
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,950
It doesn't matter. He won't die.

432
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:34,650
I'll look for him.

433
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,990
Let's talk about it when I'm back.

434
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,080
Jingxue, that won't do.

435
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,640
Even if I can afford to wait,
all those goods cannot.

436
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:43,200
If you don't sign the contract now,
the dock will be stuck.

437
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,920
I won't take up much of your time.

438
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,390
You should
deal with business first.

439
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,160
Hurry and sign the form.

440
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:50,670
Tao, prepare the car.
We're heading to Li Yingliang's house.

441
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,460
(Representative: Jin Jingxue)

442
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,200
Don't panic.

443
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:55,880
Slow down.

444
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,190
You have plenty of time.

445
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,660
(Representative: Jin Jingxue)

446
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,360
Here, this is the last one.

447
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,120
Second Uncle, I assume there are
no opium deals involved, right?

448
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,790
Who do you take me for?

449
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:09,790
I guarantee with my life.

450
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:10,980
Hurry and sign it.

451
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,500
(Jin Jingxue)

452
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,190
Second Uncle, sorry for the trouble.

453
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:20,880
Calm down.

454
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,990
Slow down!

455
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:23,640
Slow...

456
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:26,950
Slow down.

457
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:36,310
This is a piece of cake.

458
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:42,990
Here it is.

459
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,310
When Jingxue

460
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:54,550
falls in love,

461
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,790
she becomes a total fool.

462
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,160
Liang.

463
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,550
(Don't you know
the kind of person I am?)

464
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,470
It won't end well
if you are together with me.

465
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,440
(You get whatever you like.)

466
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,510
(Why must you be together with me?)

467
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,080
(Liang,)

468
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,840
(I'll wait for your return.)

469
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,310
Weilian,

470
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:28,990
why is his wound

471
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,710
recovering this slowly?

472
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:36,950
Heng,

473
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,080
your so-called principles

474
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,310
will kill you.

475
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:41,550
He will never die.

476
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,990
Of course.

477
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,750
It's just that he doesn't know
about the consequences.

478
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,510
Weilian,

479
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,310
I need to speak with you.

480
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,550
Follow me.

481
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:05,200
He's Mr. Shen.

482
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:06,640
I know.

483
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,520
He's Mr. Shen.

484
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,200
I know.

485
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,060
He's different from other people.

486
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,120
If he's not Mr. Shen,

487
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,520
he'll be like you.

488
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,000
What's wrong with being like me?

489
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,270
Aren't I good?

490
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,390
No.

491
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,830
He's very good.

492
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,390
He looks after me.

493
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:24,200
He looks after you too.

494
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,120
He'll cooperate with Chi Shanying

495
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,790
for your sake.

496
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,200
That is the case.

497
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,120
That's why you aren't allowed

498
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,350
to say something like

499
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:37,910
his principles will kill him eventually.

500
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:40,080
Other people can say that, but not you.

501
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,040
You're his younger brother.

502
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:43,270
You cannot say that.

503
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,390
Alright.

504
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,120
I got it.

505
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:49,040
I wish to protect him.

506
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,750
Heng is in
a terrible condition now.

507
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:52,390
We have to protect him.

508
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,040
You have to promise me.

509
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,330
Don't run away like what you did
at the mines.

510
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:58,560
I promise you, Miss...

511
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,080
