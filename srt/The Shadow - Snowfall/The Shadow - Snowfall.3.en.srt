3
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,040
(This drama is purely fictional.)

4
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,280
Mr. Shen.

5
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:18,950
I am...

6
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:19,720
Mr. Li.

7
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,920
I remember you.

8
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,920
It's been at least half a month

9
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,760
since we last saw each other, hasn't it?

10
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,110
Did you miss me?

11
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,270
I was ill.

12
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:36,760
What did you have?

13
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,990
Was it serious?

14
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,080
I almost died.

15
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,790
I wonder which hospital you go to.

16
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,320
The doctor's skill sure is remarkable.

17
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,360
Well, it's not the doctor's skills
that was remarkable.

18
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:53,950
I was just lucky.

19
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,440
They say that good fortune follows
after escaping death, Mr. Shen.

20
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,670
I wonder if I might have the honor

21
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,270
of sharing a meal with you, Mr. Shen.

22
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,390
Sure.

23
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,760
That's great.

24
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,640
I've long admired you, Mr. Shen.

25
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,390
I've always wanted
to be friends with you,

26
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,390
but you never gave me the opportunity.

27
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,480
I'm truly honored

28
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,950
that you're giving me
this opportunity today.

29
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,160
How about this?

30
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,360
I'll buy you a meal.

31
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,830
There's a restaurant called
Dongya Restaurant.

32
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,230
It's not too crowded and quiet.

33
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,790
How does that sound?

34
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,920
When?

35
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,270
How about tomorrow?

36
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,600
Sure.

37
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,200
That's great.

38
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,640
Tomorrow night at Dongya Restaurant,

39
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,040
I'll be waiting for you.

40
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,990
Mr. Li, go home and get a good rest

41
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,160
to be well-prepared.

42
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,950
Tomorrow night is a big night for you.

43
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,950
You probably won't be able
to sleep tonight.

44
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,390
- Splendid!
- Marvelous!

45
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,560
Mr. Situ,

46
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,470
how can you dance so well?

47
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,830
Miss Jin,

48
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,640
are we considered acquainted now?

49
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:01,830
Of course.

50
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,030
From now on, you're my friend.

51
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,560
I saw you with Li Yingliang
a moment ago.

52
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:16,910
Are you crazy?

53
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,150
He's out for your blood
and you still want to meet him?

54
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,910
What's there to be afraid of?

55
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,390
Besides, you're overthinking it.

56
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,150
We had a good chat and even made plans
to have dinner together.

57
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,240
Dinner?

58
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,200
What could you possibly talk about?

59
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,350
If he tries to kill me,
I'll kill him back.

60
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,440
If he wants to talk,

61
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,510
I'm open to it.

62
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,320
So if he kills you once,

63
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,800
you'll kill him once in return?

64
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,120
Is that too much?

65
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,560
Not at all.

66
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,590
Your dancing is quite impressive.

67
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,350
You saw me dance?

68
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,200
I thought you were indifferent to me.

69
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:47,640
Tell you what.

70
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,200
I had a chat with Jingxue

71
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,350
and we danced to quite a few songs.

72
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,390
Jingxue?

73
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:53,950
Yes.

74
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,200
Her name is Jingxue.

75
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,660
What's wrong with calling her
by her name?

76
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,030
Is that too much?

77
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,640
Not at all.

78
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,640
But to be with Jingxue

79
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,800
costs a lot.

80
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,560
Well, you are my savior.

81
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,030
I owe you this.

82
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,760
(Tomorrow night is a big night for you.)

83
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,270
You probably won't be able
to sleep tonight.

84
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:43,860
(Yongjia Li)

85
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,000
Mr. Shen won't keep hiring you

86
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,590
or me forever.

87
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,270
But I assure you

88
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,880
that you won't find a better employer

89
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,390
in Haidong.

90
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,270
- Yes.
- Mr. Wang.

91
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,880
He's very generous.

92
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,510
A day's work for him is worth

93
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,760
a month's work for someone else.

94
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,270
I understand.

95
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,760
Don't speak so softly.

96
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,560
Mr. Shen prefers us
to speak confidently.

97
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,800
This is the living room.

98
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,640
You're not allowed to stay
in the Shen Mansion after dark.

99
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,560
You must leave before nightfall.

100
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,560
Although the house doesn't have
many things,

101
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,350
it's filled with valuable antiques.

102
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,800
Be careful while you're working.

103
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,680
This is Mr. Shen's bedroom

104
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,990
and his study room,
which is a restricted area.

105
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,300
There is a dedicated person
for cleaning it.

106
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,320
You're not allowed to enter.

107
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,280
Also,

108
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,800
stay away from the locked rooms.

109
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,350
Mr. Shen is quite unusual.

110
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,920
Doesn't he feel scared living
in such a large place alone?

111
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,560
Don't gossip about Mr. Shen
behind his back.

112
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,160
Yes.

113
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,920
Good morning, Mr. Shen.

114
00:08:58,950 --> 00:08:59,710
Good morning, Mr. Shen.

115
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:00,870
Good morning.

116
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,630
Stop staring.

117
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,970
From now on, you'll be responsible
for cleaning the ground floor

118
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,080
and maintaining the garden.

119
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,440
Since it's been snowing,

120
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,520
remember to clear the snow
from the garden.

121
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:13,320
Go along now.

122
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,420
(Series of Wild Animal Attacks
on Locals)

123
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,230
Youwen,

124
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,870
come to the house.

125
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,950
I need to talk to you.

126
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,420
(Report from Haidong Radio Station.)

127
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,320
(Yesterday, a severe incident occurred
where a wild animal attacked)

128
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,040
(hikers on the rocky hills
near the city outskirts.)

129
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,750
(By the time the police arrived,)

130
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,110
(the scene was only left
with a pool of blood)

131
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,230
(and no bodies.)

132
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,710
(We would like to remind the city's residents
that climbing mountains carries risks...)

133
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,400
Miss Mi,

134
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,080
Mr. Mi had someone send

135
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,440
these new clothes to you

136
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,990
for the winter.

137
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,440
Madam Zhang, fetch me some water.

138
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,200
I want to water this plant.

139
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,040
Here you go.

140
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,230
Miss Mi,

141
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,870
these new clothes are

142
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,470
beautiful and warm.

143
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,870
Mr. Mi still cares about you.

144
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,440
Mr. Shen,

145
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,830
there have been two incidents of
a wild animal attacking locals this month.

146
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,020
It's just outside the city
on the rocky hills.

147
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,710
The people who were attacked
were all hikers.

148
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,040
I went to check it out
right after hearing the news.

149
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,890
I happened to meet the police
who were searching the mountain.

150
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,040
But after a long search,

151
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:58,990
they found nothing.

152
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,110
After the newspaper reported it,

153
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,200
the wild animal seemed
to have disappeared

154
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,870
and hasn't appeared again.

155
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,950
The police think that since
the wild animal has disappeared,

156
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,780
there's no need to continue
the investigation

157
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,950
or cause unnecessary panic.

158
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,680
They've just let the matter drop.

159
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,040
But I believe

160
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,800
the truth is out there.

161
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,280
They just don't want to find it.

162
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,400
What has become of the victims?

163
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,710
All of them had died.

164
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,230
There are three of them.

165
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,780
They all died from severe blood loss.

166
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,640
One, who was in good health,

167
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,230
developed a high fever for several days

168
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,710
and was delirious.

169
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,590
He died in the end.

170
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,200
What did he say?

171
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,160
He kept shouting for help

172
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,560
and saying that a ghost was going
to eat him.

173
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,320
Excessive blood loss

174
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,590
and trying to eat them.

175
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,470
Trying to eat them?

176
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,560
(Could it be him?)

177
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:01,440
Mr. Shen,

178
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,560
look at this.

179
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,560
I took these in secret.

180
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,990
Could this wild animal be a leopard?

181
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,590
Is it possible
that it started attacking humans

182
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,080
because it was starving
in the cold winter?

183
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,560
But that doesn't add up.

184
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:16,990
If it were a leopard,

185
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,870
the bodies wouldn't be intact.

186
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,680
We need to publish more warnings

187
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,280
so people stay indoors.

188
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,320
The weather's too cold.

189
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:25,950
They should avoid deserted places.

190
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,640
Okay, don't worry.

191
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,440
I'll make sure it's handled properly.

192
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,440
Go.

193
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,070
I'll get going now, Mr. Shen.

194
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:34,800
Okay.

195
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,470
(If it really is him,)

196
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,560
(I must find a way to stop him.)

197
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:47,160
(I can't let him harm the innocent.)

198
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,470
You're a worthless burden.

199
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:51,790
You still have the nerve
to grow plants?

200
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,230
Madam Zhang, you should leave.

201
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,050
My mother is about to give me a beating.

202
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:56,750
But...

203
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:05,640
Madam.

204
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,990
This plant sure is beautiful.

205
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,920
It's a pity

206
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,320
that you can't see it.

207
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:29,710
Tell me.

208
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,280
Who gave you this plant?

209
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,830
Is it that wretched eighth mistress?

210
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:35,400
Give it to me.

211
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:36,750
Give it!

212
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,200
I said, give it to me!

213
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:39,230
Give it to me!

214
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,990
Did I say you can grow a plant?

215
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,870
Did I?

216
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:46,830
Did I?

217
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,230
Are you going to keep it?

218
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,590
Are you?

219
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,070
Who says you can grow it?

220
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,230
Get up!

221
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:54,800
Tell me!

222
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,320
You dare to retaliate, huh?

223
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,320
What are you trying to do?

224
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,280
You dare to defy me?

225
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,230
You even dare to hit me!

226
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:03,780
Leave!

227
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,040
Leave!

228
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,230
Just you wait!

229
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:14,950
Where's the key?

230
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,750
Lock the door from the outside.

231
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,470
Do you hear me?

232
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,040
Don't give her water

233
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,830
or food! Let her starve!

234
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,560
How dare she fight me back.

235
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,800
I may not be able to control others.

236
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,990
But I can certainly control her!

237
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,230
Starve her!

238
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,110
How dare she hit me!

239
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,040
Do you hear me?

240
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,520
Yes, Madam.

241
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,470
I said, do you hear me?

242
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:41,710
Yes, Madam.

243
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:44,320
She dares to hit me.

244
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,680
- Mr. Shen.
- Mr. Shen.

245
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,120
Mr. Shen hasn't eaten anything all day.

246
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,390
He just had a sip of water and left.

247
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,750
How can living like

248
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,200
Mr. Shen be enjoyable?

249
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:44,880
Don't you agree?

250
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,230
He dresses simply,

251
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,230
with minimal colors.

252
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,230
He doesn't care about food or clothing.

253
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,200
It seems all he cares about is
this big house.

254
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,030
But you all know

255
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,160
that Mr. Shen's
belongings are getting fewer,

256
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,400
and he has few friends or family left.

257
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,470
So

258
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,950
his life isn't

259
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,680
as carefree as ours.

260
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,400
Enough talking. Get back to work.

261
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,020
Come on.

262
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:10,400
Go.

263
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,740
(Moxi Restaurant)

264
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,880
Hurry up.

265
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,160
Are you saying Shen Zhiheng is alive?

266
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:39,390
Yes, not only did he survive, but he also made
a public appearance at a charity banquet,

267
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,260
donating a hundred thousand
and stealing the spotlight.

268
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,840
Now the whole
of Haidong is talking about it.

269
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,790
How could he possibly be alive?

270
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,680
Didn't they say

271
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,030
he was beaten to a pulp?

272
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,230
Didn't they say
he was run over by a car

273
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:50,840
repeatedly

274
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,200
and turned into mush?

275
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,690
How could he possibly still be alive?

276
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,160
Where's Li Yingliang?

277
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,290
The Superintendent is asking you
a question.

278
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,120
Mr. Li and Shen Zhiheng are together

279
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,840
at Dongya Restaurant.

280
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,600
So,

281
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,200
Li Yingliang knew
that Shen Zhiheng wasn't dead.

282
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,550
Not only did he fail to report this,

283
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,750
but he's even meeting Shen Zhiheng
in secret.

284
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,310
Great, just great.

285
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,640
How loyal.

286
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,600
Let's join in the fun.

287
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:31,710
Yes, sir.

288
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:56,680
This way, please.

289
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,880
He didn't even bring any bodyguards.

290
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,310
He's either incredibly confident
or just naive.

291
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,030
Mr. Shen.

292
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:32,680
Mr. Li.

293
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,750
I'm truly delighted

294
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,710
that you could grace us
with your presence today.

295
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,120
You're too kind, Mr. Li.

296
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,440
Please drop the formalities.

297
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,030
I'm not inviting you

298
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:43,950
as the chairman.

299
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,030
I'd rather be friends with you.

300
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,030
As you know,

301
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,030
I've long admired you

302
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,230
and wanted to get to know you.

303
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,360
But I never had the chance.

304
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,230
Your flattery is

305
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:01,080
too much for me to bear.

306
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,640
Mr. Shen, please head inside.

307
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,880
Mr. Li, you're being overly courteous.

308
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,880
We could have a simple meal together.

309
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,400
There's no need to make such a fuss.

310
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,510
This is way

311
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,440
too lavish.

312
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,470
It's the least

313
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,080
I can do to show my sincerity.

314
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:50,990
Mr. Shen, here.

315
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,160
I have a stomach issue,
so I can't drink.

316
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,600
Please drink a little.

317
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,840
After a serious illness,
I nearly lost my life.

318
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,560
I finally managed to get better
after a lot of effort.

319
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,200
So I can't help to be cautious.

320
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,440
Surely, you won't think

321
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,790
I've poisoned the wine, do you?

322
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:08,880
Would you?

323
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,470
Mr. Shen,

324
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,600
let's drop the formalities.

325
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,440
Please enjoy.

326
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,550
Mr. Shen,

327
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,400
I believe we've had
some misunderstandings.

328
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:50,310
I thought we couldn't sit here and talk
due to our different positions.

329
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,400
I didn't think we could sit together
in the same room

330
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,600
and talk over a meal today.

331
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,840
I'm truly honored.

332
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,160
I believe with your wisdom,

333
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,840
you can understand my difficulties.

334
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,680
My work does involve Chi Shanying
to some extent.

335
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:10,990
But our relationship is not

336
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,950
as your newspapers suggest.

337
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,680
Besides, I haven't done anything
to harm the country or the people.

338
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,080
The development of Haidong covers
many aspects and details.

339
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,270
I have to handle the connections
for every single one.

340
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,400
Look.

341
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,200
I don't target the poor.

342
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,950
I only address those wealthy individuals

343
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,600
who only care about themselves.

344
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,990
Since you agree with my approach,

345
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,710
may I be bold

346
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,680
to get closer to you

347
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,510
and ask for your understanding?

348
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,200
When reporting news

349
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,950
about the Haidong Army, especially
the Economic Development Committee,

350
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,310
it would be helpful to communicate
with me first.

351
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,080
Of course,

352
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,400
I'm not trying to interfere
with your freedom to report news.

353
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,550
It's just
that everything can be talked out.

354
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,030
Helping others is also helping oneself,

355
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:54,680
don't you agree?

356
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:56,880
Besides,

357
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,550
I won't let you help for nothing.

358
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,080
There will be a generous gift

359
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,790
to show my gratitude.

360
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,550
A generous gift?

361
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,510
How generous?

362
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,640
You can name your price.

363
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,990
Whatever you want,

364
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,470
I'll make sure you're satisfied.

365
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:28,310
I want your life.

366
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:30,510
What?

367
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,680
I want you

368
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:35,950
to pay with your life.

369
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,650
Captain, there's noise coming
from inside.

370
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,030
Open your mouth.

371
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:55,750
It's okay.

372
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,600
If something were wrong,

373
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,880
Mr. Li would have thrown his cup

374
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,880
to signal us.

375
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,160
I usually don't take revenge this way.

376
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,880
It's against my principles.

377
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,950
But you've gone too far.

378
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,270
You didn't even let me die
with a whole body,

379
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,920
which has caused me great torment

380
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,200
and unbearable suffering.

381
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,200
Superintendent Chi,
what brings you here?

382
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,550
I... Mr Li, he's...

383
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,600
Mr. Shen.

384
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,270
What are you doing?

385
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,360
Let go of Mr. Li.

386
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,440
Mr. Shen,

387
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,950
what are you doing?

388
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,270
I want Mr. Li to send me off.

389
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,470
I hope no one minds.

390
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,470
Put down your guns.

391
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,710
Give Mr. Shen some space.

392
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:12,310
Put down the guns!

393
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,600
Do you take my words for nonsense?

394
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:15,840
Put it down.

395
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,510
Slowly.

396
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,840
Superintendent Chi,

397
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,470
nice to meet you.

398
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,680
Yes.

399
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:39,840
Don't just stand there.

400
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,680
After him. Go!

401
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,230
Faster.

402
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,310
Stop!

403
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:39,550
Mr. Li!

404
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,440
Mr. Li.

405
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,230
Mr. Li.

406
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:45,510
Mr. Li.

407
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:46,880
Don't scare us.

408
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,200
- Mr. Li.
- Mr. Li.

409
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,840
Mr. Li!

410
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,080
Mr. Li.

411
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,480
What are you waiting for?

412
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,990
Send him to the hospital.

413
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,440
Hurry! Let's go.

414
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,310
Here.

415
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,780
(Xia District. Traffic Inspection.
Violators will be shot.)

416
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:52,750
Shen,

417
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,840
you have finally returned.

418
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,880
Did you really meet Li Yingliang?

419
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:03,270
I just let the newspapers criticize
their oppression of the people.

420
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,120
Yet, they want me dead.

421
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,230
If I were an ordinary person,

422
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,360
I'd probably have died that night.

423
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:10,880
So

424
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:11,880
did you kill him?

425
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,920
Killing isn't my principle.

426
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,190
Those scoundrels are using
their power to bully others.

427
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,400
The people are constantly criticizing
them for bullying them.

428
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,310
You could have just killed them
and ended it all.

429
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,710
Don't take it seriously.

430
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,880
I was just saying it out of spite.

431
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,880
Weilian.

432
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,310
Enough.

433
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,510
I know you have your principles
and I shouldn't have said that.

434
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:40,880
Just remember

435
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,120
that you're not immortal.

436
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,270
It would be excruciating
to get hit by those bullets.

437
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,990
Excessive blood loss is really serious.

438
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,120
You should be cautious.

439
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,600
I can't be rescuing you every day.

440
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:49,190
I'll get going now.

441
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:49,950
Okay.

442
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:00,400
(Self-restraint)

443
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,360
If violence could solve problems,

444
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,900
why would I stick

445
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,680
to my principles?

446
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,510
Thank you.

447
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,570
Superintendent Chi,

448
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,680
thank you for saving my life.

449
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:40,120
Didn't you say Shen Zhiheng is dead?

450
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,680
How is he alive?

451
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,440
Mr. Li, don't...

452
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,310
I did kill him.

453
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,080
But I don't know

454
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,160
how he survived.

455
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,400
Then why

456
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,440
did you meet him in secret?

457
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,710
Because he is extremely suspicious.

458
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,750
I can't find anything about him.

459
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:04,230
So, I secretly met with him.

460
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:06,200
I simply wanted to meet him alone

461
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:06,880
and have a talk.

462
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,550
If the negotiation failed,

463
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,640
I would have killed him myself.

464
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,990
Clever.

465
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:14,950
Clever, indeed.

466
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,270
I thought he was scared of us.

467
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,270
But I didn't expect...

468
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,750
Is he afraid of us now?

469
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,680
Is he?

470
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,200
I was careless.

471
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,710
With your skills,

472
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,990
how did you get subdued

473
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:34,230
by him so easily?

474
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,710
At the time, he moved so quickly
that I couldn't see clearly.

475
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,440
And he was incredibly strong.

476
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,990
I clearly dressed thickly.

477
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:43,400
He managed to stab me in the thigh
with a chopstick.

478
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,080
I...

479
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:47,880
I'm curious about something.

480
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,550
What were you doing when I came in?

481
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,990
I saw his head

482
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,120
right on your neck.

483
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,440
It was so close to your face.

484
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,360
It was this close.

485
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:00,880
What were you doing?

486
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,510
What was he doing?

487
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,270
I think he was trying to bite me.

488
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,510
Is he a dog?

489
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,510
Bite you?

490
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:15,710
Does he have some kind of fetish?

491
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,680
He does have some peculiar fetish.

492
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,030
He watered his plants with blood.

493
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,750
My subordinates saw it
with their own eyes.

494
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:21,760
Didn't you ever think

495
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,510
that maybe your subordinates lied
to you on purpose

496
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:24,990
because they were incompetent?

497
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:25,510
I...

498
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:30,400
Enough.

499
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,880
I'll get you a new team

500
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,030
to assist you.

501
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,160
Superintendent Chi, I can guarantee

502
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:38,270
- that I will definitely...
- Save your breath.

503
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,550
Take good care of your injury.

504
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,790
Mr. Li. Help me out here.

505
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,710
Be careful.

506
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:54,840
Gently.

507
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,840
Shen Zhiheng, this rascal.

508
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,460
I'm going to take him out right now.

509
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,120
Let's go.

510
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:04,880
Come back!

511
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:09,710
Mr. Li,

512
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,470
it's my fault this time.

513
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:12,880
You can punish me.

514
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,400
But there's one thing
I still don't understand.

515
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:18,200
I clearly killed him and...

516
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,710
But why...

517
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,160
Our investigation was too hasty

518
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,550
and underestimated him.

519
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,950
Call in

520
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,230
more of our men.

521
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,030
Keep an eye on him

522
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:30,470
around the clock.

523
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,880
Find out

524
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,200
everyone he's met,

525
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,130
his connections, and his family's background
for three generations.

526
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:38,470
Rest assured.

527
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,990
We'll get to the bottom of this.

528
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:44,640
Leave some people

529
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,510
to guard.

530
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,120
Yes, sir.

531
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,270
You, at the back. Stay and watch him.

532
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,030
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

533
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:05,510
About-face! Forward march!

534
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:31,080
Shen,

535
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,230
what have you found?

536
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,350
I found it.

537
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,680
"Promise?"

538
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,320
Why are you looking for this character?

539
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,230
A promise is like a thousand gold,
which is as firm as mountains.

540
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,520
A thousand gold?

541
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,160
Are you saying
this is worth a thousand gold bars?

542
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:46,200
Then I want it.

543
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,830
What are you thinking?

544
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,230
Come with me to the Mi Mansion.

545
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,960
Didn't she say not to go?

546
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:54,200
Should we not go
even if she didn't allow us?

547
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,270
We're talking
about a life-saving favor here.

548
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,910
Mr. Shen,

549
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,040
what brings you here today?

550
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:16,790
You're too kind.

551
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:17,710
It's fine to just visit.

552
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:18,960
Why did you bring so many gifts?

553
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,750
My husband has been away

554
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,310
to collect payment recently.

555
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,520
So he's not in Haidong.

556
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:28,680
Well, you see.

557
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,080
I'm here

558
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,640
to visit Mr. Mi

559
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,870
and to thank your daughter.

560
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,830
Mi Lan?

561
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,680
Yes.

562
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:38,520
Is your daughter here today?

563
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,000
I've prepared

564
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:42,270
all these gifts for her.

565
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,040
Mr. Shen, you sure have
a sense of humor.

566
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,520
Mi Lan never leaves the house.

567
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,230
How could she possibly help you?

568
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,390
Is your daughter home?

569
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,640
She's not in.

570
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,960
You said, she never goes out.

571
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,600
Where could she be?

572
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,230
She's gone to Jiangnan with her father
to collect payments.

573
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,750
Mr. Shen, I'm sorry.

574
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,390
I'm not feeling well today.

575
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:36,870
I must ask you to leave.

576
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:38,560
Someone.

577
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:40,060
Please see the guests out.

578
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,310
Please come with me.

579
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,790
I'll take my leave then.
