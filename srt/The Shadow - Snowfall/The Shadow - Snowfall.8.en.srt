(This drama is purely fictional.)

4
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:50,640
Who's there?

5
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,120
Don't come here!

6
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,480
Mi Lan?

7
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,670
It's me.

8
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,030
Dr. Situ, hurry and examine Mr. Shen.

9
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,000
See what's wrong with him.

10
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,510
He was unconscious the entire night.

11
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,670
His body is cold too.

12
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,880
Please save him.

13
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,160
I'm begging you.

14
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,270
Mi Lan, don't worry.

15
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,190
This isn't his first time
experiencing this.

16
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,670
I have experience with this. You...

17
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,040
- Hurry and save him.
- Don't cry.

18
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,110
He'll be fine after a nap.

19
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,790
I'll take him to his room first.

20
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,160
Alright.

21
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,580
I need to head to the hospital.

22
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,230
I'll take you to the guest room.

23
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,480
I want to watch over him.

24
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,320
That's fine.

25
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,080
Okay. I'm leaving now.

She can't see after all.

57

It feels strange to have
an extra person in the house.

58
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,870
She can't see anything after all.

59
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,080
Who's there?

60
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,280
Liang, it's me.

61
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,470
I'm here to visit you.

62
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:50,920
Miss Jin?

63
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,750
What are you doing here?

64
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,520
You shouldn't be here.

65
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,440
Who said so?

66
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,040
Where you are, that's where I shall be.

67
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:00,530
Please don't say that.

68
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:01,630
I don't deserve that.

69
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,950
Aren't you going to invite me inside?

70
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,230
Please.

71
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,590
Miss Jin, do you need anything?

72
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,560
You shouted at me yesterday.

73
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,590
I was worried that you might
not be able to sleep due to your guilt.

74
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:30,950
So I came here to visit you.

75
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,580
I never expected you to sleep this well.

76
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,020
I was too impulsive yesterday.

77
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,380
I overstepped my boundaries.

78
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:39,880
Miss Jin, let me apologize to you.

79
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,280
Now that you're calm down,

80
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,110
Ingrate, so you won't
bark at me anymore?

81
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,920
But I do like
the occasional tantrum you throw.

82
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,190
Miss Jin, you're used
to keeping dogs around.

83
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,080
You like to compare
people to animals, huh?

84
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,440
You know that's not what I mean.

85
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:58,470
It's fine.

86
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,830
I'm already used to it as well.

87
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,320
Let me apologize to you.

88
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:05,520
Sit down.

89
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,830
I made you some dumplings.

90
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:27,870
Try them.

91
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,470
Did Tao make them?

92
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,800
It doesn't matter who made them.

93
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,090
This is a token of my appreciation.

94
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,230
Hurry and try them.

95
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,400
Are they nice?

96
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,440
Yeah.

97
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,950
Liang, wouldn't it be great for you
to return to the Jin family with me?

98
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,320
I can tell our servants

99
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,280
to make whatever
you want to eat for you.

100
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,160
Why must you live alone

101
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,320
in such a tiny place?

102
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,590
You don't even have decent meals here.

103
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,320
Why is your house
surrounded by iron fences?

104
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,280
I know now.

105
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,160
Did you commit atrocious deeds

106
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,350
with Chi Shanying again?

107
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,910
Are you afraid that your enemies
might revenge?

108
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,990
Why did you turn your house

109
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,870
into a prison cell?

110
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,320
You're not a criminal.

111
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,350
Ordinary people
wouldn't lead such lives.

112
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,550
Isn't it better to return
to my family with me?

113
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,590
Why must you become
Chi Shanying's lackey?

114
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,440
That's enough!

115
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:35,950
That's right. I'm Chi Shanying's lackey.

116
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,330
But I'll be the Jin family's lackey
if I go with you!

117
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,690
I'm a lackey no matter where I go!

118
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,320
Liang, you misunderstood me.

119
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,290
- You're right.
- I...

120
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,160
This place is a prison.

121
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,560
I'm a criminal.

122
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,470
Miss Jin.

123
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:54,560
Dear Miss Jin, please spare me.

124
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,520
Leave this prison cell of mine

125
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,090
and return to
that golden house of yours.

126
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,080
But Liang...

127
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,630
Scram!

128
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,710
Li Yingliang!

129
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,990
It's the last time
you're shouting at me!

130
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,830
If I let this happen again, I...

131
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:43,990
What's going on?

132
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,800
I don't know.

133
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,950
Why is Mr. Shen asleep again?

134
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,950
He's way less vigorous
than he was in the past.

135
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,090
He needs to rest more.

136
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:10,200
Mind the steps.

137
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,470
He can drink blood, doesn't he?

138
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:18,800
Mi Lan.

139
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,710
You know that Shen isn't
any ordinary person, right?

140
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,950
Yeah.

141
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,230
But it doesn't matter.

142
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,750
If so, why do you
keep revolving around him?

143
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,200
Do you truly fancy him?

144
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,850
Or are you two just taking
what you need from each other?

145
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,110
I don't know.

146
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,380
I don't know either.

147
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,040
I was told before

148
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,300
you were the most intriguing one
out of all the suitors.

149
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,950
Later I was told
due to a conflict of interests,

150
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,470
the relationship was no longer pure.

151
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,750
Women are so complicated.

152
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,670
Why can't the relationship
be just like my relationship with him?

153
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,280
What kind of relationship

154
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,470
do you two have?

155
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,750
He wants a decent life,

156
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,400
and that's what I provide him with.

157
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,790
I need a lot of money,
and that's what he provides me with.

158
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:03,290
We need each other
and can't part with each other.

159
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,320
Isn't that great?

160
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:05,350
What about you?

161
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,490
Do you need money as well?

162
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,080
I don't need money.

163
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,520
What do you need, then?

164
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,630
Do you need Shen too?

165
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,680
Shen is something else.

166
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,830
Before this, he said
he couldn't take you here

167
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,990
due to safety concerns.

168
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,560
But look at where you are right now.

169
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,230
Don't tell me Shen needs you too?

170
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:34,520
Wait a minute.

171
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,440
If you two need each other,

172
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,590
what about me, then?

173
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,630
What are you up to?

174
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,000
Mi Lan.

175
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,630
Mi Lan,

176
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,320
do you know that you're famous now?

177
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:37,520
Let me read
today's newspaper headline for you.

178
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:48,110
"Blind Heiress Falls For Media Tycoon,

179
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,590
Sealing Their Fate
With A Kiss In Captivity".

180
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:52,800
It's just the lousy newspaper.

181
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,890
What are they writing about?

182
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,670
Lousy newspaper?

183
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,430
I guess you can describe
Haidong Daily as such.

184
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,190
Now, the entire Haidong

185
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,910
knows about this.

186
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,630
How do you plan
to explain yourself to Mr. Mi

187
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:05,880
when he returns from the South?

188
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:06,910
He doesn't need to.

189
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,560
You're a great friend, aren't you?

190
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,320
If that's the case,

191
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,790
(Love Affair Among Elites Shocks Haidong)
Mi Lan is your savior

192
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,830
while Li Yingliang is your nemesis.

193
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,720
Wait. There's me too.

194
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,630
I'm your savior as well.

195
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,830
You're the boy who spends all my wealth.

196
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,290
What's the point of keeping you here?

197
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,430
Speaking of spending all your wealth,

198
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,190
- Shen...
- Shut up.

199
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:33,390
You.

200
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,110
Have some milk.

201
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,150
I don't feel like having it.

202
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,910
You're not allowed to refuse it.

203
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,240
Finish it.

204
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,720
Mi Lan,

205
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,480
why do you listen to Shen so much?

206
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:00,960
Greetings, Mr. Shen.

207
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:01,720
Greetings.

208
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,390
- Greetings, Mr. Shen.
- Greetings, Mr. Shen.

209
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,000
Greetings.

210
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,110
Continue your work.

211
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,390
Such a strong ink smell.

212
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,480
- Look.
- Interested in a newspaper firm?

213
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,190
It's my first time here.
It's kind of exciting.

214
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:18,720
Mr. Shen.

215
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,720
Why did you establish a newspaper firm?

216
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:24,720
Come.

217
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,520
Feel this.

218
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,350
It feels like it's made
of many characters.

219
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,760
It's full of dents and crevices.

220
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,670
It's hard to the touch.

221
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,870
It feels strong.

222
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:55,870
Feel it again.

223
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:09,000
It's like car wheels
rolling over a bumpy surface.

224
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:10,830
And?

225
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,760
The harder you press it,
the more you can feel it.

226
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,320
That's the power of words.

227
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:24,080
It's a weapon that can
change one's thoughts the most.

228
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,830
I dare not claim
that it can enlighten the public

229
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,910
and change society.

230
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,630
However,

231
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,630
I guess it can realize my aspirations.

232
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:34,870
Mr. Shen,

233
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,990
what kind of aspirations do you have?

234
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,430
It's a long story.

235
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,630
Mr. Shen?

236
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,280
What are you doing here?

237
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,390
Miss Mi?

238
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,490
What are you doing here as well?

239
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,520
You.

240
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,040
Come with me.

241
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,490
Is she the girl in the headline?

242
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,910
She's much more good-looking in person.

243
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:00,870
Yeah.

244
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,000
You shouldn't have involved

245
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,430
our staff regarding the incident
at the police station.

246
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,280
As a manager, you neglected your duties!

247
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,800
Everyone had to suffer
in order to save me.

248
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,560
This is for them.

249
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,040
I'll thank you on their behalf.

250
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,520
Yours is included as well.

251
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,320
You're truly the best boss in the world.

252
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,830
I have to trouble your grandfather
to maintain my family's tomb.

253
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,190
It's about time.

254
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,150
Look at how forgetful I am.

255
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:38,830
No problem.

256
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,870
And, regarding Chi Shanying,

257
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,960
he's a devious person.

258
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,830
We have to stay alert.

259
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,990
Tell your men to keep an eye on him.

260
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,320
However, safety first.

261
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:48,670
Alright.

262
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,790
If so, Mr. Shen, I shall take my leave.

263
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:54,480
Wait.

264
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,500
(Blind Heiress Falls For Media Tycoon)

265
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,080
Explain yourself.

266
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,240
What's there to explain?

267
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,890
All other newspapers are publishing it.

268
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,110
We'll be at a disadvantage if we don't.

269
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,090
Keep the benefits
within the family, am I right?

270
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,190
If we don't publish it,

271
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,720
doesn't that mean
we have a guilty conscience?

272
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,990
You look like
you have a guilty conscience.

273
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,190
What nonsense did you write?

274
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,990
You didn't think it through, did you?

275
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,800
Mi Lan is a lady, you know?

276
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,880
How could you write something
like this about her?

277
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,390
I don't mind.

278
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,280
She doesn't mind.

279
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,590
Even so, that won't do.

280
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,110
Miss Mi Lan did so to save me.

281
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,720
It was nothing like the title.

282
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,560
As a media firm,

283
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,560
we should strive for the actual truth

284
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,280
and seek to uncover the facts.

285
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,120
Not deceiving our readers
should be our utmost priority.

286
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,090
We must depict and narrate
without exaggerating or omitting facts.

287
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,760
We must respect the dignity of us

288
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,520
and uphold the way of the gentlemen.

289
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,560
How could we follow the masses blindly?

290
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,630
Alright.

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,350
When I leave the office,

292
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,480
I'll tell them to stop publishing it.

293

Cancel it immediately.

296
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,550
If so, I'll leave, then.

308
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,320
I came here

309
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,430
for that freak called Shen Zhiheng.

310
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,910
I heard that he has
extraordinary powers.

311
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,240
Shen Zhiheng

312
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,630
is truly capable.

313
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,000
He's very well-known in Haidong.

314
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,320
We've tried all kinds
of methods to capture him,

315
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:59,720
yet he managed to escape every time.

316
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,520
It's fine.

317
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,560
I'll give it a try once I understand

318
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,720
the whole situation.

319
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:06,960
However...

320
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,250
Miss Mu, what else do you
not understand about the situation?

321
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,670
I don't have a reason to act.

322
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,590
I think it's more appropriate
for me to remain here

323
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,110
as an assistant investigator.

324
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,520
I hope you can assign someone

325
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,720
who understands the situation to me.

326
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:21,720
If so...

327
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,010
I'll tell Mr. Li to cooperate with you.

328
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:25,910
Is that okay, Mr. Li?

329
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,240
Yes, sir.

330
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,560

Mr. Li, you're very enthusiastic,
aren't you?

00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,000
Mr. Li,

336
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,110
what did that woman tell you?

337
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:16,480
She said she had a secret weapon
that could deal with Shen Zhiheng.

338
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,800
Really?

339
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,900

340
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,280
Mr. Shen, someone's here.

341
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,110

342
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,280
You're here.

You're on the ladder again.

What is it?

346
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,480
Take this.

00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:02,750
This is called the Nine Rings Puzzle.

348
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,710
It has nine rings.

349
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,120
You need to remove it one by one.

350
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,920
This is used to test one's IQ.

351
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:07,990
Alright.

352
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:14,060
Shen, before coming here,

353
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,660
I think I saw someone spying on

354
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:17,020
the Shen Mansion from the outside.

355
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,790
Both Chi Shanying and Li Yingliang

356
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,270
are hard to deal with.

357
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,560
Of course they won't
let me off that easily.

358
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:25,030
If so, why didn't you
just kill Li Yingliang...

359
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,720
Although Li Yingliang is detestable,

360
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,030
at least he doesn't bully the poor.

361
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,270
Haidong will be in turmoil

362
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,590
if another person
replaces him after I killed him.

363
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,720
Do you think that'll resolve the issue?

364
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,440
Don't tell me you want to be
the savior of the world?

365
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:44,680
Weilian,

366
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:47,510
curbing violence with violence

367
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,270
is a pointless solution.

368
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,440
What's wrong?

369
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,950
Can't I even have some aspirations
now that I'm a patient?

370
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:57,880
You can.

371
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,190
You're right no matter what you do.

372
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,230
Come with me.

373
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,440
Mi Lan, stay here.

374
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,790
I need to speak with Weilian in private.

375
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:08,600
Alright.

376
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,080
There are changes to Mi Lan's pupils?

377
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,680
I saw it myself.

378
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,400
Does that mean she saw you back then?

379
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,270
That's my guess.

380
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,270
This should be related to my blood.

381
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,330
I have to ask her about it, then.

382
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,020
What if she did regain her vision?

383
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,840
Maybe we can actually help the blind

384
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,810
to restore their vision.

385
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:32,640
Think about it.

386
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,640
By then, plenty of people will line up
just to drink your blood.

387
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,550
Be serious for once.

388
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,920
If so, why don't we do a test first?

389
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,440
What test?

390
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,440
A blood test.

391
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:51,510
Mi Lan.

392
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,040
Finish this milk.

393
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,390
You forgot to have it this morning.

394
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:56,960
I already had one this morning.

395
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:58,480
Be a good girl.

396
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,590
Have another one.

397
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,560
Get down.

398
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,180
(I smell blood.)

399
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,630
She actually finished it.

400
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,150
Mr. Shen.

401
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,320
I can see now.

402
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:05,870
Mr. Shen.

403
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,430
I...

404
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,670
I could see again.

405
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:12,630
I know.

406
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,080
But it only lasted for a short while.

407
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:20,630
Now, I can't see again.

408
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,960
I know that too.

409
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,870
Do you sense a light?

410
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,480
A little.

411
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,430
Is it the same for this eye too?

412
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,240
How old are you?

413
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,040
18.

414
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,450
I asked her about it before coming.

415
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:05,280
She has been blind since she was born.

416
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,350
What do you mean?

417
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,910
A congenital condition like hers
is difficult to cure.

418
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:13,430
Given the current medical conditions,

419
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:15,960
it's literally impossible.

420
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,960
Why didn't you ask me

421
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,430
if it could be treated or not?

422
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,560
You would've told me immediately

423
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,630
if it could be treated.

424
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,400
But judging from your tone,

425
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,760
I don't think you sound happy.

426
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,000
That's why...

427
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:55,960
Mr. Shen, it's fine.

428
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,000
Didn't you tell me

429
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,190
that there were other ways
for me to regain my vision?

430
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,390
I'm already content

431
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,190
even if it's just for a short while.

432
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,530
Mi Lan, I don't wish
to hide this from you.

433
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,480
My blood should be able to help you
regain your vision temporarily.

434
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:15,530
However, it'll lead to larger issues
in the future.

435
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,110
When you're sick,

436
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,060
you need to be treated from the roots.

437
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,770
This isn't the solution.

438
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,800
Does that mean

439
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,960
I cannot drink blood in the future?

440
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,150
That's right.

441
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,350
I understand.

442
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,430
I will do whatever you say.

443
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:39,260
(Keats Hospital)

444
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,270
Please spare him!

445
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,080
Mr. Li, where are they?

446
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,520
I made a mistake and...

447
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,360
Mr. Li, what do you think?

448
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,440
Miss Mu, you came prepared.

449
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,110
I'm thoroughly impressed.

450
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,790
You're pretty good at playing tricks.

451
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,230
Miss Mu, sorry about that.

452
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,110
It's fine.

453
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,710
We can chat somewhere else.

454
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,880
Over here, please.

455
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,740
Just go.

456
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:23,000
(Dangui Theater)

457
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,630

459
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,310
Mr. Shen.

460
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,150
I like Zhu Yingtai.

461
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,110
But why?

462
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,980
It's because she doesn't want
to return home.

463
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:57,360
She likes Liang Shanbo.

464
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:59,670
I think she's very brave.

465
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,880
You're just as brave as her.

466
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,310
If so, did she become the top scholar?

467
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,440
No, she didn't.

468
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:12,790
But why?

469
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,360
When she went back home,

470
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,150
her parents forced her to get married

471
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,390
and forbade her from studying.

472
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:19,520
But why?

473
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,960
Because she's a girl.

474
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:25,480
Back then, it was difficult enough
for girls to study,

475
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,580
not to mention becoming the top scholar.

476
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,150
What about now?

477
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,490
Now, the situation is slightly better.

478
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,400
However, a woman has
to work much harder than a man

479
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,790
for them to be successful.

480
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,230
But now, at least

481
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,310
they can decide their own fate.

482
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:44,590
If so, did she decide
her own fate in the end?

483
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,790
I guess.

484
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,080
Although she died,

485
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,670
she was together with her beloved.

00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,920
If I were to write the ending,

489

It's because you never die.
