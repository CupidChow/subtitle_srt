(This drama is purely fictional.)

00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:29,420
(Haidong Army HQ)

5
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,190
You guys are dressed up
this early in the morning.

6
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,480
Where are we going?

7
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,510
We're going to take a train to Binjiang.

8
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,510
Why are we heading to Binjiang?

9
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,950
The medical equipment
there is more professional.

10
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,590
Maybe they can find out the kind
of strange disease you've contracted.

11
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,600
So, you're sending me to my death.

12
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,110
Are you afraid?

13
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,790
I truly thought
that you were fearless.

14
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,160
Aren't you guys afraid
that I'll kill all of you

15
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,810
and escape from the train halfway?

16
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,600
Even if you can escape,

17
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,110
these two friends of yours cannot.

18
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,880
I sent both of them
to the train last night.

19
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,550
As long as you behave yourself,

20
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,830
I promise I'll send them back
to Haidong in one piece.

21
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,950
If you play tricks,
in case of escaping at midnight,

22
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,670
don't blame me
for showing no mercy, then.

23
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,110
Even if I do kill them on the train,

24
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,670
no one will know who the culprit is.

25
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,790
Am I right?

26
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,670
So, who's more important to you
among the two?

27
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,090
Is it Miss Mi? Or the guy
with the curly hair?

28
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,710
Or none of them is important to you?

29
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,040
Is it fine even if they die?

30
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,830
Why don't you take a guess?

31
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,510
One more thing.

32
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,270
Do they know about your secret?

33
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,080
Does Miss Mi know about it?

34
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,160
Curly is kind of witty.

35
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,480
I think he should know.

36
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,270
They know nothing.

37
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,880
If so, you should stay put.

38
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,240
If not, they'll find out, you know?

39
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,910
Move out!

40
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:34,180
(Haidong Army HQ)

41
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:42,660
(Haidong Station)

42
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,560
Mr. Shen, we meet again.

43
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,320
Get on the train.

44
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,000
I want to see the hostage.

45
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,120
No.

46
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,150
If not, I can't guarantee
what will happen next.

47
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,880
Are you threatening me?

48
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,030
Yes.

49
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,680
We're threatening each other right now.

50
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,910
The train will depart soon.

51
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,470
It should be fine

52
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,680
for him to see the hostage.

53
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,800
Mr. Shen, what about this?

54
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,270
You can wait in the carriage for now.

55
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,390
Mr. Li, you can
take the hostages to him.

56
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,590
That'll do, right?

57
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,710
Yes, Miss Mu.

58
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,560
I'll take them to you, alright?

59
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,880
Get on the train.

60
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,060
(Haidong Station)

61
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,470
Miss Mi.

62
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,080
Mi Lan.

63
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,560
Mr. Shen.

64
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,150
Weilian!

65
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:59,200
Shen!

66
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,640
You made me worried, you know?

67
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,880
Are you okay? Did you suffer?

68
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,200
What's that thing on your face?

69
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,030
Mr. Shen,

70
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,440
are you okay?

71
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm fine.

72
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,120
What is this?

73
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,270
Did they do something bad to you?

74
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,080
Are you hurt?

75
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,120
I'm not.

76
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,030
How have you been lately?

77
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,150
Did you suffer?

78
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,590
I'm fine.

79
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,880
Shen, what's wrong with you?

80
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,470
Why did you lose to Li Yingliang again?

81
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,030
Is it embarrassing to lose to me?

82
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,200
Where are you taking us?

83
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,880
They're going to take me to Binjiang

84
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,320
for a medical checkup.

85
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,880
A checkup?

86
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What checkup?

87
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,080
They found out about my secret.

88
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,350
Mr. Shen,

89
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:49,240
Mr. Li said you were a freak who lived for
over a hundred years.

90
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,120
But I think you're nice.

91
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,680
Mi Lan, he's truly a monster.

92
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,120
He eats people.

93
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,800
You're the monster here!

94
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,470
Mr. Shen never harmed anyone,

95
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,510
unlike you!

96
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,500
You're not allowed to say that.

97
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,800
Were you guys detained together?

98
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:09,680
Yeah.

99
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,000
Our place is about

100
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,910
three to four carriages away.

101
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,880
If so, you guys...

102
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,120
That's all for today.

103
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:17,830
Miss Mi,

104
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,800
Dr. Situ,

105
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,000
please return.

106
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:21,590
Someone.

107
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,120
Yes, sir.

108
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,120
Mr. Shen.

109
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,830
You're older than her.
Take care of Mi Lan.

110
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,800
Take them away.

111
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,510
Yes, sir.

112
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,390
Go now.

113
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,680
Mi Lan, you should go.

114
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,910
I want this.

115
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,080
In your dreams! Go!

116
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,590
I'm upset.

117
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,950
I'm already unlucky enough.

118
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,270
I just feel like drinking.

119
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,280
Here you go. Go ahead.

120
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,040
Thank you, miss.

121
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,160
Mr. Shen, what do you think
about my move?

122
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,320
You're despicable and shameless.

123
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,080
How could I subdue a monster like you

124
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,320
if I didn't resort
to something like this?

125
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,870
I never expected you to be quite humane.

126
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,870
Yesterday, I was worried

127
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,090
that you were a cold-blooded freak
without any emotions.

128
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,680
I thought you didn't
care about their lives.

129
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,280
What nonsense did you tell the girl?

130
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,830
What did I do?

131
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,590
Mi Lan.

132
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,320
I saw that she liked you.

133
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,470
I wanted to test
whether or not she had feelings for you.

134
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,110
What's the result?

135
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,350
She said, "Whatever."

136
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,350
That was interesting.

137
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,950
She didn't care about you at all.

138
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,600
As for Weilian,

139
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,870
he pretended to be ignorant and said
that I slandered you.

140
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,680
It seemed to me like
he knew your identity long ago.

141
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,800
He wasn't afraid of you at all.

142
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,080
He even kept your secret for you.

143
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,290
Is there a secret deal between you two?

144
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,870
He's just my doctor,
and I'm just his patient.

145
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,590
If so, he's quite daring, isn't he?

146
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,710
It's because I'm generous.

147
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,040
It's good to be wealthy.

148
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,280
Even an inhumane freak like you
can get friends

149
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,950
with money alone.

150
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,560
Mr. Li, what if
I'm paying you to be my friend?

151
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,870
What will be your price?

152
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:17,680
What?

153
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,880
Aren't you even going to
give me a chance?

154
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:23,520
What a shame.

155
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:27,110
So, Mr. Li, you're priceless, huh?

156
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,830
Are you trying to bribe me?

157
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,520
I'm also trying to be friends with you.

158
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:41,800
Isn't that good?

159
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,590
What did you say?

160
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,110
I said,

161
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:46,990
I would offer you money

162
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,320
and be your friend.

163
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,110
Don't take me for a fool.

164
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,280
Over here.

165
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,110
Weilian,

166
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,920
what kind of checkup

167
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,440
will they give Mr. Shen in Binjiang?

168
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,680
Who knows?

169
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,590
They're spending so much effort on this.

170
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,560
Maybe they'll expose
Shen's true identity

171
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,280
and ruin his reputation.

172
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,350
People will hate him.

173
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,440
Or, maybe

174
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,750
they'll end his life

175
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,160
during this trip.

176
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:01,830
I have to save him.

177
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,950
(So, this train
will pass by Beiju County Station.)

178
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,830
Go.

179
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,080
Go.

180
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,520
Go.

181
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:04,560
Go.

182
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,470
Go.

183
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:10,630
Go.

184
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:29,630
No.

185
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,320
It's not like I'll escape.

186
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,040
Someone.

187
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:33,710
Yes, sir.

188
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,320
I can still maintain a bit
of my human dignity

189
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,990
before reaching Binjiang.

190
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,870
You don't need to be that pessimistic.

191
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,870
I'm not sending you to your death.

192
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,660
If that were the case, I didn't need
to spend this much effort on it.

193
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,320
You're just there for a medical checkup.

194
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:13,800
In other words,

195
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,520
you're just heading
to a bigger hospital.

196
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,080
You're really pure, aren't you?

197
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:22,920
Forget it.

198
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,230
Let me wash up.

199
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,280
Get us a pail of water.

200
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:35,630
Yes, sir.

201
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,160
My medicine!

202
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:22,720
My medicine!

203
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,720
Miss Mu!

204
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,380
I need my medicine.

205
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,950
I don't have

206
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,320
much time left.

207
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,280
What's on your mind?

208
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,470
What's on your mind?

209
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,440
This time,

210
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,320
I dragged Mr. Shen down.

211
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,520
He might not be captured

212
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,560
if it weren't for me.

213
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:11,870
Not necessarily.

214
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,520
Without you, there's still me, you know?

215
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,480
In life,

216
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,760
some people devote all of their efforts

217
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,480
to avoid responsibility.

218
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,800
Some people bear responsibilities

219
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,150
just so they could feel alive.

220
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,150
He's the latter.

221
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,430
What's wrong?

222
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,150
Miss, are you interested in us as well?

223
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,040
No.

224
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,560
I'm only interested in you.

225
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,390
Are you going to take me
to Binjiang as well?

226
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,760
Do you mind changing spots?

227
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,520
Let's get to know each other well.

228
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:03,760
If you have anything to say,

229
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,760
you can say it here.

230
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,480
I already have someone I fancy.

231
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,670
It's inappropriate to be somewhere

232
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,040
with you alone.

233
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,560
Weilian,

234
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,630
do you fear her?

235
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,110
I don't fear her.

236
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,390
I just feel

237
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,480
that she's sinister.

238
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,110
We have to stay on our toes.

239
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,560
Why are you still here?

240
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,480
That's none of your business.

241
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,480
This is my territory.

242
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,040
I can be anywhere I like.

243
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,150
Do you have cigars?

244
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,280
No. I only have this.

245
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,040
You should try out some cigars.

246
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,040
I don't have the leisure for that.

247
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,340
As long as it produces smoke.

248
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,480
What about a chimney, then?

249
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,490
Looks like you're in a good mood.

250
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,590
It's pointless for us
to stare at each other.

251
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,430
Get some men here.

252
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,350
Let's play poker.

253
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:43,720
Poker?

254
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,480
Mahjong or Show Hand is fine as well.

255
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,110
Tell Weilian to come.

256
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,350
He loves these games.

257
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,790
What if I refuse your request?

258
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,040
If so,

259
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,630
I will perish together with you.

260
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,150
Stop trying to scare me with that.

261
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,320
If you perish together with me,

262
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,390
the two of them will die as well.

263
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,040
I know.

264
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,520
Why do you think
I'm staying in this carriage

265
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,910
even though I can leave easily?

266
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,430
I have another question.

267
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,240
Are you staying here willingly

268
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,080
for Mi Lan's sake
or Situ Weilian's sake?

269
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,240
It's Weilian.

270
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,910
I thought it was Mi Lan.

271
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,760
But Mi Lan did land you in trouble.

272
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,320
It's Weilian.

273
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,480
Don't be fooled by
his carefree appearance.

274
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,760
He's loyal to me.

275
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,110
More like he's loyal to your money.

276
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,590
You always simplify complicated things.

277
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:56,870
When one acts,

278
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,320
he has to have a goal.

279
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,630
And, he can only have one goal.

280
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:01,760
That's wrong.

281
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,870
You're a human,

282
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,670
but you don't understand humans.

283
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,800
If so, do you understand me?

284
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,320
I do.

285
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,670
You don't understand me at all.

286
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,190
Why would you offend me
if you did understand me?

287
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,080
Back then, I didn't know you well.

288
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,480
I didn't understand you.

289
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,320
Now, we know each other well.

290
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,820
It's a shame that it's too late.

291
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,560
It's too late indeed.

292
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,590
Let's drop the topic.

293
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,800
Tell your men to come.

294
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,670
Let's play some games

295
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:48,720
and get through the night.

296
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,760
Open the door.

297
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,150
Why did you tell me to come?

298
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:40,560
To play Mahjong.

299
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,120
Mahjong?

300
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,490
They're actually
letting you play Mahjong?

301
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:49,670
How have you guys been today?

302
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:50,870
Were you guys bullied?

303
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,350
No.

304
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,190
I just feel terrified.

305
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:56,280
How can you sleep this soundly, then?

306
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,210
I won't be terrified
as long as I'm asleep.

307
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,520
We lack one player.

308
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,150
We need one more player to play Mahjong.

309
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:12,830
Mr. Shen.

310
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:16,960
Just look at Miss Mu.

311
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,830
She's much gentler than you.

312
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,190
Let's begin.

313
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:37,480
Dr. Situ, you've been
very generous lately.

314
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,380
You've invested heavily
in multiple hospitals.

315
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,590
Is there some news
that we're missing out on?

316
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,180
My father, Situ He,
was the one doing the investments.

317
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,560
I don't have the money to do that.

318
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,830
Regarding investments,

319
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,090
you have to ask him.

320
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:50,830
He always manages to find a way.

321
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,480
He makes a profit all the times.

322
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,870
Seems like wealth

323
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:56,040
does gather in bulk.

324
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:59,170
The wealthier one is,
the easier it is for them to make money.

325
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,910
It just looks easy.

326
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,760
What's wrong?

327
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,720
Miss Mu, are you interested?

328
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,480
The Mu family

329
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,660
was focused on stock investments
before this.

330
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,240
We also invested in shipping
and logistics.

331
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,240
I heard that the mines in Haidong
are quite profitable.

332
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,540
I intend to invest in them.

333
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:15,350
By the way,

334
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:18,350
Mr. Shen, if you're willing

335
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,380
to give up on some
of the newspaper firm's shares,

336
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,040
we'll be willing to invest in it.

337
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,830
I operate a tiny business.

338
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,390
The Mu family makes a large fortune.

339
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,690
I'm sure you won't be interested.

340
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,760
I have plenty of other
investment opportunities.

341
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:33,280
Miss Mu, I'll share them
with you next time.

342
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,240
Mr. Shen, you don't even have cash.

343
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,550
How will you pay for your losses?

344
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,110
I can write an IOU.

345
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,560
Just take my IOU

346
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,590
to Haidong Daily
and find our general manager.

347
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,110
You'll definitely get your money.

348
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:51,960
However, I don't think you guys
will get the chance to do so.

349
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,630
It's because I always lose at love

350
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,240
and win at gambling.

351
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,590
Mr. Shen, what do you mean
by you lose at love?

352
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,560
The entire Haidong knows

353
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,150
that your girl

354
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,320
is on this train.

355
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,910
I believe in singlehood.

356
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,080
(I can't just wait for my demise.)

357
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,580
(I have to come up with a plan
and make some preparations.)

358
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,630
Dr. Situ, what about you?
Are you the same as him?

359
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,760
I'm not single.

360
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,080
I already have someone I fancy.

361
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,670
Since she made you fall for him,

362
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,820
I'm sure she's someone extraordinary.

363
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,630
I guess she has bad taste.

364
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,320
Bad taste?

365
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:33,150
Mr. Li, I wonder
how good your taste is, then?

366
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,910
To me, she's the culmination
of intelligence, beauty,

367
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,830
gentleness, and romance.

368
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,350
In this world,

369
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,320
I think "perfect"

370
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:42,960
is the only term I can use

371
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,080
to describe her.

372
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,560
Mr. Situ, you have to be careful.

373
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,390
What if she took you
as her backburner lover?

374
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:50,830
I won.

375
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:55,720
You're quite lucky.

376
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,040
You flatter me.

377
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:20,390
Mr. Shen, looks like
you're curious about my ring.

378
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,110
Naturally.

379
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,040
When I was in the underground cell,

380
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:25,720
I couldn't move

381
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,390
after taking a glance at it.

382
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,760
Miss Mu, if you lived as long as me

383
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,990
and had been through
all the things I had been through,

384
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:34,280
I'm sure you would be curious as well

385
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,340
when you encounter something
that could stop you.

386
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,520
This is a 10,000-year-old meteor shard.

387
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,910
Mr. Shen, although
you've lived for over a century,

388
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:45,430
compared to it,

389
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:48,150
you're nothing but a speck of dust.

390
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,080
A speck of dust indeed.

391
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:54,430
Excellent words.

392
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,730
Get me some paper and a pen.

393
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:00,190
Write an IOU for Mr. Li.

394
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,830
Alright.

395
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,630
Mr. Li.

396
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,040
I hope you'll pay up.

397
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,040
Miss Jin, you're back.

398
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,280
By the way, Tao,

399
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,870
has Dr. Situ visited us today?

400
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:41,800
No.

401
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:43,190
It's kind of strange.

402
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,670
Before this, he said
he would sponge off us every day.

403
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,150
Just like what you've said,

404
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,110
he's unreliable.

405
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,350
Miss Jin, I'll get you some soup.

406
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,870
Sorry about this, guys.

407
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,040
I won again.

408
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,080
And, I think I won by a huge margin.

409
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,480
I'll spare you guys from the losses.

410
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:27,320
Thanks for the game.

411
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,110
Thank you.

412
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,760
This train ride is taking forever, huh?

413
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,390
Mr. Shen, are you in a hurry
to head to Binjiang?

414
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,630
Don't you want
to admire the view along the trip?

415
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,520
I have no patience.

416
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,630
Since I already knew
what the ending will be,

417
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:46,080
there's no need to admire the view.

418
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:50,870
Do you have
any unfulfilled wishes in life?

419
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,430
Finding my family members.

420
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:55,870
Does that count?

421
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,490
Aren't all of your family members

422
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,830
dead by now?

423
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:05,480
Everyone was reduced to ashes
after the fire.

424
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,590
I thought they were dead too.

425
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,190
But still, there's still
a glimmer of hope that I might find them.

426
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,630
Tired birds return to their nests

427
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,720
while falling leaves
return to their roots.

428
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:18,040
Maybe this ending

429
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,520
isn't a bad thing

430
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,190
for me after all.

431
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,080
Forget it.

432
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:27,770
I'll stop with the discouraging stuff.

433
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,040
Have you guys taken
the Asia Express before?

434
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:33,190
If we make our transit at Beiju,

435
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,560
we'll be able to reach Binjiang soon.

436
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,350
I haven't.

437
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:43,390
What about you?

438
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,670
I haven't either.

439
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,430
I took it twice.

440
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,830
It was great.

441
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,590
It was extremely fast.

442
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,040
There are air-conditioners on the train.

443
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,320
They serve top-quality cuisines.

444
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,690
They have sightseeing carriages
and everything you can think of.

445
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,670
It's the culmination
of technology and wealth.

446
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:04,110
There are plenty
of great things in the world.

447
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,280
You'll be able to enjoy everything

448
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,390
as long as you work hard enough.

449
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,590
Although it sounds like a cliche,

450
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,760
it's true.

451
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,910
I love this world.

452
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,770
I think I won't be able to live
until all these debts are paid.

453
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:27,490
I hope you guys will repay
your debt in the future.

454
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,390
Give the money to Weilian.

455
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,150
Shen, you do know me well.

456
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,150
You think I'll default on my debt?

457
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,280
That's hard to say.

458
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,430
Mr. Li, to me,

459
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,800
you aren't credible from the start.

460
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,350
Enough.

461
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,960
It's getting late.

462
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,240
Let's end this early.

463
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,110
Alright.

464
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,040
I'll head back and rest now.

465
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,830
I'll look forward

466
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,630
to your next story-sharing session.

467
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:54,870
Sweet dreams, Miss Mu.

468
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,630
Send Dr. Situ back.

469
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:01,160
Yes, sir.

470
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,190
Let's go.

471
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,280
Don't pull my sleeve.

472
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,760
Weilian?

473
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,040
Mi Lan.

474
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,960
How's Mr. Shen?

475
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,190
Why are you awake when it's barely dawn?

476
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:51,150
He's doing okay.

477
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,910
He's just not in a good mood.

478
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,390
What have you guys been doing
since last night?

479
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:00,280
We played Mahjong the entire night.

480
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:03,110
And, I got myself plenty of IOUs.

481
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,760
Hand them to me.

482
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,350
You want the IOUs?

483
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:13,560
Here you go.

484
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,350
What are you doing?

485
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,080
Mr. Shen wouldn't just play Mahjong

486
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,080
with you for no reason.

487
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,390
What did you guys talk about?

488
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:50,990
What did we talk about?

489
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:55,190
We talked about investments.

490
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,190
We talked about how to make money.

491
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:00,320
We also talked about Mu Lihua's ring.

492
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:03,190
He even showed off
in front of Li Yingliang

493
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:07,190
that he took a train called
Asia Express before.

494
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,360
Have you guys taken
the Asia Express before?

495
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,560
If we make our transit at Beiju,

496
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,750
we'll be able to reach Binjiang soon.

497
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,400
I know now.

498
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,230
I'm sure that was Mr. Shen's hint.

499
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,190
He would come tonight

500
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,400
and take us to ride the Asia Express.

501
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,190
Rest early.

502
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,750
I'll give you one last chance.

503
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:42,840
What?

504
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,920
Do you know why I'm not killing you?

505
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,040
Why?

506
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,920
If I kill you and
replace someone else,

507
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,220
Haidong will just be more chaotic.

508
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,520
From what I've learned, at least

509
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,840
you don't oppress the poor.

510
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,890
Although you started from the bottom
and reached now,

511
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,190
you were empathetic toward the poor.

512
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:57,190
From that alone,
I know you're not utterly rotten.

513
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,630
What did you say?
You said I wasn't utterly rotten?

514
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:00,220
Mr. Li!

515
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:02,840
I'm fine.

516
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:08,040
If that's not the case,

517
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:09,520
I'll give you one million.

518
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,520
With that sum, even if you don't work,

519
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,710
you can buy a vineyard abroad

520
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,310
and spend the rest of your life richly.

521
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,140
It's not pointless to lie to me,

522
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,440
Or do you think
that I trust you completely now?

523
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,080
I'm not lying to you.

524
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,020
Once you release me,
Mi Lan, and Weilian,

525
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,420
I'll take the three of you with me.

526
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,360
As for your reward,
although one million isn't a small sum,

527
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,960
I won't go bankrupt yet.

528
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,590
I think my life is worth the price.

529
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,400
What do you think?

530
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:36,400
Enough.

531
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,480
I have no time for your crap.

532
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,920
(What was the point
of saying all those things?)

533
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,860
(I'm sure he was lying.)

534
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,590
(He wanted to shake me up.)

535
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:17,710
(Li Yingliang,
it's too late for you to turn back.)

536
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,560
(You think you can
turn over a new leaf now?)

537
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:23,140
(Once one chooses to bow to authority,
it's hard to stand up again easily.)

538
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:24,960
(Wake up.)

539
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,280
Open the door.

540
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:35,670
Miss Mu,

541
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:39,790
last time, you said you would take Shen Zhiheng
to Binjiang for a medical checkup.

542
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,440
What kind of medical checkup is it?

543
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,040
It's quite simple.

544
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,190
Mr. Li, since you've never
dabbled in this field before,

545
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,670
you'll think that it's complicated.

546
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,660
If so, I shall explain it
to you in detail.

547
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,190
That's all I wish for.

548
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:54,670
Open the door.

549
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,000
Aren't we heading to Hell now?

550
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,080
How dare you steal my stuff?

551
