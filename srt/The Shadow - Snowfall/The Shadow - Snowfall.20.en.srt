=Episode 20=

3
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:41,940
(This drama is purely fictional.)

4
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,720
Where did you find it?

5
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,390
Near a sinkhole

6
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,990
about 20 kilometers

7
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,340
north of the city, Superintendent.

8
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,190
Some remains haven't been
completely burned.

9
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,760
The police investigated it

10
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,760
and found some of your soldiers
that you sent to Mu Lihua in there.

11
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,710
Superintendent, this Mu Lihua character
is questionable.

12
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,150
The public is

13
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,240
in an uproar,

14
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,240
everyone's panicking.

15
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:07,880
They're saying…

16
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:09,600
What are they saying?

17
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,630
They're saying that you brought back
a man-eating monster.

18
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,000
The plan to capture Shen Zhiheng
can commence now.

19
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,880
Follow the original plan.

20
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,160
I'll assign extra help.

21
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,480
Do not fail me again.

22
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:28,560
Yes, Superintendent.

23
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,950
I'll give it my all.

24
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,230
And about Li Guisheng…

25
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:33,790
Superintendent,

26
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,600
I am absolutely loyal to you.

27
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,070
I need Li Guisheng.

28
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,160
With his help,

29
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,790
I will surely bring back Shen Zhiheng.

30
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,440
Very well.

31
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:45,790
Bring back

32
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,200
the confession,

33
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,910
and I'll release Li Guisheng.

34
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,720
Yes, of course.

35
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,160
I'll get it done.

36
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,230
(Step one.)

37
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,790
(Capture Shen Zhiheng.)

38
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,280
(Detain him in the mine.)

39
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,480
(Trick him)

40
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,830
(into signing the confession.)

41
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,660
(Step One)

42
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,660
(Confession)
(Step Two)

43
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,070
(Step two.)

44
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,230
(Reclaim Chi Shanying's trust.)

45
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,990
(Get promoted and rewarded.)

46
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,670
(Rise again.)

47
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,510
(Step three.)

48
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,110
(Kill Situ.)

49
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,630
(Marry Jingxue.)

50
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,040
Situ Weilian!

51
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,420
(Step Three)

52
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,510
Didn't Li Yingliang say

53
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,120
he has a plan?

54
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,510
He may have his schemes,

55
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,630
but I have countermeasures.

56
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,760
He has one plan,

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I have three.

58
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,200
First,

59
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,760
Li Yingliang says
he can capture Shen Zhiheng.

60
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,630
Whether Shen Zhiheng cooperates or not,

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,560
the mine will be the place

62
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,320
to detain both him and Situ Weilian.

63
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,390
When that happens,

64
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,360
you will plant explosives inside the mine.

65
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,470
Superintendent, it's done.

66
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:17,590
Understood.

67
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,800
Am I clear?

68
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,120
Secondly,

69
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,320
Mu Lihua is a constant threat.

70
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,680
She is determined

71
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,350
to capture Shen Zhiheng, yes?

72
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,950
Then, we'll use Shen Zhiheng as bait.

73
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,120
She'll definitely come.

74
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:54,800
When

75
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,000
she does…

76
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:06,320
I can't stand your meddling anymore.

77
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,760
You've been wreaking havoc
on my soldiers.

78
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,950
I've had enough.

79
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,680
I've had enough of this.

80
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:13,830
You!

81
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,590
Then,

82
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,910
we proceed with the final plan.

83
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,560
Shen Zhiheng has colluded

84
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,590
with Mu Lihua,

85
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,830
endangering the safety
of Haidong's citizens.

86
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,150
Haidong

87
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,390
is now safe.

88
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,570
Thank you, Superintendent Chi!

89
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,760
Superintendent Chi is wise!

90
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,560
And that's a job well done for us.

91
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,760
Leave

92
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,470
no survivors.

93
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:05,000
Heng, I've made arrangements
with Li Yingliang.

94
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,240
The plan starts tomorrow.

95
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,710
Remember to come to my place on time.

96
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,680
I agreed to this plan

97
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,440
only for three reasons.

98
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:13,510
One,

99
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,640
your happiness with Jin Jingxue.

100
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,320
Two,

101
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,880
so I can take Mi Lan and join you
in finding a new life.

102
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,030
Three,

103
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,590
if I am to cooperate and get captured,
I expect results.

104
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,030
Mu Lihua must show up.

105
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,150
Those are my conditions.

106
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,710
Why do you need Mu Lihua to appear?

107
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,320
To eliminate a threat for good.

108
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,390
Consider it a deed
for the greater good too.

109
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,320
All right, got it.

110
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,350
I'll go now.

111
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,120
Let's hope

112
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,390
this is the end.

113
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,440
Well?

114
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,240
Deputy Officer Wu,
all the explosives have been planted.

115
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,350
Well done. Tell them to withdraw.

116
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,120
Yes.

117
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,030
Everyone, get in the vehicles.

118
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,180
(Shen Mansion)

119
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,680
I'll be away for a few days.

120
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,990
I'll leave the house in your care.

121
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,590
Please look after Mi Lan as well.

122
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,750
Yes, sir.

123
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,590
You can't go!

124
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,350
Uncle Li isn't reliable.

125
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,590
Don't trust him.

126
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,200
He might try to kill you again.

127
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,560
If I don't go, he won't let it go.

128
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,110
I've already bought the tickets.

129
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,320
We leave in seven days.

130
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,470
Once this is done,

131
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,890
we will all leave Haidong together.

132
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,710
We can just hide at home,

133
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,590
wait for seven days,

134
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,080
and then leave when the ship comes.

135
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,750
And I'm strong enough now.

136
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,350
You don't need to do this for me.

137
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,560
We're ill.

138
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,350
What's there to be afraid of?
Everyone knows that.

139
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,320
If we can't win or hide,

140
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,800
should we just give ourselves up?

141
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,160
Are you a fool?

142
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,350
We are human, Mi Lan.

143
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:50,230
Humans have thoughts and feelings.

144
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,350
So what if we do?

145
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,870
So what if we don't?

146
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,470
Does it really matter?

147
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,400
Being human

148
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,440
means having family and friends,

149
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,400
responsibilities,

150
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,280
and the ability
to handle you and Weilian.

151
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,870
I am responsible for my little brother.

152
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,480
We need to face this once more.

153
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,870
In any case,

154
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:14,160
I'll return before the ship leaves.

155
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,950
Stay home

156
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,280
and wait for me.

157
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,710
All right?

158
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,040
Okay.

159
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,590
Please take care.

160
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,080
Rest assured, Mr. Shen.

161
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,630
(In their quest for immortality,)

162
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,560
(the Mu family went to Penglai,)

163
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,470
(forming an alliance with the Mo family,
who possessed the Profound Yang Stone,)

164
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,200
(and together
they guarded Jinwu Fusang.)

165
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:14,920
(Due to continuous conflicts between
the Mu family ancestors and the Mo family,)

166
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,520
(they rebelled and left Penglai.)

167
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,630
(Fortunately,
their ancestors took Jinwu Fusang,)

168
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,950
(leading to the Mo family's
downfall overnight. )

169
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,830
(Though the Mu clan
acquired the Jinwu Fusang,)

170
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,870
(they still couldn't break the curse.)

171
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,110
The curse.

172
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,920
Why?

173
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,200
The Mu family must die at 30,

174
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,990
yet Shen Zhiheng can live on.

175
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,350
If fate won't let me change my destiny,

176
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,160
I'll make Shen Zhiheng perish with me.

177
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,560
Not even the deities and heavens

178
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,160
can stop me now.

179
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,950
He agreed to act together

180
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,590
but left me to you.

181
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,110
I don't need being taken care of.

182
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,040
Of course, you don't need it.

183
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,350
Just let me know if you ever do.

184
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,560
Heng.

185
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,040
Long trip?

186
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,400
It was fine.

187
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,110
I've been waiting here for you.

188
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,040
Let's head inside.

189
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,440
Come in, Heng.

190
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:29,320
Heng.

191
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,870
Are you smiling?

192
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,320
I'm about to go

193
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,710
to Haidong Army's prison for you.

194
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,440
Do you think I can still smile?

195
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,160
I think you are smiling.

196
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,080
You seem to be in a good mood.

197
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,920
I've always thought this plan was silly,

198
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,160
but I still came.

199
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,230
The things for my brother.

200
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:53,950
Heng,

201
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,160
you're the best!

202
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,440
Where's Li Yingliang?

203
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,870
He should be here any minute.

204
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,200
But outside in the corridor,

205
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,200
on either side, upstairs and downstairs,

206
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:05,630
they have people lying in wait.

207
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,350
Soon they'll storm in,

208
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,470
take me hostage,
and force you to go with them.

209
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,110
You even rehearsed this whole act?

210
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:12,990
Of course we had to rehearse it.

211
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,630
How else

212
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:15,870
would they believe us?

213
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:19,680
Where are my cigars?

214
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,830
You never showed up,

215
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,160
so they got moldy.

216
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,440
I had to toss them a couple of days ago.

217
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,280
Want some gum?

218
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,990
Just for the taste,

219
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:30,950
not to swallow.

220
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,590
Try some of this.

221
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,920
You little rascal.

222
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,080
Coming.

223
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:52,990
You're not planning
to kidnap me, are you?

224
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,450
This is a private residence.

225
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,230
I'll call the police!

226
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,040
Too fake.

227
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,350
It's just an act,

228
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:02,750
why so serious?

229
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:31,750
Shen…

230
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,320
He's insulting me!

231
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,300
He must have eaten something bad.

232
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,630
He's definitely insulting me!

233
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,400
Think

234
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:50,830
what you want.

235
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,440
Mr. Shen,

236
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,230
didn't expect to see me alive, did you?

237
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,520
Did you dig the hole

238
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:22,990
in the lighthouse with your hands?

239
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,470
You must have thought I died in there.

240
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,630
That lighthouse was a rental,

241
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,830
and the lease was almost up.

242
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:33,200
If the owner found a body in there,

243
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,830
wouldn't that be trouble?

244
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,710
Well, I saved you some trouble then.

245
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,110
Dealing with you alive

246
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,590
is much more of a hassle
than dealing with your corpse.

247
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,590
I was going to let you go,

248
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,990
but you were too impatient.

249
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,950
You didn't have to go through that.

250
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,200
How was I supposed to know
what you were thinking?

251
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,090
One moment you want to kill me,
the next want to release me,

252
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,630
and you keep scaring me.

253
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,520
Ever seen a cat play with a mouse?

254
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,680
Are you saying I'm the mouse?

255
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,400
What do you think?

256
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,430
You…

257
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,870
You're so childish.

258
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,320
Giving up so soon?

259
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,110
That's not like you, Mr. Li.

260
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,180
You sound as if you know me well.

261
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:16,760
I understand people.

262
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:21,870
Boring.

263
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:24,520
So you went through
all that trouble to escape

264
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,320
just to go back

265
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,630
to being Chi Shanying's lackey.

266
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,350
You have a choice, I don't.

267
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,390
It's all about surviving,

268
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,710
and I'm just finding a way
to stay alive.

269
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,840
Well, I hope you manage
to stay alive this time.

270
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,710
Liang.

271
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,680
Please, Mr. Shen.

272
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,840
Miss Mi Lan,

273
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,640
would you like some tea?

274
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,400
Miss Mi Lan?

275
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,710
Miss Mi Lan?

276
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,920
Miss Mi?

277
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,920
Miss Mi Lan!

278
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,920
Miss Mi Lan!

279
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,600
Miss Mi Lan!

280
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,080
Miss Mi!

281
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,510
(Dushan Pavilion)

282
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,710
Miss Mi Lan!

283
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,310
Miss Mi Lan!

284
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,790
Miss Mi Lan…

285
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:37,680
Apologies, Mr. Shen,
but we have to make this look real.

286
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,790
Please understand.

287
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,120
Got a new place.

288
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,100
The Superintendent thinks
you are special.

289
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,440
Ordinary places can't hold you.

290
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,680
Chi Shanying really put in
a lot of effort.

291
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,230
Come along, Mr. Shen.

292
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:25,200
I didn't know this mine pit could be
turned into a cell.

293
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,200
It's quite cool inside.

294
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,750
The air isn't great.

295
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,680
You're not angry, are you?

296
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,480
Afraid I'd be angry
after you lied to me for three years?

297
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,400
There you go again,
bringing up the past.

298
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,840
You're my brother.

299
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,550
Don't be so petty.

300
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,750
If I were petty,

301
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,390
would I have come with you
to this place?

302
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,600
I don't want to be your enemy.

303
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,200
I have no choice but to do this.

304
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,200
I won't be able
to clear my name otherwise.

305
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:03,840
Not only will I lose my property,

306
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,190
but I also won't be able be alive.

307
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,790
So, please understand.

308
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,470
Given my current situation,

309
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,880
it's hard for me to understand you.

310
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:11,790
Please

311
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,550
understand that.

312
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,710
I can't go against
the Superintendent's orders.

313
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,030
Capturing you was his idea,

314
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,790
but I can't afford to offend you either.

315
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,310
So please believe

316
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,600
that I will do everything in my power

317
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,950
to help and protect you.

318
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,230
Let's see how you do.

319
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,750
All right, watch me.

320
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,600
If you need anything, just tell me.

321
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,270
For now, I'm in charge here.

322
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,510
Weilian is cold.

323
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,230
All right.

324
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,270
I'll have someone bring in a blanket.

325
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,080
I'm hungry.

326
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,990
The higher-ups ordered me
to keep you hungry.

327
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,640
They…

328
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,400
They want to weaken you.

329
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:01,030
Fine, I'll find a way.

330
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,920
He's like a trapped animal.

331
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,400
No one's trapping him.

332
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:13,200
He's trapping himself.

333
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,920
(Am I not also a trapped animal?)

334
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,950
(Trapped by family ties.)

335
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,790
(Both trapped animals,)

336
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:23,590
(but it seems I'm at least a bit
more dignified than Li Yingliang.)

337
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,360
(Even if trapped,)

338
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,080
(it's in a more meaningful way.)

339
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:37,920
Hello?

340
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,230
Is this the car rental company?

341
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,390
I'd like to hire a service.

342
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,440
Miss, you've been to several places already.

343
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,270
We charge by the hour.

344
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,440
Are you sure you want to continue?

345
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,750
Keep looking.

346
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,130
We'll be at Shen Mansion in the end.

347
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,510
All right.

348
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,790
This is a confession.

349
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,710
It details how you kidnapped me

350
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,940
and fabricated classified documents.

351
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,110
I wrote everything truthfully.

352
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,470
You just need to sign it.

353
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,750
This confession is only
for Chi Shanying's perusal.

354
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,270
Please, I'm begging you.

355
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,270
I urgently need my name cleared.

356
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:28,880
Once I have power,

357
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,360
I can help you deal with Mu Lihua.

358
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,600
Anything else?

359
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,310
I need to rescue Guisheng.

360
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,320
He's still being detained.

361
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,680
I didn't expect you
to be so loyal to Li Guisheng.

362
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,160
He's different.

363
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,470
I have to save him.

364
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,990
Since you still have a conscience,

365
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:49,840
I'll tell you

366
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,680
I won't sign

367
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,080
the confession.

368
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,840
You clearly brought two documents

369
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,510
but only showed me one.

370
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,440
How can I trust you?

371
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,740
(Open Letter)

372
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,840
This is an open letter.

373
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:11,980
It's not a confession,
but a clarification.

374
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,230
It clarifies that I didn't do this.

375
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:15,950
I know

376
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:18,750
this will affect your reputation,

377
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,920
but I've shown you my sincerity.

378
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:22,130
You want to deal with Mu Lihua.

379
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,310
I've already spoken
to Chi Shanying about it.

380
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,270
Thank you.

381
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,400
Thank you.

382
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,080
Say,

383
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,510
do you think Jingxue and I
can have children?

384
00:24:58,950 --> 00:24:59,920
Probably.

385
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,230
How else would you come to be?

386
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,160
If we do have children,

387
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,550
I'll let you adopt the second one.

388
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:06,750
No, thank you.

389
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:08,680
I'm not into raising kids.

390
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,710
Are you expecting me
to take care of your whole family?

391
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:14,640
No,

392
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,280
I just don't want you to be lonely.

393
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,840
Lonely?

394
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,790
Spare me.

395
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,990
I know you.

396
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:24,030
You're my only brother.

397
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,310
"Everything mentioned above

398
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,470
was done solely by me.

399
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,710
It has nothing to do
with Mr. Li Yingliang."

400
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,790
This is an open letter.

401
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,360
Yes.

402
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,790
This is the best outcome
we can negotiate for now.

403
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,640
But this letter

404
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,320
only proves your innocence.

405
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,460
It doesn't clear me.

406
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:50,160
Getting Shen Zhiheng to sign
a confession is a challenging task.

407
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,230
A monumental one!

408
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,230
Shen Zhiheng is practically caught.

409
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,440
We can let Mu Lihua know.

410
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,270
She'll definitely head to the mine.

411
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,360
Out in the wild,

412
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,610
we can catch them all in one go.

413
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,270
Once they are in our hands,

414
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:10,550
everything will be

415
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:11,990
under our control, right?

416
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,510
You should head back.

417
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,640
Mu Lihua will be here soon.

418
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,840
When Mu Lihua gets here,

419
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,680
I'll try your method.

420
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,950
In that case, Superintendent,

421
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,120
I really need

422
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,520
a trustworthy helper.

423
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,560
You mentioned Li Guisheng…

424
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,510
This is Chi Shanying.

425
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:47,840
Release Li Guisheng.

426
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,550
Go pick him up.

427
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,370
Thank you, Superintendent.

428
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:11,920
(Shen Zhiheng has been secured.)

429
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,840
(All that's left)

430
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,080
(is Mu Lihua.)

431
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,360
Sheng, you've suffered in prison.

432
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,640
I'm fine.

433
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,950
I managed
to persuade the Superintendent.

434
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:42,540
He's finally agreed to release you.

435
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:42,950
Really?

436
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,680
When the secret documents
were made public,

437
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,510
I thought we were done for.

438
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,470
I even thought
I might die in that prison.

439
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,190
I've come up with a plan.

440
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,440
If it works, the Superintendent
will put all his worries to rest.

441
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:55,750
Sheng,

442
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,790
there's no one else I can trust.

443
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,710
Only you can help me with this.

444
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:01,840
Whatever you command,

445
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,980
I'll do it, even if it means
entering the lion's den.

446
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,550
Let's go.

447
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,940
(Haidong 0113)

448
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,440
You've had a rough time inside.

449
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,310
Eat more.

450
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,640
What's wrong, Sheng?

451
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,790
I couldn't sleep in there.

452
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,080
I kept thinking about all the people

453
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,840
we've killed and the things we've done.

454
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:02,270
Was it right?

455
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:08,440
We shouldn't have gone
against Shen Zhiheng from the start.

456
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:11,080
Shouldn't have joined
the Economic Development Committee.

457
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,990
You've had it tough inside.

458
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,230
There's no turning back now.

459
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,160
Even if we could, we can't.

460
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:24,370
Superintendent Chi is meeting
with Mu Lihua.

461
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,030
If all goes well,

462
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,470
Mu Lihua will be at the mine.

463
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,470
If we handle this right,

464
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,390
my feud with Shen Zhiheng
will be over once and for all.

465
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,270
Are they planning to act tonight?

466
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,470
I'd prefer to resolve this
as soon as possible,

467
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,610
but Superintendent needs some arrangements.

468
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:40,990
It'll be tomorrow night.

469
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,160
We'll go together tomorrow.

470
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,200
Sheng,

471
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,680
help me one last time.

472
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:51,880
I'm useless.

473
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,200
I owe a blood debt

474
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,080
I can't repay in this life.

475
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,190
I'll repay it in the next.

476
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,120
Just tell me what you need.

477
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,310
I'll leave Situ Weilian to you.

478
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:06,400
Sheng,

479
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,950
make sure he doesn't come out alive.

480
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:11,600
I know what to do. Don't worry.

481
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,470
Uncle Youwen.

482
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,120
Miss Mi!

483
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,550
Where have you been?

484
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,680
You worried me sick!

485
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,710
I went to rescue Mr. Shen.

486
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,310
Rescue Mr. Shen?

487
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,710
100,000?

488
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,220
How could you waste
Mr. Shen's money?

489
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,270
Well, if you hadn't…

490
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:47,920
My photo is terrible.

491
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:51,580
(Shen Mansion)

492
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,710
Mr. Shen,

493
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,310
I'm coming to save you.

494
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,440
Miss Mi Lan!

495
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,540
(Shen Mansion)

496
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,400
Miss Mi Lan!

497
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,710
Sir! Miss!

498
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,640
Have you seen a young lady,

499
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:28,510
about this tall,

500
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,310
with short hair, carrying a white cane?

501
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,270
No.

502
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,120
No.

503
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:05,200
Let's go.

504
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,600
Ms. Mu,

505
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,880
there's something

506
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,990
I need to confirm with you.

507
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,030
Go ahead.

508
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,470
There's a sinkhole
about 20 kilometers outside the city.

509
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:52,510
It was reported that
a pile of bodies was burned there.

510
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,880
Almost all of them
were soldiers I gave you.

511
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:58,030
Yes, that's true.

512
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,650
You've been pushing my soldiers
to their limits, I see.

513
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,790
That was for our common goal.

514
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:10,790
And did you achieve that goal?

515
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,230
Just give me two more battalions.

516
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,580
You don't have to get involved.
I'll lead them.

517
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:20,830
I guarantee

518
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,640
I'll catch us that Shen Zhiheng.

519
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,790
Two more battalions?

520
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,080
It's the quickest way.

521
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,390
The sooner we get results,

522
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,560
the sooner I can give my family

523
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,960
an explanation.

524
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,680
It'll also help

525
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,520
move your plans forward.

526
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,310
Isn't that a win-win?

527
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,790
Win-win, my foot!

528
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:44,480
My plans?

529
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,830
My plans have changed.

530
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,960
I caught Shen Zhiheng

531
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,640
without you.

532
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:55,000
And there's no need for you
to report to the Mu family whatsoever.

533
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:57,430
Ms. Mu,

534
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:00,150
let me send you
on your way to join them.

535
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,830
Superintendent Chi, don't do this!

536
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,680
Don't do this…

537
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:04,640
Don't…

538
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,980
Darn it all…

539
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,790
You really are…

540
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,520
a good… good dog…

541
00:35:58,810 --> 00:35:59,680
I've got a new master.

542
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,270
Ms. Mu.

543
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:17,200
Pleased to work with you.

544
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:18,870
The pleasure is mine,

545
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,520
Acting Superintendent Wu.

546
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,120
Sheng,

547
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,930
hide the car and find a place
to lie in wait.

548
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,230
Once I bring out
Shen Zhiheng and Situ Weilian,

549
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:45,390
look for an opportunity
to take out Situ Weilian.

550
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:46,750
Understood.

551
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:04,600
Mi Lan?

552
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,710
Tell me

553
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:07,640
where Shen Zhiheng is,

554
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,230
or I'll kill you.

555
00:38:18,674 --> 00:38:21,174
♪Like the care poured by the moonlight♪

556
00:38:21,344 --> 00:38:24,254
