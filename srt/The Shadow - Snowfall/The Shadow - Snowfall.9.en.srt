=Snow Fall=
=Episode 9=

3
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,940
(This drama is purely fictional.)

4
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,600
Please come inside.

5
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,080
Miss Mu, I've already prepared
the experimental machine you requested.

6
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,510
Thank you, Mr. Li.

7
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,320
Miss Mu, what is this?

8
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,760
This is Jinwu Fusang.

9
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,900
According to the ancient book
Classic of the Great Eastern Wilderness,

10
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,230
there's a Fusang tree above Tang Valley.

11
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,710
One sun arrives as another departs,
both carried by Jinwu.

12
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,670
Life thrives wherever light shines.

13
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,160
To other people,
this may just be a myth.

14
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,640
But to the Mu family,

15
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,390
it's actually our faith.

16
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,270
Faith? Oh.

17
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,480
Mr. Li, I wish to know more
about Shen Zhiheng from you.

18
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,160
Miss Mu, you do cherish
every second, huh?

19
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,080
You don't slack at all.

20
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,080
Wild waters and desolate mountains
have long awaited,

21
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,600
all to have a glance at the gentleman.

22
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:16,230
Naturally, I'm raring to go.

23
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,040
Miss Mu, you're knowledgeable indeed.

24
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,080
Mr. Li.

25
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,230
Please.

26
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,110
Please.

27
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,270
Let's go.

28
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:43,780
(Shen Mansion)

29
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,480
Shen.

30
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,380
(Du)

31
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,880
What word is this?

32
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,200
This is "Du."

33
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,150
Du?

34
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,470
Du as in "guide others, guide oneself."

35
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:33,150
I only know the words "Nuo" and "Shen."

36
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,000
So you need
to learn more in the future.

37
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,290
If so, you'll be able
to read in the future.

38
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,760
My parents said I'm blind.

39
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,760
I just need to get married.

40
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,200
I don't need to study.

41
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,510
If so, do you wish to study?

42
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,510
Is it good to study?

43
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,820
You can understand facts
and differentiate between right and wrong.

44
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,590
If you wish to understand the world,

45
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:53,910
you need to study more.

46
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,440
You should teach me, then.

47
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,240
I can teach you.

48
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,560
However, I have a question for you.

49
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,030
Have you ever thought about your future?

50
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:12,880
I haven't.

51
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,490
I dare not think about it either.

52
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,470
People live like how grasses grow.

53
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,320
In this life,

54
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,800
you have to have a goal
that you intend to pursue.

55
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,680
If so, I wish to be someone like you.

56
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,030
I'm afraid you won't understand

57
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,830
no matter how I explain it to you now.

58
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,780
(Yong'an Department Store)

59
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,510
I didn't expect Haidong
to change this much.

60
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,320
Now, they have everything here.

61
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,900
Miss Mu, seems like you're
going to live here for some time.

62
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,680
That'll depend on

63
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,360
whether I can capture
Shen Zhiheng or not.

64
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:55,800
You're right.

65
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,590
I look forward to that day.

66
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,830
Mr. Li, you've offered me
plenty of help.

67
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,990
Our men collaborated with
each other as well.

68
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,020
Let's hope
that it'll end well this time.

69
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,880
I want to thank you
for your constant effort.

70
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,030
I wonder if you're willing
to have a meal with me?

71
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,320
Of course.

72
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,240
Miss Mu, please.

73
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,680
Li Yingliang!

74
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:24,590
Go and deal with Miss Jin.

75
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,030
Mr. Li, I...

76
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,120
Miss Jin!

77
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:31,690
Get out of the way!

78
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,240
Miss Jin!

79
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,270
Miss Jin!

80
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,830
We're on a mission right now.

81
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,510
On a mission?

82
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,200
Is your mission
to shop with that woman?

83
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,440
That's a mission.

84
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,440
- But it's not what you think...
-  Don't talk to me!

85
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,120
Get lost!

86
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,320
Alright.

87
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,630
I'll leave, then.

88
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,270
Here, Miss Mu.

89
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,920
Miss Mu, you came from a distant land.

90
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,950
I wonder if
the liquor here suits your taste.

91
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,490
As the saying goes,
"When in Rome, do as the Romans do".

92
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,320
I'm fine with anything
as long as it's liquor.

93
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,880
Miss Mu, see if
you need any more dishes.

94
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,510
I'm not picky with food.

95
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,120
It's fine as long as there's liquor.

96
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:23,920
Alright.

97
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,510
Miss Mu, let's drink, then.

98
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,030
Miss Mu, I'll fill your cup.

99
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:29,920
Thank you.

100
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,490
The people of Nanwei are tanned,
slim, and not good-looking.

101
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,440
The women of Haidong are better.

102
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,150
Who did you take a liking to?

103
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,710
Of course it's Miss Jin Jingxue
of the Jin family.

104
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,200
She has a foxy look to her.

105
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,760
I was intoxicated by her charm.

106
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,320
I dream about her every day.

107
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,950
Miss Mu, please excuse me.

108
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,390
I need to go to the restroom.

109
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,070
You can leave after finishing our toast.

110
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,060
Let's continue our bet.

111
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,590
- Hurry, place your bets.
- Alright.

112
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,680
Hurry, place your bets.

113
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,680
Hurry.

114
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,320
But she has terrible taste.

115
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,340
She just had to fall for
that lackey, Li Yingliang.

116
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:07,830
He's so lucky.

117
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,390
I suppose she's an inferior good, then.

118
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:11,920
That's right.

119
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,880
Of course.

120
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:13,920
Let's continue.

121
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,760
- Come.
- Place your bets.

122
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,920
Just look at
Jin Jingxue's waist and butt.

123
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm sure all men will fall for that!

124
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,300
Place your bets.

125
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,230
What are you doing?

126
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:36,680
Who are you?

127
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,200
Who's that?

128
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,040
A troublemaker!

129
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,070
Miss Mu, sorry for the wait.

130
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,280
Here, fill his cup.

131
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,520
Here, Miss Mu.

132
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,630
Mr. Li, it must've been
tough on you lately.

133
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,520
Not at all.

134
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,440
Miss.

135
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,590
It's cold.

136
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,990
Why don't you get into the carriage?

137
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,440
It's fine. The liquor
is keeping me warm.

138
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,440
Actually, you don't need
to drink that much

139
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,680
with all those people.

140
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,920
It's not like

141
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,200
I didn't learn anything new
from this trip.

142
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,080
Li Yingliang is bent on
capturing Shen Zhiheng.

143
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:19,630
And, he knows every affair
there is in Haidong.

144
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,400
He's usable.

145
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,160
Do you truly think this Shen Zhiheng

146
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,640
is the person we're looking for?

147
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,350
The Mu family has struggled to pass down
their heritage for hundreds of years.

148
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,950
Each of my predecessor
failed to live beyond the age of 30.

149
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,750
Is it that difficult

150
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,640
to survive?

151
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,160
I won't give up

152
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,990
as long as there's a glimmer of hope.

153
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:54,780
(Haidong Daily)

154
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,780
Mr. Shen, a group of mysterious figures
arrived at Haidong a few days ago.

155
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,040
They went to Haidong Army HQ.

156
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,320
Their leader was a woman

157
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,200
called Mu Lihua.

158
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,160
This is her profile.

159
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,590
This Mu Lihua

160
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,640
is the 32nd successor of the Mu family.

161
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:22,070
The Mu family was originally a tribe
from our country's southwestern region.

162
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,040
After that, for some reason,
their entire family moved abroad.

163
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,630
After operating their business
for over a millennium overseas,

164
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,990
they're now considered a famous family.

165
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,830
Rumor has it that the Mu family

166
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,710
worships the Fusang tree and Sunbird

167
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,750
to acquire supernatural powers.

168
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,320
The ridiculous thing about them

169
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,470
is that every member of the Mu family

170
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,200
fails to live beyond the age of 30.

171
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,400
Mu Lihua is already 28.

172
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,440
If the rumors are true,

173
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,350
Mu Lihua only has
two years left to live.

174
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,800
Have you found out where she lives?

175
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:51,640
I have.

176
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:52,690
It's all in her profile.

177
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,830
She also has a lab in her current place.

178
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,040
The Fusang tree, huh?

179
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,900
(She could hurt me even though
she didn't appear before me.)

180
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,440
(If what Mr. Mo said was true,)

181
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,830
(I'm sure she didn't come in peace.)

182
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,920
(I have to come up with
a countermeasure.)

183
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,920
Buns for sale!

184
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,720
Fresh buns for sale!

185
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,560
Buns for sale!

186
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,990
Fresh buns with loads of fillings!

187
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:36,830
Give me five buns.

188
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:37,950
Alright, sir.

189
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,520
Fresh buns for sale!

190
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,400
They're piping hot!

191
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,160
I guarantee

192
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,350
you'll come again after trying my buns.

193
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,470
Please put another layer of paper.

194
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:53,860
- Alright.
- It's cold.

195
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:54,640
Don't get cold.

196
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,320
Here, sir. Here you go.

197
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:02,870
Thank you.

198
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:03,640
Thank you.

199
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,440
Buns for sale!

200
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,710
Fresh buns for sale!

201
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:26,440
Mr. Shen?

202
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,040
Mi Lan.

203
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:31,950
- Take a sniff.
- Buns?

204
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,680
Here's your breakfast.

205
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:34,920
Here.

206
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,440
Mi Lan,

207
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,590
I need to leave Haidong for a few days.

208
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,680
Let me join you, then.

209
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,230
I have plenty of business to attend to
this time around.

210
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,590
If Haidong is no longer
a suitable place for us,

211
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,870
we have to leave.

212
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,080
Are we going to move?

213
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,420
That's probably what we should do.

214
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,950
I've already told Madam Zhang about it.

215
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,590
You should follow her home first.

216
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,630
Is it because of Mr. Li?

217
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,000
It has nothing to do with Li Yingliang.

218
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,950
Chi Shanying managed
to hire someone formidable.

219
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,920
I need to deal with her.

220
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:23,870
If so,

221
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,750
is there anything I can help?

222
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,920
Yeah.

223
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,110
Get out!

224
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,040
Miss Mi, be careful.

225
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,100
I knew you detested me for being blind.

226
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,600
- What's going on?
- You think I'm a drag.

227
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,340
You're right.

228
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,680
I allowed you to get your way

229
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,620
because you were young.

230
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,160
I never expected you
to be so full of yourself!

231
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,230
Mr. Shen, calm down!

232
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:52,750
Back then I risked my life to save you!

233
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,040
I was wrong about you!

234
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,040
I regret it so much!

235
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,680
You're the cause of all my troubles!

236
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,400
- What's going on?
- Stop arguing.

237
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:58,920
It's strange.

238
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,750
I cause trouble for you?

239
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,730
Madam Zhang, look at her.

240
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,160
Someone

241
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,590
poured ink at the Shen Mansion

242
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,120
(Shen Mansion)
just because I took her in!

243
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,550
That has nothing to do with me!

244
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,290
It's because
you criticized too many people.

245
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,600
Return to the Mi Mansion, then.

246
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,080
Mr. Shen!

247
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:10,750
There's no one!

248
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,920
It's peaceful and quiet!

249
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,190
- Don't say that!
- Fine by me!

250
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,030
There's nothing good about this place.

251
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,020
Although you're rich,

252
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,920
you only feed me buns!

253
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,750
At night, it's as cold as an ice cellar.

254
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,840
You're so stingy.

255
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,470
You didn't even provide me
with a heater!

256
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,360
Miss Mi!

257
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,790
Mr. Shen, please forgive her.

258
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:26,600
Stop it.

259
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,740
Miss Mi, don't act like this.

260
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,220
- Stop arguing.
- Madam Zhang, let's go.

261
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,430
- Miss Mi, don't be like this. You...
- I've fallen out with him!

262
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,470
She fell out with him?

263
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,950
I don't wish to see you again either.

264
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,470
I'll leave Haidong tomorrow.

265
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,080
Mr. Shen!

266
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,440
Mr. Shen...

267
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,030
Miss Mi, slow down!

268
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,310
What exactly is going on?

269
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,990
What's with the heated argument?

270
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,270
He was nice to you.

271
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,360
Why would you two argue for no reason?

272
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,120
Miss Mi, it wouldn't be an argument

273
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,670
had you not continued the conversation.

274
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,640
Why did you two argue?

275
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,270
Let's go.

276
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,360
I didn't expect this lass
to be so good at arguing.

277
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,360
I mustn't offend her in the future.

278
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,920
I can't afford the consequences.

279
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,100
(Mi Mansion)

280
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,790
Miss Mi,

281
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,880
Mr. Shen will come back, right?

282
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,160
He won't just ignore you, right?

283
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:13,640
He won't.

284
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,030
He'll definitely come back.

285
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:29,840
Miss Mi,

286
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,990
I've laid your bed for you.

287
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,680
You should rest early.

288
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,950
You know where Mr. Mo is, right?

289
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:09,920
Are you willing to lead the way?

290
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:32,260
(Shen Zhiheng's Name Was Cleared)

291
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,790
Shen Zhiheng left?

292
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,510
To put it more accurately, he escaped.

293
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,080
Our men in front of Shen Mansion

294
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,790
overheard Shen Zhiheng saying
that he wasn't returning to Haidong.

295
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,370
He's not returning to Haidong?

296
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,600
You can go wherever you like

297
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,640
as long as you have money.

298
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,840
Besides, it's only been three years
since he came to Haidong.

299
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,200
It's not impossible for him
to leave the place.

300
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,510
What about Mi Lan, then?

301
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,120
She was sent back to the Mi Mansion.

302
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,190
I don't think he intends
to take Mi Lan with him.

303
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,640
What about Situ Weilian?

304
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,470
I think Situ Weilian isn't as close
to him compared to Mi Lan.

305
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,790
He even doesn't know
that Shen Zhiheng left the place.

306
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,230
He went to Shen Mansion at night.

307
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,090
He was confused when he saw
that no one was there.

308
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,310
(Shen Zhiheng,)

309
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,750
(our feud isn't settled yet.)

310
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:44,140
(Haidong Army HQ)

311
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,590
(Wealthy Blind Woman's Infatuation
With Media Tycoon Leads to Rejection)

312
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,030
Superintendent, it's been many days,

313
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,590
yet there's still no news
of Shen Zhiheng.

314
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,160
I traveled all the way here

315
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,080
to find this Shen Zhiheng.

316
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,470
Now, you're telling me
he's nowhere to be found?

317
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,590
It's obvious that your subordinates
didn't keep a close eye on him.

318
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,950
You have to give me an account somehow.

319
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,550
So, Miss Mu, according to you,

320
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,640
do we have to tell you

321
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,360
where Shen Zhiheng is at all times,

322
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:20,880
is that so?

323
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,880
Naturally, I dare not do so.

324
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,440
But you know this too.

325
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,360
Since I came to Haidong personally,

326
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,300
you can see how much attention

327
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,780
our family is paying to this case.

328
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,550
You're able to get
to where you are today

329
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,120
with the help

330
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,200
of our family's financial strength.

331
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,950
I spent a lot of effort on this,

332
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,080
and now, you want me
to return empty-handed?

333
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,230
Do you think that's appropriate?

334
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,230
Did you understand Miss Mu's request?

335
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,790
Find Shen Zhiheng.

336
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:58,160
Locate his whereabouts

337
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,840
no matter where he went.

338
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,120
Yes, sir.

339
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,120
Miss Mu, what if

340
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,710
they can't find Shen Zhiheng either?

341
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,120
Shen Zhiheng has no way

342
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,270
to shift his base out of Haidong.

343
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,840
It's impossible for him

344
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,400
to give up on his enterprise in Haidong.

345
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,160
We just arrived at Haidong.

346
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,360
We must keep a low profile.

347
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,440
As long as Chi Shanying
can locate Shen Zhiheng,

348
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,750
he can help us

349
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,880
to break the curse on our family.

350
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,230
Mr. Mo.

351
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,400
I'm Shen Zhiheng.

352
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,990
I've encountered the descendant
of the Mu family.

353
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,600
You said you touched something

354
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,990
that scorched you at Mu Lihua's place?

355
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:03,920
What does it look like?

356
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,750
It looks like a tree.

357
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:08,360
It's made with gold.
It gave out a red light.

358
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:09,920
It was placed on an altar.

359
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,390
It resembled an item of worship.

360
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:13,880
Its energy

361
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:17,920
resembles the energy
you showed me last time.

362
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,510
You're candid and honest.

363
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,800
Mr. Mo, you know everything
about the Mu family and my aunt.

364
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,470
You even know about the origin
of the three meteor shards.

365
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,200
And, you possess the same energy too.

366
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,880
I'm sure you're not an outsider.

367
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,090
I didn't intend to hide this
from you anyway.

368
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,510
But what's the point
of obtaining such power?

369
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:39,680
In the end, the Mu family
still stole the Profound Yang Stone.

370
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,920
Back then, after my ancestor
obtained the stone,

371
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,500
according to the description
of the ancient book,

372
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,950
on the Tanggu Valley, there is a Fusang tree,

373
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:48,490
where the ten suns take their baths,
located to the north of the Black Teeth.

374
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:51,550
So the Fusang tree came into shape.

375
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,470
It's the item

376
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,440
you saw at Mu Lihua's place.

377
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,990
Although the members of
the Mu family aren't immortals,

378
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,890
due to the influence
of the Profound Yang Stone,

379
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,200
we have strong bodies
and long lifespans.

380
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,160
The only hardship we have to endure

381
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,550
is to overcome countless trials

382
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,920
and ordeals to harness its power.

383
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:10,360
Sometimes, death is the better option.

384
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,790
Now, my aunt and
younger brother are missing.

385
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,080
I'm still looking for them.

386
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,030
Mu Lihua came with sinister intentions.

387
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,400
What about you, Mr. Mo?

388
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,680
Both of us are trying
to trace our roots here.

389
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,690
The Profound Yang Stone
was stolen from us.

390
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,030
Although the members of the Mu family
still retain its power,

391
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,640
its power has been diminished greatly
during my generation.

392
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:35,790
Therefore, Mu Lihua's appearance
is mysterious and perplexing.

393
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,030
You and I must consider carefully
before we engage her in a battle.

394
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,630
Regarding how much the descendants
of the Mu family

395
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,600
know about what happened in the past

396
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,790
and her abilities,

397
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,030
I can test them out.

398
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,470
However, this is very risky.

399
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,200
Since the past

400
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,880
has caught up to me,

401
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,920
I won't shirk my responsibilities.

402
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,200
Mr. Mo,

403
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,080
I'm grateful to you

404
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,160
for all the information.

405
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,990
Although I have to take a risk,

406
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,270
I need to do this personally.

407
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,950
Miss Jin,

408
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,400
dinner is ready.

409
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,190
I'm not hungry yet.
Wait for a while.

410
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,120
Alright.

411
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,470
Dr. Situ?

412
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,680
You're here again.

413
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,710
Hello, Tao.

414
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,080
Jingxue.

415
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,400
Situ?

416
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,550
This is for you.

417
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,080
Why did you bring me gifts again?

418
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,030
Take a look.

419
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,950
What is this?

420
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,780
The nurses at the hospital

421
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,840
love to knit sweaters together.

422
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,320
I thought you needed this.

423
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,870
I'll try to learn it, then.

424
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,910
Did you just return from the hospital?

425
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,490
Yeah. I've been working the entire day.

426
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:57,110
I'm starving now.

427
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,190
You're here to sponge off me again, huh?

428
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:00,960
Tao, let's eat.

429
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,350
Alright, Miss Jin.

430
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,260
Let's eat.

431
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,080
Alright.

432
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:06,590
Eat up.

433
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:11,910
Why have you been

434
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,430
more hardworking lately?

435
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,890
You get off work so late every day.

436
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,350
Shen is gone.

437
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,240
Is he dead?

438
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,720
No. Shen went out of town.

439
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,670
Could it be that he supported you?

440
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:29,480
That's not it.

441
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,720
Sometimes, he needs my help too.

442
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,560
But now that he's not here,

443
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,110
I have nothing else to do.

444
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,580
So I can only
head to the hospital.

445
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,830
Your father is Situ He.

446
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:43,150
The Situ family is considered
a renowned family.

447
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,990
But it looked like
you never returned home.

448
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,390
I don't feel like going back.

449
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:47,480
I like your place.

450
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,590
I like Shen's place as well.

451
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:50,580
You like this place?

452
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,350
I do.

453
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:54,910
Let me ask you this, then.

454
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:57,350
What if you no longer
like this place one day?

455
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,870
Will you stop coming here, then?

456
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:00,790
What do you mean by that?

457
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,630
We're acquaintances already.

458
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,430
I may look like
I have plenty of friends,

459
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,020
but I only consider few
as real friends.

460
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:09,040
I'm afraid
that you might not show up again

461
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,190
once I drag you in,

462
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,760
just like what you did with
the Situ family and Shen Zhiheng.

463
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:14,670
Of course not.

464
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:17,630
But you said that you had a close
relationship with Shen Zhiheng.

465
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:18,890
You said you two were like brothers.

466
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,080
He's gone now.

467
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,390
Have you looked for him?

468
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,800
Why should I?

469
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,320
Is that important?

470
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,000
I don't know whether or not
this is important to him,

471
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:29,190
but it's important to me.

472
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:29,910
Jingxue,

473
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,110
don't worry.

474
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,350
If you do go missing one day,

475
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,490
I'll definitely look for you.

476
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,480
Have some soup.

477
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,200
Get me some celery.

478
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,260
- Alright.
- Mr. Li.

479
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,720
Besides Mi Lan, the last person
who saw Shen Zhiheng

480
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
was this Madam Zhang.

481
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,800
Now, Shen Zhiheng is missing.

482
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:01,870
Mi Lan might not know
where Shen Zhiheng is.

483
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,590
Madam Zhang

484
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,190
is our only lead.

485
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,280
Madam Zhang.

486
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,830
Was your mistress

487
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,720
truly abandoned by Mr. Shen?

488
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,870
Who said so?

489
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:15,240
The entire Haidong is talking about it.

490
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,390
Miss Mi caused a commotion
at the Shen Mansion.

491
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,560
It was a huge commotion.

492
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,280
She was as feisty as her mother.

493
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,110
That's why Mr. Shen chased her out.

494
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:25,350
She's already a shrew at such an age.

495
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,960
No one in Haidong
dares to marry her.

496
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,100
What are you talking about?

497
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,540
Mr. Shen

498
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,000
didn't chase her out!

499
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:31,960
He didn't?

500
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,240
Why did they argue, then?

501
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,960
Your master and madam aren't around.

502
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:36,450
Do you even have enough money to live?

503
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,910
How is this your business?

504
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,190
It's none of your business.

505
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:40,720
This...

506
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,920
Listen!

507
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,640
They have a great relationship!

508
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,120
He even gave us living expenses!

509
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:47,310
Mr. Shen is just on a long trip.

510
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,640
He'll come back and pick us up!

511
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,030
I won't buy anything from you.

512
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,400
You keep spouting nonsense!

513
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,880
I won't buy anything from you.

514
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,310
Stop pretending.

515
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,600
You badmouthed Madam Mi before this.

516
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,310
Leave, then.

517
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,790
Madam Zhang, is that you?

518
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,470
Yes.

519
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,310
It's me.

520
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:28,710
Mr. Li?

521
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,400
Mi Lan,

522
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,950
you're truly
the most intelligent girl I've ever seen.

523
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,710
Mr. Li, Dad went to the South.

524
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:01,920
He's not home.

525
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,160
I'm not here to look for your father.

526
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:05,680
Mi Lan,

527
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:07,310
since you're this smart,

528
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,200
I'm sure you know my intention.

529
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,360
I don't know.

530
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:15,030
Where did Shen Zhiheng go?

531
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,710
I don't know.

532
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,030
Mi Lan,

533
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,550
it's wrong to lie.

534
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:24,750
My father is gone.

535
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,360
My mother is gone too.

536
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,890
Now, I won't need
to endure a beating again.

537
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:32,160
I just wish to live alone in peace.

538
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,150
I don't want to get involved
in your conflict with him.

539
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,360
Shen Zhiheng took you to his mansion

540
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:39,440
and treated you like a princess.

541
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:41,750
How could you not know anything?

542
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,920
I'm just a blind girl.

543
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:47,030
He didn't give me
a princess's treatment either.

544
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,920
He abandoned me.

545
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,640
We fell out with each other.

546
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,950
How would I know about his whereabouts?

547
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,920
I was humiliated.

548
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:14,640
Do you truly take me for a fool?

549
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,260
Mr. Li,

550
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,680
Mr. Shen never paid any attention
to you at all.

551
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,200
Why are you still trying to pester him?

552
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:31,790
Li Guisheng.

553
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:32,710
Beat her.

554
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,360
Don't do that!

555
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,200
Tell me.

556
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,440
Where is Shen Zhiheng?

557
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,750
Mi Lan, do you know
the kind of person Shen Zhiheng is?

558
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,470
Do you know what he has done or what

559
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:01,360
he even looks like?

560
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,600
You know nothing!

561
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,550
You don't know

562
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,640
if he's lying to you or not.

563
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,360
Why are you still trying to defend him?

564
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,400
Tell me.

565
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,880
Where is Shen Zhiheng?

566
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:23,600
Continue.

567
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:29,080
Stop beating her!

568
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,510
I'll tell you!

569
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,980
I'll tell you!

570
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,200
Miss Mi has no idea where Mr. Shen is.

571
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,520
Mr. Shen just said

572
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,840
- he would come back and pick her up.
- Madam Zhang!

573
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,090
I'll wait for him together with you.

574
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:33,060
(Mi Mansion)

575
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:15,390
Shen Zhiheng!

576
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:28,790
Mi Lan!

577
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:40,640
Mr. Shen, long time no see.

578
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,790
You're really obsessed with me, huh?

579
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,480
I'm more than just obsessed with you.

580
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:48,750
I've literally devoted myself to you.

581
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,520
Look at the big fuss we have over here.

582
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:52,000
What else do you want to do?

583
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:53,450
Do you want to kill me again?

584
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:54,600
No.

585
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,230
How could I do so?

586
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,120
This time,

587
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,000
you just need to follow us back.

588
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,750
I know you're powerful.

589
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,960
But look at all the guns here.

590
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:08,430
No matter how powerful you are,
you'll never be as fast as my bullets.

591
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,520
Even if you can escape,

592
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:13,390
she can't.

593
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:36,040
You don't need to do so.

594
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,270
I'll just follow you.

595
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:39,910
Do not harm her.

596
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:41,680
Of course.

597
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,750
