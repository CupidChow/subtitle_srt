=Episode 11=

3
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,940
(This drama is purely fictional.)

4
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,990
I advise you not to make any rash moves.

5
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,910
The collar
around your neck is electrified.

6
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,000
If you dare to make a wrong move,
I will electrocute you.

7
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,320
We're the only ones in this dungeon.

8
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,190
If it comes to it,
we can just die together.

9
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,600
From now on,

10
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,200
you will answer whatever I ask.

11
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,760
Give me some clothes.

12
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,070
It's not cold here.

13
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,910
You won't freeze to death.

14
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,830
It's crude to talk in this state.

15
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Do you really want to face me like this?

16
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,230
Sure.

17
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,440
I'm not a woman.

18
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,280
Not only are you not a woman,

19
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,630
but you're even not human.

20
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,390
What is your true form?

21
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,310
Reveal your true form.

22
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,380
Stand up and take a few steps.

23
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,280
Extend your claws.

24
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,350
Show your tail.

25
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,560
Now, with both witnesses and evidence,

26
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,440
what more excuses do you have?

27
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,820
Why are you still pretending
to be human?

28
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,000
You better behave and listen to me.

29
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,720
If you dare to pull any more tricks,

30
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:17,200
I'll lock you up here until you behave.

31
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,600
In any case,

32
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,350
I will deal with you until the end.

33
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,280
I want some water.

34
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,200
No.

35
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,560
I want to see Chi Shanying.

36
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,950
Stop pulling tricks here!

37
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,540
If you want to say,
just say it.

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,320
Then, just give me some clothes.

39
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,390
I can't answer without clothes.

40
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,380
You're not even human.
Why would you need clothes?

41
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,390
You keep staring at me.

42
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,780
Even if you don't feel embarrassed,
I do feel a sense of shame.

43
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,790
Shame?

44
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,320
Well, that's the right emotion.

45
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,070
Aren't you a big shot?

46
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,790
Aren't you a socialite?

47
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,560
You think you're above me
just because of your wealth and power?

48
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:55,910
Fine.

49
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,560
I'm here to humiliate you,
the so-called big shot and socialite.

50
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,380
So what if you have money and power?

51
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,040
You're still here, stripped down.

52
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,390
All right, you've succeeded.

53
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,790
You've humiliated me.

54
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,320
At least could you give me some clothes?

55
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:15,720
Beg me.

56
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,390
Mr. Li.

57
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,120
Please give me some clothes.

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,030
I'm not giving you any.

59
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,270
You're so childish.

60
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,320
Remember what you said.

61
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,190
I'll let you have some clothes on.

62
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,680
You'll cooperate with me.

63
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,390
Bring some clothes down here.

64
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:00,470
Yes, Mr. Li.

65
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,150
Miss, Mr Li's men asked me
to come get you.

66
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,190
Shen Zhiheng was willing
to cooperate with the interrogation.

67
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,800
That's great.

68
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,760
Let's go.

69
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,880
Miss, you're activating the ring.

70
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,200
That's a family curse.

71
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,320
You shouldn't use it.

72
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,710
How am I not aware of that?

73
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,880
Our ancestors advised us

74
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,120
to use it cautiously.

75
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,390
But if I don't use

76
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,320
the power of the Fantasy Stone,

77
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,950
how can I catch Shen Zhiheng?

78
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:36,560
Let's go.

79
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,830
What are you looking at?

80
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,560
I'm trying to figure out

81
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,470
if there's some deep-seated grudge
between us

82
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,710
that makes you chase after me
so relentlessly.

83
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,800
Because you're a monster.

84
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,710
Your status as a big shot
and socialite is all an act.

85
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,200
They are all fake.

86
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,440
And a thing like you dare
to look down on me?

87
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,880
Well, I did not.

88
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,830
You're overthinking it.

89
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,510
Forget it.

90
00:07:59,070 --> 00:07:59,950
I don't care anyway.

91
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:00,950
Tell me.

92
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,070
What are you?

93
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,560
I don't know either.

94
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,510
When my father was young,

95
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,120
he met a woman outside.

96
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,560
She later became pregnant

97
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,830
and gave birth to a son.

98
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,120
Father brought them home.

99
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,360
I called her Madam Shen.

100
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:25,590
Greetings, Mother.

101
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,390
But Grandmother didn't like her.

102
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,950
Eventually, Grandmother discovered

103
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,490
she secretly killing chickens
and drinking their blood at night.

104
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,680
She suspected they were monsters.

105
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,540
So she tied them up

106
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,920
while Father was away.

107
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,280
Capture these two monsters.

108
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,280
Heng, help!

109
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,590
Help, Heng!

110
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,160
Grandmother, please let
my little brother and Madam Shen go.

111
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,800
They haven't harmed anyone.

112
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,180
When they do,
it will be too late for regrets.

113
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:57,660
Get up!

114
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,520
Grandmother!

115
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,720
Old Madam,

116
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,640
I know you don't like me.

117
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,470
But the child is still young.

118
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,700
When Hongxing returns,

119
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,070
how will you explain this?

120
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,520
In the Shen Mansion,

121
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,800
I have the final say.

122
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,260
I don't need to explain to him.

123
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,320
Light the fire!

124
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,560
- Heng, save me!
- No, don't!

125
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,520
Let my son go!

126
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,160
Heng!

127
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,400
Mother!

128
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,710
Let my son go!

129
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,020
Let him go!

130
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,160
Let him go!

131
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:27,750
Let him go!

132
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,750
Mother!

133
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,920
- Save me!
- Let my son go!

134
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:31,920
Save me!

135
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,750
Son!

136
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,920
Mother!

137
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,520
- Let my son go!
- Let him go!

138
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,710
Grandmother!

139
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,920
- Mother!
- I'll kill all of you!

140
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,020
(Shen Ancestral Hall)

141
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,950
(Madam Shen went berserk)

142
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,080
(and started a killing spree.)

143
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,920
(I got this illness)

144
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,950
after that injury.

145
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,040
Then where are they now?

146
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,680
They're dead.

147
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,870
It looks like you're the only survivor.

148
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,110
How old are you?

149
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,230
I haven't calculated it in a long time.

150
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,560
After I turned 100,

151
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,200
I haven't kept track of time since then.

152
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,200
You're over 100.

153
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,470
But you look like you're 30.

154
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,930
Perhaps it's because
I have everything going for

155
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,520
and nothing to worry about.

156
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,560
When I first met you,

157
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,320
I thought

158
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,920
you were my age.

159
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,320
The Shen family isn't some wealthy,
powerful household.

160
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,990
In over a hundred years,

161
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,950
the family fortune must be long spent.

162
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,680
But I'm good at making money.

163
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,200
To be honest,

164
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,520
I do make quite a bit.

165
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,830
Unlike you

166
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,680
who only rob.

167
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,040
Honestly,

168
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,440
now that I see you like this,

169
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:02,040
I feel that all the grudges

170
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,560
between us don't really matter anymore.

171
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,920
Grudges?

172
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,200
I thought our relationship was simple.

173
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,320
It's either you kill me, or I kill you.

174
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,200
So you do hate me.

175
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,750
Of course, I hate you!

176
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,940
And you still have the time

177
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,060
to argue with me.

178
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,320
From what I saw earlier,

179
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,350
I thought you might actually be sad.

180
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,560
It looks like you are heartbroken.

181
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,890
Do you need a tissue for your tears?

182
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,160
You don't need to worry about my eyes.

183
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,400
You should think about your future.

184
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,160
The interrogation ends here today.

185
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,200
We'll serve you a proper meal soon.

186
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,950
Mr. Shen suddenly becomes so polite

187
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,320
that I don't fear him as much.

188
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,990
You can keep him company then.

189
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,320
That's not necessary.

190
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,280
Where's Miss Mu?

191
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,350
Is she here?

192
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,230
She was here just now.

193
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,560
She listened for a while and left.

194
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,950
I'll report to Superintendent Chi.

195
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,040
Give him his meal.

196
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:49,960
Yes, sir.

197
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,520
Do you still remember me?

198
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,520
A deep impression.

199
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,560
That night,

200
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,400
I was the one
who fired those rounds of shots.

201
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,040
Li Yingliang seems to trust you a lot.

202
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,400
I'm loyal to him.

203
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,920
So of course he trusts me.

204
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,830
How old are you this year?

205
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,040
Exactly 30 years old.

206
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,560
Why?

207
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,830
That night, I saw how agile you were.

208
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,280
You were ruthless and decisive.

209
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,070
As expected of an experienced
and seasoned expert.

210
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,520
You have a good eye.

211
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,830
How much do you earn

212
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,400
under Li Yingliang each month?

213
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,800
Do wealthy people really care so much

214
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,560
about how much others earn?

215
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,230
Don't get me wrong.

216
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,640
I'm just impressed
by your skills and courage.

217
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,830
If one day

218
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,040
you get married

219
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,520
and want a more stable job,

220
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,200
you can come to work for me.

221
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,230
I've always needed someone like you.

222
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,870
What makes you think

223
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,620
you can leave this place alive?

224
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,640
At first, you wanted to kill me

225
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,460
because I refused to cooperate

226
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,520
and insulted you.

227
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,040
That's easily solved.

228
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,320
At worst,

229
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,280
I'll just cooperate with you.

230
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,230
You're too optimistic.

231
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,040
Who would want to cooperate

232
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,710
with a thing like you?

233
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,870
Just relax and rest.

234
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,020
(Dangui Theater)

235
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,940
(Dangui Theater)

236
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,230
Excuse me, mister.

237
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,320
We're closed.

238
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,270
Turn off the lights and get some rest.

239
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,360
With the lights off,
you can't see anything.

240
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,030
It's fine.

241
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:19,750
Go ahead.

242
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:21,880
All right.

243
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,440
Do we really have a grudge
against each other?

244
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,640
Of course, we do,

245
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,880
Mr. Shen.

246
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,440
Mr. Shen, I'm here to serve you.

247
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,200
Young man, what's your name?

248
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,030
Liang.

249
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:18,920
Thank you.

(Longchun Opera House)

251
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:24,600
Liang,

252
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:25,440
you're home.

253
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:26,880
Xiao,

254
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,120
what are you doing here?

255
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,600
You can't catch a chill.

256
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,030
Come home with me now.

257
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,550
I don't want to.

258
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,270
Liang,

259
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,710
I've been practicing all day

260
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,160
just to sing it to you.

264
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:49,550
Xiao,

265
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,840
I met Mr. Shen today.

266
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,950
He promised me

267
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,780
that he'll help cure your illness.

268
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,790
Really?

269
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:57,600
Yes.

270
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,140
Mr. Shen?

271
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,750
Mr. Shen, you're here.

272
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,260
Mr. Shen, what's this...

273
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,030
This...

274
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,790
Take it.

275
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,750
Buy medicine for your sister.

276
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,990
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

277
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:19,840
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

278
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,030
Mr. Shen, please enjoy.

279
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,490
If you need anything else, let me know.

280
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,840
Thank you, Liang.

281
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,550
Run!

282
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,040
The bandits have broken in!

283
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,120
Oh, no! My sister.

284
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,320
Run!

285
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,920
This way!

286
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,790
Run!

287
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,360
Xiao, don't be scared. I'm here.

288
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:52,920
Xiao,

289
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,790
I'll bring you to Mr. Shen.

290
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:07,990
Mr. Shen.

291
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:08,890
Don't come any closer!

292
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,550
Mr. Shen, I'm Liang.

293
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,160
My sister is bleeding profusely.

294
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,550
Can you save her?

295
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,360
Mr. Shen!

296
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,080
Please save her, Mr. Shen!

297
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,400
Mr. Shen has given us

298
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,400
a lot of help.

299
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,360
It's just that my illness is severe.

300
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,120
If Mr. Shen refuses to save you,
I'll save you.

301
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,640
I'll find the best doctor.

302
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,470
He can definitely cure your illness.

303
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:43,840
Xiao.

304
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,080
Xiao!

305
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,640
Xiao!

(Haidong Army HQ)

307
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:11,160
His cells divide rapidly,

308
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,160
and have a strong regenerative ability,

309
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,270
so his wounds heal quickly.

310
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,800
If we can find

311
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,310
Shen Zhiheng's extraordinary secrets

312
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,880
and use them to our advantage,

313
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,160
wouldn't that be great?

314
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,440
To find out exactly what he is,

315
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:36,070
we should give him
a comprehensive medical examination.

316
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,590
Won't that reveal the truth?

317
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,560
We'll do as Miss Mu suggested.

318
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,490
I'll make the arrangements.

319
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,320
Sir, what's the matter?

320
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,430
What do you think

321
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,630
the material

322
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:07,800
of Mu Lihua's ring is made from?

323
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:10,910
How did it manage
to make Shen Zhiheng surrender easily?

324
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:14,390
I'm not sure.

325
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,040
But it's not surprising
for someone

326
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,090
with special abilities
to have some unusual items.

327
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,320
There's something off about this woman.

328
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,630
We need to be cautious around her.

329
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,760
Especially you,
since you spend a lot of time with her.

330
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,860
You should be more cautious.

331
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,870
Look for a chance to ask her

332
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,150
about what that ring is made of.

333
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,090
But don't raise her suspicions.

334
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,320
Yes, sir.

335
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:16,520
What's so funny?

336
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,480
What's your problem?

337
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,350
Oh, nothing.

338
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,480
Are you so full
that you're infatuated?

339
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,590
You didn't come all the way down

340
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,040
just to yell at me, did you?

341
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,040
Can't I?

342
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,390
Of course, you can't.

343
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,690
I'm here to scold you.
What are you going to do about it?

344
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,870
As for you,

345
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,520
if spoken highly, you're a monster.

346
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,150
If spoken simply, you're just an animal.

347
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:45,760
What's the difference between you
and a stray cat or dog on the street?

348
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:50,000
Laugh all you want.

349
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,190
I wonder if I owe you from a past life
for you to be mocking me like this.

350
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,350
Unreasonable.

351
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,550
Superintendent Chi wants you
to go through an examination.

352
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,320
The health team
from headquarters

353
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,710
will take some blood samples,

354
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,360
check your teeth, and examine your eyes.

355
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,990
But with so few staff
and limited equipment, the check-up

356
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,910
won't reveal much.

357
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,920
This examination is pointless.

358
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,990
Superintendent Chi knew it.

359
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,390
You don't need to waste your breath.

360
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,400
So what's next?

361
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,400
What do you mean?

362
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,120
Are you planning
to keep me here indefinitely,

363
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,710
kill me, or release me?

364
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,230
Does it matter to you?

365
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,230
We'll do as we please.

366
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,360
Just endure it.

367
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,230
You seem unhappy today.

368
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,710
It's none of your business.

369
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,080
I'm doing this because I trust you

370
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,230
and see you as a person.

371
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,360
Don't be ungrateful.

372
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,600
If you want to escape, that's fine.

373
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,640
We can both die together
if it comes to that.

374
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,840
Your heartbeat is

375
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,750
very strong.

376
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,710
What's that on your finger?

377
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,880
Miss Mu, we've set up the X-ray machine.

378
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,640
Mr. Shen,

379
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,080
this way, please.

380
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:39,880
(You mentioned)

381
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,680
(that you're close to Shen Zhiheng,
like family.)

382
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,990
(Now, he's missing.)

383
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,030
(Have you looked for him?)

384
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,510
(It's not like Shen has never left
Haidong before.)

385
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,230
(Besides, he's so capable.)

386
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:50,920
(That's not right.)

387
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,440
(Since Shen has been entangled
with Li Yingliang,)

388
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,670
(he hasn't been able to live
as freely as he used to.)

389
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,750
(Shen Mansion)
(Shen has been away for quite a while.)

390
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,080
(Did something bad happen to him?)

391
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,230
I'm taking a big risk

392
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,080
by being so close to you

393
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,120
because I know

394
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,680
you're not afraid of dying with me.

395
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,600
You don't die that easily too.

396
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,120
Are you scared of me?

397
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,440
My fear of you is just like

398
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,200
my fear of lions and tigers.

399
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,400
For a thing like you,

400
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,190
you're still just a wild beast
no matter how powerful you are.

401
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,440
You should be feeling sorry
for yourself.

402
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,920
I'm used to it.

403
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,360
So I'm not sad.

404
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,310
You won't have a good end.

405
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,590
When lions and tigers roam
into human territory,

406
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,120
they either get caged in a zoo
or end up dead.

407
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:41,990
It's true.

408
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,640
You won't have a good end.

409
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,160
You've just randomly berated me

410
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,270
and now you're cursing me.

411
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,120
What's next?

412
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:53,990
Are you going to torture me?

413
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,270
You lied to me.

414
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,440
If I were to torture you,
you wouldn't feel wronged.

415
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,840
Again, you say I lied to you,

416
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,510
I've always
thought we had little interaction.

417
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,750
Did I forget, or did you get it wrong?

418
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,510
When have I ever lied to you?

419
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,360
You did lie to me.

420
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,600
I once held you in high regard,

421
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,550
thinking you were a respectable person.

422
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,120
But look at you now.

423
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,680
What is this if it's not a lie?

424
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,990
Well,

425
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,230
I can't argue with that.

426
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,510
People like you,

427
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,360
always scheming and deceiving.

428
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,950
You don't have
a single true friend or family around you.

429
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,080
Aren't you tired of living like this?

430
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,600
Don't you feel like ending your life?

431
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:40,790
Why?

432
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,750
Does it hit a nerve?

433
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,080
It's painful.

434
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,200
I want to die.

435
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,200
But it's all right.

436
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,400
I'm already used to it.

437
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,200
Just lay still.

438
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,840
You did well today.

439
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:32,600
(Physical Examination Report)

440
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,600
Healthy?

441
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,160
What does "normal" mean?

442
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:40,950
Maybe the medical equipment is outdated.

443
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:43,120
How about we go somewhere else

444
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,230
to do another examination?

445
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,310
Miss Mu, what are your thoughts?

446
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:51,200
Binjiang has some of the most advanced
medical equipment in the world.

447
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,600
If you're comfortable with it,

448
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,120
how about sending him there
to be tested?

449
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,750
What do you think?

450
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,200
All right.

451
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,120
Then let's proceed as you suggested.

452
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,080
All right.

453
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:08,920
I shall take my leave now.

454
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:09,880
Take care.

455
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,200
Yingliang,

456
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,790
come and sit here.

457
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,680
This time,

458
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,710
you'll be the main person in charge

459
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,640
of the examination for Shen Zhiheng
in Binjiang.

460
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,550
Although Mu Lihua is
a talented individual I hired,

461
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,080
she's not to be trusted.

462
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:34,880
Also,

463
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:36,510
I have a secret mission for you.

464
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,300
Please give me your instructions.

465
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,840
If Shen Zhiheng's
next examination shows

466
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,920
any abnormalities,

467
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,640
make sure to bring me the original report

468
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,470
of his examination.

469
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,080
Do not let Mu Lihua see it.

470
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,230
If everything is still normal

471
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,510
as it is now,

472
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:55,440
then you should get rid
of Shen Zhiheng in Binjiang.

473
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,510
Get... Get rid of him?

474
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:01,880
If I can't use

475
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,600
someone like Shen Zhiheng,

476
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:07,640
I shouldn't give others an advantage.

477
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,880
Is that so?

478
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:24,450
Ladies and gentlemen.

479
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,750
The guests who are present

480
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,470
at Miss Jin's birthday party today are

481
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,080
all elite figures from various fields

482
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,600
and have continuously supported

483
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,940
my family's business
over the years.

484
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,010
Today is a joyful occasion.

485
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,230
I'd like to propose a toast to everyone.

486
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:37,790
Cheers!

487
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,090
Please help yourselves.

488
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,640
- Cheers.
- Let's drink.

489
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,200
(Liang,)

490
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,990
(let's see how long you can sit
in the car.)

491
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:53,600
(If you don't get out of the car,)

492
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,640
(I'll ignore you.)

493
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,230
Miss Jin,

494
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,200
why are you still here?

495
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:25,080
Today is your birthday, not mine.

496
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,600
If you don't go downstairs,

497
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:27,880
aren't you putting me

498
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,840
in an awkward position downstairs?

499
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:32,360
Uncle, my birthday is
the same every year.

500
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,370
I'm already bored with it.

501
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,710
Besides, none of the people downstairs
are my friends.

502
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:38,120
Aren't they your business partners?

503
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,710
I won't go.

504
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,230
Who am I doing this for?

505
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,510
Isn't this all
for the Jin family's business?

506
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:43,990
Mr. Li,

507
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:46,950
aren't you going in?

508
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,230
Ding, you go.

509
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,030
Let me send it.

510
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,160
Why are you meddling?

511
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,360
Ding will go.

512
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,510
All right.

513
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,890
You are the chairperson
in name, after all.

514
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:05,880
In the end,

515
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,920
isn't all this for you?

516
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:09,080
The guests today are

517
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,520
all elite figures from various fields.

518
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:15,120
If you keep staying upstairs,

519
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:16,430
how can I still show my face?

520
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,230
Mr. Ding,

521
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,310
tell Li Yingliang.

522
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,430
If he doesn't come in person today,

523
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,350
don't bother sending me any gifts!

524
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,600
Uncle, I'll do as you say.

525
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,450
Celebrate my birthday.

526
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,520
That's more like it.

527
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,040
Jingxue is here.

528
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,230
- Miss Jin, happy birthday!
- Thank you.

529
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,390
- Happy birthday.
- Miss Jin.

530
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:44,960
Happy birthday!

531
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,040
Happy birthday.

532
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,870
Thank you.

533
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:48,750
I'm so sorry for coming late.

534
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,200
I'll apologize to you first.

535
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:55,350
Thank you all
for coming to my birthday party today.

536
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:57,180
I hope everyone could have a good time.

537
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:58,350
Let me make a toast.

538
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:01,060
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you.

539
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,040
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

540
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:10,750
Jingxue, happy birthday. Cheers.

541
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,860
Come and have another one.

542
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:15,940
All right.

543
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:29,910
Miss Jin,

544
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,830
let me help you to your room and rest.

545
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,710
All of you can leave first.

546
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,350
I want to be alone.

547
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:36,790
Yes, Miss Jin.

548
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:38,790
All of you can leave now.

549
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,350
Situ?

550
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,890
Why did you climb in
through the window again?

551
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,100
I want to give you a surprise.

552
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,420
Why didn't you tell me
that today is your birthday?

553
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,160
I didn't even prepare
any birthday gift.

554
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,600
It's a pity you arrived too late.

555
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,790
The food and drinks are all finished.

556
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:21,040
Besides, a birthday is

557
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,640
just a formality.

558
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,620
It's the same every year.

559
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,910
Don't you also give me gifts often?

560
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:29,030
I followed your advice
and went to look for Shen.

561
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,090
But even the servants don't know
where he has gone.

562
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:32,430
But don't worry.

563
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:34,480
I will keep searching for him
until I find him.

564
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:36,600
Foolish little brother.

565
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,310
How am I a foolish younger brother?

566
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,000
You've always been one.

567
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:59,350
It's you again.

568
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:02,560
Why such a response?

569
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:05,640
You took

570
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,680
Shen away, didn't you?

571
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,200
Oh, don't be sad.

572
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,910
Soon, you'll also end up in prison

573
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,600
so you'll reunite early.

574
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,350
Take him.

575
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:36,350
Mr. Li,

576
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,830
we've locked Situ Weilian up

577
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:39,970
and have Mr. Ding watch him.

578
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,490
Why do we need to capture him?

579
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,540
We're taking him to Binjiang
with Shen Zhiheng.

580
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,480
Binjiang?

581
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:46,120
Who suggested Binjiang?

582
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,390
Mu Lihua.

583
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,310
Why should we take orders from Mu Lihua

584
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:13,000
and act like her subordinates?

585
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:14,600
What's she to us?

586
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:18,560
This task is really frustrating.

587
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:21,830
Can we not do it?

588
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:25,790
Can we?

589
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:27,120
Do you think we can?

590
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:30,750
Mu Lihua has Superintendent Chi
within her grips.

591
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,870
Do you think nobodies like us

592
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,350
can refuse to do it?

593
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,680
If you ask me,

594
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,020
we can go back to the Jin family
at the worst.

595
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:46,960
Master is no longer here.

596
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,640
Only Miss Jin is left to manage
the household now.

597
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,910
Since young,
Miss Jin has treated you well...

598
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:52,310
Shut up.

599
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:53,060
And has feelings...

600
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,520
Don't think about using Miss Jin.

601
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:57,910
The Jin family isn't our fallback plan.

602
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,390
There's no more turning back for us.

603
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,390
We've been working for Chi Shanying
for so many years.

604
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,000
We've killed

605
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,120
and offended so many people.

606
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,750
We're already living
with a noose around our necks.

607
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,710
If we were killed on the streets,

608
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,430
we wouldn't even know who did it.

609
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,910
We have too much blood on our hands.

610
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,600
So don't think about Miss Jin.

611
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,870
The better Jin Jingxue treats me,

612
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:30,160
the further I have
to stay away from her.

613
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,270
To take a step back,

614
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,790
even if we have to beg for food,

615
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:36,480
we can't go back to the Jin family.

616
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,390
It turns out your feelings
for Miss Jin...

617
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:42,230
I get it.

618
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,230
I won't say anything.

619
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,190
Do as you say. I won't back out.

620
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,600
I'll go to Binjiang alone.

621
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,520
You'll stay in Haidong.

622
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,200
I can't do that.

623
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:56,500
I can't let you go alone.

624
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,480
I must stay by your side.

625
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,200
No, you must stay in Haidong.

626
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,000
No way.

627
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:03,350
We've never been so far apart
since we were young.

628
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:04,390
Besides,

629
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,940
we have a monster like Shen Zhiheng

630
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,120
and a schemer like Mu Lihua on the train.

631
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:10,150
How can I not be worried
when you go alone?

632
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,000
I must go with you.

633
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,200
Sheng,

634
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,710
the outcome

635
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,640
of this Binjiang trip is uncertain.

636
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:21,270
If it succeeds, we'll enjoy promotions
and wealth when I return

637
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:22,560
and live in luxury.

638
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:24,200
But if something goes wrong,

639
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,560
you'll need to adapt quickly in Haidong

640
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,430
and secure a backup plan for us.

641
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:35,000
Then please be careful.

642
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,270
Take a few trusted men with you.

643
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:45,960
I'll wait for your return.
