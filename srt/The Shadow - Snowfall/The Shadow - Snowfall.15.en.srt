(This drama is purely fictional.)

4
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:50,060
(Shen Residence)

5
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,600
Here are some wontons for you.

6
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,270
They're piping hot.

7
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,910
Miss Mi Lan, please have them
while they're still hot.

8
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,790
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

9
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:06,430
Here.

10
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:08,910
Be careful. It's hot.

11
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,480
Thank you, Degeng.

12
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,440
Why are you being so courteous?

13
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,230
How is it?

14
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,670
It's delicious.

15
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,000
You should eat up, then.

16
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,520
That's right.

17
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,200
Mr. Shen.

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,910
I always thought you were lonely.

19
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,390
Now, you have someone beside you.

20
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,280
I can rest at ease now.

21
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,600
Hurry and eat up.

22
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,110
I didn't clean

23
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,950
the storeroom periodically.

24
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,070
So it took some time
for me to look for it.

25
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,320
I'm so sorry.

26
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,790
Degeng, don't say that.

27
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,040
I'm already very grateful to you
for looking after them on my behalf.

28
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
Thank you.

29
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,670
Qian.

30
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,600
Here, Young Master.

31
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,160
Qian.

32
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,160
Go to your grandmother.

33
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,560
Brother, isn't this nice?

34
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,320
Qian, we're doing a photoshoot here.

35
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,720
Be a good boy. Go to the back.

36
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,440
- Be a good boy.
- Yeah.

37
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,510
- Come, Qian.
- Go to your grandmother.

38
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,190
Take pictures.

39
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,160
Here.

40
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,480
I'll take the picture now.

41
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,230
I need to head
to the cemetery immediately.

42
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,480
Do you need me to join you?

43
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,200
No need for that.

44
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:58,830
Mi Lan, let's go.

45
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,920
I, Shen Zhiheng,
am here to pay my respect, my ancestors.

46
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:23,100
(Grave of Eldest Grandson, Shen Zhiheng)

47
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,390
This is my grave.

48
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,470
You aren't dead.

49
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,070
Why do you have a grave?

50
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,880
Back then,
the Shen Family was massacred.

51
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,000
Only my grandmother and I
managed to survive.

52
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,920
However, I contracted a strange disease.

53
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,590
Grandmother was worried that people
might relate the strange occurrences to me.

54
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,560
Therefore, she erected
a cenotaph for me.

55
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,150
But this is good too.

56
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,360
But the human Shen Zhiheng

57
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,440
did die on that day.

58
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:13,620
(Shen Zhiheng)

59
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,630
Heng!

60
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:03,950
Heng!

61
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,030
Mother!

62
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,200
Hongxing.

63
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,470
Don't come near me.

64
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,000
Father!

65
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,880
You too!

66
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,590
Why?

67
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,390
Why did you do that?

68
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:27,590
Scram.

69
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,700
Scram!

70
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,030
Madam wanted

71
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,240
to burn my child and I to death.

72
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,560
We did so to protect ourselves.

73
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,510
Hongxing!

74
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,360
Don't move!

75
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:38,920
You...

76
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,680
Stand back!

77
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,200
I'm Wei Qiu.

78
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,950
Wei Qiu, I married you.

79
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,710
I loved you.

80
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,200
But you killed my family!

81
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,680
I shouldn't brought you home!

82
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,230
Hongxing!

83
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,470
Father!

84
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,620
(Ancestral Tablet of the Shen Family)

85
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,590
Mr. Shen.

86
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,920
Someone's coming.

87
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,280
Mr. Shen?

88
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,280
Mr. Shen?

89
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,740
Mr. Shen?

90
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,240
He's unkillable. Charge!

91
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,740
Mi Lan?

92
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,680
Mi Lan.

93
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,480
Shen...

94
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,510
Mr. Shen...

95
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,860
- I'm here.
- Mr. Shen.

96
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm here.

97
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,590
I'm here for you.

98
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,640
Don't cry.

99
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:42,880
Mi Lan, don't cry.

100
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,800
You...

101
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,640
You once told me this,

102
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,040
"Mi Lan,

103
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,430
don't take your own life, okay?"

104
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,800
I said

105
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,800
it was too excruciating to live.

106
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,760
But now,

107
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,400
I think living is pretty nice.

108
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,520
Becoming you

109
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,430
is pretty nice too.

drifting like road dust.

139
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,340
(Shen Residence)

140
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,630
I plan to leave with her tonight.

141
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,360
But she hasn't
regained consciousness yet.

142
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,440
I'm not sure whether
she can regain consciousness.

143
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,400
But we'll only cause you trouble

144
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,910
if we keep waiting here.

145
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,010
This place isn't safe.

146
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,770
Even if you head back,

147
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,540
you'll get yourself in trouble.

148
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,730
In my opinion, you should hide outside
for the time being.

149
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,940
Now, I'm no longer alone.

150
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,250
What will come will come eventually.

151
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:03,890
There's nowhere to hide.

152
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,060
I have to face it.

153
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,770
Returning to Haidong is my only choice.

154
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,890
Now that we're parting ways,

155
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,730
I don't know when we'll meet again.

156
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,730
Maybe I will no longer be around

157
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,220
when you come back next time.

158
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,180
Degeng,

159
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:23,940
you mustn't say that.

160
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,610
I won't.

161
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,340
I'll stop talking.

162
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,770
Everything has its cause and effect.

163
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:09,740
How did it go?

164
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,170
Shen Zhiheng carried Mi Lan back.

165
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,100
He carried her?

166
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,690
Did he carry her body back?

167
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,130
Her body?

168
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,060
I killed Mi Lan.

169
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,170
I'm sure Shen Zhiheng
hates me to the core.

170
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,300
He's back to kill me.

171
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:48,540
Once the Blood Amber Stone
merges with another person's blood,

172
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,890
you shall become the same as Wei Qiu.

173
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,340
You'll grow weaker and weaker.

174
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,280
No one stopped you
from entering my residence.

175
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,410
Why did you scale the window?

176
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,410
Isn't this what Romeo and Juliet do
on their balcony?

177
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,590
Aren't you the second lady
of the Jin Family?

178
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,020
Don't tell me you have to work?

179
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,130
Look at what you're saying.

180
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:53,300
Who do you think
is supporting all the members

181
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,580
of the Jin Family?

182
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,780
But I thought your second uncle

183
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:58,980
was managing the association.

184
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,980
Silly boy, why are you so naive?

185
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,890
I was very young before
my father passed away.

186
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,780
Therefore, he left my second uncle
in charge of the family.

187
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:13,940
But my second uncle

188
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,980
will have his own kin
and friends eventually.

189
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,260
He'll have his own plans
for other things.

190
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,660
He won't do everything for me.

191
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,380
So, no matter how much I trust him,

192
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,420
I can't entrust

193
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,660
the Jin Family to him completely.

194
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,050
So,

195
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,250
don't you have any other kin?

196
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,420
I do.

197
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,460
It's Liang.

198
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,180
But he's inhumane.

199
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:35,730
At least your second uncle
does things for you.

200
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,290
You have no idea, huh?

201
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,620
Although some people are inhumane,

202
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,050
they'll never harm you.

203
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,330
That's so hard to understand.

204
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:10,340
(Self-Discipline)

205
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,810
Mr. Shen?

206
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,530
Mi Lan?

207
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,330
Thank goodness.

208
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,050
You're finally awake.

209
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:04,140
Your eyes...

210
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,530
I can see now.

211
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,220
This is great.

212
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:23,140
Nice to meet you,

213
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:25,860
Mr. Shen.

214
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,460
Nice to meet you,

215
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:39,090
Miss Mi Lan.

216
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,460
Mi Lan.

217
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:55,140
So, this is what you look like.

218
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,420
Mr. Shen.

219
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,570
Slow down.

220
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:44,700
Mr. Shen.

221
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:46,330
Mr. Shen.

222
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,570
Mr. Shen?

223
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,940
Mr. Shen.

224
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:51,900
I'm here.

225
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:53,140
Mr. Shen.

226
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:58,770
Mr. Shen. Mr. Shen? Mr. Shen!

227
00:28:58,770 --> 00:28:59,660
It's me.

228
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,330
Mr. Shen.

229
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:09,250
It's so nice to see you.

230
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,220
I love this world,
which I can see as well.

231
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:17,220
Mi Lan.

232
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,530
In the future, we have to
depend on each other.

233
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,080
I'll always take care of you.

234
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,770
Can I not go home, then?

235
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,140
Do you wish to go home?

236
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,700
I don't.

237
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,620
I wish to stay by your side.

238
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,250
You don't need to go home.

239
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:35,770
Really?

240
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:38,730
Really.

241
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:14,090
Miss Mu, please have some tea.

242
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,690
Superintendent will be here soon.

243
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:16,770
Thank you.

244
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,010
Superintendent.

245
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,730
Miss Mu, sorry for the long wait.

246
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:31,620
To be honest,

247
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,460
I came here

248
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,090
to seek your help.

249
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:36,460
I hope you can do me a small favor.

250
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,140
Miss Mu, you're too courteous.

251
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:42,050
You came from somewhere far away.
I must look after you.

252
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:44,490
Just tell me if you need any help.

253
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:45,850
I'll do everything to help you out.

254
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:46,980
You know this too.

255
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,010
I've lost plenty of my Shadow Warriors

256
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,290
after capturing Shen Zhiheng.

257
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:56,140
I hope that you can assign some troops to me

258
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,660
and support my program.

259
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:07,770
The tea is getting cold. Have some tea.

260
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,180
Mr. Li, most of the Mu Family's
suicide warriors

261
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,180
died because of your incompetence.

262
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:49,050
I'll definitely settle this with you.

263
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,010
Miss Mu, all of them are here.

264
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,180
Mr. Li.

265
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,420
Let's go.

266
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,340
Mr. Li, please head back.

267
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,090
The superintendent said
you have been suspended.

268
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,930
You don't have the right to enter.

269
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,410
Deputy Officer Wu,
please talk to Superintendent Chi again.

270
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,160
Mr. Li has been kneeling here
the entire day.

271
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:36,130
The superintendent won't see you

272
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,550
even if you kneel here for a week.

273
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,540
Mr. Li, let's go.

274
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,450
I'm not leaving.

275
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:49,930
I have to save myself
before Shen Zhiheng kills me.

276
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:51,540
Just ignore me.

277
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,170
Go and check

278
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,650
if Shen Zhiheng has sent Mi Lan away.

279
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:55,610
Go now.

280
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:57,740
Alright.

281
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,940
(Shen Mansion)

282
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:05,210
Stop it.

283
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,380
If you keep doing that,
I won't bring you here again.

284
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:26,050
Mr. Li,

285
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:29,090
Mi Lan isn't dead.

286
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,410
What?

287
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,300
Mr. Li.

288
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:39,890
She's not dead?

289
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,050
She's alive.

290
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,470
She's at Shen Zhiheng's house.

291
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,620
She's still alive?

292
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,340
Yes.
