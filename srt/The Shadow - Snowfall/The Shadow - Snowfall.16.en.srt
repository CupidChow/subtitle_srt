3
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,940
(This drama is purely fictional.)

4
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,600
Mr. Shen!

5
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,480
I didn't kill Mi Lan!

6
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,270
It's a misunderstanding!
It really wasn't me!

7
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,000
I… I didn't!

8
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,100
I didn't do it, Mr. Shen!

9
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,230
Mr. Shen!

10
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,200
Mr. Shen! It's me, Liang!

11
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,110
Liang!

12
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:30,600
How could you audit
your second uncle's accounts?

13
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,040
What will everyone in the company think?

14
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,710
You will ruin our reputation!

15
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,710
Second Uncle,

16
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,760
have some hot tea to calm down.

17
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,510
Have you finished the audit?

18
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,760
Then, publish it.

19
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,990
Let everyone see

20
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,890
just how much your second uncle
has embezzled.

21
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,640
Second Uncle, you know

22
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,270
you're not the type
to take petty advantages.

23
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:06,550
Second Uncle,

24
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,040
our trade association

25
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,710
values harmony and profit.

26
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,920
I'm young and inexperienced.

27
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,270
It's all thanks
to your careful management

28
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,440
that the Jin family is what it is today.

29
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,470
So you're aware.

30
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,710
Then why did you audit
my accounts?

31
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,200
But Second Uncle,

32
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,800
though your books are clean,

33
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,560
someone found opium in the cargo

34
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,120
of your ships.

35
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,640
You can't say such things lightly.

36
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,150
It's a capital offense.

37
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,350
Did you really not know about this?

38
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,680
Second Uncle,

39
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,120
you must be more vigilant.

40
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,320
Don't let the ill-intentioned
exploit opportunities.

41
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,080
You know my father was killed

42
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,240
for refusing to be complicit

43
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,880
with those people.

44
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,680
Whether or not

45
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,270
someone set you up,

46
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,150
I hope you keep your eyes open.

47
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,470
The Jin family

48
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,680
doesn't do immoral business.

49
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:08,950
I see.

50
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,000
So, you're teaching me

51
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,360
how to run things?

52
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,270
I know better than you
what kind of business

53
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,590
the Jin family does.

54
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,240
Is this enough, Mr. Shen?

55
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,510
It's enough.

56
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,440
All right.

57
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,190
Allow me to excuse myself.

58
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,800
Youwen,

59
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,390
take some time to visit home.

60
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,030
Your grandfather is getting old
and needs more company.

61
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,070
Yes, sir.

62
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,200
I'll be off now, Mr. Shen.

63
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,120
Miss Mi.

64
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,360
Here.

65
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,200
Why do I have to eat these?

66
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,030
With new life

67
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,880
comes a new beginning.

68
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,510
I thought this was
the best way to celebrate.

69
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,560
These longevity noodles
represent a long life.

70
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,240
Peeling the shell of this egg

71
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,440
symbolizes shedding the past

72
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,030
and starting anew.

73
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:37,680
Starting anew.

74
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,590
I like that meaning.

75
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,320
Why am I so strong?

76
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,590
It's completely crushed.

77
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,070
It's okay, there are more.

78
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,710
Let me peel one for you.

79
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,030
You still don't know
how to control your strength.

80
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,630
I'll teach you.

81
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,270
This is fine.

82
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,000
No.

83
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,270
A new life must be perfect.

84
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,560
Let me peel a nice one.

85
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,200
For good luck.

86
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,000
Okay.

87
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,150
The noodle must not break.

88
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,880
Hurry, eat it.

89
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,320
Does it taste good?

90
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,070
The egg tastes good,
the noodles taste good,

91
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,510
and the rice cake tastes good too.

92
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,320
Being alive…

93
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,470
Being alive is good?

94
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,160
Can it always be this good?

95
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:38,830
Of course.

96
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,320
As long as you want it to be.

97
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,070
Eat up.

98
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,590
I'll peel another egg for you.

99
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,040
Jingxue,

100
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,750
have some of this.

101
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,640
Thanks.

102
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,680
It's cute.

103
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,190
- Let me finish knitting this first.
- All right.

104
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,710
Miss Jin, Mr. Liang is here.

105
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,680
Liang? Why is he here?

106
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,200
He's waiting at the door.

107
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,950
I didn't dare let him in.

108
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,990
Jingxue, I can't let him catch me.

109
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,110
I have to go.

110
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,800
Tao, let Mr. Liang in.

111
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,280
Mr. Liang, please.

112
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,950
Miss Jin, I'm terribly sorry.

113
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,560
I've been busy and haven't had
the chance to visit you.

114
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,750
That's strange.

115
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,560
You're not anyone to me.

116
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,350
Why would you need to visit me?

117
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,400
Besides, I really don't deserve it.

118
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,320
I've been away from Haidong

119
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,400
and just got back.

120
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,470
Go wherever you want,

121
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,040
and it has nothing to do with me.

122
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,640
Why suddenly report to me now?

123
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,350
I'm in trouble.

124
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,990
Who did you offend this time?

125
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,800
Shen Zhiheng.

126
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,440
I thought it was someone else,

127
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,590
but it's Shen Zhiheng.

128
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,990
What did you do to him?

129
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,040
Did you use the Haidong Army's power

130
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,590
to bully him,

131
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,470
and now he's come

132
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,200
for revenge?

133
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,520
I wish it were that simple.

134
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,680
I knew it.

135
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,400
You never come

136
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,590
when invited,

137
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,680
but now that you need help,

138
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,320
you show up at my door

139
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,640
in the middle of the night.

140
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,920
But you know my abilities.

141
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,590
How can I help you?

142
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,320
Is Situ Weilian pursuing you?

143
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,470
Can I ask you to be my go-between?

144
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,350
Aren't you trying to catch him?

145
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:30,520
How did you know that?

146
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,750
He came to see you.

147
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,520
Yes.

148
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,750
We even have a date tomorrow.

149
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,040
Why?

150
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,350
Are you going to stop me?

151
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,520
Situ Weilian has real feelings for you.

152
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,350
So do many others.

153
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,470
Is that unusual?

154
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,590
And what about you?

155
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,200
I haven't decided yet.

156
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,400
Miss Jin,

157
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,590
may I join you
when you meet him tomorrow?

158
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:11,440
Why would I bring you on our date?

159
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,990
We still have some connection.

160
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:21,400
You seem to have a good impression
of Situ Weilian.

161
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,160
I want to see

162
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,710
what kind of person he is.

163
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,320
If he's good, I'll be at ease.

164
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,990
Are you genuinely concerned about me,

165
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,400
or are you trying to use me

166
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,690
to get to Situ Weilian
to talk to Shen Zhiheng for you?

167
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,520
Just offending Shen Zhiheng

168
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,800
doesn't mean
I can't care about other things.

169
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,470
Can't I deal with Shen Zhiheng

170
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,680
and see what kind of person

171
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,520
your new boyfriend is

172
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,320
at the same time?

173
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,400
You're getting flustered.

174
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,640
What's wrong?

175
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:00,520
Excuse me.

176
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,680
I haven't slept well lately.

177
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,070
I've been getting dizzy spells.

178
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,870
I won't bother you anymore, Miss Jin.

179
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,200
Have a good rest.

180
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,680
I'll call you tomorrow around noon.

181
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,950
Tao, see Mr. Liang out.

182
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,710
Mr. Liang, this way.

183
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,070
Liang always thinks

184
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,990
he can handle everything

185
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,990
and make it out there himself,

186
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,280
but now he's hit a wall and realised

187
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,830
how tough it is out there.

188
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,230
Being a son-in-law of the Jin family

189
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,680
is his best card.

190
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,640
Is this car safe?

191
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,440
Safe.

192
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,440
I've had it bulletproofed

193
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,560
and armed to the teeth.

194
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,490
We've been meeting often
these past few days.

195
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,090
Has Superintendent
gotten suspicious?

196
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:28,560
Don't worry.

197
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,800
Superintendent Chi
hasn't noticed a thing.

198
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,520
Mr. Li, whatever you're planning,

199
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,200
I think you should take me along.

200
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,800
Don't do it alone.

201
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,710
What if something dangerous happens?

202
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,070
I worry.

203
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,110
No.

204
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,590
Your job right now

205
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,160
is to hold my position

206
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,870
and keep others from taking it.

207
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,200
If you're around me all the time,

208
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,280
it might go unnoticed once or twice,

209
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,350
but eventually,
it will raise suspicions.

210
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,520
Get someone else to follow me.

211
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:57,990
Understood.

212
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,800
(If I became)

213
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,280
(a monster like Shen Zhiheng,)

214
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,040
(with his power and longevity,)

215
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,870
(would life be easier?)

216
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,110
(Thinking about it,)

217
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,950
(living like him wouldn't be so bad.)

218
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:41,800
Mr. Li.

219
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:43,970
Are you all right?

220
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:50,920
I'm fine, just tired.

221
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,560
Too tired.

222
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,640
(Shen Mansion)

223
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:27,200
Brother, I finally caught you.

224
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,710
Stay away from me. What do you want?

225
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,830
Can't I just come to see you?

226
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,520
You're being so cold.

227
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,950
Are you out of money?

228
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,520
Yes, I'm out of money.

229
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,560
Here to extort you.

230
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,200
How much do you want?

231
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:45,920
100,000.

232
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:47,950
Fine.

233
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,590
I don't get it.

234
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,900
You're so heartless.

235
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,680
I need you just as much as you need me.

236
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,590
We have
a mutually beneficial relationship,

237
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,870
and for the past three years,
I've done my duty by you.

238
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,160
Haven't I done enough?

239
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,120
I…

240
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,030
What did I say wrong?

241
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,640
When will you give me the money?

242
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,360
Tomorrow afternoon.

243
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,940
I'll have someone
deliver the cheque to your apartment.

244
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:18,950
Just wait for it.

245
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,790
How do I know

246
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,950
you won't give me a dud cheque?

247
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,030
I wouldn't stoop that low.

248
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,300
I want a cashier's cheque.

249
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:28,880
Fine.

250
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,080
I want 200,000.

251
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,440
Fine.

252
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,400
I've changed my mind!

253
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,230
I changed my mind.

254
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,790
I want all your assets.

255
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,230
Tomorrow, get the lawyer

256
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,840
to transfer everything you can to me

257
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,360
and then get out of Haidong.

258
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,120
Situ He is your servant too, isn't he?

259
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,080
He's not. He doesn't qualify.

260
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,680
I looked for you,

261
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,360
but I couldn't find you anywhere.

262
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,160
I thought you might return
to our hometown,

263
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,750
so I went back there.

264
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,680
I saw your grave
and thought you were really dead.

265
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,680
I had nowhere else to go,

266
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,440
so I decided to stay.

267
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,200
I couldn't survive on my own.

268
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,230
I don't know why,

269
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,550
but I don't understand

270
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,030
normal human thoughts.

271
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,030
I always end up offending people.

272
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,990
There are so many things I don't get.

273
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,080
I need someone to take care of me,

274
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,270
I need money,

275
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,270
I need

276
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,200
so many things.

277
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,550
It was your job to look after me.

278
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:48,270
So I found myself a Situ He,

279
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,790
using threats and bribes,

280
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,360
because I needed an identity

281
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,680
and a place to belong.

282
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,550
But since meeting you,

283
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,360
I haven't bothered the old man

284
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,310
or spent a penny
of the Situ family's money.

285
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,440
I understand.

286
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,120
So, do you forgive me?

287
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,680
No.

288
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,120
Mr. Shen,

289
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,080
you're back.

290
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,230
Mi Lan?

291
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,680
Weilian?

292
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,550
You can see now?

293
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,550
So that's what you look like.

294
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,710
Shen Zhiheng!

295
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:39,600
So, you treasured me
because you didn't have anyone else!

296
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,030
Now that you've got Mi Lan,

297
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,320
you don't need me anymore, right?

298
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:45,310
And it's convenient
that Mi Lan is a woman, isn't it?

299
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,470
And she's head over heels for you.

300
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,510
Who knows,

301
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,600
maybe in a year or two,
you'll get married

302
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,440
and have a kid together.

303
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:55,510
Are you insulting me or Mi Lan?

304
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,510
Aren't I just stating the truth?

305
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,840
You cut ties with me

306
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,160
because you don't need me anymore!

307
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,600
Get out of my sight!

308
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,510
Fine.

309
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,680
I'll go.

310
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,360
But Shen Zhiheng,

311
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,710
don't forget,

312
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,640
you're living off my money.

313
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,920
It's my inheritance!

314
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:14,640
Out of my way.

315
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,880
Have a happy life together!

316
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,990
Mr. Shen,

317
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,550
are you still mad at Weilian?

318
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,990
That's just how he is.

319
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,510
He's thoughtless
and speaks without thinking.

320
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,270
What can I do about him?

321
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,690
Can I cut him off completely?

322
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,160
When he came to see you,

323
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,680
you were happy.

324
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,160
I could tell.

325
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,600
He's my brother.

326
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,120
I've been looking for him for so long.

327
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,790
The piano.

328
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:21,680
It isn't healthy.

329
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,120
What did he say?

330
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,080
He said the piano
hasn't been used in a long time,

331
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,030
and it's likely out of tune.

332
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,270
Play it.

333
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,750
Excellent.

334
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,270
Excellent.

335
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,500
You don't have
to play with stones anymore.

336
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,680
Let him continue teaching you.

337
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,950
I have to go out for a bit.

338
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,710
Come back soon.

339
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:35,230
All right.

340
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,510
Sir.

341
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,270
Yes, sir.

342
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,120
Goodbye.

343
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,360
This song?

344
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,230
Yes.

345
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:46,180
(Mailan Coffee)

346
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,790
Dr. Situ, I want to apologize.

347
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,310
I've offended you before,

348
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,310
and I hope

349
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,470
you will forgive me.

350
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:16,990
To be honest,

351
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,790
I'm here to make peace with you.

352
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,790
I hope to have the chance

353
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,550
to reconcile with you and,

354
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,920
through you, with Mr. Shen.

355
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,790
Dr. Situ, why are you staring
at me like that?

356
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,230
I'm just wondering why Shen Zhiheng
hasn't taken revenge on you.

357
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,440
It's why I need
to find ways to stay alive

358
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,710
while I still can.

359
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,470
Dr. Situ,

360
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,080
I apologize again for all

361
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,200
my past actions.

362
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,880
You can ask me for anything.

363
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,020
And, of course,
if there's something I can't do,

364
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,640
Superintendent Chi will certainly help.

365
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:53,710
In any case,

366
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,510
I guarantee your satisfaction.

367
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,640
I understand,

368
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,550
but you've come to the wrong person.

369
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,750
Shen Zhiheng and I have fallen out.

370
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,470
I can't even set foot in his house,

371
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:07,200
let alone deliver a message for you.

372
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:09,680
Fallen out?

373
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,920
Given your relationship with Mr. Shen,

374
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:13,950
that shouldn't happen.

375
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,200
It's complicated.

376
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,200
In short, my friendship with him

377
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,440
won't be mended anytime soon.

378
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:21,880
But I don't mind.

379
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,790
Having Jingxue is enough for me.

380
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,990
Well…

381
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,710
What about Miss Mi? How is she?

382
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,470
I don't know.

383
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,550
Shen Zhiheng won't even let you see her?

384
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,840
We've fallen out.

385
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,880
I can't get into his house,

386
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,190
so how would I know about Mi Lan?

387
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,750
Jingxue, it's time.

388
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,710
We need to get going.

389
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,360
We've got plans

390
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,640
to catch a movie later.

391
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,790
Miss Jin, I'm really sorry.

392
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,650
I'd like to take up
your time this afternoon

393
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:59,180
to have a conversation
with Dr. Situ.

394
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,400
Situ, let's have another coffee, shall we?

395
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,680
Talking to me won't help you.

396
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,600
Dr. Situ,

397
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,360
if you could mediate for me,

398
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:12,260
I'll give you 50,000
as a token of my appreciation.

399
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,280
And there will be
even more to come if you succeed.

400
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,990
And, if you ever want
to advance your career,

401
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,230
you can count on me.

402
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:21,550
Of course,

403
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,550
killing me would be satisfying for you,

404
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,990
but then what?

405
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,400
The Haidong Army
would become Mr. Shen's enemy.

406
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,990
Mr. Shen is a proper businessman.

407
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:33,470
Having the Haidong Army as an enemy
won't do him any good.

408
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:36,790
50,000 just to pass a message?

409
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:37,950
Yes.

410
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:41,600
Make the deal.
Then, let's go catch that movie.

411
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,270
You have a deal.

412
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,470
Just passing a message.

413
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:49,400
Okay.

414
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,950
Thank you, Dr. Situ.

415
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:51,990
Thank you, Miss Jin.

416
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,400
Let's go.

417
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,160
Waitress.

418
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,080
Coming.

419
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,310
A steak, please.

420
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,510
Certainly. In a moment.

422

Enjoy your meal, sir.

423

Shen…

424
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,750
Mr. Shen.

425
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,400
Eat. I'll wait.

426
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,160
Mr. Shen, please, let me explain…

427
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,360
I didn't bring a gun.

428
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,620
Haven't seen you in a few days, Mr. Li.

429
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,900
You've lost some weight.

430
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,640
Mr. Li.

431
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,160
Why don't you start eating?

432
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,030
No appetite,

433
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,080
or don't you like the food?

434
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,080
Or

435
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,260
would you like me to feed you?

436
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,030
Where are you taking me, Mr. Shen?

437
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,680
Did you see Mr. Li?

438
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,680
Mr. Li?

439
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,710
He was wearing a beige coat.

440
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,710
He left.

441
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:24,790
He left?

442
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,550
When did he leave?

443
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,270
He left a while ago.

444
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,920
Talk.

445
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,550
I shouldn't have barged into your home

446
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,850
and investigated your whereabouts.

447
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,950
Thank goodness Mi Lan isn't dead.

448
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,680
That night in the reeds,

449
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,790
I didn't mean to kill you.

450
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,080
Didn't mean to kill me?

451
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:41,310
Why did you shoot at me then?

452
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,990
Mu Lihua saw me pointing a gun at you.

453
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,400
I had no choice but to shoot.

454
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:46,270
And I didn't know
what you were thinking.

455
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,600
I was afraid you'd kill me first.

456
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,790
I aimed at Mu Lihua.

457
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,360
It was all Mu Lihua's idea.

458
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,780
She's Chi Shanying's important guest.

459
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:54,270
I couldn't go against her wishes.

460
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,790
Do you think

461
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,790
I believe you?

462
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,160
I know I don't deserve your mercy.

463
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,920
I've tried to harm you several times.

464
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:09,030
If you weren't Shen Zhiheng

465
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,680
and were just an ordinary man,
you'd be dead.

466
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,840
I've had

467
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,270
enough of this.

468
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,270
Mr. Shen,

469
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,550
have mercy!

470
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,200
Give me another chance!

471
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,880
I can still be useful!

472
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,710
I can do anything for you.

473
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,710
You've fallen out
with Situ Weilian, haven't you?

474
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,160
I can take his place.

475
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:40,200
You need blood, right?

476
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,310
I can get you blood.

477
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,890
However much you need,
I'll get it for you!

478
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,600
I… I won't work for…

479
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:45,640
Chi Shanying anymore!

480
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,550
I'll serve you!

481
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,400
You even know that
I had a falling out with Situ Weilian.

482
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:51,230
You've been keeping
such a close watch on me,

483
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:52,790
and yet you expect me to trust you?

484
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,990
You can judge me by my actions.

485
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,550
I'm sure you used this same approach

486
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:01,270
to climb to your current position
with Chi Shanying.

487
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,640
You had one chance to prove yourself

488
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,750
on the train,

489
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,400
but you didn't seize it.

490
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,840
We might have a connection,

491
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,990
but we're not meant to be.

492
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,940
You've tried to kill me
several times and failed.

493
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,360
Now it's my turn

494
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,400
to kill you.

495
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,840
You don't kill!

496
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:27,550
I don't kill humans.
But do you deserve to be called one?

497

Mu Lihua has been targeting me?

499
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,710
You know Mu Lihua
has been targeting you,

500
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,680
so it's not my fault.

501

I'm keeping you here

502

Shifting the blame to them

507
