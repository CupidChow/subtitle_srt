3
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,940
(This drama is purely fictional.)

4
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,640
There's the sunset.

5
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,690
You're still
in the mood to enjoy it.

6
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:16,880
When we get to Binjiang,

7
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,830
who knows if you'll even be alive.

8
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,270
That's why I'm cherishing this journey.

9
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,990
Here, I can keep

10
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,480
a bit of dignity and respect.

11
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,550
Once we get off the train,

12
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,760
it might be a whole different story.

13
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,950
Shen,

14
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,710
if you make it back alive,

15
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,320
I'll buy you a ticket

16
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,710
for the Asia Express,

17
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,600
so you can return to Haidong in style.

18
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,270
Why so generous all of a sudden?

19
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,580
Because I've looked up to you

20
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,390
for a long time.

21
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,920
Looked up to me?

22
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,670
Yet you won't cooperate with me.

23
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:07,920
I don't trust you.

24
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,260
I'm not risking my life

25
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,710
for an empty promise.

26
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,270
Shen Zhiheng!

27
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,030
Wake up!

28
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:25,880
Quickly!

29
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:27,320
Hurry up!

30
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:30,640
Hurry!

31
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,190
What's the matter?

32
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,370
Shen Zhiheng has escaped!

33
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,710
Quick! To the dining car!

34
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,560
Yes! Quick!

35
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,620
Hurry!

36
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,060
Hurry!

37
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,420
Hurry!

38
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:38,760
Up there!

39
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:39,510
He's above us!

40
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,270
Over there! After him!

41
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,000
Where's Mi Lan?

42
00:06:59,030 --> 00:06:59,680
Behind us.

43
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,950
I'm here.

44
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,470
Jump!

45
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:05,350
Jump!

46
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:13,830
You actually kicked me!

47
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,000
Let's go.

48
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:24,880
Hurry!

49
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,320
Over there! Shoot!

50
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,680
Hurry! Catch them!

51
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,120
Go!

52
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:03,640
Don't worry.

53
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,710
Shen Zhiheng won't get far

54
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:06,910
with two burdens.

55
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,270
Everything looks the same.

56
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,440
Which way should we go?

57
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,690
If we keep running like this,
we'll get lost for sure.

58
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,950
I'll lead the way.

59
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,470
Three over there.

60
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,470
Four over there. Closer.

61
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,780
Keep yourselves hidden.

62
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:25,990
Shoot!

63
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:36,830
Go!

64
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,590
Are you mad?

65
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:42,750
Those are all our people!

66
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,050
If Shen Zhiheng escapes,
it doesn't work no matter how many people.

67
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,320
Keep shooting.

68
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,230
Cease fire!

69
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,080
Go in and search.

70
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,280
This way.

71
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,920
Why have we stopped? Are we lost?

72
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,350
The wind's too strong.

73
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,750
I can't tell the sound.

74
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,830
(I'll give you one last chance.)

75
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,400
Let me, Mi Lan, and Weilian go,

76
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,750
and I'll take you with us.

77
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,660
You've climbed from the bottom
to this position

78
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,990
and still care about the poor.

79
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,990
For that alone,
you're not rotten to the core yet.

80
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,460
In addition, I'll give you one million.

81
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,470
I think my life's worth that much.

82
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,590
Shen Zhiheng!

83
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,400
Stop shooting! I'm Li Yingliang!

84
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,080
Stop!

85
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,550
What are you standing around for?
After them!

86
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,260
Yes.

87
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:24,950
Mi Lan. Weilian.

88
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,280
Mi Lan.

89
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,400
How are you feeling? Are you hurt?

90
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,800
I'm not in pain.

91
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,400
Just tired.

92
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,350
Can't run anymore.

93
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:36,830
It hurts.

94
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,280
It hurts so much.

95
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,280
Weilian!

96
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,560
I'm in so much pain…

97
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:43,280
Weilian!

98
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:46,870
Weilian…

99
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:47,990
Shen,

100
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,560
it hurts so much…

101
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,560
It's all right. Don't worry.
It'll stop hurting soon.

102
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,150
I'll take you to a doctor right away.

103
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,350
You'll be better soon.

104
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,750
Weilian.

105
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,200
- Mr. Shen…
- Weilian!

106
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,710
Mr. Shen…

107
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,060
It hurts…

108
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,200
It hurts…

109
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,470
Don't be afraid.

110
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,950
Don't worry.

111
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,560
It'll stop hurting soon.

112
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,630
I'll definitely
get you two out of here.

113
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,520
I'll find you the best doctor.

114
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,280
I'll take you home.

115
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,680
I'll bring you home.

116
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,350
It won't hurt for long.

117
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,710
Someone's coming.

118
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,230
Shen,

119
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,160
it hurt so much just now that I didn't
get the chance to tell you.

120
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,230
You told me not to be afraid.

121
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,200
I should be the one saying that to you.

122
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,920
Who are you?

123
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,560
Who in the world are you?

124
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,320
I'm actually

125
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,230
your brother.

126
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,320
Why weren't you scared

127
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,950
when you first saw me?

128
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,750
Quite a bite you have.

129
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,680
But that chicken

130
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,870
belongs to our hospital.

131
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,440
You have to pay for it.

132
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,680
How is that possible?

133
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,280
I…

134
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,230
Am I going mad?

135
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:17,710
Where's Weilian?

136
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,520
Where's Situ Weilian?

137
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,590
Where's Weilian?

138
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,040
I'm right here.

139
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,450
- Are you blind too?
- You're not Weilian!

140
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,950
Shen, if you're going to lose it,
can you do it when we get home?

141
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,800
Right now, we've got to escape.

142
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,680
If they catch us again,

143
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,520
not only will you be going to Binjiang,

144
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,080
but I'll also be going with you.

145
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,680
(If you do)

146
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,080
(find your brother one day,)

147
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,990
(what will you do?)

148
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,470
Don't think about fighting.

149
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,790
You can't beat him anyway.

150
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:50,950
What do you mean?

151
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,320
(I am your brother.)

152
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,110
I'll take full responsibility for you.

153
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:02,870
Run!

154
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,200
Stay away from me!

155
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,400
Stop messing around!

156
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,990
At least let me take a look at Mi Lan!

157
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,470
Hurry!

158
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,590
Catch them!

159
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,320
- Hurry!
- Run!

160
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,160
Miss Mu,

161
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,990
most of your top fighters are down.

162
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,790
Even the Haidong Army
couldn't capture him.

163
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,670
I don't believe you would lose to him.

164
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:43,520
I think

165
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,830
you let them go on purpose.

166
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:46,830
What do you mean by that?

167
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,440
Nothing.

168
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,920
Since you're injured,

169
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,350
leave the rest to me.

170
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:59,350
No more waiting.

171
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,460
Set the fire.

172
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,400
Force them out.

173
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:01,920
Yes.

174
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,760
Shen, the fire's getting worse.

175
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,040
What are you doing?

176
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,800
You're making a firebreak.

177
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,480
Now's not the time for us to argue.

178
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,960
Even for Mi Lan's sake,

179
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,830
we need to find a way out.

180
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,040
That Mu Lihua is really something.

181
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,520
Facing her head-on

182
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,960
might be tough to get away unscathed.

183
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,390
What are we doing?

184
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,040
Why aren't we finding an exit?

185
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,520
Wait until dawn.

186
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,720
Dawn?

187
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,430
At dawn,

188
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,190
the Asia Express will pass through here.

189
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,430
It's our only chance.

190
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,000
The day is breaking.

191
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,320
The fire's spreading.

192
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,670
(Have you ever taken the Asia Express?)

193
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,150
If we transfer at Beiju,

194
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,350
we can get to Binjiang in no time.

195
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,150
Very comfortable.

196
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,910
Very efficient.

197
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,630
Shen Zhiheng, you tricked me!

198
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,670
Mi Lan.

199
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,150
Mi Lan.

200
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,630
Wake up, Mi Lan.

201
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,670
Wake up.

202
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,190
You can't sleep now, Mi Lan.

203
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,590
Mi Lan.

204
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,690
There should be
a medical room on this train.

205
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,080
I'll find a way

206
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,390
to treat her wounds.

207
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:44,960
Don't move!

208
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:45,960
Don't move!

209
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,560
You…

210
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,350
Officer, what's going on?

211
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,590
Officer.

212
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,450
Why can't we reach
the railway bureau by phone?

213
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,000
Officer, this is a small station.

214
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,430
The line is short and can only connect
to the two nearby small stations.

215
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,600
Then inform the next station.

216
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:05,800
Officer…

217
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,560
Make the call!

218
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:10,480
All right…

219
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,310
I'll make the call.

220
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,960
This is Guyuan Station.

221
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:16,880
Guyuan Station?

222
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,540
The Haidong Army is pursuing
three fugitives on the Asia Express.

223
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,380
They carry gunshot wounds.

224
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,320
I order you to intercept

225
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,040
the Asia Express immediately!

226
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,780
(Yayuan Station)

227
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,800
This is Yayuan Station.

228
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,640
This is the station master
of Guyuan Station speaking.

229
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,320
The Asia Express
is a special express train.

230
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,280
We don't have the authority
to intercept it.

231
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,560
The station master refused.

232
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,580
He said they don't have the authority.

233
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,040
They… They can't intercept it.

234
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,280
Then relay the message
from one station to the next.

235
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,980
Contact the railway bureau.

236
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,490
Tell them that the fugitives
escaped onto the nearest Asia Express.

237
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,720
Request an immediate stop

238
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,150
and search of the entire train.

239
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,580
Yes.

240
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:39,150
Hello, Guyuan Station?

241
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:46,660
(Yayuan Station)

242
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,960
Mr. Shen, are you in such a hurry
to get to Binjiang

243
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:08,390
that you can't appreciate the scenery?

244
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:11,520
Maybe this journey's end

245
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,560
won't be so bad for me.

246
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,350
Once we get off the train,

247
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,430
it might be a whole different story.

248
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,240
if you make it back alive,

249
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,430
I'll buy you a ticket

250
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,720
for the Asia Express,

251
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,560
so you can return to Haidong in style.

252
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:33,100
(Yayuan Station)

253
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,870
This is Yayuan Station.

254
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:42,000
This is Beiju Station.

255
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:44,580
After inspection, we did not find
the three fugitives you mentioned.

256
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,240
Are you certain?

257
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,110
Affirmative.

258
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,800
(Shen Zhiheng,)

259
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,960
(you had it all planned out
from the beginning)

260
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,040
(and used me, deceived me.)

261
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,350
(And yet,
I actually faltered for a moment.)

262
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,760
We were almost at Beiju.

263
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,380
Why did we have to jump off the train?

264
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:26,630
I've got it.

265
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,240
You think they might search
for us at Beiju Station, right?

266
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,690
Maybe I should carry her instead?

267
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,240
This isn't going to work.

268
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,980
(Haidong)

269
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,630
(Superintendent's Office)
I went to great lengths,

270
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,630
used a special express,
and mobilized so many people

271
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:05,320
to get Shen Zhiheng to Binjiang
for an examination,

272
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,830
and this is the result I get?

273
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,350
Superintendent Chi,

274
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,280
my intention was to send Shen Zhiheng
to Binjiang for an examination,

275
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,190
to carry out what you planned.

276
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,910
But I need to ask Mr. Li,

277
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,320
why were your bullets

278
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:25,800
aimed at me

279
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,830
in the reeds that day?

280
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,390
I did no such thing.

281
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,000
The wind and snow
were strong that night.

282
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,310
I couldn't see clearly and missed.

283
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,670
Missed?

284
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,040
Fine.

285
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,800
I'll believe they missed, for now.

286
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:46,240
Superintendent Chi,

287
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,190
I will report the matter

288
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:50,040
with Shen Zhiheng truthfully
to my family.

289
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,320
Goodbye.

290
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,580
Superintendent,
I never intended to kill Miss Mu.

291
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,150
What difference would it make

292
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,800
if she were dead?

293
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,390
Would it matter to us?

294
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:20,480
The issue isn't about
killing her or not!

295
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,910
But letting Shen Zhiheng escape!

296
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,390
He escaped! Do you understand?

297
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,190
And you gave Mu Lihua such a big excuse

298
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,320
to stir up trouble!

299
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,430
Li Yingliang,

300
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,110
how can you still have the nerve
to come crawling back alive?

301
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,080
Wu Zhongyi.

302
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:34,830
Yes, sir.

303
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,590
Lock him up.

304
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:36,560
Take him away.

305
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:37,890
Superintendent!

306
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,240
Superintendent!

307
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,760
Mr. Li!

308
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,910
Miss Jin, please…

309
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,080
Please help Mr. Li.

310
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:15,720
Why should I?

311
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,110
Whenthere's trouble, you come to me?

312
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:21,670
And who is it, I wonder,
that never wants to step foot inside

313
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,000
the Jin family's gate?

314
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:24,670
That's not true.

315
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,280
It's really not.

316
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,830
How is it not true?

317
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,720
Li Guisheng,

318
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,000
you've always been
in cahoots with Liang,

319
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,320
hiding everything from me.

320
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,560
What did I tell you two?

321
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,350
Stay away

322
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,320
from Chi Shanying's evil deeds

323
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,490
and come back to the Jin family.

324
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,910
But did either of you ever listen to me?

325
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:44,480
Miss Jin,

326
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,040
I really wanted to come back.

327
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,430
But you know

328
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,430
how Mr. Liang is.

329
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,080
He may not say it,

330
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:52,150
but he cares deeply about you.

331
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,830
Just the other day,
we were drinking, and he said,

332
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:56,560
"Sheng,

333
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:58,000
do you think I want

334
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,740
to live every day

335
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,240
with my head on the line?

336
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,350
I don't.

337
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,320
But we can't turn back.

338
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,560
The better Jin Jingxue…

339
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,960
Miss Jin treats me,

340
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,670
the farther I need to stay from her.

341
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:11,760
Even if we end up as beggars
on the street,

342
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,320
we must never let Miss Jin
get dragged into this."

343
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,910
You see, he's always thinking of you.

344
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:24,350
Is what you said true?

345
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:25,960
Of course, it's true.

346
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,110
Would I lie to you?

347
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,720
Very well. I've heard you.

348
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:32,800
You can go back now.

349
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,670
So,

350
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,800
will you help,

351
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,280
Miss Jin?

352
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,080
That's none of your concern.

353
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,320
Get going.

354
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:47,390
Understood.

355
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,960
Please hurry, though.

356
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,940
(Haidong Army HQ)

357
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,390
Miss Jin, I'm afraid you're unaware of

358
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,150
the extent of Li Yingliang's mistake.

359
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,760
Superintendent Chi,

360
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,630
haven't you always claimed

361
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:14,280
you have no ties
with the Economic Development Committee?

362
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,110
Then why are you the one

363
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,830
punishing Li Yingliang?

364
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,800
What do you mean by that?

365
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,280
I know

366
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:25,110
you might not tell me

367
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,390
the real reason,

368
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,280
but I know very well
how much Li Yingliang has done for you

369
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,430
since he left the Jin family

370
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,760
to join you.

371
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,670
Others may not know, but I do.

372
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:38,960
He's still someone from the Jin family.

373
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,430
If anything happens to him,

374
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,000
I'll be very concerned.

375
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,390
Miss Jin.

376
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:54,910
Be careful, it's hot.

377
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,110
Some things are okay

378
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,040
to say once,

379
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,110
but repeating them

380
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,040
becomes meaningless.

381
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,870
I understand.

382
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,670
Superintendent.

383
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:39,560
Superintendent.

384
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:45,110
You know how difficult

385
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:48,350
my first step was.

386
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,900
Capturing Shen Zhiheng

387
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,000
was the first step in my cooperation

388
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,320
with the Mu family,

389
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,320
and you ruined it.

390
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:01,320
I even praised you in front of them

391
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,630
for being capable.

392
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:09,320
My fault for misjudging you.

393
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:14,110
Miss Jin came

394
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,110
to plead for you earlier.

395
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,560
You can leave now.

396
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,430
But remember,

397
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,350
Li Yingliang,

398
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,240
if I truly want to kill someone,

399
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,520
no amount of pleading
from anyone will help.

400
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,670
Mr. Li, you're out.

401
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,910
Is everything okay now?

402
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,110
Sheng, I've been suspended.

403
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,390
We need to catch Shen Zhiheng,

404
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,110
or we're all doomed.

405
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,740
We'll all be doomed!

406
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,000
You've only been suspended.

407
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,350
You'll be back.

408
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:24,480
Yes,

409
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,630
I can still come back.

410
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,240
How can I help you?

411
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,900
Shen Zhiheng escaped.

412
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,110
We need to capture him.

413
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,520
We need to bring him back.

414
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,080
The Haidong Army already searched

415
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,390
the Asia Express at Beiju Station.

416
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:38,800
They found some discarded clothes.

417
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:42,340
Only one train passed through Beiju Station
in those five minutes.

418
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,800
Check that route thoroughly.

419
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,320
Notify me immediately
if you find anything.

420
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:47,040
Rest assured, I'll get to it right away.

421
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,140
Let me send you back first.

422
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,760
No need, you go and investigate it.

423
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,960
I'll go back on my own.

424
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:13,980
(Haidong Army HQ)

425
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,240
How do you know about this place?

426
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,110
Mr. Mo.

427
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:27,800
Shen Zhiheng?

428
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,350
My friend is injured, badly.

429
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:30,800
Hurry, come in.

430
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:45,590
Mr. Mo.

431
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,430
How did you

432
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:49,240
get into such a mess?

433
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,480
It's all because of Mu Lihua.

434
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,150
Is the descendant of the Mu family
really that formidable?

435
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,350
She had help
from the Haidong Superintendent.

436
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:02,390
We wouldn't be
in this situation otherwise.

437
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,000
But I did gain something.

438
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,560
At least I found my brother.

439
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,400
Your brother?

440
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,000
The young doctor
who performed the surgery?

441
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,960
Then that's great news.

442
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,960
Congratulations.

443
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,750
Congratulations?

444
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,440
He's been by my side for three years

445
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,710
and never told me.

446
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,040
I don't know what he's hiding.

447
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:29,920
What ill intentions could a young boy
in his hundreds have?

448
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:33,200
By the way, about Mu Lihua,

449
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:33,960
do you…?

450
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,520
Mi Lan is fine.

451
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:40,150
She just needs plenty of rest.

452
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:47,230
I'll watch over Mi Lan for you.

453
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:48,590
You two should have

454
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,000
a good talk.

455
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,150
Don't fight, though.

456
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,390
If you must fight, go outside.

457
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,000
The things in the yard are expensive.

458
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,920
What?

459
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,790
Are you here to settle scores with me
right after I saved Mi Lan?

460
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,760
I'm not afraid to settle scores.

461
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,720
I've never had
any ill intentions towards you.

462
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,360
How about I start calling you
"elder brother" from now on?

463
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,000
Why did you lie to me?

464
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:44,040
I didn't mean to lie to you.

465
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,420
When we first met,

466
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,160
I had no idea
whether you were good or bad.

467
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:48,880
So, I decided I wanted
to stay by your side

468
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,840
and observe.

469
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:51,480
And before I knew it,

470
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,000
it slipped my mind.

471
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,150
For three years,

472
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:57,190
all this time,
I've been searching for you,

473
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,150
running around everywhere to find you.

474
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,000
You knew all along,

475
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,110
but you said nothing.

476
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,560
You hid it from me.

477
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:04,480
If you hadn't been shot,

478
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,630
you'd still be hiding,

479
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,270
watching me search for you blindly.

480
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,710
Isn't that right?

481
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:10,750
I asked you, didn't I?

482
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,310
Whether you were looking to repay

483
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,230
or seek revenge on your brother.

484
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,480
At the time, you wanted revenge.

485
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,230
I like you.

486
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,660
I just want to be brothers with you.

487
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,690
If we can't be brothers,
being friends is good enough.

488
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,750
I don't want us to be enemies.

489
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,590
Don't want to be enemies?

490
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,790
Yet in a life-and-death situation,
you refused to help.

491
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,590
Life-and-death situation?

492
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,040
You mean when you saved me and Mi Lan?

493
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,040
I didn't know it was life and death.

494
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,150
I thought you could
handle it on your own,

495
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,630
so I waited with Mi Lan.

496
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,000
You didn't know?

497
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,710
Or did you just want to keep hiding
and not get involved?

498
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,400
Brother, I…

499
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,150
In this world,

500
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:51,790
I have no one

501
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:55,440
but you to rely on,

502
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,000
to trust.

503
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,960
Even if I die, you'd be fine.

504
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,480
I've signed all the papers
with the lawyer.

505
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,080
You are to be my sole heir.

506
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,190
All my assets are yours.

507
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:10,080
That's my love for you.

508
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,150
Heng…

509
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:13,400
But our relationship ends here.

510
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,750
From now on,

511
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,480
you go your way.

512
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:20,670
Good luck.

513
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,310
I won't see you off.

514
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:24,270
Heng!

515
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,270
It was wrong of me to lie to you.

516
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,560
But haven't I taken good care of you
all these years?

517
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,360
I know you too well.

518
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,110
You just want to see me as a fool.

519
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,230
You enjoy watching me
being kept in the dark.

520
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,750
It amuses you, doesn't it?

521
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,230
Are you crazy?

522
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,840
How dare you lay hands on me!

523
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:07,590
You're nothing more than an inheritance
my mother left me!

524
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,190
It's your honor that I acknowledge you
as my big brother!

525
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,630
Can you feel it?

526
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,560
I'm stronger than you.

527
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:52,290
Especially since I'm whole and complete,
I will never lose control.

528
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,080
Heng,

529
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:12,960
stop.

530
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,080
