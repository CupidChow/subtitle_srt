3
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,940
(This drama is purely fictional.)

4
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,430
Mr. Situ.

5
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,030
Tao.

6
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,230
Where's Jingxue?

7
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,920
Miss Jin left early in the morning.

8
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,520
She's not home.

9
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:52,950
She's not home?

10
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,790
Where did she go?

11
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,640
I don't know.

12
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,000
When will she return, then?

13
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,150
I don't know either.

14
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,720
Tao, what do you know, then?

15
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,030
I don't know anything.

16
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,230
If so,

17
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,080
hand this to Jingxue for me.

18
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,940
I've included
the method of usage as well.

19
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:08,640
I prepared

20
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,920
this prescription for her.

21
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,480
You just need to hand this to her.

22
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,550
Alright, Mr. Situ.

23
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,360
After that, you must tell her
that I prepared this for her.

24
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,080
I know.

25
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,110
Seems like you finally know something.

26
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,480
Miss Jin,

27
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:21,920
please have some tea.

28
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,390
Thank you, Superintendent Chi.

29
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,760
Miss Jin, what's with the sudden visit?

30
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,110
Is it something urgent?

31
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:32,640
Miss Jin,

32
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,360
what's with the wound on your face...

33
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,230
That doesn't matter.

34
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,160
Superintendent Chi, I heard from people that

35
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,820
Li Yingliang
disclosed the confidential documents

36
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,550
of Haidong Army to the newspaper firms.

37
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,440
He's missing

38
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,480
because you targeted him.

39
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,760
You assassinated him.

40
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:47,950
Is that true?

41
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,670
Nonsense.

42
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,990
That's pure nonsense!

43
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,320
We're looking for him ourselves.

44
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,110
Are you sure you guys didn't kill him?

45
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,100
You'll be struck by lightning
if you lie.

46
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:58,270
It's a shame that it'll never strike me.

47
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,640
Let me put it this way.

48
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,640
Li Yingliang

49
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,040
is my most loyal subordinate.

50
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,670
Everyone outside is saying

51
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,160
that Li Yingliang had deceived me.

52
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,710
I don't believe them at all.

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,480
According to my understanding of him,

54
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,360
I think he encountered a mishap.

55
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,480
He has no way to show up

56
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,760
and clarify the issue.

57
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,360
I want to find him and save him

58
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,270
more than anyone else.

59
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,790
Firstly, I'm doing it
to save his life and future.

60
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:28,990
Secondly,

61
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,830
I'm doing it to protect my reputation.

62
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,880
Miss Jin, I assume you can understand
what I'm saying.

63
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,150
What kinds of mishaps
could he have encountered?

64
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,710
He made enemies

65
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,040
for your sake.

66
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,940
You were the one who forced him
to commit all those evil deeds.

67
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,330
That's why he offended many people.

68
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,270
Now that he's in trouble,

69
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,870
you guys mustn't leave him in the lurch.

70
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,670
What about this?

71
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,480
Miss Jin,

72
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,080
I have some questions for you.

73
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,880
It's because you might
know him better than me.

74
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,830
It might help us to locate him quicker.

75
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:06,800
Superintendent Chi,

76
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,080
actually, I saw Li Yingliang
three days ago.

77
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,110
We met in a cafe.

78
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,950
He even begged Situ Weilian
to contact Shen Zhiheng.

79
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,710
I never saw him after that.

80
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,680
Recently, Guisheng told me

81
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:19,830
that he went missing.

82
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,440
So, according to what you said,

83
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,950
Li Yingliang

84
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,710
looked for Situ Weilian before this.

85
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,150
He hoped that he could meet Shen Zhiheng

86
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,570
through Situ Weilian's arrangement.

87
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,390
If so, maybe

88
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,800
Shen Zhiheng was behind this.

89
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,590
I confronted him before this.

90
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,000
But he denied it.

91
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,830
Shen Zhiheng is very cunning.

92
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,240
He's a liar.

93
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,240
Don't let him fool you.

94
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,760
If it was him,

95
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,560
I would seek revenge against him.

96
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,320
You see, Miss Jin,

97
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,450
I have plenty
of petty affairs to deal with.

98
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,360
What about this?
You can head back first.

99
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,950
I'll send my men to notify you
once I receive any news of Li Yingliang.

100
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,240
Is that okay?

101
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,560
Alright, then.

102
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,490
Superintendent Chi,
sorry for the trouble.

103
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,590
Take care.

104
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,120
Wu Zhongyi.

105
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,490
Superintendent Chi.

106
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,800
Have you not found Li Yingliang yet?

107
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:23,590
No.

108
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,880
Spread the news that
Li Guisheng was captured.

109
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,980
Force him to show himself.

110
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:31,800
Yes, sir.

111
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:59,510
Hurry and sleep.

112
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,200
Mr. Shen.

113
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,920
Will you kill Mr. Li?

114
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,830
He hurt you.

115
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,470
He did hurt me.

116
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,000
But due to that, I gained vision.

117
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,360
Regarding that,

118
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,070
I don't hate him.

119
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,470
But he kept pestering you

120
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,440
and harming you.

121
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,710
I think he should be punished.

122
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,880
You shouldn't think about such affairs.

123
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,390
Go to sleep now.

124
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,390
Good night.

125
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,270
Good night.

126
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,920
Shen Zhiheng!

127
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,030
You freak!

128
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,090
I'm going to skin you alive
and torture you when I get out!

129
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,560
Chi Shanying, I was loyal to you,
yet you treated me like a lackey!

130
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,000
Li Guisheng, you useless fool!

131
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,240
You can't find anything!

132
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,180
I nurtured you in vain!

133
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,860
What are you looking at?

134
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,510
You gigolo.

135
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,710
Situ Weilian!

136
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,680
How dare you steal Jin Jingxue from me?

137
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,590
I'll kill you!

138
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,390
Mi Lan,

139
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,760
you silly girl.

140
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,320
You idiot.

141
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,490
Why would you
believe in a freak?

142
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,510
Liang,

143
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,710
I would never be imprisoned

144
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,070
if it weren't for you!

145
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,590
It's all your fault!

146
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,760
You landed me in trouble!

147
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,800
Mr. Shen, let me serve you.

148
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,470
Thank you, Liang.

149
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,510
Investigate Shen Zhiheng!

150
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,030
I didn't tell you
to do all this nonsense!

151
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,320
I guarantee with my life!

152
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,860
I guarantee
that Shen Zhiheng is dead!

153
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,830
Mr. Li.

154
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:53,240
Go away!

155
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,320
Mr. Shen never paid
any attention to you.

156
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:56,630
Go away!

157
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,590
In the end? Where's the evidence?

158
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,440
Scram!

159
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,120
Scram!

160
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:28,800
Is anyone there?

161
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:31,950
Is anyone there?

162
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,520
Is anyone there?

163
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,110
Let me out!

164
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,950
Is anyone there?

165
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,350
Shen Zhiheng!

166
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,800
Shen Zhiheng!

167
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,640
(He's not at home.)

168
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,390
(He's not at his office either.)

169
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,680
(Liang,)

170
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,280
(where exactly are you hiding?)

171
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,520
I never expected this menace

172
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,280
to actually dig a hole through the wall.

173
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:36,800
Miss Jin.

174
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:37,560
Who's there?

175
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:43,950
Liang?

176
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,470
Liang?

177
00:11:59,160 --> 00:11:59,990
Liang!

178
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,950
How did you end up like this?

179
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,490
Where have you been
for the past few days?

180
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,040
You made me worried,

181
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,400
you know?

182
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,590
How did you end up like this?

183
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,590
I'm fine. Just ignore me.

184
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,160
You're seriously wounded.

185
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,350
Let's go to the hospital.

186
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:19,680
I'm not going!

187
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,990
I'm not going anywhere!

188
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,950
I won't go anywhere.

189
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,400
Alright. We won't go anywhere.

190
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,570
We won't go to the hospital.

191
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,350
Liang,

192
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,590
are you hungry, then?

193
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,400
Why don't you eat something?

194
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:31,950
I'm not hungry.

195
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,160
I'm just thirsty.

196
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,350
I'll get you some water, then.

197
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,590
It's fine.

198
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,560
I already had some tap water.

199
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,520
Liang,

200
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,230
what exactly happened to you?

201
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,830
Who did this to you?

202
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,110
Tell me.

203
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,560
Did someone torture you?

204
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,440
I was kidnapped.

205
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,710
It was Shen Zhiheng.

206
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,800
That scum!

207
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,920
I knew he lied to me!

208
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,750
Liang, don't be scared.

209
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,440
You're fine now.

210
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,830
What are you trying to do?

211
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,950
Liang,

212
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,320
I only want to make you
a cup of hot cocoa.

213
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,040
No! They are trying to kill me!
Don't open the door!

214
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,750
Alright.

215
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:36,920
Alright.

216
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,750
I won't open the door.

217
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:42,160
By "all of them",
were you referring to Shen Zhiheng?

218
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,200
Don't worry.

219
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,710
He's not bold enough

220
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,470
to commit murder in my residence.

221
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,830
Unless he has a death wish.

222
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,440
He's bold enough.

223
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,640
Alright.

224
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,470
We won't go anywhere.

225
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,230
I won't open the door.

226
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,540
Everything will be fine.

227
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,470
Come.

228
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:17,750
Liang,

229
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,950
if you're scared,

230
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,440
why don't we leave Haidong and return

231
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,680
to our hometown tomorrow?

232
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,950
That won't do.

233
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,830
I can't show myself in public now.

234
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,920
Shen Zhiheng has ruined my life.

235
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,470
Chi Shanying will come up on me.

236
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,870
Alright.

237
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,040
We won't go anywhere.

238
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,520
You can live here with peace of mind.

239
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:37,950
I'll keep you company
for the next few days, okay?

240
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,560
Your servants aren't reliable.

241
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,640
Will they betray me?

242
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,520
Don't worry.

243
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,870
I'll give them a holiday tomorrow.

244
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:46,850
I'll only keep Tao here.

245
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,350
She grew up together with me.

246
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,390
She's definitely reliable.

247
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,110
Trust me, Liang.

248
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,400
Just trust me.

249
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,680
You should sleep.

250
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:04,950
You should stop worrying.

251
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,990
If not, you'll scare yourself to death
before Shen Zhiheng is here.

252
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:15,920
Don't switch it off!

253
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,540
Alright.

254
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,470
I'll keep it on.

255
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,160
Liang, it's fine now.

256
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,160
Go to sleep.

257
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,560
Liang?

258
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:03,990
Liang?

259
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,160
Liang.

260
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,090
Everything's fine now.

261
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:07,920
It's fine now.

262
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:09,880
Don't be scared.

263
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,510
Everything's fine now.

264
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:33,600
Everything's fine now.

265
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,230
Tao.

266
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,030
Mr. Situ.

267
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,230
Is Jingxue home?

268
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:40,840
No.

269
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,290
Miss Jin took a train this morning
to go back to her hometown.

270
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,510
What's her address, then?

271
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,550
I don't know.

272
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,880
When will she come back, then?

273
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,270
I don't know either.

274
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,900
(Shen Mansion)

275
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,750
(Mr. Mo once said)

276
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,510
(the three stones restrain each other.)

277
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,450
(This crow has been
under Mr. Mo's care for a long time.)

278
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,160
(Even I'm a little bit fearful)

279
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,920
(of the crow's power.)

280
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:34,120
(What would happen if I do this?)

281
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,990
(Since Mr. Mo handed you to me himself,)

282
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,710
(I suppose it won't be that simple.)

283
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,030
Miss Mu, we received a telegram
from Lin Zhen.

284
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,990
One century ago.

285
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,270
Her surname is Wei.

286
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:23,920
Wei Qiu?

287
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,550
The Wei family?

288
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,470
Could this be a mere coincidence?

289
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,030
Heng.

290
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:48,600
Weilian.

291
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,680
What are you doing here?

292
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,120
Heng,

293
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,550
I fell out of love.

294
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,080
You fell out of love again?

295
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,270
Heng,

296
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,880
Jingxue returned to her hometown.

297
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,890
She didn't even tell me
that she was heading back.

298
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,840
Is she abandoning me?

299
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,400
Maybe she was avoiding you on purpose.

300
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,030
Maybe she's having fun
outside right now.

301
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:09,470
That's too big.

302
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,550
It doesn't suit you.

303
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,030
That looks nice.

304
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,980
Are you just going
to pick her hairpins

305
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,400
and ignore me in distress?

306
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,840
You shouldn't focus all your energy
on relationships alone.

307
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,440
There's one thing you should know.

308
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:25,990
Mi Lan.

309
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,810
Isn't this the necklace
I wore when I was young?

310
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,230
How did you find it?

311
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,990
You have to listen

312
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,470
to its story closely.

313
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,230
So, this is a magical item, huh?

314
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,710
I was able to save you

315
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,030
and Mi Lan all thanks to it.

316
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,390
If my mother's family and the Mu family
are the Three Outer Families,

317
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,360
who's the last family?

318
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,120
It's Mr. Mo's family.

319
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,400
Mr. Mo?

320
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,740
You mean the charlatan
at the wooden shack in Shenhai?

321
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,120
Mr. Mo is a nice person.

322
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,640
He even gave us a crow.

323
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,680
Don't badmouth him.

324
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,200
Mr. Mo is a friend, not a foe.

325
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,490
If so, why are we
engaging Mu Lihua in a fight, then?

326
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,670
If Mr. Mo is that capable,
he should deal with her himself.

327
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,470
Mu Lihua is targeting us.

328
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,310
What has this got to do with him?

329
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,640
So, does that mean

330
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,900
our conflict with her will only end
when one of us dies?

331
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,680
But if she does possess such power,

332
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,610
is it even possible to even defeat her?

333
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:35,890
It seems like Mu Lihua doesn't understand
the full picture either.

334
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,750
She's still relying on

335
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,640
Chi Shanying and his influence
in Haidong.

336
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,400
It's better to plan

337
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,270
as early as possible.

338
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,020
It's good that she doesn't know.

339
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,350
It's best if she doesn't find out.

340
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:48,790
You can have this back.

341
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,990
All of that doesn't matter.

342
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,680
Jingxue.

343
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:52,450
Now, my head is filled with
thoughts of her.

344
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,200
Heng,

345
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,120
you have to find out
where her hometown is.

346
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,840
Heng, you have to help me out.

347
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,510
I can't live without you. I need you.

348
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,760
Were there still people
looking for me?

349
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:14,790
There's no one

350
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,910
except for Mr. Situ,
who asks me once per day.

351
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,160
Now, everyone outside

352
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,990
thinks that the mistress isn't home.

353
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:20,710
Tao,

354
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,470
Liang came to seek shelter here

355
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,990
because he offended formidable figures.

356
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,840
We must protect him

357
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,990
and prevent his enemies
from finding him here.

358
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,270
Yes, Miss Jin.

359
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,310
You may leave.

360
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,680
You should stop.

361
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,360
It's too dark. It'll hurt your eyes.

362
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,470
I have to do something.

363
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,880
I'm so bored.

364
00:22:59,200 --> 00:22:59,710
Guess

365
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,360
what I'm knitting.

366
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,230
I don't know.

367
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,790
Actually, I don't know either.

368
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:07,840
If I'm lazy,

369
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,440
it'll turn into a scarf.

370
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,510
If I'm hardworking,

371
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,750
it'll turn into a sweater.

372
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:14,600
It depends on you whether it'll turn
into a scarf or a sweater.

373
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,160
Is it for me?

374
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:18,680
It's for the dog.

375
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,080
You should stop.

376
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,160
It's too exhausting.

377
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,510
If I wish to wear something like that,
I'll go out and buy one.

378
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,310
Do you truly care for me?

379
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,680
Or you just don't want
to owe me any favors?

380
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,360
If it's the front,

381
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,360
I'm grateful.

382
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,990
If it's the latter,

383
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,880
you shouldn't stay
at my house right now.

384
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,120
You should leave immediately.

385
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:45,200
Of course I can't just stay here
all the time.

386
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,510
Don't tell me you want to go back?

387
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,260
Do you know what other people
are saying about you?

388
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,710
You're Chi Shanying's lackey.

389
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,840
And you disclosed
his confidential files

390
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,260
and published them in the newspaper.

391
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,700
Chi Shanying will never let you off.

392
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:00,990
If you head back now,
you'll be seeking death.

393
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,310
Shen Zhiheng framed me.

394
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,270
I didn't do it.

395
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,400
Chi Shanying is just angry at me
for the time being.

396
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,080
We have aligned interests.

397
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,790
He wouldn't kill me that easily.

398
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,680
Just forget about it.

399
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,680
Even if Chi Shanying doesn't kill you,
Shen Zhiheng will.

400
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:16,550
You should come to my hometown
with me tomorrow.

401
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,440
At least you won't starve.

402
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,310
There's no point in escaping.

403
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,840
So what if I'm a lackey?

404
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,470
The result will be the same anyway.

405
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,470
If so, I would rather
take the preemptive strike.

406
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,610
At least I have a foundation.

407
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,950
Chi Shanying admires my talent.

408
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,790
As long as he's willing
to give me a chance,

409
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,640
I'll be able to make a comeback.

410
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,400
Why are you trying to make a comeback?

411
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,390
If you want money, I can give you that.

412
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,790
You don't need to make a comeback.

413
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,120
I have to!

414
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,950
I must make a comeback!

415
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,640
I don't want money.

416
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,510
I want power.

417
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,750
You're unreasonable.

418
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,400
I predict that she's hiding
from you on purpose.

419
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,550
But why?

420
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,030
I'm a good boy.

421
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,190
I didn't make her angry.

422
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:09,400
Heng,

423
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,400
did you release Li Yingliang or not?

424
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,840
I've already answered

425
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,710
that question 100 times.

426
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,470
He's not here.

427
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,990
You should try calling
the Jin family again.

428
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,990
I already called them this morning.

429
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,080
No one picked up.

430
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,550
You should try again.

431
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,200
Hello, this is the Jin Mansion.

432
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,440
Hello, Tao.

433
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,510
It's me, Situ Weilian.

434
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,840
Where exactly did Jingxue go?

435
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,030
I don't know.

436
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,360
Don't tell me she's in trouble?

437
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,750
I don't know.

438
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,840
When will she come back, then?

439
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,840
I'm not sure.

440
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,120
Fine.

441
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,230
Alright. Goodbye.

442
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:54,200
Miss Jin, Dr. Situ called us just now.

443
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,670
He was asking about your condition
and when you would come back.

444
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,890
I told him that I knew nothing.

445
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:05,120
Situ Weilian

446
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,470
is quite devoted to you, huh?

447
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,080
There are plenty of people like him.

448
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,200
If so, between you and Shen Zhiheng,

449
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,790
who is more important
in his heart?

450
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,230
What kind of question was that?

451
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,880
Maybe it's me.

452
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,920
If so, can you tell him to come here
and do me a favor?

453
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,840
What do you want him to do?

454
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,030
Deliver a letter to Chi Shanying
on my behalf.

455
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,200
Hello.

456
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,030
Hello, Miss Tao.

457
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:42,710
It's me again.

458
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,880
Is Jingxue trying
to hide from me at home?

459
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,200
Mr. Situ.

460
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,950
Miss Jin isn't home.

461
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:49,920
Fine, then.

462
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,640
When will she come back, then?

463
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,840
Mr. Situ,

464
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:54,230
I've told you many times.

465
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,510
I have no idea

466
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,750
when Miss Jin will come back.

467
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:58,440
Alright, then.

468
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,470
You must tell me

469
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,920
immediately when she's back, then.

470
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,750
Alright, Mr. Situ.

471
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:03,920
Goodbye.

472
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,310
Hello, Situ. This is Jingxue speaking.

473
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,360
Jingxue?

474
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:11,400
You're back?

475
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,190
I went to attend to some businesses.

476
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,470
I just came back.

477
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,360
You should come when you're free.

478
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,890
Alright. I'll head there right now.

479
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,480
Heng, you're amazing!

480
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,200
I'll make a move first.

481
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,270
So, that menace

482
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,710
was hiding in the Jin family.

483
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,120
Are you worried about Weilian?

484
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:41,030
What's there to worry about him?

485
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,680
Why are you frowning, then?

486
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:51,510
I don't wish to kill.

487
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:52,950
I can...

488
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:53,950
No, you can't.

489
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,200
Mr. Situ, you're here.

490
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:04,990
Where's Jingxue?

491
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,400
Miss Jin is waiting for you inside.

492
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,680
Jingxue.

493
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,120
Weilian, you're here.

494
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,550
You made me worried.

495
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:18,440
I thought I would never see you again.

496
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,790
When I heard your voice,

497
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,710
I wanted to rush here
as soon as possible.

498
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:22,600
Dr. Situ.

499
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:23,880
Long time no see.

500
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,360
Why do you still haunt me to no end?

501
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,360
What happened to you?

502
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,360
Did Shen Zhiheng set you free?

503
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,230
No.

504
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:42,160
I escaped by myself.

505
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,600
Jingxue,

506
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,200
I did tell Shen Zhiheng

507
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,310
to release Li Yingliang.

508
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,920
He said yes on the surface,

509
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:49,950
but he didn't do it.

510
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:50,990
I know.

511
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,840
Shen Zhiheng was untrustworthy.

512
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,120
It's his fault.

513
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,640
I'm already grateful to you

514
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,840
that you made a plea to him

515
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:57,880
for Liang's sake.

516
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,790
Dr. Situ, I have something urgent

517
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,190
to discuss with you
in private.

518
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:06,190
You already escaped from the place.
Why are you still looking for me?

519
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,600
Don't tell me
you want me to be your mediator again?

520
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,640
No. Don't even think about it.

521
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,630
I haven't even reconciled
with Shen Zhiheng yet.

522
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,080
He never smiled at me.

523
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,790
No. Dr. Situ, you misunderstood me.

524
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,980
I have something more important
to discuss with you.

525
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,360
Please give me a chance.

526
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:22,710
Situ,

527
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,680
why don't you hear him out first?

528
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,310
If he dares to spout nonsense,

529
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,550
you can just ignore him.

530
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,160
Dr. Situ.

531
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,640
(First rule, no bloodsucking allowed
without apparent reason)

532
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,550
Try and read them.

533
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,990
I don't recognize the words.

534
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,230
Try and recognize
as many as you can.

535
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,840
It's vital to learn how to read.

536
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,990
No. No. No.

537
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,750
People. People...

538
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,230
One, two,

539
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,160
three, four, five, six.

540
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,160
Do not hurt others
without apparent reason.

541
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,230
Do not show your true form

542
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,030
in front of strangers.

543
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:11,680
Why must we hide ourselves?

544
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,120
We're much stronger than them.

545
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,680
In this world,

546
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,030
we're the minority.

547
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,880
If we reveal ourselves,

548
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,880
we'll be ostracized and eliminated.

549
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,300
The same rule hasn't changed
since ancient times.

550
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,990
We don't need to provoke
the masses and their rules.

551
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:31,400
But even if I don't kill anyone,

552
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,200
they'll still die in the future.

553
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,600
Mi Lan, it's different.

554
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,160
Once you kill the first target,

555
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,160
you'll start to kill them
one after another.

556
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,150
Once, you thought you could
know black from white.

557
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,990
In the end,

558
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,360
you won't be able
to differentiate between them.

559
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,950
If a person can't even choose

560
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,400
to be kind,

561
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,400
he'll cease to be a human.

562
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,440
Humans are different from animals.

563
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,710
Fine.

564
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,440
I promise.

565
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,790
Take it back and stick it
in your room.

566
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,550
Read it at least thrice per day.

567
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:09,710
That's difficult.

568
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,120
But you gave me your promise.

569
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,790
Dr. Situ, have a seat.

570
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,710
If you have anything to say,

571
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,230
you should cut to the chase.

572
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:46,440
Dr. Situ,

573
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,440
I remember I promised to give you

574
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,310
50,000 yuan last time.

575
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,600
After that, I was
kidnapped by Shen Zhiheng.

576
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,120
But even now, you haven't

577
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,440
given me the money yet.

578
00:31:59,120 --> 00:31:59,790
It's because

579
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,400
I cannot show myself in public.

580
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,120
I can't manage my assets.

581
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,990
So I was thinking that I wanted you
to do me another similar favor.

582
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,030
Once I can show myself in public,

583
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,400
I'll give you the 50,000 yuan.

584
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,360
So, you want me

585
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,920
to do you a favor for free, huh?

586
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,550
Jin Jingxue.

587
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,440
What has this got to do with Jingxue?

588
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,950
It has nothing to do with her.

589
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,680
But if you're willing to help me out,

590
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,510
I'm willing to be the matchmaker
between you two.

591
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,580
Do you make the call here?

592
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:37,200
I do.

593
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:40,790
Are you going to give her to me?

594
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,470
That's not how we put it.

595
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,790
She's a living person.

596
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,510
She's not an object.

597
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,310
I'm just saying that I can help you out.

598
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,030
Regarding the kind of person she is
and the kind of person she likes,

599
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:10,310
I know them better than her.

600
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,310
I can help you out.

601
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,360
I can make her fall for you.

602
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,440
Do you even know
what you're saying right now?

603
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,440
Isn't your wish to spend your life

604
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,710
with Miss Jin?

605
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,120
You're such a scum.

606
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,490
Do you believe that
I'll tell Jingxue about this?

607
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,550
And then?

608
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:37,510
She'd know that she fell in love
with the wrong person

609
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,790
and was wrong about him!

610
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,230
And then?

611
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:49,880
Buddy,

612
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,950
when I was 12,

613
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,550
Mr. Jin became my godfather.

614
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:55,590
I joined the Jin family.

615
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:57,750
Miss Jin knew clearly

616
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,400
the kind of person I was.

617
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,080
Do you think she doesn't know

618
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,030
that I'm a bad egg?

619
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,200
It's only because she loves me.

620
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,710
That's why she thinks
I have bitter reasons

621
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:07,510
for everything I do.

622
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:08,870
In her eyes,

623
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,600
I can always be forgiven.

624
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:12,350
She's so nice to you.

625
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:14,040
Why didn't you love her back?

626
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,040
I don't deserve to talk about love.

627
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:23,870
I'm not a good match for her.

628
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:27,120
She can be married
to all the rich sons in the world.

629
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,120
But she cannot be married to me.

630
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,270
Is there something wrong with you?

631
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:35,790
But you've done well.

632
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,480
All these years,

633
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,790
countless men have flocked
toward Miss Jin.

634
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,640
I never liked any of them.

635
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,230
But you're different.

636
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:45,560
You're sincere.

637
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,560
So, what exactly do you want me to do?

638
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,430
I won't commit any evil deeds.

639
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,080
Thanks to Shen Zhiheng,

640
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,640
everyone is out to get me.

641
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:55,780
Chi Shanying captured Li Guisheng
to force me to show myself.

642
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,790
The person who caused the trouble
has to end it.

643
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,870
If I wish to resolve this issue,

644
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:02,000
I have to start with Shen Zhiheng.

645
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,990
I can't afford to offend
Shen Zhiheng for your sake again.

646
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:06,040
Farewell.

647
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,390
There's no need for me
to resort to such dirty tricks.

648
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:10,790
Don't worry. This time,
you won't offend him.

649
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,270
You can claim credit
in front of him instead.

650
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,310
Can you finish your words in one go?

651
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,640
Stop wasting my time here.

652
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,080
I'm here for Jingxue's sake,
not your sake.

653
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:22,480
I want you to be my messenger.

654
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,750
Contact Chi Shanying on my behalf.

655
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,310
Once Chi Shanying agrees to help us out,

656
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,790
we'll set a trap

657
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,350
and capture Shen Zhiheng.

658
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:31,640
Once Shen Zhiheng is captured,

659
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,040
I can show myself in public again.

660
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,520
You want me to capture
Shen Zhiheng for you?

661
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,080
Are you crazy?
Or am I the crazy one?

662
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,960
Don't worry.
This time, I won't harm him.

663
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,750
I'll only request him
to own up to his crime

664
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,350
and clear my name
in front of Chi Shanying.

665
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,350
By then, I have ways
to help you leave.

666
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,790
You guys can go wherever you like.

667
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,750
You can leave Haidong
and go somewhere far away.

668
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,890
If you can't bear to part with Miss Jin,
I can recommend you to Chi Shanying.

669
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:55,390
You'll have a bright future
if you serve him.

670
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,080
You can only dupe kids
with that stupid plan.

671
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,990
You want me to help you
capture Shen Zhiheng?

672
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,520
I'm afraid you'll silence me
after capturing him.

673
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,560
There's no need to silence you.

674
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,000
If I do,

675
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,750
Shen Zhiheng will silence me.

676
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,330
I believe that you won't tell him
about our plan, right?

677
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:13,120
But Shen Zhiheng hates you to the core.

678
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:15,000
Why would he follow your will?

679
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,050
He'll own up to his crime
just as you want?

680
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:18,910
That's just a superficial process.

681
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,270
In reality,

682
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,790
Mu Lihua, Chi Shanying, and him

683
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,600
will each take a step back after that.

684
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
They'll give each other an out.

685
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,640
Don't you agree?

686
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:40,190
May we have a pleasant cooperation.

687
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,310
This is not a cooperation.

688
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,480
I'll stop the plan immediately
if I find out

689
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,200
that you intend to harm him.

690
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:50,870
Don't worry. I understand.

691
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,870
I won't put you on the spot.

692
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,430
Are you guys done?

693
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,060
Jingxue, I'll make a move first.

694
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,040
Did he agree to it?

695
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,640
Yes.

696
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:26,480
What did you offer him?

697
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,160
I offered him money.

698
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,010
Moreover,
he didn't take any risks.

699
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:31,430
It's just a small favor.

700
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,960
He's a nice person. He's pure too.

701
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:35,960
You mustn't harm him.

702
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,830
You're quite concerned about him.

703
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,960
Yeah. What's wrong with that?

704
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,080
I'm not immoral, you know?

705
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:46,390
