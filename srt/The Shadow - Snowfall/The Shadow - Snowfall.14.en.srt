3
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,940
(This drama is purely fictional.)

4
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,030
Heng, stop it.

5
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,510
You're not my match.

6
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,370
I told you to stop fighting.
But you insisted on fighting me.

7
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,320
We're brothers.

8
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,350
Can't we just get along?

9
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,590
Besides, I have no ill intention.
Why do you take me as a bad person?

10
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,580
Let's sit and talk it out.
I'll tell you whatever you want to know.

11
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,720
Look at you now.

12
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,160
You're not dignified at all.

13
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,760
Heng, are you hurt?

14
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,160
I didn't even exert much force.

15
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,280
Look at your state
after I overpowered you.

16
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,510
I'm your younger brother, anyway.

17
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,910
You talk too much.

18
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,630
Mr. Mo.

19
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:09,720
You're done fighting?

20
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,160
Sorry for that.

21
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,510
You haven't solved anything yet.

22
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,790
How about continuing
your discussion inside?

23
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,040
I want something to eat too.

24
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,070
Mr. Mo,

25
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,600
we're starving.

26
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,000
You two are
both several hundred years old.

27
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,350
How can you be so reckless?

28
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,630
Sorry to trouble you.

29
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,230
Well, it's not that much of a trouble.

30
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,790
But I have to pay

31
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,510
for the things you've damaged.

32
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:39,670
Come with me.

33
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,070
Do you want a cigar?
I'll go and buy it for you.

34
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,830
No need.

35
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,200
Tell me.

36
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,720
How did you come to existence?

37
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,040
Me?

38
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,390
My mother gave birth to me.

39
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,510
That year, do you remember

40
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,320
why the Shen family wanted
to burn us alive that year?

41
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,190
Because your mother also had
the same illness as mine.

42
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,070
- Heng!
- The child is innocent!

43
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,440
- Heng!
- Let go of my son!

44
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,280
- Mother!
- I'll kill all of you!

45
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,390
Mother!

46
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,680
(Shen Ancestral Hall)
Don't kill Heng!

47
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,760
Heng has been trying to protect us.

48
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,800
He never tries to hurt us.

49
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,200
Can you please not kill him?

50
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,830
Mother, please!

51
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,880
Do you want to save his life?

52
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:53,950
Yes, Mother.

53
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,590
If he can't survive this, it's his fate.

54
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,710
If he survives,

55
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,470
he'll be a servant I leave you.

56
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,320
Do you remember this?

57
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,630
What's that?

58
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,760
The thing that she took off your neck

59
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,710
to heal my injury.

60
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,320
I'm not too sure.

61
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,590
From the day I was born,

62
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,030
Mother made me wear it at all times.

63
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,240
Perhaps it's that thing

64
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,120
that helped you survive.

65
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,630
(It seems this is
the Blood Amber Stone Mr. Mo mentioned.)

66
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,630
But it's missing.

67
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,120
Then where is it now?

68
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,470
It's not with us.

69
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,000
My mother and I never returned
since then.

70
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,880
Is it important?

71
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,200
It's important to me.

72
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,090
I never wanted
to have this strange illness.

73
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,440
Aren't things fine as they are?

74
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,800
I don't care about immortality at all.

75
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,440
Besides, compared to you,

76
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,200
you should know the difference
between us.

77
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,150
But I really don't know
where that thing is.

78
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,440
I was only five at that time.

79
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,290
I only remember
that I wanted to save you.

80
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,590
That's why my mother used it on you.

81
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,520
I don't really remember about the rest.

82
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,590
Then where is your mother now?

83
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,240
After she left the Shen Mansion,
she gradually grew weak.

84
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,790
Even drinking blood didn't help at all.

85
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,390
She died in the end.

86
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,880
When my mother died,

87
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,470
I was still young.

88
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,390
She once told me

89
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,070
that she left you to me.

90
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,470
I may not know if you could survive.

91
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,830
But when I found out

92
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,120
that you are still alive,

93
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,470
I was thrilled.

94
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,470
Why did she leave me to you?

95
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,510
To be your servant?

96
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:48,880
Don't be upset.

97
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,150
I already apologized earlier.

98
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,070
I've always treated you as my brother.

99
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,680
I never treat you as my servant.

100
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,150
Besides, it's the modern era
where everyone is equal.

101
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,920
No one can enslave anyone else, right?

102
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,570
I understand the principle.
I went to university, you know.

103
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,680
Where do you and your mother get
the confidence

104
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,470
to think I would willingly become
your servant?

105
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,920
Do you want to know my mother's logic?

106
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,220
Of course, it's because you need
something from me.

107
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,200
I need something from you?

108
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,030
Haven't you been relying on me
all these years?

109
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:16,240
Really?

110
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:19,830
Are you sure?

111
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,760
Heng, I gave you power and immortality.

112
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,910
So you're responsible
for supporting and protecting me.

113
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,620
Isn't it good that we benefit
from each other and cooperate together?

114
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:40,800
Situ Weilian, I've been treating you
as my best friend.

115
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,070
But you betrayed my trust.

116
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,390
Our friendship ends here.

117
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,630
If you insist on saying

118
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,120
what we have is cooperation,

119
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,280
I'll tell you this now.

120
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,800
The cooperation ends here.

121
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,030
Didn't I tell you

122
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,760
that you can't leave me?

123
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,710
You need me

124
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,030
and you'll only need me even more.

125
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,240
I said this before,

126
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:02,800
you're not fully developed.

127
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,470
Leave.

128
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,880
Are you serious?

129
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,880
Fine, I'll leave.

130
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,920
Who's this?

131
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,400
Master L. Chairman Li.

132
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,710
Second Master.

133
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:55,950
Oh, don't.

134
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,470
I don't deserve it.

135
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,640
I really don't deserve it.

136
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,040
I don't deserve
to be addressed respectfully

137
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,040
by an ingrate.

138
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,230
Have a seat.

139
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,230
What brings you

140
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:18,990
to the Jin family today?

141
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,040
By the way,

142
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,400
did Chi Shanying send you out
to commit crimes

143
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,870
and oppress the people today?

144
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,590
You don't have to be concerned
about this, Second Master Jin.

145
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:32,070
Even if I were to commit
heinous acts daily,

146
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,110
it's none of your business, right?

147
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,830
You sure have grown up, huh?

148
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:39,870
You talk back now.

149
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,440
You sure are different

150
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,090
after becoming Chi Shanying's
lapdog, eh?

151
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,390
Have you forgotten your place?

152
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,200
When you left the opera troupe

153
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,560
and lived on the streets,

154
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,560
you would have been dead
if the Jin family didn't take you in.

155
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,780
It is still none of your business,
isn't it?

156
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,750
I'm doing quite well now.

157
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,710
Getting bolder, huh?

158
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,110
This is Miss Jin's house.

159
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,870
Besides, I'm no longer
someone you can anyhow mistreat.

160
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,560
If Miss Jin sees you trying
to hit me again,

161
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,320
she'll be upset.

162
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:19,800
Don't you agree,

163
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,470
Second Master Jin?

164
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,710
Liang.

165
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,110
Second Uncle.

166
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,870
Jingxue, why do you look so pretty today?

167
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,450
Thank you, Second Uncle.

168
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,400
Why are you here?

169
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,590
I need your signature.

170
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,400
Here's the list
from yesterday's business transactions.

171
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,320
You need to review it.

172
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,900
(General Manager: Jin Jingxue)

173
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:56,830
Thank you, Second Uncle.

174
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,160
It's our family business.
What's there to thank me for?

175
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,990
All right. Since there's nothing else,

176
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,070
I'll take my leave then.

177
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,290
Take care, Second Uncle.

178
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,680
Liang.

179
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,520
Thank you for pleading for me, Miss Jin.

180
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:22,560
Liang,

181
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,680
where did you learn to be so courteous?

182
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,590
Why did you bow when you saw me?

183
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,870
Miss Jin, I'm just trying
to make a living.

184
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,110
Please have mercy and spare the sarcasm.

185
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,520
It's not easy making a living
with Chi Shanying.

186
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:36,110
So, why not come back to the Jin family?

187
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:39,470
As long as you return, you will always
be a valued member of the Jin family.

188
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,030
You sure have a sense of humor.

189
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,890
I won't be in your way then.
I'll take my leave.

190
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:10,710
Mi Lan,

191
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,560
you're up.

192
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,470
Your fever is gone too.

193
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:17,750
Mr. Shen.

194
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,200
Where are we?

195
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,680
We're at a friend's house.

196
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,710
Is it safe?

197
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,820
We're safe.

198
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,680
Weilian also helped treat your injury.

199
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,800
Is there anything you feel like eating

200
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,160
or drinking?

201
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,110
I'm craving rice cake.

202
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,110
All right.

203
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,160
I'll go and buy some for you.

204
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,470
That's what happened.

205
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,320
Come on, tell me more.

206
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,400
Give me more details.

207
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,400
Who are these people?

208
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,830
Mister, are there any more buns?

209
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,560
They're all sold out.

210
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:12,690
Only a few steamed buns left.

211
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:13,290
Forget it then.

212
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,680
Madam Liu, I'll get going now.

213
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,190
You can't keep staying up like this.

214
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,120
If you don't sleep,
you're going to wear yourself out here.

215
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,830
Come, stop looking at it.

216
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,800
I bought you some pastries.

217
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,320
They're fresh from the oven.

218
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,400
Eat up.

219
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,160
Mr. Li, we've missed you

220
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:55,830
while you're not around.

221
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,040
Tell me something important.

222
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,920
I've ordered our men to watch
Shen Zhiheng's villa in Shenhai,

223
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,970
the docks in Haidong,
and the railway day and night.

224
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,320
But so far,

225
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,520
he hasn't shown up.

226
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,320
It's strange.

227
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,070
How can someone like him just disappear?

228
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,160
If he were alone,

229
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,200
he might have vanished into thin air.

230
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,520
But he's with the heavily injured Mi Lan.

231
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,990
Should I take our men to Haidong Daily
and arrest everyone there?

232
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,200
After all, we now know
that Shen Zhiheng is not human.

233
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,800
We should spread this news.

234
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,560
Shen Zhiheng isn't even in Haidong.

235
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:49,160
He can't even see it
if we caught people or spread news.

236
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,560
Chi Shanying is always suspicious.

237
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:00,590
Sheng,

238
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,520
you're taking over my position now.

239
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,110
If you keep coming to me,
it might cause misunderstandings.

240
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,640
I'll investigate Shen Zhiheng myself.

241
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,040
You stay put for now.

242
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,870
I'll come to you if I need you.

243
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,680
All right.

244
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,110
I understand.

245
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,640
I'll do as you say.

246
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,490
Eat slowly.
I'll get some water for you.

247
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,710
Here are the changes of clothes I prepared

248
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,040
for you and Mi Lan.

249
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,320
Thank you.

250
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,520
This is to help you recover.

251
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:01,860
Thank you.

252
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,710
Why did your brother leave?

253
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:10,440
Ignore him.

254
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,920
He would never understand it anyway.

255
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,200
So just let him go.

256
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,990
So, have your problems been resolved?

257
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,040
He said

258
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,230
Madam Shen is dead.

259
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,110
Wei Qiu?

260
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,230
That's impossible.

261
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,990
What about the Blood Amber Stone?

262
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,880
After she saved me
with the Blood Amber Stone,

263
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,690
she brought it with her when she left.

264
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,110
She perished from exhaustion
in just a few years.

265
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,350
She used the Blood Amber Stone
to bring you back to life.

266
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,280
Your blood merged
with the Blood Amber Stone,

267
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,800
creating a connection

268
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,470
that caused her to deteriorate and die.

269
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,070
This means

270
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,830
the stone's energy can only be used

271
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,350
by one person.

272
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,090
All the symptoms
you're experiencing can only be resolved

273
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,320
by finding the Blood Amber Stone.

274
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,950
Since my condition is caused by it,

275
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,040
I must seek an answer through it.

276
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,560
I believe

277
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,160
that once the stone merges
with someone else's blood,

278
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,750
you'll start

279
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,360
to deteriorate just like Wei Qiu.

280
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:17,340
(Haidong Economic Development Committee)

281
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,590
What are you doing
with Mr. Li's favorite coffee machine?

282
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,600
Mr. Li, these items were used
by Li Yingliang.

283
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,950
I'll put them away right away.

284
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:37,640
Put it down.

285
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,230
Who says you can touch it?

286
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,080
Don't touch anything
that belongs to him.

287
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,550
Mr. Li, you're the chairman now.

288
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,710
Li Yingliang was dismissed
for misconduct.

289
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,510
In the end,

290
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,680
we're all working
for Superintendent Chi.

291
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,010
Is Li Yingliang
who you can casually mention?

292
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,030
Don't think I don't know.

293
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,270
Every single thing I do
with Mr. Li is known

294
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,920
to Superintendent Chi.

295
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,790
It's you, right?

296
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,360
Put away your scheming ways.

297
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,370
If you pull another stunt like that,
I'll deal with you.

298
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,200
I dare not.

299
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,640
How about I get you a glass of water?

300
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:11,990
Get lost.

301
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,640
Li...

302
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:17,750
Li...

303
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:18,990
Li...

304
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,140
(Chairman's office)

305
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,470
Mr. Li, what are you doing here?

306
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,840
Come and take a seat.

307
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,550
It's okay.

308
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,160
Sheng, there's no need
to clash with Mr. Ding.

309
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,470
You need to hold my place for me.

310
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,400
All right.

311
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:44,880
I'll do as you say.

312
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,790
Any news about Shen Zhiheng?

313
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,990
We're still looking into it.

314
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,750
I'll let you know once I have something.

315
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,550
Be quick.

316
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,120
We don't have much time left.

317
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,270
Plus, there are too many eyes here.

318
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,550
So I can't be here every day.

319
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,300
You'll have to run extra errands for me.

320
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,360
What are you saying? This is my duty.

321
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,160
Don't worry.

322
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:04,840
Please sit.

323
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,230
I'll make you some coffee.

324
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,510
Have you been having
trouble sleeping again lately?

325
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,270
Situ.

326
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,470
What are you thinking about?

327
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,090
This is for you.

328
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,840
A cup of hot cocoa before bed can help

329
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,120
you sleep better.

330
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,360
Jingxue,

331
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,400
thank you for taking me in.

332
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,470
There's something
that I can't figure out.

333
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,990
So I wanted to chat with someone.

334
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,090
You're the only one I have besides Shen.

335
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,200
Can you help me?

336
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,360
Sure. Tell me what it is.

337
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,200
I once helped a patient.

338
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,470
I think I had been entirely devoted to him

339
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,920
and had saved his life several times.

340
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,360
But I only hid a small detail from him.

341
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,230
When he discovered it, he was furious

342
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,680
and even wanted to cut ties with me.

343
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,510
So you're bothered by that?

344
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,920
I just don't understand

345
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,470
why he was so upset.

346
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,750
What's so hard to understand?

347
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,310
It must be important to him.

348
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,080
How important could it be?

349
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,160
How would I know that?

350
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,710
I think he must regard you highly.

351
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,160
Otherwise, he wouldn't be so mad.

352
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,270
Well, he does hold me in high regard.

353
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,550
He doesn't hide anything from me.

354
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,950
Then it's your fault.

355
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,160
You should make peace with him.

356
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,510
Over time, feelings will fade

357
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,840
and he will become disappointed.

358
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:53,840
Could it really be my fault?

359
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,840
Once you lose someone's trust,

360
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,030
it's very hard to regain it.

361
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,470
Stop overthinking and get some sleep.

362
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:16,920
We've arrived.

363
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,080
Thank you.

364
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,840
(Shen Mansion)

365
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,790
(Shen Zhiheng,)

366
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,470
(where did you run off with Mi Lan to?)

367
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,740
(County Records)

368
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,820
(Ledger)

369
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,980
(Cheng Huan, Longchun Troupe)

370
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,460
(Liang, Longchun Troupe Apprentice.
Longchun Opera House Attendant)

371
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,860
(Smart and capable, a rare lad.)

372
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,100
(Ledger)

373
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,420

(Suping Town)

375
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,270
(Zhang Youwen.)

376
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,980
(Zhang Youwen, Suping Town)

(Haidong Daily)

378
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,360
(Three years ago,)

379
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,490
(Zhang Youwen and Shen Zhiheng arrived
in Haidong shortly after each other)

380
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,790
(to become the general manager
of Haidong Daily.)

381
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,550
(Although Shen Zhiheng
was not as close to him)

382
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,630
(as Mi Lan and Situ Weilian,)

383
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,290
(Shen Zhiheng still trusted
him greatly.)

384
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,950
(I failed to notice this person before.)

385
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,600
Mi Lan.

386
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,680
Mr. Shen.

387
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,270
Here, drink this.

388
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,950
Drink it. It's good for your health.

389
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,080
Drink slowly.

390
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,550
This medicine tastes bitter.

391
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,550
Mr. Mo said

392
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,510
you made chicken soup for me.

393
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:26,920
Is it ready?

394
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,080
I want some.

395
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:31,600
That was chicken soup you just had.

396
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,270
I added several herbs

397
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,470
to the soup to help you
get better quickly.

398
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:44,840
The chicken soup is delicious.

399
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,880
Mr. Shen, you're incredible.

400
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,230
Do you still want rice cakes?

401
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:54,680
Yes.

402
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,470
I want something sweet.

403
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:57,510
All right.

404
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,080
I'll go and buy some for you.

405
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,440
Sweet rice cakes!

406
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,990
Mister, I want two pieces of rice cakes.

407
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,030
All right.

408
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,400
Thank you so much.

409
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,890
I'm just waiting to finish selling
this basket for going back sooner.

410
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,510
Why? Has business been slow recently?

411
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,360
It's a turbulent time now.

412
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,160
The Haidong Army patrols

413
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,360
the streets every day.

414
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:30,940
They said that the fugitives from Haidong
have come here to commit crimes.

415
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:31,880
I fear death.

416
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,310
So I should go home early.

417
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,880
Here you go.

418
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,510
Thank you.

419
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,680
Mi Lan, have some tea.

420
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,750
Be careful. It's hot.

421
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,550
It's not poisoned.

422
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,990
There's no need to smell it.

423
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,950
You're not fully recovered yet.

424
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,080
You should get more rest.

425
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:05,080
I don't want to keep staying in bed.

426
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,560
Shen Zhiheng told me

427
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,060
that you've sacrificed a lot for him.

428
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,220
This injury is also because of him.

429
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,950
It wasn't sacrificing.

430
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,600
Half of Mr. Shen's life is mine.

431
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,190
So I have to be responsible for it.

432
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,420
But do you know

433
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,720
what kind of person he is?

434
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,840
Mr. Mo, it doesn't matter what he is.

435
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,120
Whether he's a cat, a dog,

436
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,230
an immortal, or a monster,

437
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,600
it's enough to know

438
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,510
that he's my Mr. Shen.

439
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:53,750
Your Mr. Shen is home.

440
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,230
Mr. Shen.

441
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:58,360
Mi Lan,

442
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,120
have some rice cakes.

443
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,550
I have to take Mi Lan away.

444
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,120
The Haidong Army is here.

445
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,160
Sorry for the trouble
these past few days.

446
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,400
Until we meet again.

447
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,380
Actually, you don't need to rush off.

448
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,680
I can still help you handle things
with the Haidong Army.

449
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,790
That's not necessary.

450
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,080
I've gotten too many people involved
in this already.

451
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,790
You've helped me a great deal.

452
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,600
Your courage is admirable.

453
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:41,080
I wish you success
in finding the Blood Amber Stone.

454
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:44,920
Mr. Mo,

455
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:46,990
farewell.

456
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:47,790
Take care.

457
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:23,330
Please come in.

458
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,400
Mr. Li.

459
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,030
I found out that there's something fishy
about Zhang Youwen.

460
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,790
Every year, he sends a sum of money
to a certain place

461
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,120
for grave maintenance.

462
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,440
Grave maintenance?

463
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,400
Whose grave?

464
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,360
A prominent family
with the last name Shen.

465
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:57,550
It definitely has something to do
with Shen Zhiheng.

466
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,160
But what's strange is

467
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:02,160
that this place has been abandoned
for years because of the war.

468
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,680
Even family has been dead and gone
for several decades.

469
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,030
Where is this place?

470
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,440
Not far from Shenhai,

471
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,710
in the Suping Town area.

472
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,160
Sheng,

473
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,710
arrange a meeting with Mu Lihua for me.

474
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:23,360
She has to stay in this act with me.

475
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,080
Mister, we can't pass through.

476
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,470
When did the route change?

477
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:09,790
Mister, the river has changed course
and cut off the road.

478
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,840
My vehicle can't go any further.

479
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,840
It's all right. You can drop us here.

480
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,950
I'm truly sorry, Mister.

481
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,180
Thank you, Mister.

482
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,310
Mi Lan.

483
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:38,840
Mister, take care.

484
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,990
You can't walk on this path.
Let me carry you on my back.

485
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,550
Mr. Shen,

486
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,230
why are we going to the ancestral house?

487
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,600
It's remote there
and a good place to recuperate.

488
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:08,840
Other than that,

489
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,400
the answers

490
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,400
I've been searching for
over the past century might be there.

491
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,920
But if people could live forever,

492
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:19,360
why do they have to know
where they come from?

493
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:21,710
How do you know

494
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,230
my destiny is immortality

495
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,030
instead of rampant killing

496
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,230
and losing myself?

497
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,550
I'm not like you.

498
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,080
This is as far as I've lived.

499
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,990
I was born blind.

500
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:34,950
So I just want to focus on the present.

501
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:39,750
If I can eat well, stay warm, be happy,

502
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:43,120
and be with you, that's enough for me.

503
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:46,550
I haven't even taken a good look

504
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,080
at what you look like.

505
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:12,750
Mi Lan.

506
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,950
Are we here?

507
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,270
Yes.

508
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:25,990
We're home.

509
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,600
(Shen Residence)

510
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,160
After drifting for over a hundred years,

511
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:32,160
I've finally returned.

512
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,710
I am Shen Zhiheng,

513
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:37,080
and I'm home.

514
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:42,680
Mind the steps.

515
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:56,160
Why? Is anyone living here?

516
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,200
A dear friend of mine lives here.

517
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,520
Degeng, it's been a long time.

518
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,870
Mr. Shen?

519
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,350
It's really you.

520
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,710
You've returned.

521
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:21,790
Please.

522
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,410
- Please come in.
- All right.

523
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,870
Watch the threshold.

524
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,830
It must have been
an arduous journey for you.

525
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,870
I've tidied up this room.

526
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,910
Miss Mi Lan,
I hope you'll feel comfortable.

527
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,600
Come and take a look inside.

528
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:55,100
There's a threshold.

529
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:03,350
I plan to stay and guard here
until I die.

530
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:06,870
You can say it's my way of repaying
the favor you did back then.

531
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,830
Did Mr. Shen save you back then?

532
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,870
He saved our entire family.

533
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:15,200
Our family has always been grateful
to him

534
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,230
and decided to serve him.

535
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,520
My son passed away young.

536
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:25,040
When I was heartbroken,

537
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:26,960
I decided to return
to this ancestral home

538
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,120
to guard the Shen family's grave.

539
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,230
My grandson, Youwen was also brought

540
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,600
to Haidong by Mr. Shen.

541
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,520
Does Uncle Youwen know

542
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,520
about Mr. Shen's condition?

543
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:41,790
It's not the time
for him to know about it.

544
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:42,960
Degeng,

545
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:47,040
have you kept all the items
from the ancestral home?

546
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:47,790
Yes.

547
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,230
Do you remember

548
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:51,350
a family portrait
from a hundred years ago?

549
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,120
A family portrait?

550
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:53,910
Yes.

551
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:56,200
I need it to confirm something.

552
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,350
All these old items are stored

553
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,870
in the warehouse on the second floor.

554
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,680
I'll go and look for it tomorrow.

555
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:03,270
All right.

556
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,390
Thank you, Degeng.

557
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,040
Miss, this way, please.

558
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,100
This way, please.

559
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:30,380
(Lingering Charm of the Cold Moon)

560
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,520
Miss Mu, it's been a while.

561
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,040
I never expected you

562
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,830
to be so cultured that you
invited me to meet at such a place.

563
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,260
There's even an opera performance.

564
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:53,680
The play wouldn't be lively

565
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,310
without Miss Mu.

566
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,790
Miss Mu, please have a seat.

567
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,830
I've found Shen Zhiheng's whereabouts.

568
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:13,200
Where is he?

569
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,520
Last time, you shifted
all the blame onto me

570
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,200
in front of the superintendent.

571
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,750
Do you think I'd still share

572
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:20,790
everything with you?

573
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:27,480
So you are here

574
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,600
to settle scores with me.

575
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,710
Oh, no.

576
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,160
Just to make a deal.

577
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,120
I want to borrow your Shadow Warriors

578
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,200
to capture Shen Zhiheng.

579
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,480
Once the matter is settled,

580
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,710
I'll be reinstated as the Chairman
of the Development Committee,

581
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,110
and you can deal with Shen Zhiheng

582
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:46,790
as you see fit.

583
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,230
How many do you need?

584
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,120
All of them.

585
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,190
The Shadow Warriors have been trained

586
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,480
from a young age by our Mu family
as elite assassins.

587
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:03,390
Do you know

588
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:05,350
how valuable they are?

589
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:06,790
I know.

590
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:10,750
Without the Shadow Warriors,
I wouldn't have much confidence.

591
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,830
So, what's your chance of success?

592
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:21,680
With all the Shadow Warriors,
it'll be ninety percent.

593
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:31,430
It's a deal.

594
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,350
I'll lend them to you.
