Yes, it's dark.

It's already dark.

12
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,720
Do you have a headache?

13
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,480
I'm fine.

14
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,560
Madam Zhang, you may go out.

15
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,110
I'll go out first then.

It'll be your turn soon.

31
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,380
- Okay.
- All right.

32
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,020

Thank you, Miss.

Hello.

36
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,180
Can I help you, Miss?

37
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,200
Let me find it for you.

38
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,510
Are you here to examine your injuries?

39
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,760
Hello.

40
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,200
Is there a Dr. Situ Weilian here?

41
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,470
Are you here for Dr. Weilian?

42
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,830
But he's busy right now.

43
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,710
You'll have to line up.

44
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,150
I have something very important
to talk to him about.

45
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,500
I'm not here to see him
about my injuries.

46
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,800
Be gentle.

47
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,760
Where's the doctor?

48
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,270
Where did the doctor go?

49
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,200
The doctor will be here soon.

50
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,830
Dr. Situ, we're ready.

51
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,920
Why does this young man
look so unfamiliar?

52
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,830
Why have I never seen you before?

53
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,590
This isn't the first time
I've done this.

54
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,880
Do a good job.

55
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,070
Do you know who I am?

56
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,630
I'm Wang Erhu.

57
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,270
Do you know
who's taking care of the dock now?

58
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,120
It's me.

59
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,710
If you don't do it properly,

60
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,510
I'll tear this hospital down.

61
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,030
That's quick.

62
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,300
It's just extracting a bullet.

63
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,090

67

A girl said she had something urgent
to talk to you about.

68

A girl?

69
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,270
What girl?

70
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,120
Does she look pretty?

71
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,320
She's in your office.

72
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,240

76
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:07,760
Hello.

77
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm Situ Weilian.

78
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,120
I'm Mi Lan.

79
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,710
I have a secret to tell you.

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,800
Close the door.

81
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,200
A secret?

82
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,270
Do you know me?

83
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,000
Your friend is injured

84
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and needs your help.

85
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:23,760
My friend?

86
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:24,800
Who is it?

87
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,760
Mr. Shen.

88
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,630
I see.

89
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,070
I'll rescue him tonight.

90
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,760
Go as soon as possible.

91
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,800
He's injured.

92
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,120
And it snowed again last night.

93
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,680
I'm afraid he'll freeze to death.

94
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,880
Got it.

95
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,630
Don't worry.

96
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,920
He won't die yet.

97
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:47,950
I meant

98
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,120
you should save him now.

99
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,950
You have to drive there.
Don't take the rickshaw.

100
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,070
He's too severely injured to move.

101
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:53,950
I'm a doctor.

102
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,360
I said he won't die,

103
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,710
so he won't die.

104
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,120
You have to trust the doctor.

105
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,240
All right.

106
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,030

107

108
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,590
we'll visit you to thank you.

109
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,440
No.

110
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,980
My mother doesn't know
that I went out at night.

111
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,490
She'll give me a beating
if she finds out.

112
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,680
I don't want you to thank me either.

113
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,000
Just make sure he survives.

114
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,920
Okay. I'll pass on the message.

115
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,270
Will you really save him?

116
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,120
Of course.

117
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,470
I'm his best friend.

118
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,470
I remember you.

119
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,590

120
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,710

You couldn't find him?

127
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:01,680
Yes.

128
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:02,990
Then keep looking for him.

He vanished?

132
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,710
Just tell him stray dogs took him away.

133
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,400
Do you think Superintendent Chi
will believe that?

134
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,230
Hurry and send more people

this time.

191
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,400
Is there anything to eat?

192
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,400
I'm hungry.

193
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:27,870
You want something to eat?

194
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,560
Sure.

195
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,950
Let's make a deal.

196
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,590
Get lost.

197
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,590
I'm starving.

203

Get out.

204
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,830
I'm not getting out.

205
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,890
I'm not getting out.

206
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,620
- Let go!
- Shut up.

207
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,440
Let go.

208
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,470
- Shut up.
- Let go!

209
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,680
You're illegally detaining me.

210
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,560
I'm going to sue you!

211
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,160
Shut up.

212
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,020
What are you doing?

213
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,620
Sorry, Captain.

214
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,380
We couldn't stop him.
He jumped down by himself.

215
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,590
It scared me.

216
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,590
Come here and clean this up.

217
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,230
Yes.

218
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,350
Go.

219
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:33,680
Go.

220
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,800

Go.

224
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,160
I'm going to sue you.

225
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,440
Let me go.

227
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,640
Mr. Li.

228
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,230
I was disrespectful last time.

229
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:29,040
I'll face karma sooner or later.

230
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,070
Not you.

00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,280
Not you.

He has committed all kinds of crimes
in Haidong over the years.

233
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,560
He exploited the people

234
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,640
and killed many people.

235
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,440
Why don't scums like him

236
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,680
die earlier?

237
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,280
It's unfair.

238
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,470
Has Mr. Wang
said anything disrespectful?

239
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,440

Thank you for your trust in me.

248
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,550
Didn't I tell you

249
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,510
not to come to Haidong Army HQ
if there's nothing serious?

250
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,120
Those newspaper writers
would be writing nonsense again

251
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,790
if they saw this.

252
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,030
Unless you're sure

253
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,990
you've killed Shen Zhiheng.

254
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,840
Haidong Daily
won't be causing any more trouble.

255
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,200
I'm sure.

256
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,440
Good.

257
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:46,750
Superintendent.

258
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,780
This is the mine you were interested in.

259
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,600
It was done by the old rules.

260
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,750
Yingliang.

261
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,360
You've

262
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,030
done a good job.

263
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,510
Shen.

264
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:15,710
I'm back.

265
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,510
What are you doing here?

266
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,750
It's too hot outside.

267
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,550
Who is that?

268
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,200
0113.

269
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,950
Economic Development Committee's car.

270
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,710
Li Yingliang is their president.

271
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:48,990
Their men

272
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,790
are still stationed
outside Shen Mansion.

273
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,510
Li Yingliang?

274
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,680
I don't know him.

275
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,880
Of course you don't know him.

276
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,990
Haidong Daily

277
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,380
recently criticized Chi Shanying

278
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,710
for bullying the people.

279
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:03,880
Li Yingliang

280
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:06,080
is a gangster Chi Shanying supported.

281
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,990
No wonder they wanted to kill me.

282
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,950
I uncovered the Haidong Army's dirt.

283
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,160
They had the audacity

284
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,510
to use the committee's car.

285
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,270
It seems that they don't think
you can survive.

286
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,680
They're probably stupid too.

287
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,550
But you're really lucky.

288
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,640
While you were lying still, a girl
ran errands and passed a message to you.

289
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,230
She can't even see,

290
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,310
yet she came to the hospital to find me.

291
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:30,950
Did she

292
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,710
go to the hospital herself?

293
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:37,200
She also specifically told us
not to go to her house to thank her.

294
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,360
If her mother knew,

295
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:40,990
she might give her a beating.

296
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,710
I was so dizzy that day

297
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,120
that I forgot she was blind.

298
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,640
I thought
she could find your phone number

299
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,840
like any other person.

300
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,270
She found you alone

301
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,230
without telling her parents.

302
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,710
I don't know her,

303
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,640
but she kept her promise.

304
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,710
You can tell
that she's a person of integrity.

305
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,160
Help me remove the gauze.

306
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,160
I'm going out for a while.

307
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,840
Is it you,

308
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,030
Mr. Shen?

309
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,640
You knew?

310
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,200
The wind has your scent.

311
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,310
Dr. Situ didn't trick me.

312
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,440
You're alive.

313
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,400
That's good.

314
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:01,840
Yes.

315
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,440
You saved me.

316
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,880
Aren't you seriously injured?

317
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,200
But I have a great doctor.

318
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,600
Check

319
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,080
if I've recovered.

320
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,120
You're not fully recovered.

321
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,360
Half of your life is mine.

322
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:42,160
You must remember
to take good care of your injuries.

323
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,710
Okay.

324
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,880
Half of my life belongs to you.

325
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,840
Remember that.

326
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,510
Yes.

327
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,160
My last name is Shen.

328
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,990
Shen Zhiheng.

329
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,550
I'm tough.

330
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,680
If anyone bullies you in the future,

331
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,120
I'll help you out.

332
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,920
Then why were you hunted down
by your enemies?

333
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,600
I was careless

334
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,550
at that time.

335
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,510
I'll take care of it in the future.

336
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,880
Red camellia.

337
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,120
Red camellia?

338
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,270
It's a flower
that blooms even in winter.

339
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,200
Are you giving it to me?

340
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,680
Mi Lan.

341
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,550
Take good care of it, okay?

342
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,030
Me?

343
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,880
I can't even...

344
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:46,950
When the flowers bloom,

345
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,600
I'll visit you again.

346
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:52,790
Okay.

347
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,950
I'll wait for you.

348
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,710
Mr. Shen.

349
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:04,360
What does red look like?

350
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,510
Red?

351
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,080
Red is the passionate fire,

352
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,840
warm light,

353
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,310
boiling blood,

354
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,950
desire, hope,

355
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,270
and the color of growth.

356
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,230
No one has ever
described a color to me like this.

357
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,510
I seem to be able to feel it.

358
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,840
Remember.

359
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,600
I owe you half my life.

360
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,470
I'll pay off my debt.

361
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,400
You must live a good life.

362
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,200
I'll remember.

379
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,230
Shen.

380
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,470
You've been resting at my house

381
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,600
for quite a long time.

382
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,080
I served you for so long.

383
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,300
I let you stay at my house.

384
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,200
I helped you take baths.

385
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,400
I even braid your hair now.

386
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,710
So you'll have to give me

387
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:40,880
two thousand.

388
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,440
You're so lame.

389
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,630
You only asked for two thousand
after thinking about it for so long.

390
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,750
Give me more money

391
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,680
so that I can become better.

392
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,640
Send me back later.

393
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,200
I'll write you a check.

394
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,580
How much are you giving me?

395
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,160
I'm not sure.

396
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,470
It depends on my mood.

397
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,680
Your braiding is too bad.

398
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,080
I'm deducting 500.

399
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,600
It's not that bad, is it?

400
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,640
You're just going home.

401
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:08,590
Who's going to see you?

402
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,360
What I fear most is making mistakes.

403
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:12,920
Especially this time.

404
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,310
I can't let others know

405
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,750
that I escaped death.

406
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,160
So what if they can tell?

407
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,510
You didn't really die.

408
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,080
Surviving a near-death experience
is always daunting.

409
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,680
I'd better keep my dignity till the end.

410
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,600
I'm so exhausted.

411
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,030
How many days has it been?

412
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:39,680
Shen never appeared.

413
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:41,920
Yeah.

414
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,400
What's the point

415
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,790
of guarding an empty house?

416
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,400
Gosh.

417
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:05,840
Would Li Yingliang

418
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,510
be scared to death if he knew

419
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,710
you showed up in one piece?

420
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,360
Let's scare him to death.

421
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:12,470
Shen, I'll take the money.

422
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,920
You can't even eat

423
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,840
normal food anymore?

424
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,160
Shen.

425
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,290
I've known you for over three years.

426
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:43,390
Even though you've been injured before,

427
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,470
your injury this time

428
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,270
is worse than I thought.

429
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,470
I'm afraid there will be
very serious after-effects.

430
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,230
What kind of after-effects?

431
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:55,440
Look.

432
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,440
You can't even eat normal food anymore.

433
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,600
I'm afraid you'll have to live on blood.

434
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,200
And that desire will only grow stronger.

435
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,230
How long does it take

436
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:06,890
for me to turn out like that?

437
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:08,990
I don't know.

438
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,680
It could be tomorrow.

439
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,360
It could be years.

440
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,230
But if you keep resisting

441
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,470
your thirst for blood,

442
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:18,480
it's only inevitable.

443
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,790
Looks like we need to find him soon.

444
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,400
Your brother?

445
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,880
The man who did this to you?

446
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:36,950
Shen.

447
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,330
There's actually a question

448
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,750
I've been meaning to ask you.

449
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:41,990
If you really

450
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:43,510
find your brother one day,

451
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,440
what are you going to do?

452
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,710
There's nothing I can do.

453
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,080
But I have to figure out

454
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,440
why I'm the way I am.

455
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:56,790
Got it.

456
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,880
Your obsession is your brother.

457
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,750
But

458
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,750
do you really not hate him?

459
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,840
As you said,

460
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,230
your family was wiped out.

461
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,080
He can't get away with it.

462
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,440
It's been my obsession for a century.

463
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,710
But we have to find him

464
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,200
before we can have an explanation.

465
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,120
Mr. Li, you wanted to see me?

466
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:35,680
All done.

467
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,990
Why are you looking at me like that?

468
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,600
Shen Zhiheng.

469
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:49,790
Did you find his body?

470
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,470
Shen Zhiheng's alive.

471
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:53,920
Alive?

472
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,360
No way.

473
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,840
I ran him over three times

474
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,470
and shot him many times that day.

475
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,440
Let me just say this.

476
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,600
Even if he's a god,

477
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,790
he'll be dead.

478
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,600
He swaggered back to Shen Mansion.

479
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,840
Are you telling me he's dead?

480
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,440
Mr. Li.

481
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,990
I swear on my life.

482
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,710
If Shen Zhiheng doesn't die, I'll die.

483
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:16,950
Shoot me.

484
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:23,920
Put the gun away.

485
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,710
I know you don't have to

486
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:33,990
lie to me.

487
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,320
But our men saw Shen Zhiheng alive

488
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,360
with their own eyes.

489
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,030
Really?

490
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,270
It's a substitute.

491
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,360
It must be a substitute.

492
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,400
This is weird.

493
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:07,440
Mr. Li's office.

494
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,640
Hold on.

495
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,840
Mr. Li. It's a call from Miss Jin.

496
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,640
Hello, Miss Jin?

497
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,400
Liang.

498
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,120
Join the ball with me tonight.

499
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,360
Thank you.

500
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,030
But I'm not suitable, am I?

501
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,400
I can't dance.

502
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,510
How about you find a rich heir
to go with you?

503
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,830
You can get along with them.

504
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,710
What do you mean?

505
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,840
You don't want to go with me, do you?

506
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,640
No.

507
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,270
That's not what I meant.
I wouldn't dare.

508
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,680
How about this?

509
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,470
I'll be your driver.

510
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,950
I'll take you there
and take you home afterward.

511
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,600
You just don't want to go with me.

512
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,230
What are you and Chi Shanying doing?

513
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,360
I'll ask him.

514
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:00,400
Fine.

515
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,360
I'll do whatever you want.

516
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,440
Okay, attend it with me tonight.

517
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,160
7 PM. Wear a suit.

518
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:06,710
Okay.

519
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,080
I'll wear a suit.

520
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:09,480
See you later.

521
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:15,230
If you don't want to go,

522
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:18,260
you might as well tell Miss Jin that you have
something important to do in the evening.

523
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,520
She'll go to Superintendent Chi
to investigate me thoroughly

524
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,270
and see why I can't help her.

525
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,930
You have to investigate

526
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:30,160
the Shen Mansion matter yourself.

527
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:33,790
See if the Shen Zhiheng in Shen Mansion is real.

528
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,910
And Chi Shanying
mustn't know about this.

529
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,910
If Chi Shanying knows,

530
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,040
our lives might be in danger.

531
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:41,960
Don't worry.

532
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,200
I'll do it now.

533
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,230
Go.

534
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,230
How weird.

535
00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:00,180
(Jinghua Restaurant)

536
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,230
Liang.

537
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:25,230
Is my dress pretty?

538
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:30,870
Yes.

539
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,520
Is that all you have to say?

540
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:34,600
Yes.

541
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,430
I know what you're thinking.

542
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,350
You're hypocritically obeying me.

543
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,480
You're saying yes,

544
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,230
but

545
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,520
you might be inwardly cursing me.

546
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,520
But it doesn't matter.

547
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,490
I'm not afraid of you cursing me.

548
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,640
The faker your smile is,

549
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:53,680
the more

550
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,870
I want you to dance with me all night.

551
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:57,960
Miss Jin.

552
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,390
I really can't dance.

553
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,310
Please spare me.

554
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,640
It's all right if you can't dance.

555
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:02,790
I'll teach you.

556
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:05,350
If you step on me,

557
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:06,830
I'll pinch you.

558
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,160
I'll pinch you all night.

559
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,040
I'm sure you'll learn.

560
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,480
I'm sorry to trouble you.

561
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,080
Long time no see.

562
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:21,680
Jingxue, you're here.

563
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,560
Jingxue, you look so good in this dress.

564
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,640
You're all here.

565
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,110
- You're the only one missing.
- You're so beautiful today.

566
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,710
Where did you buy this dress?
It's so beautiful.

567
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,640
- Really?
- It's good.

568
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,750
Mr. Shen.

569
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,480
Welcome.

570
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:34,270
Mr. Wu.

571
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:37,120
I heard Mr. Shen is busy these days.

572
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:38,710
I'm honored

573
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,680
that you came to today's banquet.

574
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,830
It's so nice to have Mr. Shen here.

575
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,480
Liang, where are you going?

576
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,060
Who are you looking at?

577
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,350
The dance is about to begin.

578
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,580
Let's go dancing.

579
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,080
- Sure.
- Sure.

580
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,390
Liang, dance with me.

581
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,440
Let's go.

582
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:16,640
(Is he really
Shen Zhiheng's substitute?)

583
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,230
Focus.

584
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,270
Sorry, Miss Jin.

585
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:30,710
What are you looking for?

586
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:33,230
Sorry, Miss Jin.

587
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:34,750
Again.

588
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,000
Sorry.

589
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,350
Sorry, Miss Jin.

590
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,680
I really have an emergency.

591
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,750
Let me go to the toilet.

592
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:51,560
