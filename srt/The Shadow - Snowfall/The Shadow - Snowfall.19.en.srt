=Episode 19=

3
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:41,940
(This drama is purely fictional.)

4
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,080
It's too small.

5
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,640
I need a bigger space

6
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,280
and more personnel.

7
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,390
But Chi Shanying
has his eyes on us right now.

8
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,880
Those who dare to obstruct me shall die.

9
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,910
(Superintendent's Office)
Mu Lihua took my troops.

10
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,460
Now, she's not even picking up my calls.

11
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,600
Superintendent, take a look.

12
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,940
(Name list of deceased personnel)

13
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:37,550
Are they all dead?

14
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,550
Yes, sir.

15
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,460
I think Miss Mu's training
is quite terrifying.

16
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,810
I couldn't see the training venue,

17
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,480
all of the troops she took were dead.

18
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,950
I found their bodies

19
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,440
at several mass graves.

20
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,230
Go and find Mu Lihua.

21
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,360
Go and find Mu Lihua!

22
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,200
She has to give me an account for this!

23
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:54,790
Yes, sir.

24
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:57,880
What kind of account do you want?

25
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,920
Miss Mu,

26
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,480
you came uninvited, huh?

27
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,360
What's wrong?

28
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,710
Aren't you busy?

29
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,230
I was planning
to talk to you about this.

30
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,490
Due to my carelessness,
some of your brothers

31
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,390
were burned to death some time ago.

32
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,910
However, I've told my assistant

33
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,420
to send them the compensation payment.

34
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,480
Therefore,

35
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,350
please send a few more men to me.

36
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,070
You do make it sound easy.

37
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,040
You want a few more men?

38
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,160
You took my troops

39
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,040
without accomplishing my task.

40
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,630
I would've shot you

41
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,350
if you were someone else!

42
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,790
Superintendent Chi,

43
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,720
I think you misunderstood something.

44
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,000
Didn't I tell you before?

45
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,510
The Mu family will
definitely support you

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,760
as long as you keep supporting me.

47
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,320
Superintendent Chi,
you're the one going back on your word.

48
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,160
How could you blame me for this?

49
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:59,390
When it comes to arguing,

50
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,560
Miss Mu, you're truly something else.

51
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,600
You have a silver tongue.

52
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,280
If that's the case,

53
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,200
I'll make myself clear.

54
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,790
All these brothers of mine

55
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,760
have been through
thick and thin with me.

56
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,910
They're strong and determined.

57
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,830
They can only die on the battlefield!

58
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,730
Their names
shouldn't be appearing on this list!

59
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,590
If everyone knows

60
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,200
that I'd lost this many troops,

61
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,320
had the soldiers' morale shaken,

62
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,680
and had my tasks hindered

63
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,000
because of you,

64
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,630
I won't be able to give my brothers

65
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,360
and the people

66
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,680
an account.

67
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,470
Superintendent Chi,

68
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,920
you do live up to your title.

69
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,490
You do focus on the bigger picture.

70
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,320
I was being inconsiderate here.

71
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,470
Farewell.

72
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,290
Give it to me.

73
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,470
Mr. Shen,

74
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,030
Uncle Youwen called me just now and said

75
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,360
that Mr. Zhang had passed away.

76
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,270
You're here.

77
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,880
I'm back.

78
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,760
Has...

79
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,370
Has everything settled down?

80
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,880
Yes.

81
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,590
Good.

82
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,830
Mr. Shen,

83
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,320
this is the letter

84
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,200
Grandfather told me to hand it to you.

85
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,080
Don't worry.

86
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,590
You can leave
the Shen family's residence to me.

87
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,640
I will do what

88
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,150
Grandfather has done in the past.

89
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,760
As for your secret,

90
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,200
I will never tell
any strangers about it.

91
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,560
To me,

92
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,800
you never changed at all.

93
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:15,950
Thank you.

94
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:26,270
(Mr. Shen, please treat
this letter as our encounter.)

95
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,440
(As you saved me,)

96
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,640
(I guarded the tombs
for the Shen family.)

97
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,350
(I was lucky enough to live out
my years in peace and contentment.)

98
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:38,080
(I'm already content with my life.)

99
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,440
(You were always a considerate person.)

100
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,710
(I often think about this.)

101
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,120
(Although we knew
each other for 70 years,)

102
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,560
(we only met three to five times.)

103
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,910
(Now, I have to bid you
a hasty farewell.)

104
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,390
(I already have no regrets in life.)

105
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,950
(As a general has his reputation
shattered one battle after another,)

106
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:04,800
(he turns back
to look at the riverside,)

107
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:08,120
(knowing that
his old friends are long gone.)

108
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:13,560
(Now that we're parting ways,
I hope you can look after yourself.)

109
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,540
(To Mr. Shen)

110
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,150
It's my honor to make
your acquaintance as well.

111
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,350
So, do all of the other tablets

112
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,800
represent your family members?

113
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:33,520
There are family members.

114
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,350
There are friends as well.

115
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,470
Will there be mine?

116
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,080
Not for now.

117
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,090
I will have one in the future, right?

118
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,950
All of these represent
my deceased family members and friends.

119
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,920
You're back.

120
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,160
Yes, Miss Mu.

121
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,440
I was thinking that I should rush back
and clean the scene for you.

122
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,280
I never expected you
to clean it up already.

123
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,080
How was the investigation?

124
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,110
I did obtain some leads

125
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,820
when I did my investigation
in Suping Town.

126
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,400
(When my father was young,)

127
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,320
(he made acquaintance with a woman.)

128
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,230
(After that, she got pregnant.)

129
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,680
(She gave birth to a son.)

130
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,950
(Father brought her home.)

131
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,080
(I called her Madam Shen.)

132
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,750
After that, Grandmother
found out

133
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,280
that she often killed chickens
and drank their blood at night.

134
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,870
Grandmother thought they were monsters.

135
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,470
When Father was away,

136
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,750
she tied both her and her son up.

137
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,490
She wanted to burn them to death.

138
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,590
Madam Shen?

139
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,710
That's right.

140
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,550
I have looked into
the Shen family genealogy.

141
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,040
That Madam Shen

142
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,110
was only known as Wei.

143
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,870
(My ancestor once
mentioned in the diary)

144
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,590
(that the Mu family fought with
someone for the Blood Amber Stone.)

145
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,630
(That person was called Wei Qiu.)

146
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,630
(When she goes berserk,)

147
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,990
(she becomes super strong and swift.)

148
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,990
(She could rival 100 men)

149
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,590
(with her fists alone.)

150
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,520
(The Mu family
suffered heavy casualties.)

151
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:59,950
(Only my ancestor)

152
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,280
(managed to escape frantically.)

153
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,080
(He wrote this diary entry)

154
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,630
(with his remaining memories.)

155
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,560
In this diary, Wei Qiu's abilities

156
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,560
were the same as Shen Zhiheng's.

157
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,630
What do you think that proves?

158
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,830
Could it be that this woman

159
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,790
had handed the Blood Amber Stone
to Shen Zhiheng?

160
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,520
If that's the case,

161
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,590
that means

162
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,680
I have to get you at all costs.

163
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,560
Lin Zhen, we have to do something.

164
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,710
We need to force him to show himself.

165
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:23,950
Who's there?

166
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,520
Let me do it.

167
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,800
Alright.

168
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,520
What are you guys doing?

169
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,830
We're leaving Haidong.

170
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,950
Why are we leaving Haidong?

171
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,920
We're going to spend our days
in a peaceful place

172
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,830
when no one will pester
or cause trouble for us.

173
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,680
We're leaving Haidong, huh?

174
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,230
But before that,
there's one more person to deal with.

175
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,870
"Many people
have gone missing in Haidong."

176
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,560
"Practice caution
when you tread at night?"

177
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,790
That has nothing to do with me.

178
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,920
I didn't do it.

179
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,320
I know it wasn't you.

180
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,920
It should be Mu Lihua.

181
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,710
Chi Shanying has already lost

182
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,080
many of his guards.

183
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,990
They never came back
after heading to her place.

184
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,920
Even if the feud
of the Three Stones didn't exist,

185
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,230
we cannot allow Mu Lihua to remain here.

186
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,680
We need to deal with this threat
on Haidong's behalf.

187
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,110
What about Chi Shanying?

188
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,520
At least Chi Shanying is still a human.

189
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,350
But Mu Lihua

190
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,440
has already lost all sense of reason.

191
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,950
Fine. I'll follow your will.

192
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,440
But there's one thing
we need to discuss.

193
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,320
It's very important.

194
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,200
Is that all?

195
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,590
Yes.

196
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,080
Since this is

197
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,350
so beneficial to you,

198
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,750
you can do it yourself.

199
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,230
You don't need to tell me about it.

200
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,080
Don't tell me you think

201
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,520
that I'll cooperate with you
and surrender myself to him?

202
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,920
I didn't agree to
Li Yingliang's proposal for the benefits.

203
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,040
I did it for your sake.

204
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,520
For my sake?

205
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,110
Please tell me the details.

206
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,990
You've offended the Haidong Army.

207
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,470
Chi Shanying won't let you off.

208
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,320
You also disclosed your immortality.

209
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,830
Mu Lihua won't let you off either.

210
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,980
That's why I'm planning
to leave Haidong with you two.

211
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,420
Why do you still want to remain here?

212
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,920
Li Yingliang gave me his promise.

213
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,800
He said he could help us to leave

214
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,520
as long as I helped him out.

215
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:31,920
And, he even said that he would withdraw
from the relationship and help me

216
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,470
win Jingxue's heart.

217
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,990
Even if I agree,

218
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,520
Jin Jingxue won't agree to it.

219
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,830
We aren't machines.

220
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,400
We can't stop our feelings at will.

221
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,950
We can't just change the person we love.

222
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,110
Even I could tell

223
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,560
that she loves Li Yingliang.

224
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,440
Can't you tell?

225
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,830
I think Li Yingliang doesn't love
Jin Jingxue at all.

226
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,950
How would you know that?

227
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,800
If he loved Jin Jingxue,

228
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,950
he wouldn't use her
as his bargaining chip.

229
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,320
If I were him,
I would never be able to do that.

230
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,520
Strange.

231
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,400
How did an innocent guy like you

232
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,110
actually hide this from me
for three years?

233
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,280
Heng, just take it
as if you're fulfilling my wish.

234
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,750
This is beneficial to you as well.

235
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,800
Brothers are stand-in fathers.

236
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,390
In the future,
I'll treat you like my father.

237
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,270
I'll be filial to you.

238
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,470
And, I can't rest at ease

239
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,620
when Jingxue is in Haidong.

240
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,800
I must've owed you a lot
in my past life, huh?

241
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,320
Heng, you're the best.

242
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,590
I can cooperate with you.

243
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,920
But I have one request.

244
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,950
I need to see Mu Lihua at the very end.

245
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,470
Only then will I leave.

246
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,350
Why are you looking for me?

247
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:38,870
Am I great?

248
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,750
You're much more interesting
than Heng.

249
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,560
You're just like me.

250
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,440
Am I great or not?

251
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,750
You're swift and strong.

252
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,080
Yeah, you are.

253
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,400
If so, can I do anything
to help you guys out?

254
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,440
In what?

255
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,710
Chi Shanying and Mu Lihua
are powerful as well, right?

256
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,350
If so,

257
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,440
let's get rid of them in secret.

258
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,080
I cannot kill.

259
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,320
It's fine.

260
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,870
Both of them are bad eggs.

261
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,520
Let's get rid of them in secret.

262
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:16,530
Don't tell Heng about it.

263
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,110
What were you two whispering about?

264
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,460
Didn't you have business?

265
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,400
You, come with me.

266
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,390
(Third, don't reveal your true form)
You broke the third rule today.

267
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,870
Weilian isn't a stranger.

268
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,590
You're talking back to me, huh?

269
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:36,750
Good.

270
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,710
Copy the Six Rules 30 times.

271
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,800
You can only sleep after that.

272
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,040
30 times isn't enough?

273
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,040
Copy it 40 times, then.

274
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,620
You're not allowed to sleep
until you're done.

275
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,800
Little crow,

276
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,830
I'll take you outside.

277
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,180
But don't make a sound, okay?

278
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,720
If not, I'll pluck your feather.

279
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:15,830
Let's go.

280
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,110
What's going on?

281
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,520
Why were you terrified by a stupid crow?

282
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,870
You can just chase it away.

283
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,830
Go away!

284
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,320
Go away!

285
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:15,630
What a fool.

286
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,190
Scram!

287
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,560
Useless fool.

288
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,280
Go away!

289
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,590
Go away!

290
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,320
There's a ghost!

291
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,000
What ghost?

292
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,040
How could there be a ghost?

293
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,560
Come out!

294
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,590
Stop hiding!

295
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,520
Show yourself!

296
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,040
Where is he?

297
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,430
Show yourself!

298
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,800
Are you sick in the head?

299
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,870
Isn't it tiring
to swing around like that?

300
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,280
Show yourself if you dare!

301
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:09,590
What are you looking at? Look at me!

302
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,290
Investigate this case tomorrow.

303
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,720
Find him at all costs!

304
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,350
Yes, sir.

305
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,980
If I could scare you enough to leave
Haidong by taking this bullet,

306
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:00,910
that'll be worth it.

307
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,150
Sorry about that.

308
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,560
I plucked one of your feathers.

309
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,800
Eat up. Here.

310
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,350
Why are you like this?

311
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,110
You're so petty.

312
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,590
It's just one feather.

313
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:21,590
You are too much.

314
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:22,840
I won't be friends with you!

315
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:27,320
Mi Lan.

316
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,630
Mr. Shen.

317
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,430
You woke up early today, huh?

318
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:40,910
I couldn't sleep.

319
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,040
Go and get changed.
Let's go and admire some views.

320
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,190
Alright.

321
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,960
Say,

322
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,040
he only tried to terrify me.

323
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,350
He didn't harm me.

324
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,150
What was his goal?

325
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:07,430
Superintendent Chi,
judging from your description,

326
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,520
he appeared out of nowhere
and was extremely swift.

327
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,380
I'm sure it's not an ordinary person.

328
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:12,880
Could it be Shen Zhiheng?

329
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,080
That's impossible.

330
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,430
He has a small figure.
It's not Shen Zhiheng.

331
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,830
A small figure...

332
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,720
Could it be Mu Lihua?

333
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,760
I have a report.

334
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,390
Come in.

335
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,040
Superintendent Chi,
someone named Situ Weilian

336
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,070
is waiting for you outside.

337
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,720
He said he has news of Li Yingliang.

338
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,320
Why didn't Li Yingliang
come here himself?

339
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,910
He said he didn't dare
to show himself in public yet.

340
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,190
He also said

341
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,520
that he didn't hand the documents
to Shen Zhiheng.

342
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,000
Shen Zhiheng stole them.

343
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,110
Shen Zhiheng wanted to frame him.

344
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,430
He wanted to use you

345
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:57,760
to get rid of him.

346
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,430
If so, aren't you afraid

347
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,110
that I'll doubt your words

348
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,430
and kill you instead?

349
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,630
I've never thought of that.

350
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:08,800
Would you though?

351
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,960
Such audacity.

352
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,430
How dare you speak like that?

353
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,110
Actually, he told me to come here

354
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,870
so that you could go there
and visit him.

355
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,110
He said he didn't believe in anyone else

356
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:29,910
except for you.

357
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,080
Fine.

358
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,760
Please tell Li Yingliang

359
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,280
that I'll visit him.

360
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:41,480
Got it.

361
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:42,970
Farewell, Superintendent Chi.

362
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,720
By the way, I almost forgot about
the most important part.

363
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,110
Li Yingliang also said

364
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,910
that he would show his loyalty

365
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,000
by coming up with a way

366
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,480
to help you capture Shen Zhiheng.

367
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,480
Did Li Yingliang
tell you about it, then?

368
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,280
I'm just a messenger.

369
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:08,000
I'll be going now.

370
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,320
This Li Yingliang

371
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,670
is truly dumb.

372
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,040
I was looking for him all this while
but to no avail.

373
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:21,630
Now, he actually
sought help from his enemy.

374
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,560
He even told Situ Weilian

375
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,910
about his plan.

376
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Situ Weilian is on Shen Zhiheng's side.

377
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,720
If Situ Weilian knows about his plan,

378
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,390
Shen Zhiheng will know about it too.

379
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,280
So, Superintendent Chi,
what's your plan?

380
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,800
In my opinion,

381
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:37,800
maybe

382
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,870
Shen Zhiheng was the one
who came up with this plan.

383
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:43,150
Maybe the three of them are in cahoots.

384
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,670
They're staging an act for me to see.

385
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:48,290
Superintendent Chi, I'll take my men
to the Jin Mansion and arrest him.

386
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:49,870
No need for that.

387
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,910
Superintendent Chi,
do you intend to see him, then?

388
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,110
Yes.

389
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,190
Of course.

390
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,110
He spent so much effort

391
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,390
to come up with this plan.

392
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,670
I want to see what he's up to.

393
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,950
I'll arrange for it immediately.

394
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:08,390
Mr. Shen,

395
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,630
I didn't sleep last night.

396
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,760
You didn't sleep?

397
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:13,480
What did you do, then?

398
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,520
I went to scare Chi Shanying.

399
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:16,860
Scare?

400
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,860
Wasn't that what you did

401
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,060
to chase my mother away?

402
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,240
You said I mustn't kill.

403
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,530
I can at least scare them, right?

404
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,350
Did I do something wrong again?

405
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,390
That's not it.

406
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,830
That's pretty good.

407
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,080
But you must take note
of your safety.

408
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:40,080
You must form a plan
before you deal with foes.

409
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:41,990
You shouldn't act
on your own initiative like this.

410
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:44,190
What if you alert them to your presence?

411
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:45,870
Will I?

412
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,400
Chi Shanying is stationed in Haidong.

413
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,920
He's in a position

414
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,480
where his moves will affect everything.

415
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,520
At least he and Mu Lihua
can restrain each other.

416
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,630
What should we do
if you do scare him away?

417
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,560
I guess he's stronger than my mother.

418
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,210
He doesn't run away
for the first time.

419
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,190
You're right.

420
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,080
He won't run away just from that.

421
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,190
He can't bear
to part with his position.

422
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,150
I've lived for over 100 years.

423
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,240
For the past 100 years,

424
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,430
initially, I was uncertain of my future.

425
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:20,190
Then I gradually stabilized my life.

426
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:21,910
And life became interesting.

427
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:23,870
And now,

428
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,390
I live as if I'm a zombie.

429
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:29,390
Even so, I still chose
to become a decent human.

430
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,150
I thrived as a human.

431
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,000
Even so, I still don't understand
the meaning of being human.

432
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,590
Mr. Shen, I didn't feel like living

433
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,590
before I met you.

434
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,390
But now, I wish to live.

435
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,590
Me too.

436
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,720
Mi Lan,

437
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,000
let's act together next time, okay?

438
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,280
Okay.

439
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:02,350
I don't know when it'll stop snowing,

440
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:04,600
but I'm already
looking forward to the days

441
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:06,800
when we can listen to the rain together.

442
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,520
Mr. Shen, I'm also looking forward

443
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,350
to every single day
I'll be spending with you.

444
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,000
Liang.

445
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,670
Thank you, Miss Jin.

446
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,000
What's on your mind?

447
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,520
As long as my plan proceeds smoothly,

448
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:51,190
I can return to my position.

449
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,240
Shen Zhiheng and
Situ Weilian will be fine.

450
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:55,560
Miss Jin, don't worry.

451
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:57,870
I won't harm them.

452
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,580
I won't treat them
as my foes in the future.

453
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,430
Chi Shanying has held Guisheng captive.

454
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,040
I have to rescue him.

455
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,150
Superintendent Chi.

456
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,590
Superintendent Chi.

457
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:16,560
Li Yingliang.

458
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,390
You do know
that I can kill you directly, right?

459
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,870
Superintendent Chi,
I never betrayed you.

460
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,860
Shen Zhiheng captured me
to his warehouse.

461
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:28,280
He almost tortured me to death.

462
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:30,080
I only managed to escape
by digging a hole.

463
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,660
I didn't even dare
to walk on the streets after my escape.

464
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,040
I'm afraid that
he might capture me again.

465
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:35,390
So I'm hiding
in the Jin Mansion.

466
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:37,890
I thought of a perfect plan
to kill Shen Zhiheng.

467
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:40,470
That's why I risked my life
and sent someone to look for you.

468
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,950
Do you think no one else except for you

469
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,600
can complete this task for me?

470
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,470
Have you ever considered this?

471
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,550
Ever since

472
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,030
you took over Shen Zhiheng's case,

473
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,440
you never accomplished anything!

474
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:56,030
Even Mu Lihua's ring is
much stronger than you!

475
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,370
It's much more stronger than you.

476
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,710
Superintendent Chi, I'm different.

477
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:00,790
I'm more loyal to you

478
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:01,990
than anyone else.

479
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,030
Do you know

480
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,790
what I did before I became a soldier?

481
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,640
I don't know.

482
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,360
Before I became a soldier,

483
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,470
I was a mentee

484
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:29,470
in a barber shop.

485
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,270
My first job

486
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,120
was to help an officer
shave his mustache.

487
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,360
Back then,

488
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,710
I was new.

489
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:40,510
I was nervous.

490
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,950
My hand was shaky.

491
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,400
I cut

492
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,750
the officer's face.

493
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:46,840
He was bleeding.

494
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,230
All those soldiers were pointing
their guns at me and my mentor.

495
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,840
I thought I was done for.

496
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:54,600
I thought I was dead for sure.

497
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,470
But I didn't expect

498
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,080
that the officer
didn't utter a single word.

499
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:01,950
He left after that.

500
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,160
Those days,

501
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,920
I was leading an uneasy life.

502
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:11,950
After half a month,

503
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,950
that officer came back.

504
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,600
This time, he didn't bring
any soldiers or guns with him.

505
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,680
He came alone.

506
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,160
He designated me to shave his mustache.

507
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,230
He said he believed that I didn't do it
on purpose the first time around.

508
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:29,080
He believed that I wouldn't
repeat my mistake.

509
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:30,840
Li Yingliang,

510
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,550
you've messed up so many times.

511
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,200
You've gotten yourself
into plenty of trouble.

512
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,270
I never punished you severely

513
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,160
because I took your past merit
into consideration.

514
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:42,230
I still trusted you.

515
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,400
That's why I'm willing
to give you another chance.

516
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,120
Trust

517
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,400
is very important.

518
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,400
You shouldn't let me down.

519
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,190
Superintendent Chi,
I won't let you down.

520
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,750
I'll definitely make it
as long as you give me one more chance.

521
00:31:59,270 --> 00:31:59,920
Have a seat.

522
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,950
Tell me about your plan.

523
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,920
This time, we'll outsmart him.

524
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,710
We'll make
Shen Zhiheng sign a confession.

525
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:12,020
We'll announce it in the newspaper

526
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,360
that the firm was disclosing the Haidong
Army's confidential documents, not me.

527
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,510
I believe that I can accomplish this task

528
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,400
with the help of
Li Guisheng and Situ Weilian.

529
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,950
Not Li Guisheng.

530
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,360
The people demanded me

531
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,790
to give them an account.

532
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,680
I have no choice
but to lock Li Guisheng up.

533
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,190
Superintendent Chi,
you're considerate indeed.

534
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,510
Superintendent Chi, if my plan does work out,

535
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,790
can you please let Li Guisheng go?

536
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:40,640
What about Mu Lihua?

537
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,950
Why didn't you mention her?

538
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,880
Mu Lihua did capture

539
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,470
Shen Zhiheng before this.

540
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,920
Superintendent Chi,
pardon me for being frank,

541
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,080
but Mu Lihua is not trustworthy.

542
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,710
Didn't you realize something?

543
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:57,360
Haidong had been in turmoil
ever since she came here.

544
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,160
And, plenty of people have gone missing.

545
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,470
Why couldn't that
be the work of Shen Zhiheng?

546
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,680
He could've gone berserk
and killed all of them.

547
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,550
Shen Zhiheng has a sense of decency.

548
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,190
He wasn't willing
to get death-row convicts.

549
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,640
Why would he lose his mind

550
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,640
and attack the people?

551
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,200
You see,

552
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,640
Mu Lihua gets her way

553
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,600
at all costs.

554
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,160
(Many missing in Haidong)
She only cares about her own interests.

555
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,710
She never respects life.

556
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:22,680
Superintendent Chi,
you mustn't trust her.

557
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,920
We can proceed with your plan.

558
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,510
But Li Yingliang,

559
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:35,200
trust

560
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,600
is very important.

561
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,080
You mustn't let me down.

562
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:42,270
Yes, I understand.

563
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,440
Thank you, Superintendent Chi.

564
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,990
Get me a new pot of tea.

565
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,120
The tea you poured for me was cold.

566
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,470
Yes, sir.

567
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:53,560
Why are you still awake?

568
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,520
You don't need to overreact.

569
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,750
As if I was trying to hit you.

570
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,370
I'll repay your kindness
once I make a comeback.

571
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,910
How do you intend to repay me?

572
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,710
I'll buy you expensive dowries.

573
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:37,120
Who cares about that?

574
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,830
I don't even have a fiance.

575
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:43,910
Who knows when I'll be able
to use the dowries you buy?

576
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,000
Now, you're saying all this.

577
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,110
What if you go back on your word
in the future?

578
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,270
I think Situ Weilian is a worthy groom.

579
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,350
Who do you think you are?

580
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,880
Now, you're making the call for me?

581
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,790
You don't like him?

582
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:03,600
I don't.

583
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,430
I think he's nice to you.

584
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:08,120
You're nice to him too.

585
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,750
Does that mean I need to marry him?

586
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:28,870
Li Yingliang, I'm ever nicer to you.

587
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:36,680
I'm sleepy.

588
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,870

615

and that you're trying
to make a living with me.

You get whatever you desire.

617

That's why I can be together

627

I have to resolve it
as soon as possible.

628

Even if I'll lose my future,

629
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:35,080
I have to clear my name

630
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,350
and save myself.

631

If this keeps up,

632
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:41,000
you'll be implicated too.

633
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,230
I'm not afraid of that.

634
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:48,160
Don't worry. I won't be in danger.

635
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:53,710
I'll come back

You don't need to coax me

I'm serious. I'm not trying to coax you.

But don't think that I'm using this
to threaten you here.

If so,

647
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,790
