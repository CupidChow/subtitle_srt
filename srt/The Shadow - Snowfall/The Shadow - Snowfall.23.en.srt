(Haidong Army HQ)

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,030
You may go inside.

6
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,880
Superintendent Wu
agrees with seeing you.

7
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,200
Thank you.

8
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:00,790
Have a seat.

9
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,560
Thank you, Superintendent Wu.

10
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:11,080
Superintendent Wu, I didn't expect you
to be generous enough to see me in person.

11
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,360
Let me thank you in advance.

12
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,990
Miss Jin, you're capable.

13
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,760
Why would you become dejected

14
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,950
over such a small affair?

15
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,920
Even if you have to make a comeback,

16
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,080
I'm sure it's nothing difficult for you.

17
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,440
Superintendent Wu, you do know
how to assess the situation.

18
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,040
If not, you wouldn't have
gotten to where you are today.

19
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,810
Miss Jin, thank you for the compliment.

20
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,040
So, what brings you here today?

21
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,080
I heard that the Haidong Army
cleaned up the mine.

22
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,600
I just found out

23
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,990
that Li Yingliang died inside the mine.

24
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,090
Fallen leaves return to their roots
like how we return to our ancestry.

25
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,760
He was from the Jin family after all.

26
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,200
I have to find his body and
give him a proper burial.

27
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,670
Superintendent Wu,

28
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,480
will you help me out?

29
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,040
Miss Jin,

30
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,440
to be honest,

31
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,600
not only did the mine collapse,
but there was also a huge fire.

32
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,760
Our men did inspect the place.

33
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,760
We didn't see Li Yingliang's body.

34
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,640
His body wasn't found?

35
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,120
That means Liang is still alive,

36
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,080
right?

37
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,390
Right?

38
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,390
Mother, here.

39
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,830
Thank you, Qian.

40
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,200
Here.

41
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,470
Put it on for me.

42
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,590
Your father did the same for me

43
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,950
back then.

44
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,560
My solitary shadow lingers in the world.

45
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,910
How can we share life

46
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,120
but not death?

47
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,350
(Love.)

48
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,680
(What exactly is love?)

49
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,910
(Must we love something
once we obtain it?)

50
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,760
(Must we cry)

51
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,350
(when we lose it?)

52
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,710
Big Brother,

53
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,830
when I courted Jingxue in the past,

54
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,190
it was as if I was worshiping a Buddha.

55
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,000
I would be elated

56
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,240
as long as she was wearing

57
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,880
something I bought.

58
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,120
Now, although she's living with me,

59
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,710
I don't feel happy at all.

60
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,320
In the past,

61
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,440
I knew that she loved Li Yingliang.

62
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,910
But I thought

63
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,590
it didn't matter.

64
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,390
You can like whoever you like
and I can do the same.

65
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,950
Liking someone is my own business.

66
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,520
It's fine as long as I'm happy.

67
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,440
But today,

68
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,350
I only found out

69
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,320
that I didn't care about her.

70
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,710
I just cared about obtaining her.

71
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,280
But in her heart,

72
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,680
there are no traces of me at all.

73
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,110
Big Brother,

74
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,350
you didn't see how she was crying today.

75
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,160
I felt a little terrified.

76
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,520
I was afraid that she would keep crying,

77
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,040
just like my mother.

78
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,110
I only encountered
one person I liked after so long.

79
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,040
If she cries herself to death,

80
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,110
wouldn't that be quite a shame for me?

81
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,320
That would be a shame.

82
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,870
I have to make her happy.

83
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,350
Wu, stop at the junction.

84
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,180
Buy some newspapers.

85
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,400
Wu, I'm talking to you. Did you hear me?

86
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:46,750
Wu...

87
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,320
There's a street called
Xinglong Street in Haidong.

88
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,200
There are plenty of interesting things

89
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,680
and delicious food there.

90
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,630
When I first came to Haidong,

91
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,590
I went there with Weilian once.

92
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,350
It's very lively.

93
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,200
You should check it out.

94
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,710
You can make a candy figure.

95
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,110
They sell roasted chestnuts

96
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,440
and candied hawthorns as well.

97
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,080
You can watch
acrobatic performances there.

98
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,760

of other things there.

Mr. Shen, I'm back.

119
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,590
I bought candied hawthorns
and roasted chestnuts.

120
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,710
Welcome back.

121
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,920

(but she's extremely swift as well.)

125

(I'm sure this is related
to the Blood Amber Stone.)

126
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,950
Mr. Shen gave me plenty of nice things.

127
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,230
I'm going to give him
something in return.

128
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,590

00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:36,950
Okay.

139

Are you trying to trigger me?

140

to being in charge again)

and take over the association.

Come back.

146
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,080

Jingxue,

150
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,630
I was just joking with you
a few days ago.

151
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,760
How could I steal
the association from you?

152
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,040
I would be inhumane if I did so.

153
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,390
Take a look.

154
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,150
This is the transfer agreement.

155
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,670
I've already signed it for you.

156

00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:35,520
You don't believe me?

160
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:36,520
Why would I

161
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,800
call all of them here to receive you, then?

162
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,870
That's right, Miss Jin.

163
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,000
- Come back.
- Come back.

171
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,720

Not bad.

But if I find out
that you try to hurt Jingxue again,

178

00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,080
Okay.

187
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,390
Paste it over there. Go now.

188
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,350
I'm done.

189
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:25,800
Okay.

190
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,560
I'm done too.

191
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,280
Let's prepare
and make some dumplings.

192
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:34,910
Who could it be?

193
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,240
Heng, I invited Jingxue to celebrate
the Chinese New Year with us.

194
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,390
Alright. Go now.

195
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:45,910
That's pretty good.

196
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:46,980
It'll be livelier.

197
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,560
Big Brother, Jingxue is here.

198
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:52,590
Mi Lan.

199
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,320
Jingxue.

200
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:54,910
You're here.

201
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,720
He insisted on dragging me here.

202
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,320
I guess I have no choice but to celebrate
the Chinese New Year with you guys.

203
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,670
Happy Chinese New Year.

204
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,190
Happy Chinese New Year.

205
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,090
It's good that you're visiting us.
No need to bring any gifts.

206
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,080
Here, Mi Lan.

207
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,350
That handbag is mine.

208
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,190
Great timing.
Let's make some dumplings together.

209
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:18,960
Weilian.

210
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:20,430
Come on.

211
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,150
Jingxue, let's go.

212
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,390
You guys are turning it
into a sticky mess.

213
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,040
Stop it.

214
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,520
Especially you.

215
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,800
Got it.

216
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,720
Jingxue,

217
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,350
how are you so good at this?

218
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,830
Chinese New Year was
a lively occasion in the past.

219
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,150
Both my parents
and Liang were still around...

220
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,670
Anyway, everyone was there.

221
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,720
Naturally, Chinese New Year
was a lot of fun.

222
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:02,040
Don't tell me you guys never celebrated
Chinese New Year before?

223
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,350
I thought everyone knew
how to make dumplings.

224
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,240
I lived alone for a long time.

225
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,680
I never celebrated
Chinese New Year.

226
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,190
Heng never taught me
how to celebrate.

227
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,240
I was blind since I was born.

228
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,830
My parents argued often as well.

229
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,580
We could only celebrate Chinese New Year
when they were in a good mood.

230
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:16,990
Only then would I have dumplings.

231
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,150
But I couldn't see.

232
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,380
So I couldn't learn
how to make.

233
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:21,830
If so, I guess I can teach you.

234
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,280
Do you wish to learn?

235
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:24,720
I do!

236
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:26,800
Me too.

237
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,190
I'll teach you two, then.

238
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,520
Two folds.

239
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,080
Here.

240
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,870
After that, pinch it gently

241
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:37,870
in the middle.

242
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:38,800
After that,

243
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,040
pinch both sides gently.

244
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,560
Your dumpling is ready.

245
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,190
Mr. Shen, does it look nice?

246
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,390
Yeah.

247
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,590
Weilian.

248
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,190
I intend to write another couplet.

249
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,350
You should come with me.

250
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:56,390
Alright.

251
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:57,990
You guys can continue.

252
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,320
Did Shen Zhiheng turn you into this?

253
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,560
You can tell Weilian

254
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,800
to convert you as well.

255
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:08,960
I don't want that.

256
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,670
You regained vision.

257
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,390
Shen Zhiheng has immortality.

258
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,870
Although I don't know
what Weilian has obtained,

259
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:16,760
I think

260
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,110
he did obtain a lot of benefits.

261
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,760
However, you guys are no longer humans.

262
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,110
I think it's worth it.

263
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,110
This way,

264
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,390
I can be together with Mr. Shen forever.

265
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,000
That's you.

266
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,930
Anyway, I don't want it.

267
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,870
Why are you always angry?

268
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,520
Why do you always look angry, then?

269
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,590
I just look angry.

270
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,630
I'll be nice to you in the future.

271
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,590
I'll also be nice to Weilian
in the future.

272
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,760
I'll make money for him to spend.

273
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,560
Shen Zhiheng is wealthy.

274
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:46,860
He doesn't need you
to make money.

275
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,350
Don't call him Shen Zhiheng.

276
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,110
You should call him Heng.

277
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,180
Does that mean I have to call you
Sister-in-law?

278
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:56,110
If you're willing,

279
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,830
I don't mind that either.

280
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:02,520
Seems like Shen Zhiheng
has swapped out your brain as well, huh?

281
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,190
Time to have some dumplings.

282
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,870
Time to have some dumplings!

283
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,150
(Humble abode and a simple life)

284
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,000
Slow down.

285
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,080
Time to have some dumplings!

286
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,040
The dumplings are ready.

287
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,590
It's Chinese New Year.
Here are some blessings.

288
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,120
Mi Lan.

289
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,090
- Happy Chinese New Year.
- Thank you.

290
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:29,720
Miss Jin.

291
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,560
Thank you.

292
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,320
And you.

293
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,300
Here you go.

294
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,040
Thank you, Heng.

295
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,150
Happy Chinese New Year.

296
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,800
- Happy Chinese New Year.
- Happy Chinese New Year.

297
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:36,660
Happy Chinese New Year.

298
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:37,110
Great.

299
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:40,350
I want to try Weilian's dumplings.

300
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:41,870
Mine is especially delicious.

301
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:43,800
You made the least and ate the fastest.

302
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,350
Delicious.

303
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:46,720
Eat up.

304
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:49,870
Mr. Shen.

305
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:50,320
Youwen.

306
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,260
- Happy Chinese New Year.
- Uncle Youwen.

307
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,240
Youwen, Happy Chinese New Year.

308
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:52,840
Uncle Youwen.

309
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,480
Mr. Situ, Miss Jin,
you two are here as well.

310
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,880
Happy Chinese New Year.

311
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,040
- Happy Chinese New Year.
- Miss Mi Lan, Happy Chinese New Year.

312
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,290
Join us for some dumplings.

313
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,580
Youwen and I have to deal with
the newspaper firm's affairs.

314
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,430
You guys can go ahead.
We'll come back soon.

315
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,150
- Let's continue.
- Come.

316
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:18,080
Mr. Shen, I've changed your will
according to your instructions.

317
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,080
I've added Miss Mi Lan

318
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,670
to the list of asset successors.

319
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,040
Youwen,

320
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,780
I wish to add another clause.

321
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,110
Please tell me.

322
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,350
I wish to transfer
the shares

323
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,830
of Haidong Daily and the two
other newspaper firms to you.

324
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,520
Mr. Shen,

325
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,110
you mustn't do so.

326
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,800
There are conditions to it.

327
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,430
If I do die...

328
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,110
You and your clan

329
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,760
have to take care of Mi Lan
for generations to come.

330
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,960
Mi Lan is pure and naive.

331
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,480
You should feed her whatever she likes.

332
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,190
Try to make her as happy as possible.

333
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,080
Do not put her in danger.

334
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,320
Anyway,

335
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,040
you mustn't ignore her.

336
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,240
Mr. Shen, I'll definitely

337
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,560
fulfill your wish.

338
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,830
Thank you.

339
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,480
Come. Let's have some dumplings.

340
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:41,040
They're setting fireworks!

341
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,110
What wish did you make?

342
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,040
I can't tell you yet.

343
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,100
Why did you come here and admire
the fireworks without telling me?

344
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,710
I'm keeping watch
over the arrival of a new year.

345
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,320
What does that mean?

346
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:14,560
Lanterns and fireworks
light up the new year.

347
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,110
On Chinese New Year's Eve, lights
are bright and fireworks are everywhere.

348
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:19,590
Rumor has it

349
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:23,150
that it'll help us to gain wealth
and prosperity in the coming year.

350
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,760
So we shouldn't sleep
on Chinese New Year's Eve.

351
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,790
That's keeping
watch over the arrival of a new year.

352
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,350
Aren't Weilian and the rest
going to join us, then?

353
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,800
They're too lazy.

354
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,190
I can do it myself.

355
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,190
Let's do it together, then.

356
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:37,960
Okay.

357
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,630
(The hibiscus tree is no longer
in the research center.)

358
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,630
(I don't know who took it away.)

359
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:59,390
(Now, I only have
the Fantasy Stone with me.)

360
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,720
(I have to resolve this
as soon as possible.)

361
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,240
(I've seen the Profound Yang Stone
and set up the hibiscus tree.)

362
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,240
(Its intense power
is the most likely to cause harm.)

363
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,670
(So, who can use
the Profound Yang Stone?)

364
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,390
(Future generations should
remember this carefully.)

365
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,060
(The descendants of the Mo family
may reactivate the hibiscus tree.)

366
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:21,490
(They will only be able to utilize the
stone's power with good intention.)

367
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,080
(Shen Zhiheng possesses
the power of the Blood Amber Stone.)

368
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,680
(If I transfer the power
of the Profound Yang Stone to him,)

369
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:30,000
(he might become more powerful than me.)

370
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:35,260
(Mi Mansion)

371
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,060
(Mi Mansion)

372
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,520
You're here, huh?

373
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:18,040
So, this is what you look like.

374
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,150
Why are your clothes torn?

375
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,720
You kept me company in the past.

376
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,040
Sorry about this.

377
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,960
I've left you alone here.

378
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:58,350
Is there anyone else home?

379
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,150
Who's there?

380
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,560
Mi Lan?

381
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,320
What are you doing here?

382
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,240
Didn't you run away with Shen Zhiheng?

383
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,560
Didn't you elope with that coachman?

384
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:23,910
That scoundrel.

385
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,590
He ran away
after cheating me of my money.

386
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:47,520
You...

387
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,350
You can see now?

388
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,390
How could that be?

389
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,720
I won't tell you the reason.

390
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:58,590
Shen Zhiheng

391
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:00,830
is pretty nice to you, huh?

392
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,760
He gave you food

393
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,110
and apparel.

394
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,110
He even cured your condition.

395
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,910
Where's Shen Zhiheng?

396
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,300
I'm considered his mother-in-law.

397
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,870
He should come here and kowtow to me.

398
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,830
He abducted my daughter.

399
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,190
But now, he doesn't dare
to show himself.

400
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,320
He's just a coward...

401
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:18,910
Shut up!

402
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,630
You dare to talk back to me now?

403
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,290
Seems like you're itching for a beating.

404
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,280
You!

405
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,480
Mi Lan!

406
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,280
Stop.

407
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,000
Come with me.

408
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,670
You don't need to be afraid.

409
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,800
You did raise Mi Lan after all.

410
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,150
No one wants you dead

411
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:08,670
because of something like that.

412
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,430
But I do have something
to discuss with you.

413
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:12,560
Have a seat.

414
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,190
Go ahead. I'm all ears.

415
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,590
Judging from your condition,

416
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,390
I suppose you didn't lead
a comfortable life out there.

417
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:31,000
That's why you came back, right?

418
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:34,800
That scoundrel.

419
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,280
He ran away after taking my money!

420
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:41,140
I can promise you
that you won't need to fret about money

421
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:42,240
after this.

422
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:46,480
But you have to be
a good mother for once.

423
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:23,590
Mi Lan,

424
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,920
it was all my fault in the past.

425
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,480
Can you please forgive me?

426
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,000
I'll apologize to you.

427
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:33,480
I missed you, you know?

428
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,440
Mr. Shen,

429
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,190
let's head home.

430
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,360
(Bringing a child into the world
without nurturing or teaching)

431
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,440
(is the worst thing a parent can do.)

432
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,310
(Mi Lan was blind since birth.)

433
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:27,040
(That was already tragic enough.)

434
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,000
(But you abused her without any reason.)

435
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,480
You even blamed her for your suffering,

436
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,840
causing her to lose her will to live.

437
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,750
But no matter what I do now,

438
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,630
I'm sure she can never forgive me.

439
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,480
It would never end up like this

440
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,840
had you done anything

441
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,230
(that a mother would do.)

442
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,150
(She doesn't know the meaning of love,)

443
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,920
not to mention forgiveness.

444
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,840
This is the sin
you have to bear as a mother.

445
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,310
(Mr. Shen is nice.)

446
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,630
(He's doing everything for my sake.)

447
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
(I shouldn't make him worried again.)

448
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,310
Mr. Shen.

449
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:50,880
Are you still upset?

450
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,480
I'm doing great now.

451
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,150
You don't need to worry.

452
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:57,630
I've already figured it out.

453
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:00,360
What have you figured out?

454
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,560
In the past, you loved to lecture me.

455
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,670
You even established
the Six Rules for me.

456
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,080
Although I was obedient,

457
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,840
I was upset with it.

458
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:12,590
But today,

459
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,110
I finally understood why.

460
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:19,230
My parents never taught me anything.

461
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,080
Therefore, my knowledge of the world

462
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:23,710
isn't complete.

463
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,630
You want to help me
avoid detours in life.

464
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,480
You don't want me to suffer that much.

465
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,360
I can see that.

466
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,630
I'm very happy

467
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,630
that you can understand my intention.

468
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,000
During Chinese New Year,

469
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,040
Weilian, Jingxue,

470
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:48,040
and Uncle Youwen visited us.

471
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:49,920
I was happy.

472
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:53,310
When Mother embraced me,

473
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,960
I was happy too.

474
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,920
In the past, I didn't have any friends.

475
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,960
My family members didn't love me.

476
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,360
You gave me everything I had.

477
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:07,520
So, this is what you mean

478
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,040
by the warmth of being a human.

479
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,360
You always said
that you were a cold person.

480
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,360
But I think

481
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,710
you're the warmest person in the world.

482
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,480
Shen Zhiheng,

483
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,230
from now on,

484
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:57,710
no matter if it's day or night,

485
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:01,670
let's never part ways again,

486
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,270
okay?

487
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,920
