00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,940
(This drama is purely fictional.)

4
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:48,140
(Haidong Army HQ)

5
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,200
Mr. Li, you still couldn't hold it in.

6
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,430
You actually kidnapped me.

7
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,480
Mr. Shen, I thought you wouldn't
be returning to Haidong.

8
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,830
How can I bear to do so?

9
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,910
Mr. Li, you're still here.

10
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,320
If so, seems like
we have to grow old together

11
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,200
and become best friends, Mr. Shen.

12
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,350
Mr. Li, you finally got
what you asked for.

13
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,350
I can see you

14
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,280
grinning from ear to ear.

15
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,720
Of course.

16
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,230
If only I could open
a bottle of champagne

17
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,670
and celebrate the occasion with you.

18
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,000
Oh, I forgot.
Mr. Shen, you don't eat.

19
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,950
But I have to eat.

20
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,990
I'm afraid
you have to suffer for a while.

21
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,160
I'll come back and catch up with you
once I'm done with my meal.

22
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,440
Wait for me.

23
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,630
She's just a blind girl.

24
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,990
Do we have to
pay this much attention to her?

25
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,600
I guess you weren't at
Annan District's police station.

26
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:34,630
She rescued

27
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,160
Shen Zhiheng by herself.

28
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,720
She's smart and witty.

29
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,560
Is that so?

30
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,520
Of course.

31
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,720
We mustn't let down our guard.

32
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,560
I guess we have to stay on our toes.

33
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,350
(Canteen)

34
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,280
Congratulations.

35
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,390
You captured Shen Zhiheng successfully.

36
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,560
You flatter me.

37
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,000
It's all thanks to your expert

38
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,560
who captured Shen Zhiheng successfully.

39
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,750
If not, we wouldn't be able
to capture him this easily.

40
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,800
All in all,
it's all thanks to you, Miss Mu.

41
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:25,680
You're too courteous.

42
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,400
Before this, we've tried
plenty of methods

43
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,240
to force Shen Zhiheng
to reveal his true form.

44
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,560
But nothing worked.

45
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,380
Miss Mu, I wonder
if you have any great ideas.

46
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,830
I have plenty of great ideas.

47
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,510
I've heard of such a condition before

48
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,120
when I was studying abroad.

49
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,560
As for the ideas,

50
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,000
we have to try them one by one.

51
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,200
Mr. Li, I hope
you'll support me by then.

52
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,200
That's for sure.

53
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,070
Miss Mu, please.

54
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:37,920
Mr. Shen,

55
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,560
allow me to introduce

56
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,710
this lady beside me.

57
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,920
This is the 32nd successor
of the Mu family,

58
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,830
Miss Mu Lihua.

59
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,070
Mr. Shen,

60
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,440
I've long heard of your name.

61
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,200
She has escaped!

62
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,120
Those who are downstairs,
split up and search for her!

63
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,200
That girl has escaped again!

64
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,390
Hurry! Follow me!

65
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,880
She escaped through the back door!

66
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,950
Hurry! After her!

67
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,070
- Let's go!
- Hurry!

68
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,680
Young girl, I didn't expect you
to escape at night.

69
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,540
You're something else.

70
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,800
Stop struggling.

71
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,710
It's pointless.

72
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,510
You guys better stay awake
the entire night.

73
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,630
If not, I'll try to escape again.

74
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,270
You're blind. You can't run that far.

75
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,440
What exactly are you up to?

76
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,150
I want to see Mr. Li.

77
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,710
Mr. Li?

78
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,120
Li Yingliang.

79
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,200
Wait here.

80
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,040
Mr. Li.

81
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,590
Mr. Li.

82
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,160
I heard that you act up
at the Mi Mansion

83
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,350
just so you could see me.

84
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,440
What's the point of seeing me?

85
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,320
Mi Lan,

86
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,870
I'll never release him.

87
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,440
Will you kill him, then?

88
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,400
What?

89
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,680
Do you care for his life?

90
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,830
I care for it a lot.

91
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:01,990
Mr. Li.

92
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,350
Can you do me a favor?

93
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,520
I can do you a favor,

94
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,590
but not Shen Zhiheng.

95
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,590
I'm begging you.

96
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,520
Mi Lan, you should wake up.

97
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,120
Is it worth it for you
to make a plea for a freak like him?

98
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,200
He's very kind.

99
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,920
He's nice to me.

100
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,640
That's more than worth it.

101
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,280
You're a fool as well.

102
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,040
What's so good about him?

103
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:39,870
It's pointless to beg me.

104
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,400
I'm just an errand boy.

105
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,950
I can't decide
whether he'll live or not.

106
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,750
I can only guarantee

107
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,520
that you can live here safely.

108
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,800
Untie her.

109
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,070
- Yes, Mr. Li.
- Yes, Mr. Li.

110
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,830
Don't try anything funny.

111
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,790
You won't be able to escape.

112
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:57,220
(Haidong Army)

113
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:06,990
Mr. Li.

114
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:07,750
What time is it?

115
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,830
It's 8:30 A.M.

116
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,030
Why are you still yawning?

117
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,390
I kept an eye on him the entire night.

118
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,040
Mr. Shen, how was last night?

119
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,710
You're forcing a conversation here.

120
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,040
Boring.

121
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,230
Yeah. I'm boring.

122
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,750
You're high and mighty.

123
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,950
You can keep this up.

124
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,830
I'll see how long you can keep this up.

125
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,200
Miss Mu,

126
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,800
what about today?

127
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,230
It's pointless

128
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,070
to drag this out.

129
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,350
Mr. Li,

130
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,650
we have to implement another plan

131
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,230
by tonight.

132
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,870
(I have to escape by tonight somehow.)

133
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:20,320
Hurry!

134
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,750
Superintendent, is Shen Zhiheng
going to show himself now?

135
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,470
Fire!

136
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,600
Stop!

137
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,190
Superintendent!

138
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,230
Superintendent...

139
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,200
Why are you shouting?

140
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,310
Don't come here.

141
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,160
Superintendent, hurry and capture him!

142
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,270
Superintendent, be careful!

143
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,380
(Serene Clouds and Clear Breeze)

144
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,920
Mr. Shen.

145
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,790
Hurry, examine him!

146
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:41,550
Yes, sir.

147
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,230
Is he even human?

148
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,990
I'm not sure either.

149
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,160
If he's not human, what is he?

150
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,400
Is he a demon?

151
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:58,030
Why would a demon establish
a newspaper firm?

152
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,840
There's only blood.

153
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,230
There are no wounds at all.

154
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,270
Check his vital signs.

155
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,600
Is there anyone else in his family?

156
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,310
Where are they?

157
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,510
I'm not sure either.

158
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,080
He lived in Beidu for a few years
17 years ago.

159
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,710
He left Beidu 14 years ago.

160
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,400
After that, no one knew where he went.

161
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,600
He only moved to Haidong
three years ago.

162
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:19,750
Something's off.

163
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,400
How old is he?

164
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,600
He must've been a child
over a decade ago.

165
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,400
Does he live alone?

166
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,750
This is what he always looked like.

167
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,270
He doesn't get old?

168
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,270
I'm not sure either.

169
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,840
He's mortally wounded.

170
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,550
Ordinary people

171
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,950
would've been dead by now.

172
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,440
That's right.

173
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,710
He doesn't feel pain either, right?

174
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,200
Since he can't be killed,

175
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,400
I'm sure he doesn't feel pain.

176
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:52,030
He's extremely quick and powerful.

177
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,600
Yes, he's very dangerous.

178
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,440
An ordinary youth

179
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:00,080
with an extraordinary body

180
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:03,120
cannot achieve his level

181
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,200
even after undergoing rigorous training.

182
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,230
If he's one of us,

183
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,880
or if our men are like him,

184
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:11,950
all of them

185
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:14,030
will be excellent soldiers
after undergoing training.

186
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:16,950
Superintendent...

187
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,440
Interrogate him when he's awake.

188
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,950
Let's see what information we can gain.

189
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,030
Yes, Superintendent.

190
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,230
I'm leaving now.

191
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,360
Interrogate him.

192
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,400
Yes. Let me see you off.

193
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,270
Mr. Shen, you're finally awake.

194
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,640
Do you know

195
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,400
what you looked like back then?

196
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,470
Even now, I couldn't believe

197
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,710
you used to be elegant and graceful.

198
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:31,790
Does it hurt?

199
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:33,920
I'm sorry.

200
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,600
I can't release you.

201
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,990
You were too frightening before this.

202
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,510
You killed plenty of our men.

203
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,640
We can't talk
if you don't stay in this state.

204
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,510
Go down there. See what he wants.

205
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,550
You want me to go down there?

206
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,550
Do you expect me to go, then?

207
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,920
Put the ladder down.

208
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,880
I'll cooperate with you.

209
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,310
What did you say?

210
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,360
I'll cooperate with you.

211
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:46,600
He said he wants you dead.

212
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,270
What?

213
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:58,990
