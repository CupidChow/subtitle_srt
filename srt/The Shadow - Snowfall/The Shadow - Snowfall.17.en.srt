(This drama is purely fictional.)

4
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,670
Mr. Shen.

5
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,000
Is this true?

6
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,640
Yes.

7
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,720
Initially, I thought Chi Shanying only
created pretexts to line his pockets.

8
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,000
Actually, he brandished his weapons
and committed robberies.

9
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,970
He's literally a bandit.

10
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,920
Contact all the newspaper firms in Haidong

11
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,870
and publish all of these.

12
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,510
Chi Shanying cares about
the public's opinions.

13
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,280
He would stop his actions
for the time being.

14
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,310
Alright.

15
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,710
I'll get to it immediately.

16
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,920
Mr. Shen, I know my fault now!

17
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,270
Please give me another chance!

18
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,560
I'll do anything you want me to!

19
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,920
Please give me another chance!

20
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,360
Don't beg me yet.

21
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,160
You should take a look at this.

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,640
Did you do this?

25
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,080
Yes, I did.

26
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,830
I went to your office.

27
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,200
I visited your house as well.

28
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,600
I took your bank book as well.

29
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,360
I don't understand at all.

30
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,710
Your entire fortune

31
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,760
is only the 18,000 yuan you kept
in Zhengjin Bank.

32
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,640
You rejected my offer
of one million yuan

33
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,880
back then.

34
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,880
I thought you were wealthy.

35
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,880
Is this how you're
taking revenge against me?

36
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,080
Now, the biggest issue

37
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,670
isn't about how I have to deal with you.

38
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,440
But these confidential files were spread
to the media through your hands.

39
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,270
And, you vanished for no reason.

40
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,040
What will Chi Shanying do to you?

41
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,270
Your future is already ruined.

42
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,790
Even if I don't kill you,
Chi Shanying will.

43
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,640
By the way,
I forgot to tell you something.

44
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,550
Your bank account
has been frozen as well.

45
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,920
Now, I've lost everything.

46
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,640
Don't worry.

47
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,550
You're safe here.

48
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,790
No one can find you.

49
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,830
You can stay here
and wait for your demise.

50
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,440

51
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,270

Take me with you!

00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,590
Don't leave! Take me with you!

Chi Shanying's criminal activities
have been exposed!

55
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,510
He amassed wealth unscrupulously!

56
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,200
Come.

57
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,440
Get your newspaper.

58
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:42,710
Alright.

59
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,640
Thank you.

60
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,120
You fool!

61
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,120
You idiot!

62
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,710
You can't even capture one person?

63
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,510
What are you waiting for?

64
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,980
You think I'm buying you a drink?

65
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,240
Go and arrest him!

66
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,880
Yes, sir!

67
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,940
What a fool.

68
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,840
Sheng? What are you doing here?

69
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,020
Tao, I'm looking for Miss Jin.

70
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,540
Sheng, Miss Jin is here.

71
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,560
Li Guisheng, what are you
doing here this late at night?

72
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,680
Miss Jin.

73
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,000
Did you get beaten up again?

74
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,510
It's not about me.

75
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,880
We're in huge trouble.

76
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,390
Take a look.

77
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,270
The newspaper states that Mr. Li disclosed
Haidong Army's confidential files.

78
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,150
Now, Superintendent Chi wants to arrest him
and the related individuals.

79
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,510
I'm risking my life here
to seek you out.

80
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,150
Now, you're the only person
who can save him.

81
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,680
Liang must've lost his mind.

82
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,630
He betrayed Haidong Army in public.

83
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,800
Chi Shanying would never let him off.

84
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,470
I'm sure Mr. Li didn't do this.

85
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,360
Mr. Li wanted to return to his position
after being suspended.

86
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,150
Why would he betray Superintendent Chi?

87
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:42,240
And...

88
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,190
And, Mr. Li
has been missing for three days.

89
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,070
Did you say Li went missing?

90
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,800
But I saw him just three days ago.

91
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,440
That day,

92
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:53,390
I saw you and Situ Weilian

93
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,510
exiting the cafe.

94
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,290
I was waiting for him in the car.
But...

95
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,200
I fell asleep.

96
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,930
He was gone
when I went inside to find him.

97
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,360
The waiter said
he left with another man.

98
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,390
Are you saying that Liang was kidnapped?

99
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,760
I think that's likely.

100
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,830
Liang has plenty of enemies.

101
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,240
Who would kidnap him?

102
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,390
Shen Zhiheng.

103
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,880
Liang was terrified of him before this.

104
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,200
He went missing out of the blue.

105
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,560
I'm sure Shen Zhiheng threatened him.

106
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,070
After that, he kidnapped him.

107
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,560
I'll find Shen Zhiheng right now.

108
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,030
Tao, help me to get changed.

109
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:27,760
Miss Jin.

110
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,150
I think we shouldn't be impulsive.

111
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,070
We're not sure whether Shen Zhiheng
was the one who kidnapped him.

112
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,120
And, you don't understand
what Shen Zhiheng is capable of.

113
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,590
Who said so?

114
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,070
Although he's influential,

115
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,070
the Jin Family
is pretty capable as well.

116
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:41,880
Miss Jin,

117
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,120
Shen Zhiheng isn't an ordinary human.

118
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,800
But you do have a point as well.

119
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,270
Why don't I make a call
and inquire about it first?

120
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,630
Hello?

121
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,390
Hello, I'm Jin Jingxue.

122
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,030
Tell Shen Zhiheng to pick up the phone.

123
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,320
He's not home.

124
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,880
Who are you?

125
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,200
I'm his...

126
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,630
Younger sister.

127
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,880
Younger sister?

128
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,630
Fine. Relay my message to him.

129
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,560
Tell him to call me immediately
once he's back.

130
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,150
I need to speak with him urgently.

131
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,440
If he doesn't call me back tonight,

132
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,760
don't blame me for visiting him
in person tomorrow.

133
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,000
Alright.

134
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,830
His younger sister
answered the call just now.

135
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,230
He still has kin?

136
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,070
Hello?

137
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,440
Hello?

138
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,320
Are you his younger sister?

139
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,640
Jin Jingxue, it's you again?

140
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,440
You better listen closely.

141
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,160
This concerns
the survival of an individual.

142
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,750
You have to relay the message to him.

143
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,680
If anything goes wrong,

144
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,950
I'll blame him for everything.

145
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,230
Miss Jin,

146
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:20,440
I can rest at ease now that
I know you can rescue Mr. Li.

147
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,280
I shall take my leave
to avoid to cause you any trouble.

148
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,350
I'll make a move first.

149
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,680
Tao, go and see him off.

150
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,470
Sheng, take care.

151
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,040
It's cold here. Go inside.

152
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:04,830
Don't move!

153
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,400
Come!

154
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,200
Hurry!

155
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:13,470
Go inside!

156
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,560
Mi Lan.

157
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,800
Mr. Shen.

158
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,560
Someone named Jin Jingxue called you
just now and asked you to call her back.

159
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,590
Jin Jingxue?

160
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,710
Why would she call me?

161
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,560
She said she had something urgent

162
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,480
that concerned the survival
to discuss with you.

163
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,640
She was very rude.

164
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,520
If so, let's ignore her.

165
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,870
I'll take you to
the new department store tomorrow.

166
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,920
Alright.

167
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:54,800
Let's go.

168
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,950
Look at what he did outside.

169
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,110
Look at what he has done.

170
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,440
You kept saying that we should
let Mr. Li come back all the time.

171
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,340
But now? He has landed
the Jin Family in trouble.

172
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,320
Second Uncle,

173
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,320
you shouldn't believe in such rumors.

174
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,560
Not all news is true, you know?

175
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:14,830
None of them are accurate.

176
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,520
Even if I believe that they're rumors,

177
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,160
do you know what other people
are saying about our family?

178
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,110
What did they say?

179
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,200
All those business owners
bullied by Li Yingliang,

180
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,990
with Wang Tieshan as their leader,

181
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,750
heard that Li Yingliang fell from power,

182
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,040
they rushed to the entrance
of the association

183
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,590
and demanded mental damage compensation.

184
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,590
And, we have to pay them.

185
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,110
Do you think we can afford that?

186
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,640
So what do you think we should do?

187
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,110
We should issue a notice.

188
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,830
We have to say that the Jin family
has no ties with Li Yingliang.

189
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,680
Although this is painful,
we have to do it to survive.

190
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,440
To protect the Jin family,

191
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:49,950
this is our only choice.

192
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,260
I'll never agree to that!

193
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,160
What exactly are you thinking?

194
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,870
Li Yingliang has already landed us

195
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:56,990
in huge trouble!

196
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:57,680
But you...

197
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,160
You're still defending him?

198
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,990
Don't you think
you're crossing the line here?

199
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,160
I'll fork out the compensation.

200
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,950
If someone demands an exorbitant price,
don't have to be polite.

201
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,230
Just chase them out with sticks.

202
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,160
As for the rest...

203
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:12,990
Second Uncle,

204
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,040
if Liang did commit a mistake,

205
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,800
he has to bear the consequences.

206
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,280
You guys can criticize all you like.

207
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,750
But I'll never agree to it

208
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,400
if anyone dares to say

209
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,190
that he has no ties with the Jin family.

210
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,580
Because he saved my life before.

211
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,750
Tao, see our guest off.

212
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,920
Jingxue!

213
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,110
You're going your own way!

214
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:39,070
If you keep this up,
the Jin Family will be ruined!

215
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,280
Second Master.

216
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,350
Please.

217
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,040
Please, my foot!

218
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,920
Their bodies are too weak.

219
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,680
They can't withstand
the Shadow Warrior's training regiment.

220
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,590
All of the borrowed soldiers are dead.

221
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,070
Remove their bodies.

222
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,040
Yes, ma'am.

223
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,880
Haidong has been quite lively lately.

224
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,870
Miss Mu, are you trying

225
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,710
to hold me accountable
with your sudden visit?

226
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,070
Superintendent Chi, I heard
that you got yourself in trouble lately.

227
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,280
I came here just to help you out.

228
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,400
Miss Mu,

229
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,070
what else can you do for me?

230
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,280
Some time ago, the clan leader
of the Mu Family

231
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,680
asked me if everything was

232
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,070
progressing smoothly here.

233
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,160
I said that you treated me

234
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,400
in a pleasant way.

235
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,320
However, I've encountered trouble

236
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,880
during training.

237
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,800
Therefore, I have no choice
but to come and trouble you...

238
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,750
Miss Mu,

239
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,350
stop beating around the bush.

240
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,230
Cut to the chase.

241
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,400
I'm here to borrow some troops.

242
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,750
I just lent you six troops
five days ago.

243
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,320
They were useless.

244
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,160
I called my elder brother, the clan leader,

245
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,710
I told him about
the progress of our training.

246
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,870
He was very interested.

247
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,830
But when I mentioned you,

248
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,520
his tone changed immediately.

249
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,800
I felt like he wasn't willing
to talk about you.

250
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,800
Wu Zhongyi.

251
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,230
Yes, sir!

252
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,350
Give her all my guards.

253
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:16,750
But you see,

254
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,160
Miss Mu,

255
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,350
I can borrow you my troops

256
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,320
only if you speak up for me

257
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,160
in front of your elder brother.

258
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,680
There are some things
I need to explain to him in person.

259
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,800
Of course.

260
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,440
I promise I'll relay your message

261
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,800
as long as you keep supporting me.

262
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,400
Miss Mu, please.

263
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,920
It's not like I'm a rat.

264
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,200
Does she think I can give birth
to a platoon whenever I like?

265
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,750
(Yong'an Department Store)
Newspaper for sale.

266
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,110
Madam, what about a newspaper?

267
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,320
Sure. I'll buy one.

268
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,680
Mister, you should buy one too.

269
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:10,830
Alright. Give me one.

270
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,520
Come.

271
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,040
Let's go.

272
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,710
Newspaper for sale!

273
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,320
Are you sure this is Shen Zhiheng's car?

274
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,040
Yeah, it's his.

275
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,320
I drive it often.

276
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,830
Mr. Shen, what a coincidence.

277
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,350
I didn't expect to see you here.

278
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,180
Are you sure it's a coincidence?

279
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,950
You answered the call, right?

280
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:00,470
If so, I assume your younger sister

281
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,950
has relayed my message to you.

282
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,240
That's right.

283
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,080
Miss Jin, what's so urgent
that you need to find me personally?

284
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,190
Naturally, it's related to Li Yingliang.

285
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,910
He's been missing for some time.

286
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,590
Did you kidnap him?

287
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:16,240
Miss Jin, what kind
of ridiculous question was that?

288
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,080
I'm just an ordinary businessman.

289
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,430
I'll be grateful to Mr. Li as long
as he doesn't cause trouble for me.

290
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,110
Why would I be daring enough
to kidnap him?

291
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,320
I'm not a bandit.

292
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,240
Stop pretending.

293
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:27,840
If this has

294
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,000
nothing to do with you,

295
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,800
why would I be here?

296
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,960
Since I'm here, that means
I have evidence of your crime.

297
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,830
Now, I don't want

298
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:36,960
to waste my breath on you.

299
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:40,830
Let's end this quick.

300
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,910
Give me your offer.

301
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,800
How much does it take to release him?

302
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:44,960
What are you doing?

303
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,670
What have you bought?

304
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,590
Here.

305
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,990
There are plenty of gifts, huh?

306
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,800
Miss Jin,

307
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,480
this isn't about money.

308
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,830
Mr. Shen, if you still
have other concerns,

309
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,490
I'll give you my guarantee
under the Jin Family's name

310
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,430
that Li Yingliang

311
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,390
will never pester you in the future.

312
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,390
Miss Jin, you should stop joking around.

313
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,670
I've heard about Mr. Li's disappearance.

314
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,430
Now, he's missing.

315
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,480
Maybe Chi Shanying already silenced him.

316
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,720
Why don't you ask Chi Shanying about it?

317
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,430
Maybe he'll know something.

318
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,560
Where is Liang?

319
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,240
Miss Jin!

320
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,180
Give him back!

321
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:30,870
Jingxue!

322
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,430
Jingxue!

323
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,190
What are you doing?

324
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,300
Stop fighting!

325
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,630
Jingxue!

326
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:40,350
Miss Jin!

327
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,150
Stop fighting!

328
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:42,800
Miss Jin!

329
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:43,760
Stop her!

330
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,150
Are you done?

331
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,320
Shen Zhiheng, how dare you drag her?

332
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,800
Don't try to be biased!

333
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:51,520
Let go!

334
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,480
You let go!

335
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,190
Jingxue!

336
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:55,960
How dare you?

337
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,490
Stop.

338
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,560
Isn't that Mr. Shen?

339
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,320
Mr. Shen?

340
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,590
Why are they still fighting?

341
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,760
How dare you tug my braid?

342
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,630
- Brat, how dare you tug my braid?
-  Heng, I know my fault now!

343
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,820
Really? Don't ever do it again.

344
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,180
Hello, is this the police station?

345
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,250
Please send your men here.

346
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,080
There's a fight in front
of Yong'an Store.

347
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,910
That's right. Yong'an Department Store.

348
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,800
Miss Jin.

349
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,430
Li Yingliang has offended Chi Shanying.

350
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,000
Even if he appears now,

351
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,430
Chi Shanying won't let him off.

352
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,040
Therefore, it's better for him
to remain hidden.

353
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:54,280
Maybe he'll appear in front of you

354
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,630
after the dust has settled.

355
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,190
I'll apologize to you
on Mi Lan's behalf.

356
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,180
I'll tell my men to deliver
the medical fee to your home.

357
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,790
Please forgive her for being insensible.

358
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,350
She should've gone easy on you.

359
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,430
Apologize to her.

360
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,090
The Shen Family accepts education indeed.

361
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,790
You're even apologizing
on her behalf.

362
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,190
Forget about the medical fee.

363
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,080
I'm wealthy.

364
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,480
Jingxue, just ignore them.

365
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,670
I'll send you to the hospital.

366
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,000
Now, I can tell that you're a doctor.

367
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,980
You only want to
send me to the hospital.

368
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,870
No thanks.

369
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,110
I'm not a frail woman.

370
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,390
I'm just like you guys.

371
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,430
I'm not a sore loser.

372
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,240
Don't worry. She's just a little girl.

373
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,630
She's not strong enough to hurt me.

374
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,480
Jingxue, are you okay?

375
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:46,670
Fine.

376
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,830
I won't send you to the hospital.

377
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,870
I'll send you home.

378
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,520
Why did you lose your temper

379
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,720
and hit her?

380
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,720
I thought she injured you.

381
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,040
I'm not afraid of getting injured.

382
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,520
But you'll still feel the pain.

383
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,190
So what?

384
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,280
Do you think you're very capable now?

385
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,590
Is that why you're fearless?

386
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,780
That's not it.

387
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,910
How dare you talk back to me?

388
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,320
By hitting you, she's also hitting me.

389
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,240
You are me.

390
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,720
I've been abused for many years.

391
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,320
I don't want to get beaten up again.

392
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,630
Does it hurt?

393
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,430
I can tolerate pain.

Of course.

398

No.

Where are we going?

407
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,240

Miss Jin, what happened?

00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:13,590
Jingxue!

421
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,350
Close the gate.

422
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:17,760
Don't be angry at me, okay?

423
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,000
I finished it.

424
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,390
Alright.

425
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,110

00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:34,190

00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:34,870
No.

428
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,000
Alright.

429
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,190
Shen Zhiheng! Mi Lan!

430
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,430
You two are truly something else!

431
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,560
Mi Lan,

432
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,560
you're something else.

433
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,230
Not only did you not repay me
for saving you,

434
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,590
but you also beat my girlfriend up.

435
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,870
Shen Zhiheng,
you're something else as well.

436
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,590
You actually tried
to kill your brother.

437
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,110
I'm sorry.

438
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,720
I don't deserve
a younger brother like you.

439
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,150
What are you doing here?

440
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,190
Collect a ticket?

441
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,960
You better stop your nonsense.

442
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,190
It depends on my mood.

443
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:11,110
I'll give you a chance to apologize.

444
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,240
I need you to do me a small favor.

445
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,930
Of course, you can decide
whether you want to help me or not.

446
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,910
I won't force you.

447
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,590
Tell me about it.

448
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,760
Can you release Li Yingliang?

449
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,970
Don't try to hide it from me.

450
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:33,560
Although Jingxue has a fiery temper,
she's not dumb.

451
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,870
Since she was looking for you,
I'm sure she had evidence.

452
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,520
Actually, I'm fine with no matter how
you intend to deal with Li Yingliang.

453
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,240
He did kidnap me after all.

454
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,430
But Jingxue is paying
too much attention to him.

455
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,360
If she doesn't find him now,
I'm afraid she'll fall in love with him.

456
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,240
What kind of logic is that?

457
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:50,720
Say,

458
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,390
you've lived for a hundred years.

459
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,090
Have you never been
in a relationship before?

460
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:58,040
If Li Yingliang is safe,

461
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,770
Jingxue won't realize
how much attention she's paying to him.

462
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,150
If so, I'll still stand a chance.

463
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,760
But now, Li Yingliang is missing.

464
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,910
Jingxue is passionate
and straightforward.

465
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,910
She might devote herself to finding him.

466
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,000
By then,

467
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,110
I, as her admirer,

468
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,480
will stand no chance at all.

469
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,520
You know

470
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,980
that she fancies Li Yingliang,

471
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,480
yet you're still trying to court her.

472
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,000
Aren't you deceiving yourself here?

473
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,110
It's fine.

474
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:20,910
I don't care.

475
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,830
What about this?

476
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,080
I'll give you a simple solution.

477
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,630
You always wanted a slave, didn't you?

478
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,320
Why don't you turn her
into one of us?

479
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,590
This way, she won't
be able to leave you.

480
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,560
Miss Jin is beautiful,

481
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,670
rich, and the person you fancy.

482
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,190
Isn't it great
to serve you for the rest of your life?

483
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,630
I knew you had never been
in a relationship before.

484
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,080
You're a novice indeed.

485
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,720
I only love her.

486
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,000
Why are you talking about
the rest of my life here?

487
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,560
There are moments when I love her

488
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,280
and there are moments when I don't.

489
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,670
If I have to spend time with her

490
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,110
when I no longer love her,

491
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,350
doesn't that make

492
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,520
both of us uncomfortable?

493
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,350
I'll be harming her and myself.

494
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,080
I won't commit

495
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,080
such a despicable deed.

496
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:02,040
I thought you truly loved her.

497
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,590
I truly love her.

498
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,280
But true love

499
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:08,080
cannot be measured with time.

500
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,910
True love doesn't mean you have to
stay with each other until the end of time.

501
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,910
True love comes from one's soul.

502
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,690
It's a desire from the heart that makes
one treats the other well.

503
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,000
That's true love.

504
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,320
Seems like you didn't live
the past century in vain.

505
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,320
You still couldn't avoid
the worldly desires of humans.

506
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,670
Unlike me, I'm born pure.

507
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,720
Sorry for the offense, then.

508
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,960
Born pure, huh?

509
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:39,720
So,

510
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,000
are you willing to release Li Yingliang

511
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,040
to fulfill my wish?

512
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,670
Heng.

513
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:47,870

That's right.

526
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,760
I thought you forgot about me.

527
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,240
I never expected you to remember me.

528

Don't tell me you hunted me relentlessly

just because I forgot about you?

530
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:48,110
Back then, I thought
you were a good guy.

531
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,480
I entrusted my life and my sister's life to you.

532
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,800
But you?

533
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,430
You ran away.

534
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,350
Your sister?

535
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,000
That's right.

536
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,110
Is she dead?

537
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:08,910
She died.

538
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,520
And it's all
because you didn't save her!

539
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:17,320
This is bad! The bandits are here!

540
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:18,630
Run!

541
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,590
The bandits are here!

542
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:25,430
This is bad! My sister isn't here!

543
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,150
Run!

544
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,760
Boss, we couldn't find that traitor.

545
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:09,980
Let's go.

546
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,390
Let's go!

00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,240

548
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,080
Don't come here!

549
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,870
Mr. Shen, I'm Liang.

550
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:32,390
My sister is bleeding profusely!

551
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,870
Can you please save her?

552
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,670
Mr. Shen, I'm begging you!

553
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,000
Please save her!

554
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,720
Mr. Shen, I'm begging you!

555
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,520
Please save her!

556
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,590
Mr. Shen!

557
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,320
Mr. Shen, please save my sister!

558
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,670
Mr. Shen!

559
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,830
The bandits launched a sudden attack.

560
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,720
I couldn't save all of them.

561
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,830
The floor was filled with blood.

562
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,480
I almost lost control.

563
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:59,560
If she came close to me,

564
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,590
she would've been harmed.

565
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:05,110
You saw what I looked like
in the underground cell.

566
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,630
Times have changed.

567
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,190
Of course you can say whatever you like.

568
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,910
After that, I went back.

569
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,190
It was more than just
the Longchun Opera Troupe.

570
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:18,110
The entire Beidu
was littered with corpses.

571
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,000
Li Yingliang, you need to know

572
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,870
that your sister died

573
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,320
because of the dark and turbulent world.

574
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,430
It wasn't my fault.

575
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,350
If you insist on
blaming her death on me,

576
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,190
that can only prove that you're weak.

577
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,760
If you can't get over her death,

578
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,800
you should do some good deeds

579
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,320
and make the world a better place

580
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,430
to prevent the same thing
from happening.

581
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,150
You shouldn't follow Chi Shanying

582
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,830
and continue committing
all those atrocious deeds.

583
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,350
Mr. Shen,

584
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,190
I know my fault now.

585
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,830
Please release me.

586
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,350
I'll never follow Chi Shanying

587
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,480
once I leave this place.

588
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:02,830
I'll follow you.

589
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,150
I'll do kind deeds
and accumulate good karma.

590
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,590
Mr. Shen.

591
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,390
I know my fault now.

592
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,080
In the end,

593
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:00,430
the feud between us

594
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,560
was caused by your inner demon.

595
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,830
Seems like you haven't
reflected upon your actions.

596
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,320
Shen Zhiheng!

597
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,670
Shen Zhiheng!

598
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,320
Let me out!

599
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:17,320
Mr. Shen!

Mr. Shen, I know my fault now!

601
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,430
Let me out!

602
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,520
Shen Zhiheng!

603
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:27,960
