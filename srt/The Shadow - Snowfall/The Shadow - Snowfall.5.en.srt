3
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,040
(This drama is purely fictional.)

4
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,150
Good morning, Jingxue.

5
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,770
Where are you going?
Let me give you a lift.

6
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,510
Liang.

7
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,440
Hi.

8
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,510
The patient who was here,

9
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,230
where is he now?

10
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,760
This patient has been discharged.

11
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,040
Discharged?

12
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,440
Yeah, he's long gone.

13
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,010
You're avoiding me, aren't you?

14
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,200
I can still find you at your house.

15
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,350
Stop following me.

16
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,440
Miss Jin.

17
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,670
Yes, it's her.

18
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,280
Why is Miss Jin here
on such a snowy day?

19
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,560
Miss, give me some food.

20
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,320
Miss.

21
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,830
Mister, give me some food.

22
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,630
Do you dislike me so much?

23
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,450
You always shun me
like guarding against a thief.

24
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,910
Please give me some food.

25
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:29,070
Miss, give me some food.

26
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,670
Thank you, Miss.

27
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,440
Mister, be careful.

28
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:57,830
This way, please.

29
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,680
Mister, what would you like to order?

30
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,680
I'll order later.

31
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,390
Okay. Call me if you need anything.

32
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,590
Is there a beautiful lady over there?

33
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,150
How do you know
there's a beautiful lady

34
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,120
if you can't see anything?

35
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,070
You smell like Chinese violet.

36
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,150
You sound like
you should be very beautiful.

37
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,440
I'm ugly.

38
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,830
You're blind.

39
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:51,800
You're right.

40
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,680
I can't see your beauty now.

41
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,760
I feel so bad.

42
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,560
Is it true you're blind?

43
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,150
Yes, Jingxue.

44
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,350
There's something

45
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,470
really wrong with my eyes.

46
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,000
Who are you kidding?

47
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,590
What are you doing?

48
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,950
I'm trying to cheer you up.

49
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:24,910
How's it?

50
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,440
Are you feeling better?

51
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:28,800
Silly.

52
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,690
Come with me to the theater.

53
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,270
Okay, let's go.

54
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,320
What are you doing?

55
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,350
What are you eating snow for?

56
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,910
I'm cured.

57
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,470
Do you want to go home?

58
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:08,680
No.

59
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,350
But you can't keep me here forever.

60
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,560
I know you don't want to go home,

61
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,910
but you can't take your health
for granted.

62
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,150
Do you feel good about being sick again

63
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,030
and taking medication every day?

64
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,140
Don't worry.

65
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:42,460
I'm not leaving
until I've saved your life.

66
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,150
Promise?

67
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:55,950
Promise.

68
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,200
I thought you were going
to the theater to see the movies.

69
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,280
But it turned out to be a real theater.

70
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But you don't seem like

71
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,830
that you would take up such a hobby.

72
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,250
You can't judge a book by its cover.

73
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,080
And he likes it.

74
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,560
He used to sing me opera.

75
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,830
He?

76
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,470
Is he the one who pissed you off?

77
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,270
Who is he?

78
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,040
(He's my father's apprentice.)

79
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,560
(I loved teasing him since I was a kid.)

80
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,080
Miss Jin.

81
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,080
Liang, eat up.

82
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,470
I dare not. Your father will beat me up.

83
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,350
- (But he always put up with me.)
- Come on.

84
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,110
(He never refused my requests.)

85
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,710
(If he hadn't saved my life,)

86
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,040
- Liang.
- (I'd be dead.)

87
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,680
Have an orange.

88
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:04,470
Miss Jin!

89
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:05,280
Miss Jin!

90
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,950
Liang!

91
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,230
Liang, I'm scared.

92
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,870
Miss Jin!

93
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,520
Liang.

94
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,990
Watch out!

95
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,230
Liang.

96
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,320
He's got a bad reputation,

97
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:39,710
but it's not like
it's a shame that I like him.

98
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,710
So you went to the hospital
to visit him?

99
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,990
But you have everything you need,

100
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,320
so why bother liking someone
who doesn't like you?

101
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,350
I know he doesn't like me.

102
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,560
We grew up as childhood friends,

103
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,040
but he'll never call me anything
but Miss Jin.

104
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,080
He's only polite and distant to me.

105
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,990
But he's destined
to be a member of our Jin family.

106
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,870
Situ, thank you.

107
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,280
I feel much better now.

108
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,680
I had a good day, too.

109
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,400
I'll be going then.

110
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:24,830
Jingxue.

111
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,440
Can we be friends first?

112
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,560
If you don't want me to court you,

113
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,590
I can agree,
but I really like talking to you.

114
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,800
I don't really have many friends,

115
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,110
but you're someone I really want
to make friends with.

116
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,400
Situ, you're very kind.

117
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,110
I've accepted you as a friend.

118
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,470
I'm very serious this time.

119
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,160
Would you take the flowers
if I gave them to you?

120
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,950
It's been here all day
and it's not fresh now.

121
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:58,590
Tomorrow...

122
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,380
I'll give you a bouquet
of the fresh flowers.

123
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,160
I'll only take this one.

124
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,080
Thank you.

125
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,280
(Two people who were never related)

126
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,800
(suddenly became so close.)

127
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,950
(They're neither old acquaintances
nor in love now.)

128
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,400
(What has happened?)

129
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,680
Miss Mi, why are you walking alone
in the middle of the night?

130
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,750
And this wound on your face...

131
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:01,920
I...

132
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,590
Mom hit me

133
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,560
and I ran out in a hurry.

134
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,830
(Shen Zhiheng went to Mi Mansion
two days ago with a generous gift.)

135
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,800
(Not long after,)

136
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,630
he carried Miss Mi out

137
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:16,750
to Keats Hospital.

138
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,710
What's his relationship with Miss Mi?

139
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,200
(I'm still watching.)

140
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,920
(But I can tell he cares about Miss Mi.)

141
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,320
I got it.

142
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,470
He's not in love with her.

143
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,920
He's in debt to her.

144
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,160
Sheng.

145
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,590
Mr. Li.

146
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:09,920
I can't hold back any longer.

147
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:19,380
(Keats Hospital)

148
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,230
Mr. Li,

149
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:33,320
Shen Zhiheng is in the hospital.

150
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,300
- I'll go in and get rid of him.
- Wait.

151
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:42,520
When will we take action?

152
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:43,590
Take action, my foot.

153
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,750
I'm going to him to make peace.

154
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,680
Shen, Mi Lan's discharge is complete.

155
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,040
Weilian.

156
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,020
I've been meaning to ask you a question.

157
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,200
What question?

158
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,990
Why weren't you scared
when you first met me?

159
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:54,870
You've got good teeth.

160
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,920
But that chicken was raised
in our hospital.

161
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,590
You'll have to pay for it.

162
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,830
No, Shen.

163
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,080
I'm not the only one
who's not scared of you.

164
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,590
Your little benefactor, Mi Lan,
wasn't scared either.

165
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,990
Remember that in a few years,

166
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,320
you can marry Mi Lan.

167
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,710
So she can escape from her mother.

168
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,040
What are you talking about?

169
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,690
Are you trying to scare her
to death by me

170
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,350
because you think she'll live too long?

171
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,280
She may not be scared to death.

172
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,470
Look at me, I'm alive and well.

173
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:28,830
Speaking of Mi Lan,

174
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,630
I'm afraid she'll be

175
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,480
in the same situation
when she returns home.

176
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,680
She can't stay in the attic all day.

177
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,230
She needs to go out

178
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,080
and meet people her own age.

179
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:46,140
(Keats Hospital)

180
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,040
Slow down.

181
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:59,830
Miss Mi.

182
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,560
Are you Miss Mi?

183
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,180
Seeing you from a distance,
I thought it was you.

184
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,910
I was afraid to recognize you.

185
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,350
Luckily, I have good eyes.

186
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,870
You're really Miss Mi.

187
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,800
Miss Mi, you probably don't remember me.

188
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,660
- I am...
- Uncle Li.

189
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,480
How do you know who I am?

190
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,870
I remember your voice.

191
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,430
Why are you here alone?

192
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:24,910
Are you sick?

193
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,960
But I am discharged today.

194
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,430
Mr. Shen?

195
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:37,930
What a coincidence.

196
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,280
We meet again.

197
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:43,520
Mr. Shen, have you completed
the procedures?

198
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,910
Uncle Li, thank you
for taking me home last time.

199
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,080
I'll be going now. Bye.

200
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,150
Aren't you scared to see me?

201
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:24,800
Mr. Shen, you must be joking.

202
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,000
Of course not.

203
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:30,670
Then why are you shaking?

204
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,800
It's cold, and the suitcase is heavy.

205
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,670
Please take care, Mr. Li.

206
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,690
I have some business to attend to,
so I'll take my leave.

207
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,390
Wait a minute.

208
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,870
I almost died at your hands last time.

209
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,720
This time, I've come alone to see you

210
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,800
because I don't mean you any harm.

211
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,320
But I do.

212
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:55,830
Mr. Li,

213
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:59,520
we're supposed
to stay out of each other's way.

214
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,480
From now on,

215
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,150
we can still stay out
of each other's way.

216
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,190
Otherwise...

217
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,190
I can do anything you can think of.

218
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,630
Are you all right?

219
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,380
When have you ever been
treated like this?

220
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:53,320
In my opinion,

221
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,390
we should just get rid of him.

222
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,060
All you know is to get rid of him.

223
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,760
Let's go.

224
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,760
Do you have a grudge against Uncle Li?

225
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,110
Uncle Li?

226
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,390
How did you know him?

227
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,240
I met him on my way back
the night I saved you.

228
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,910
He was the one who sent me home.

229
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,430
I have a grudge against him.

230
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,960
He's the one
who tried to kill me that night.

231
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:51,830
Aren't you scared?

232
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:56,960
He tried to kill you before I met you.

233
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,490
It had nothing to do with me.

234
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,150
Now that I know you,

235
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,670
I won't let him hurt you again.

236
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,560
You're so brave.

237
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,000
Thank you for protecting me,
my little benefactor.

238
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,870
By the way,
I enrolled you in a choir class.

239
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,390
In a few days, I'll take you
to meet friends your own age.

240
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:24,720
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

241
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,380
(Mi Mansion)

242
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,960
Madam, Miss Mi is back.

243
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,670
Thank you.

244
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,960
Come on, Miss Mi, let's go upstairs.

245
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,240
Come on, be careful.

246
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,320
Be careful.

247
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,000
Be careful.

248
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,870
Mr. Shen,

249
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,430
if you hadn't sent me letters
every now and then,

250
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,430
I'd have thought
you'd abducted my daughter.

251
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,110
Mrs. Mi.

252
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,040
There's something I've been wanting
to say for a long time.

253
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:14,430
Go ahead.

254
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:17,060
It is a sin for parents not to raise their children,

255
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,240
and a shame not to teach them well.

256
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,560
Mi Lan may be your daughter,

257
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,190
but she's more of a person.

258
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,960
You shouldn't just hit or scold her
when you feel like it.

259
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,110
Parents love their children.

260
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,910
Even animals know how to love
and protect their children.

261
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,110
But you don't know that.

262
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,000
Who made such hot tea?

263
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,910
That's all I have to say.

264
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:48,000
If you don't listen to advice,

265
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,000
my paper won't just expose Chi Shanying.

266
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:54,520
I've heard about the conflict
between you and Mr. Mi.

267
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,040
But I don't think

268
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,830
Mr. Mi wants his family's scandal
to be in the papers.

269
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:06,830
Shen Zhiheng,

270
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:11,110
who are you to lecture me?

271
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,520
Mi Lan.

272
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,390
Mi Lan!

273
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,590
Miss Mi...

274
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,720
How dare you rebel, you little brat?

275
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:38,620
Don't think you're so great just
because you have Shen Zhiheng's backing.

276
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,380
I'll teach you a lesson
when you come out.

277
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,390
Open the door!

278
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,190
Open!

279
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,390
How dare you hide in there?

280
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,190
Come out if you're good.

281
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,750
Don't think I can't do anything about you
just because you're quiet inside.

282
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,690
You'll have to come out, anyway.
Open the door!

283
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,350
Open.

284
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:53,670
Open it.

285
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,240
Fine.

286
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,630
Just you wait.

287
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,760
Both of you, act fast.

288
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,280
Protect the roots.

289
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,830
Don't let them freeze in the snow.

290
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,390
And you guys, be quick.

291
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,390
Where are you going, blind girl?

292
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:30,000
Do you think you can be arrogant
in front of me

293
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,720
because you have Shen Zhiheng's backing?

294
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,870
He invited you because he pitied you
for being blind.

295
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,240
Do you take it seriously?

296
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,150
I'm talking to you, can you hear me?

297
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,720
Not only are you blind,
you're deaf, right?

298
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,080
Don't play pathetic with me.

299
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,520
You brought this on yourself.

300
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,240
Look at you, why are you so careless?

301
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,320
Come on.

302
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,520
Go, go.

303
00:24:59,240 --> 00:24:59,870
Just go.

304
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,430
I'll wait for you to come back.

305
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,760
Mi Lan.

306
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,910
Mr. Shen.

307
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,320
Are you okay?

308
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,320
Hi, Mr. Shen.

309
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,560
Hi, Ms. Zhang.

310
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:04,960
Go.

311
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,280
Go in.

312
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,000
I'll pick you up when it's over.

313
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,590
Leave her to me. Don't worry.

314
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,480
Thank you.

315
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,820
Superintendent Chi,
this is all the information

316
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,390
I've compiled about Shen Zhiheng lately.

317
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,190
Please take a look.

318
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:36,190
Superintendent Chi,
Shen Zhiheng is too mysterious.

319
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,490
He never goes to a party
or a ballroom with a girl.

320
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,480
(He doesn't go to brothels,)

321
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,670
(doesn't love celebrities,)

322
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:43,630
(doesn't have a wife)

323
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,350
(and he doesn't even have a maid.)

324
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,670
(He's like a monk.)

325
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,040
(He doesn't get close to women.)

326
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,760
(And he never takes pictures.)

327
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,080
(He doesn't have a servant
or a bodyguard.)

328
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:00,670
(All his servants leave
when it gets dark.)

329
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:02,960
(I would say,)

330
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,960
(he's distant from everyone,)

331
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,190
except for a doctor named Situ Weilian,

332
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,000
but their relationship is ordinary.

333
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:12,960
Situ Weilian has been spending
a lot of money

334
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,590
on courting a woman lately.

335
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,760
Jingxue.

336
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:34,280
You told me
that Shen Zhiheng was shot twice,

337
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,560
but he didn't die
and killed two of your men, didn't you?

338
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,590
Yes.

339
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,910
Machine gun fired and the car crushed him.

340
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:42,590
Yes.

341
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,720
But ten days later,
he showed up at the party,

342
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,080
- not looking sick at all.
- And looking very fit.

343
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:53,240
He was pretty skilled
when he attacked you.

344
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:53,960
Yes.

345
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,000
It was so fast
I didn't even see it clearly.

346
00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:00,190
He's a mysterious man,
and he's a good fighter.

347
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,560
Is he a great master?

348
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:02,480
Superintendent Chi,

349
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,520
he publishes newspapers
and does charity work,

350
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,630
does he look like a great master?

351
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,320
If he's not a great master,

352
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,320
what else could he be?

353
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,380
Seems there's something sinister in it.

354
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,220
You've got to keep an eye on him.

355
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,280
Not a moment to lose.

356
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,000
Yes, Sir.

357
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,910
I'll claim the credit for you by then.

358
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,670
Yes. I'll do my best to investigate him.

359
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,560
Your coffee.

360
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,350
Please enjoy.

361
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:38,800
Drink something hot.

362
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,240
Uncle Li, is there something

363
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:46,240
you want from me?

364
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:49,760
I just happened to pass by the school
and bumped into you.

365
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,910
It's about Mr. Shen, isn't it?

366
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,480
You're so smart.

367
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,350
Then I'll be blunt.

368
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:02,670
Last time at the hospital,
you probably heard

369
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,620
that Mr. Shen and I had
a big misunderstanding.

370
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,960
I want to make peace with him.

371
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,390
But he won't give me the chance.

372
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,910
So I'd like you
to pass on a message to him for me

373
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,480
and mediate between us.

374
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:15,150
Of course, whether it works or not,

375
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,960
I'll reward you heavily.

376
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,350
Okay.

377
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,190
And you just said yes?

378
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,430
You mustn't lie to me.

379
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,240
I won't lie to you.

380
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:36,960
But I'd like to ask you a question as well.

381
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,080
Okay, go ahead.

382
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:40,960
Am I...

383
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,480
Am I ugly?

384
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:54,520
No.

385
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,280
You're pretty.

386
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,720
You look like my sister in your eyes.

387
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,000
When I was a kid,

388
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,890
I thought she'd grow up
to be a beautiful woman

389
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,390
and marry into a rich family
to enjoy wealth and prosperity,

390
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,490
so she wouldn't have
to starve and suffer anymore.

391
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:21,480
Is she married to a rich man now?

392
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:26,150
No.

393
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
She's long dead.

395

(Mi Mansion)

396
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,280
You shouldn't get involved in this.

397
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,280
I just figured

398
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,590
he'd always get someone
to pass on a message to you anyway.

399
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:02,390
I'd rather it be me than someone else.

400
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:03,910
At least

401
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,110
I won't lie to you with him.

402
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,150
You're right.

403
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,960
He'll get someone
to pass on the message anyway.

404
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,890
If it's not you, it'll be someone else.

405
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,800
But if you promised him,

406
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:19,110
he'd know you could convince me.

407
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:21,830
He's very smart.

408
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,280
He guessed you saved me that night.

409
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,190
He may have already
set his sights on you,

410
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,960
and he'll keep coming back for more

411
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,040
or even threaten me with you.

412
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,800
I won't let him threaten you with me.

413
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,670
I'm not going to school anymore.

414
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,480
I'll just hide at home.

415
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:46,490
He can't just break into the house
and come looking for me.

416
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:55,920
But I don't want you to be like this.

417
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,670
I want you to come out and feel the world.

418
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,040
It's beautiful and full of hope.

419
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,560
I know.

420
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:08,910
I hid at home before
because I had nowhere else to go,

421
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,320
but now I hide at home to help you.

422
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,480
Same as being at home,

423
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,830
I feel differently.

424
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,630
I'm willing to do it.

425
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,590
Call me if you need me.

426
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:26,340
If it's not convenient at home,
call outside.

427
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,240
Grocery shops, coffee shops,

428
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,000
anywhere there's a phone
you can borrow,

429
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,350
just pay them.

430
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,870
I just borrowed the phone
from the coffee shop.

431
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,150
Very good.

432
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:41,070
Do you hide the money I gave you
before discharging?

433
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,910
Yes, I hide it well.

434
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,670
Come here.

435
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,910
Go back in tears
and pretend I scolded you.

436
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,560
Miss Mi, what's wrong with you?

437
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,040
Why are you crying?

438
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,110
She got it as soon as I told her.
