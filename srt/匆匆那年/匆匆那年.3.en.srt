00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
This show is sponsored by the world's thinnest smartphone, E-Life.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,520
The American expert in covering up the problem, Di Qiao.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:08,480
Guys,

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,480
where there's oppression, there's resistance.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,480
You borrowed this book?

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,160
Who did this?

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,520
Who did this?

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,640
The one at the stairs.

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,760
Is it him?

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,240
It's him.

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,440
I don't think it's him.

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,600
If it's not him, why are you chatting with him alone?

13
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,680
You're so boring!

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,120
You're so manly every day.

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,160
You're a man.

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,360
You're bullying a girl.

17
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,320
Tell me!

18
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,520
Who did this?

19
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,000
I don't know.

20
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,000
How was that?

21
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,960
Last week,

22
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,960
After a beautiful training,

23
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,960
let's welcome today's

24
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,960
lucky one.

25
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,960
Zhao Yi.

26
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,960
What?

27
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,960
Don't put us together.

28
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,960
I know. I don't want to.

29
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,960
You don't want to?

30
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,960
So many homeworks.

31
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,960
You have a new project?

32
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,960
Really?

33
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,960
Yes.

34
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,960
In September,

35
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,960
you have 13 different culture.

36
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,960
It's the same as the B-boy.

37
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,960
What?

38
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,960
Let's go to the first class

39
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,960
after school.

40
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,960
Who's playing with you?

41
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,960
You're slower than me.

42
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,960
You're a master of the game.

43
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,960
Everyone, it's the New Year.

44
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,960
Come on.

45
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,960
Zhao Yi, why are you so annoying?

46
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,960
Jia Mo.

47
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,960
This is for you.

48
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,960
What's this?

49
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,960
You drew this?

50
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,960
I drew this.

51
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,960
Let me see.

52
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,960
Give it back to me.

53
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,960
Wow.

54
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,960
Awesome.

55
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,960
Wow.

56
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,960
Let me see.

57
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,960
I'm sorry.

58
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,960
You drew this?

59
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,960
You're so good.

60
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,960
Are you trying to fool me?

61
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,960
You learned how to draw?

62
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,960
I learned it when I was a kid.

63
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,960
Give me a drawing.

64
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,960
Give me a drawing.

65
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,960
Why? Who are you?

66
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,960
I won't give it to you.

67
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,960
Zhao Yi,

68
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,960
give this to Jia Mo.

69
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,960
I'll draw another one for you.

70
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,960
Here.

71
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,960
You're shameless.

72
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,960
Draw a picture of a mother.

73
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,960
A picture of a man in blue.

74
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,960
How is it?

75
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
It's so handsome.

76
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,960
I think it's like my body.

77
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,960
Do you think it's like Jia Mo?

78
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,960
Your second hand is a little bit like a mother.

79
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,960
You're so good.

80
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,960
How handsome you are.

81
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,960
How good your father is.

82
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,960
What kind of drawing is this?

83
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,960
Who do you like?

84
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,960
Me?

85
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,960
I like to cheat Wei Ren Zhang and be a family man.

86
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,960
Me too.

87
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,960
You're a thief.

88
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,960
Everyone has a family man.

89
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,960
Give me a picture.

90
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,960
Why are you doing this?

91
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,960
This...

92
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,960
What?

93
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,960
The 14th day of the gift certificate yesterday.

94
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,960
Did you make it?

95
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,960
Of course.

96
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,960
The machine is not changing.

97
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,960
The number is not changing.

98
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,960
Look at the line.

99
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,960
Let me send you the sleep.

100
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,960
To wake you up.

101
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,960
Jia Yuan,

102
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,960
I'm leaving.

103
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,960
You can tell me when you're back.

104
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,960
Okay.

105
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,960
Bye.

106
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,960
Go, Jia Yuan!

107
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,960
Go, Jia Yuan!

108
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,960
Go, Jia Yuan!

109
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,960
Go, Jia Yuan!

110
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,960
Go, Jia Yuan!

111
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,960
Go, Jia Yuan!

112
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,960
Hello.

113
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,960
Wait a minute.

114
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,960
Hello.

115
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,960
I've been away for a month.

116
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,960
I heard that our class is famous.

117
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,960
First, we were in a mess.

118
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,960
The school was in a mess.

119
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,960
Then, the class was criticized.

120
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,960
I heard that our class is sixth.

121
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,960
It was criticized.

122
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,960
Our class is a group.

123
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,960
The honor of class is the honor of each of us.

124
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,960
No one wants to be embarrassed, right?

125
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,960
Next, the class was criticized.

126
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,960
I want to hear what everyone has to say.

127
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,960
Say it.

128
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,960
Teacher Tao,

129
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,960
you're just recovered.

130
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,960
Don't worry about the press release.

131
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,960
I want to recommend a classmate.

132
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,960
Who?

133
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,960
Fang Hui.

134
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,960
I think the press release

135
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,960
is about the honor of our class.

136
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,960
Then, every class should make an effort.

137
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,960
Especially, the class with specialties.

138
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,960
Especially, the class with specialties.

139
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,960
Right, Fang Hui.

140
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,960
I remember that

141
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,960
the specialties are filled with art, right?

142
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,960
That's right.

143
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,960
Teacher Tao,

144
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,960
Fang Hui's painting is very good.

145
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,960
The painter is like the original.

146
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,960
Right?

147
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,960
Yes.

148
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,960
Sit down.

149
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,960
Fang Hui,

150
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,960
you'll be responsible for the next edition.

151
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,960
I'll try my best.

152
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,960
Okay.

153
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,960
Let's all work hard together.

154
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,960
Okay.

155
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,960
Why is it me?

156
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,960
Why is it me?

157
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,960
Your painting is good.

158
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,960
Jia Mo said that you won a prize in the district.

159
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,960
I haven't painted the board.

160
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,960
It's okay.

161
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,960
Last time, when you painted the sand,

162
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,960
the big tree was like a piece of paper.

163
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,960
No problem.

164
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,960
But...

165
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,960
It's okay. I'll help you.

166
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,960
I can't paint,

167
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,960
but I can paint and write.

168
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,960
Zhang Yan,

169
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,960
can you stay with Teacher Wang?

170
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,960
You didn't open your eyes.

171
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,960
I didn't open my eyes when I was in the bathroom.

172
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,960
I can't tell.

173
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,960
You know F4, too?

174
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,960
Who said girls can't like basketball?

175
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,960
You like our NBA, too.

176
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,960
What's wrong?

177
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,960
I like you.

178
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,960
I like you.

179
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,960
I like you, too.

180
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,960
We're meant to be.

181
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,960
You're so annoying.

182
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,960
NBA has so many fans.

183
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,960
You're meant to be with everyone.

184
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,960
Why are you so far away?

185
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,960
Get out.

186
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,960
Jia Mo,

187
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,960
I taught you how to play basketball.

188
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,960
I'll teach you how to play basketball.

189
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,960
You taught me?

190
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,960
Why?

191
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,960
I'm the number one and number two in the school.

192
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,960
Zhao Huohua, stop bragging.

193
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,960
You don't believe me?

194
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,960
Okay.

195
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,960
Zhao Ye,

196
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,960
wipe it yourself.

197
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,960
Good job, Lin Jia Mo.

198
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,960
You're really good at it.

199
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,960
Zhao Ye,

200
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,960
let's play basketball.

201
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,960
Let's go.

202
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,960
Let's go.

203
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,960
I'll tell you the first thing.

204
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,960
You can't cry if you lose.

205
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,960
Don't be too happy.

206
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,960
Let's bet something.

207
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,960
What?

208
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,960
If you lose,

209
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,960
dye your hair

210
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,960
with the color of a flower.

211
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,960
What if you lose?

212
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,960
I'll tie my hair.

213
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,960
Great.

214
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,960
It's a deal.

215
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,960
Lin Jia Mo,

216
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,960
you're the best.

217
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,960
Come on.

218
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,960
You're the best.

219
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,960
You're the best.

220
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,960
Lin Jia Mo, come on.

221
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,960
Come on.

222
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,960
Come on.

223
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,960
You're so good.

224
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,960
I'll let you win this time.

225
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,960
I'll let you see

226
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,960
what a real game is like.

227
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,960
You're really like

228
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,960
Ying Menghua.

229
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,960
Where?

230
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,960
You're so bad.

231
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,960
You're so bad.

232
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,960
What are you talking about?

233
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,960
I'll show you

234
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,960
my talent.

235
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,960
I have eagle eyes.

236
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,960
Bear ears.

237
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,960
Bear ears.

238
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,960
Bear ears.

239
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,960
Bear ears.

240
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,960
Bear ears.

241
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,960
Hello, Mr. Hong.

242
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,960
You're not supposed to play like this.

243
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,960
You have a pig's head.

244
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,960
Zhang Ye, it's your turn.

245
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,960
Zhang Ye, you're so good.

246
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,960
What are you doing?

247
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,960
What you said just now

248
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,960
has to be true.

249
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,960
What did you say?

250
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,960
What did I say?

251
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,960
You're going to dye your hair.

252
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,960
If you don't dye it,

253
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,960
I'll use the paint

254
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,960
to paint your hair red.

255
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,960
Jia Mo.

256
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,960
You're so good at playing.

257
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,960
When can you teach me?

258
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,960
Okay?

259
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,960
Let's talk about it when you're done.

260
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,960
I'll go back to the dorm and rest.

261
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,960
Okay.

262
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,960
Okay, bye.

263
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,960
Bye.

264
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,960
Bye.

265
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,960
Bye.

266
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,960
Bye.

267
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,960
What's wrong?

268
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,960
You're out of breath.

269
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,960
You may need to get a new birth.

270
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,960
What's wrong?

271
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,960
I got a glass of tea on my way here.

272
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,960
It's okay. You can go back first.

273
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,960
I'll get a new car.

274
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,960
How can I do that?

275
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,960
I'll go with you to rest.

276
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,960
The convertible is broken.

277
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,960
I'll go with him to rest.

278
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,960
I'm leaving.

279
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,960
See you tomorrow.

280
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,960
I'll go with you to rest.

281
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,960
See you tomorrow.

282
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,960
Bye.

283
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,960
Watch out.

284
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:30,960
Five, four, three, two, one.

285
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,960
How many times do I have to tell you?

286
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,960
You're so good at counting.

287
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,960
You're so accurate.

288
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,960
I loved eating popcorn when I was a kid.

289
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,960
Do you want some?

290
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,960
Thank you. No, thanks.

291
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,960
I've finished reading that book.

292
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,960
It's so good.

293
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,960
It's like I'm following the main character.

294
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,960
I feel like I'm going to the civil service together.

295
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,960
Yeah.

296
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,960
It feels like I'm going on an adventure with them.

297
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,960
I'm so curious.

298
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,960
Why doesn't he have so many strange thoughts in his head?

299
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,960
He's a genius.

300
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,960
Geniuses are all strange and interesting.

301
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:26,960
It's a pity that there are fewer and fewer interesting writers and people now.

302
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,960
I think you're interesting.

303
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,960
Really?

304
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,960
You're a very special friend.

305
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,960
By the way, why is your car so old?

306
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,960
It's been repaired three times since it was started.

307
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,960
How about I buy a new car with you?

308
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,960
It's not about the car.

309
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,960
Then what's going on?

310
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,960
I don't know.

311
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,960
It's okay if you don't want to say it.

312
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,960
I'll just ask.

313
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,960
This year,

314
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,960
Everyone moved the hairpin to the 24th level.

315
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,960
This year,

316
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,960
The second question of the 20th enterprise.

317
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,960
This year,

318
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,960
The problem of the LuFaLa paper spray.

319
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,960
The white head is up.

320
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,960
Pay attention to the可能 of the probability.

321
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,960
This year,

322
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,960
This year,

323
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,960
LuFaLa

324
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,960
Everyone, stand up.

325
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,960
What's your attitude?

326
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,960
Come back this year.

327
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,960
Then you call.

328
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,960
This year,

329
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,960
This year,

330
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,960
I don't know.

331
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,960
I'm going to the toilet.

332
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,960
What's wrong?

333
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,960
You're being pinched by Lao Liu, right?

334
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,960
No, you're a big donkey face.

335
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,960
You have to be pinched by Lao Liu.

336
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,960
Why didn't you say good night?

337
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,960
Let me see.

338
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,960
Look at how interesting it is.

339
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,960
You didn't treat Zhao Yi as a pig at all.

340
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,960
You're so bad.

341
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,960
Second Brother.

342
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,960
You two are so bad.

343
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,960
Don't be dizzy. Go play soccer.

344
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,960
I'm not going.

345
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,960
I still have to have a three-day self-examination.

346
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,960
And a hundred times of long-term salary.

347
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,960
A hundred times.

348
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,960
Lao Liu is so cruel.

349
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,960
How is it?

350
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,960
Not bad, Zhao Huahua.

351
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,960
You have a lot of experience in the field.

352
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,960
You're growing up in the battle field, right?

353
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,960
Don't talk nonsense with him.

354
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,960
I have to think about how to explain to my dad when I go home.

355
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,960
If my dad knows about this,

356
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,960
he will definitely beat me.

357
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,960
I have to save my energy.

358
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,960
Let's go.

359
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,960
Didn't you say you would explain to his dad?

360
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,960
Explain to your dad.

361
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,960
I'm going.

362
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,960
No, no, no, no.

363
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,960
Let's go.

364
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,960
Hey, classmate.

365
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,960
I remember your hair color shouldn't be this color.

366
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,960
Sister.

367
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,960
Can we not talk about hair color now?

368
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,960
Do me a favor.

369
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,960
Say it.

370
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,960
Help me ask for a leave in the team.

371
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,960
Make up a reason.

372
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,960
Don't say I'm here to check, okay?

373
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,960
You know it's embarrassing.

374
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,960
I beg you.

375
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,960
Aunt.

376
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,960
I'm not going.

377
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,960
Grandma.

378
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,960
I beg you.

379
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,960
Even if you call me Ya Dianna,

380
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,960
I'm not going.

463
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,960
Su Kai.

464
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,960

465
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,960

483
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,960
Let's see what I can do.

484
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,960
He is a little bit more experienced than me.

485
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,960
He is a little bit more experienced than me.

486
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,960
His name is called Xilai Xie.

487
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,960
Lin Jian Mo.

488
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,960
What is the name of this scholar?

489
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,960
Liu Shuan Feng.

490
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,960
Who is Liu Shuan Feng?

491
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,960
Teacher.

492
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,960
Liu Shuan Feng is a politician, revolutionary, communist, and great internationalist warrior.

493
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,960
I'm scared.

494
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,960
What are you doing?

495
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,960
I'm reading.

496
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,960
Don't bother.

497
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,960
No.

498
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,960
I said your signature is weird.

499
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,960
If a fool can see it, it's not your father's signature.

500
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,960
Get lost.

501
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,960
Can you do it?

502
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,960
You call me father.

503
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,960
I'll sign it for you.

504
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,960
Father.

505
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,960
Hey.

506
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,960
Hey.

507
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,960
Hey.

508
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,960
Hey.

509
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,960
Hey.

510
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,960
Hey.

511
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,960
Hey.

512
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,960
Hey.

513
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,960
Hey.

514
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,960
Hey.

515
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,960
Hey.

516
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,960
Hey.

517
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,960
Hey.

518
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,960
Hey.

519
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,960
Hey.

520
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,960
Hey.

521
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,960
Hey.

522
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,960
Hey.

523
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,960
Hey.

524
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,960
Can you do it?

525
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,960
Yes.

526
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,960
Yes.

527
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,960
Very good.

528
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,960
You're not this.

529
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,960
Son.

530
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,960
Tomorrow, the press release will be reviewed.

531
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,960
Are you going to have to be careful tonight?

532
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,960
I can't do it today.

533
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,960
Why?

534
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,960
I can't be absent from the training.

535
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,960
No, no.

536
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,960
You have to rely on Fang Hui for that press release.

537
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,960
I can't do anything by relying on me.

538
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,960
Right?

539
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,960
Right?

540
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,960
Yes.

541
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,960
Here.

542
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,960
Thank you.

543
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,960
Okay.

544
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,960
Okay.

545
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,960
What's wrong?

546
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,960
Thank you.

547
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,960
Thank you.

548
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,960
Oh, right.

549
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,960
I can't be with your parents today.

550
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,960
What's the matter with you?

551
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,960
I made an appointment with my mother.

552
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,960
Call me at night.

553
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,960
Your mother is in the foreign land?

554
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,960
In the UK.

555
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,960
So far away.

556
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,960
Do you miss her?

557
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,960
Yes.

558
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,960
I'm used to it.

559
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,960
Where is she?

560
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,960
Qiao Ran has something to do at home.

561
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,960
She left first.

562
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,960
He Sha caught a cold.

563
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,960
Jia Mo is in a bad mood.

564
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,960
I let her go too.

565
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,960
These people are so unreliable.

566
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,960
I'm sorry.

567
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,960
I'm sorry.

568
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,960
I'm sorry.

569
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,960
I'm sorry.

570
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,960
I'm sorry.

571
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,960
I'm sorry.

572
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,960
I'm sorry.

573
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,960
I'm sorry.

574
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,960
I'm sorry.

575
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,960
I'm sorry.

576
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,960
Could you please help me look at both lines?

577
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,960
Not crooked.

578
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,960
Actually a little crooked.

579
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,960
Not crooked.

580
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:15,620
Xia her

581
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,620
What can you do about it

582
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,340
What can you think about it

583
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,020
Example

584
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,320
Didn't she just say

585
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,860
You can do it

586
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,840
Do you mean

587
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,460
I can explain it to him

588
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:23,980
Really

589
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,200
It's just she

590
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,740
Know how to talk, you know

591
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,920
She's 재� I'm continuously disturbance

592
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,580
she

593
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,340
Anyone who comes into the relationship

594
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,420
Just bị

595
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,780
For example

596
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,140
Never

597
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,060
Am I gonna look after you

598
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:37,740
For me

599
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,340
I don't have a better

600
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,340
I went to see my dad.

601
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:45,340
I told him that we both miss him.

602
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,340
I have nothing else to do.

603
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,340
Oh, right.

604
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,340
Tomorrow is the rain in London.

605
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,340
Remember to bring an umbrella.

606
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,340
Okay.

607
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,340
Bye, mom.

608
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,500
Fine.

609
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:46,340
Love is so long, why can't we stay together?

610
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:50,340
I can only think of your tenderness

611
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:55,340
Give me happiness, give me freedom

612
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:59,340
Give me a tomorrow to live

613
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:03,340
In the deep night, the stars are still there

614
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:09,340
Tears flow in my eyes

615
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:16,340
I don't want to say that I really love you

616
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:20,340
I don't want to say that I'm sorry for you

617
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:27,340
You're crying and saying that you can't continue

618
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:31,340
It's hard to continue

619
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:41,340
Please give me more time, more happiness

620
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:44,340
Don't take everything away

621
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:49,340
Please give me more space, more tenderness

622
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:54,340
Don't make me feel so bad

623
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:59,340
You're the only woman

624
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:03,340
That makes me happy, makes me have

625
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:07,340
Makes me happy for you

626
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:14,340
Give me everything

627
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,340
Are you hungry?

628
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,340
I'm fine

629
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,340
Wait a minute

630
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,340
When did you learn to draw?

631
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,340
I was in the fifth grade in primary school

632
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,340
My mom forced me to draw

633
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:52,340
Actually, you're good at drawing

634
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:58,340
It's like playing the piano and singing

635
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,340
You have to express yourself

636
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,340
I'm just drawing

637
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,340
You're better at drawing than me

638
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:15,340
I can't even count the numbers when I'm drawing

639
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:19,340
I'm even wondering if I ate too much chicken feet when I was a kid

640
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,340
I'm sorry

641
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,340
Thank you just now

642
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,340
You mean the flashlight

643
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:53,340
I should be the one thanking you

644
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:58,340
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have been able to draw

645
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:04,340
I'm not good at drawing, so I can only draw like that

646
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,340
Don't say that

647
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,340
I think it's great

648
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,340
Really

649
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,340
It's great

650
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,340
Thank you

651
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,340
Thank you

652
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,340
Thank you

653
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,340
Thank you

654
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,340
Attention

655
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,340
Don't leave after the school break

656
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,340
High school first and high school second, play the game

657
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,340
The second and second should go too

658
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,340
Of course

659
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,340
I'll show you what technology is

660
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,340
Sure, I'll go

661
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,340
Okay, okay

662
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,340
You should come too

663
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,340
I'm not going

664
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,340
I haven't finished my homework

665
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,340
Come on, we're partners

666
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:38,340
If we go, we'll definitely win the championship

667
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,340
You're the school's most important person

668
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,340
I'm the free-rider

669
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,340
I can't play with you

670
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,340
You have to come today

671
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,340
Come on, don't skip class

672
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,340
You...

673
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:08,340
God, are you against us?

674
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,340
God

675
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:14,340
Give me strength, I'm the free-rider

676
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,340
Don't be scared

677
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,340
What if you get a thunder strike?

678
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,340
You're really bad

679
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,340
No way, how dare you

680
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,340
You scared me

681
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,340
You're really bad

682
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:36,340
You're so boring, do you miss me?

683
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,340
What are you doing?

684
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,340
Let's play together

685
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,340
I'm leaving, bye

686
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:51,340
Bye

687
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,340
Let me introduce you to the basketball

688
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,340
This is our class' Fang Hui

689
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,340
This is our class' Gao Zhen

690
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:59,340
Are you Lin Xia Mo?

691
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,340
You remember me?

692
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,340
You're the basketball player?

693
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,340
Let's start

694
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,340
Come on

695
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,340
I'll tell you the rules

696
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,340
Whoever hits the ball, will be the winner

697
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,340
Okay

698
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,340
Zhang Ye, did you do it on purpose?

699
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,340
I admit defeat

700
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,340
I admit defeat

701
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,340
I admit defeat

702
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,340
You don't know how to do it?

703
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,340
I know

704
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,340
You did that in class last time

705
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,340
That

706
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,340
Come on

707
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,340
That's so ugly

708
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,340
Next, whoever hits the ball

709
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:57,340
will write his name on his ass

710
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,340
Come on

711
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,340
I admit defeat

712
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,340
You don't know how to play

713
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,340
I admit defeat

714
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,340
Come on

715
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,340
Ready

716
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,340
One, two, three

717
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,340
Sit, right, left, right

718
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,340
Neck, right, left, right

719
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,340
Right, left, right, left, right

720
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,340
Right, left, right, left

721
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:27,340
Zhang Ye, your skin is a little bit painful

722
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,340
What are you doing?

723
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,340
Have fun

724
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,340
Whoever hits the ball

725
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,340
will go to the fish to pick up the ball

726
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,340
Okay

727
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,340
Come on

728
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,340
Turn around

729
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,340
Turn around

730
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,340
Turn around

731
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,340
Pick up the ball

732
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,340
Pick up the ball

733
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,340
I'm the one who turns around

734
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,340
The ball is quite graceful

735
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,340
Right

736
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,340
Zhang Ye, write it down

737
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,340
Come on

738
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,340
Come on

739
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,340
Come on

740
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,340
Whoever hits the ball will wipe the ball clean

741
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,340
Stop, stop, stop

742
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:19,340
Wipe the ball

743
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,340
Wipe the ball

744
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,340
Senior, I'll go to see your ear

745
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,340
No problem

746
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,340
I'll go first

747
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,340
Bye

748
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,340
Be careful

749
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,340
Lu Hua

750
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,340
Zhiyong

751
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,340
Zhang Ye

752
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,340
Zhang Ye

753
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,340
Do you want to go together?

754
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,340
No

755
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,340
I'm not riding today

756
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,340
I'll take the bus

757
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,340
Let me send you to the bus station

758
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,340
It's okay

759
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,340
Be careful

760
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,340
Bye

761
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,340
Go

762
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,340
Get in the car

763
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,340
Hurry up

764
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,340
If you have this kind of thing again

765
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,340
Just tell me

766
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,340
I'll help you solve it

767
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,340
It's okay

768
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,340
You are

769
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,340
You are not Ziwei

770
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,340
You are not being treated well every day

771
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,340
If you are not being treated well today, you will be kicked out of the palace tomorrow

772
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,340
You also see Huan Chun

773
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:45,340
I was forced to watch a cold film with my mother

774
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,340
Ziwei

775
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,340
Don't be so painful

776
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,340
Please

777
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,340
Don't be so charming

778
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,340
Ziwei

779
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,340
I love you so much

780
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,340
Er Kang

781
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,340
Mountain is not cold

782
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,340
Heaven and earth are harmonious

783
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,340
Why do you have to marry me

784
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,340
Why do you have to marry me

785
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,340
Look at what you say every day

786
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,340
Er Kang

787
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,340
I'm sorry

788
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,340
I'm really sorry

789
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,340
What are you saying

790
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,340
Actually

791
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:31,340
I hate hearing the word sorry the most

792
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,340
Why

793
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,340
If you really like someone

794
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:41,340
You won't do anything to him

795
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:45,340
So these three words have no meaning

796
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:51,340
I won't say sorry to you

797
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,340
What

798
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:57,340
I will never say sorry to you in the future

799
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,340
Even if I stepped on your feet

800
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,340
I will tell you it's okay

801
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,340
You owe me

802
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,340
Okay

803
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,340
What are you doing

804
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,340
Hold on

805
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,340
Let's speed up

806
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:25,340
I love you so much

807
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:29,340
I love you so much

808
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,340
I love you so much

809
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,340
What's this

810
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,340
Zha Yi

811
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,340
You drew it

812
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,340
Look at me

813
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,340
So cool

814
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:49,340
So cool

815
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,340
This

816
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,340
So cool

817
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,340
So cool

818
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,340
So cool

819
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,340
To be honest

820
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,340
Why don't you go to the beauty class

821
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,340
You can get a bonus

822
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,340
Really

823
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,340
I have long legs

824
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,340
Really

825
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,340
You can go

826
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,340
You can go

827
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,340
Okay

828
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:21,340
What

829
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,340
I'll forget it

830
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,340
What

831
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,340
What

832
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,340
What

833
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,340
What

834
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,340
What's the first time the heart beat

835
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:16,740
Chen Xue, what does love look like when it happens?

836
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:20,540
We, 16 years old, don't understand the meaning of love yet.

837
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:24,540
But we have the courage to love more than anything.

838
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,540
Hello?

839
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:36,340
Fang Huai, it's me.

840
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,940
Chen Xue.

841
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:44,140
Thank you for your painting.

842
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:49,140
You're welcome.

843
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:08,940
The experiment mid-term is now starting.

844
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:12,940
The first experiment is to play a national song.

845
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:43,940
The first experiment is to play a song.

846
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:01,940
Now, let's welcome the teacher to speak.

847
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:07,940
Students, teachers, good morning.

848
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:11,940
It's a new week, a new beginning.

849
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:16,140
The new semester has already passed half of the new year.

850
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:17,940
In the past two months,

851
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:22,740
our school has achieved a lot of results in education.

852
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:27,540
The mid-term comprehensive assessment, our school is ranked third.

853
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,940
Actually, the person you like is Qiao Ran.

854
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:42,940
Don't talk nonsense.

855
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:44,940
What are you doing?

856
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,940
Fang Huai and Qiao Ran are very close.

857
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:57,940
Is that necessary?

858
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:00,940
Why is it so obvious?

859
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,940
This is a very obvious thing.

860
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:05,940
Who wrote the words on the blackboard?

861
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,940
Who wrote the words on the blackboard?

862
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:09,940
We can definitely find out who it is.

863
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:10,940
Wen Jia Mo, what do you mean?

864
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:12,940
Who do you like?

865
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:14,940
We have to help her.

866
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:33,940
Hello, everyone.

867
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,940
This is the 22nd New Year.

868
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:38,940
Our school.

869
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,940
Congratulations.

870
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:05,940
Happy New Year.

00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:19,940
Happy New Year.

878
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:21,940
Happy New Year.

879
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:23,940
Happy New Year.

00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,940
Happy New Year.

881
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:27,940
Happy New Year.

882
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:29,940
Happy New Year.

883
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:31,940
Happy New Year.

884
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:33,940
Happy New Year.

885
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:35,940
Happy New Year.

886
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:37,940
Happy New Year.

887
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:39,940
Happy New Year.

888
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:41,940
Happy New Year.

889
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,940
Happy New Year

890
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:51,940
Nice to meet you.

891
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:57,940
We will be in your house on the way to your Orchid Bagh

892
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,940
我們要到您家的路 persona

893
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:28,940
Hello, teacher Li. I'm Wang Wei. I'm sorry that I can't attend the class reunion this time.

894
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:33,940
The main thing is to be a fan of the school.

895
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:38,940
I was a model in 2012. Now I'm still working in the club.

896
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:42,940
I started to work with you in the fourth grade.

897
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:45,940
Including Wang Liang. I'm the same as Wang Liang.

898
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:46,940
I'm a fan of the school.

899
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:48,940
But you were a teacher and a comedian.

900
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:50,940
We are not only comedians.

901
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:52,940
We are not only comedians.

902
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:54,940
You said that you were a good teacher and a good student.

903
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:00,940
Your npause is so long.

904
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:27,460
Your n

00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:31,940
