world's thinnest smartphone, E-Life.

4
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,280
The most important thing for a girl is to love her.

5
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,280
When we pass the entrance examination,

6
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,280
let's see what they say.

7
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,280
The line on the blackboard,

8
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,280
I like Chen Xun,

9
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,280
I didn't write it.

10
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,280
I can help you.

11
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,280
Why didn't you go to the college entrance examination?

12
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,280
I might have to go to the UK.

13
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,280
Go well and come back well.

14
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,280
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,280
What are you doing?

16
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,280
Chen Yu.

17
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,280
Chen Yu.

18
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,280
I like you.

19
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,280
I had a dream.

20
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,280
Goodbye.

21
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,280
Nice to meet you.

22
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,280
Can you upgrade the attempts on the towel?

23
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,280
No, I may not зак 얻

24
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,280
Why didn't you choose that method today?

25
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,280
I can apply for tomorrow's exchange participation.

26
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,280
Meanwhile,

27
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,280
I have to go to beaten heart today.

28
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,280
Will you come or leave?

29
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,280
I didn't come.

30
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,280
I said come.

31
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,280
They are神父

32
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,280
Please answer.

33
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,280
Thanks alone.

34
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,540
It turned out that there is a suitor on the blackboard.

35
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,540
Hey, you look like you're good at drawing.

36
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,540
Yeah, I'm good at drawing.

37
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,540
Do you like it? I'll give you two.

38
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,540
No, I can't see it. I'm old.

39
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,540
I like to read comics.

40
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,540
That's your hobby.

41
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,540
Fatty, I think you look like you're good at drawing.

42
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,540
Don't call me fatty. I'm not fat at all.

43
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,540
Then what's your name?

44
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,540
I'm Gao Kesha.

45
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,540
I'm Song Ning.

46
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,540
Hello, I'm Song Ning.

47
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,540
Come on, help me.

48
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,540
Brother Tian, who is this?

49
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,540
My goddess.

50
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,540
He's so sexy. Can you sleep well at night?

51
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,540
Hello, have you finished packing?

52
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,540
OK, I'll come back to you later.

53
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,540
I'll come back to you later.

54
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,540
Girlfriend?

55
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,540
Yes, we are.

56
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,540
Beautiful?

57
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,540
Must be.

58
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,540
OK, speed is fast enough.

59
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,540
That's a little bit of a legend.

60
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,540
What's the legend?

61
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,540
Don't pretend.

62
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,540
You're not dating a man, are you?

63
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,540
It's none of your business.

64
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,540
Why are you laughing? Are you a man?

65
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,540
I am.

66
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,540
You're checking your entrance exam.

67
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,540
Do you have a girlfriend?

68
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,540
I only have one dream in college.

69
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,540
To have a romantic relationship.

70
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,540
Hello, I'm Wilson Zhao.

71
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,540
I'm Shan Chong Lin.

72
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,540
I like to read books.

73
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,540
I'm a good guy.

74
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,540
I'm his friend.

75
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,540
Hello.

76
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,540
I'm Wilson Zhao.

77
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,540
Tell me, are you a man?

78
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,540
What man?

79
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,540
You're so tall. You won't fall down.

80
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,540
I never wear high heels.

81
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,540
I can't walk with high heels.

82
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,540
You have a good taste.

83
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,540
Try this pair.

84
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,540
I'm telling you, I can't wear high heels.

85
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,540
I have no future.

86
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,540
By the way, try this pair.

87
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,540
It's white and red.

88
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,540
Thank you.

89
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,540
It's OK to wear high heels.

90
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,540
It's really different.

91
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,540
Let's go shopping together next time.

92
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,540
No problem.

93
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,540
You can try it too.

94
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,540
By the way, this pair is for you.

95
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,540
Try it on.

96
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,540
I don't need it.

97
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,540
Don't be polite.

98
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,540
I'm not used to it.

99
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,540
Thank you.

100
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,540
Jia Mo.

101
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,540
Jia Mo.

102
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,540
What's wrong?

103
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,540
Are you not feeling well?

104
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,540
I'm fine.

105
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,540
Today,

106
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,540
I just passed by the playground.

107
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,540
I saw a lot of people.

108
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,540
I saw a lot of people.

109
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,540
I also saw a basketball team

110
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,540
at the playground.

111
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,540
I saw a boy's teammate.

112
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,540
He looks like Zhao Ye.

113
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,540
He was walking with him for a long time.

114
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,540
Of course, he looked nervous.

115
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,540
I don't know what happened inside.

116
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,540
I should be bullied.

117
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,540
No, you can't.

118
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,540
Zhao Ye's personality

119
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,540
is bully.

120
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,540
He bullied others.

121
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:35,140
Hey, how about we three go see him in a few days?

122
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,740
Okay.

123
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,740
You promised me that we would go to college together.

124
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,140
Now we're going to go together.

125
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,140
We'll still be together.

126
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:57,540
Oh, right. Today is our new student conference.

127
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:02,140
Our teacher said that college is a big man's cake.

128
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:06,740
Everyone will be colored in a different color.

129
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,340
But we must remember our true colors.

130
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,540
I think that's a good idea.

131
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,340
I gave it to you two. You should go to military school in a few days.

132
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,540
I'm afraid you'll end up with a little girl.

133
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,540
Chen Xun, be careful.

134
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:29,940
Of course. I got Qiao Ran's true colors.

135
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,740
Don't forget to bring your phone.

136
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,140
When we arrive at the military camp, we can still contact each other.

137
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,940
One, two, one.

138
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,540
One, two.

139
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,140
One.

140
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,940
This guy is so cool.

141
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,140
Please leave a message.

142
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,340
Welcome to the camp.

143
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,540
I hope that from today on,

144
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,540
you can ask yourself to be alert.

145
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,740
You must be alert.

146
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,340
Ready, go.

147
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,540
One, two, one.

148
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,540
One, two, one.

149
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,740
One, two, one.

150
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,140
Right, cut, action.

151
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,140
Jet, go.

152
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,740
Turn right.

153
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,740
Turn.

154
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,940

00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,940
One, two, polite.

156
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,940
One, two, polite.

157
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,540
One, two, polite.

158
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,340
Turn.

159
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:45,140
Turn right.

160
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,140
One, two, polite.

161
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,340
One, two, polite.

162
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,540
One, two, polite.

163
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,740
Turn.

164
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,780
Already been changed

165
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:58,820
Come out

166
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:00,540
Come out

167
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,800
A Hook shot will be punished tonight

168
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:06,780
Sir

169
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:07,980
Aren't you being�ous?

170
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,700
Humant

171
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,300

172
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:12,860
Please

173
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,900
How can you treat me like this?

174
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:04,340
Misslu,

175
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,600
I won't take your place in the future anymore.

176
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,820
Don't do this anymore.

177
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,900
Follow me.

178
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,940
Are you afraid of my high school?

179
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,940
Let me borrow it tomorrow

180
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,940
How do you know?

181
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,940
I'll tell you tomorrow

182
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,940
The first day of the school year

183
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,940
Hey, what are you doing?

184
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,940
You're feeding the pigs

185
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,940
I'm feeding the pigs in our dormitory

186
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,940
No, I've been standing here for so long

187
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,940
You, you

188
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,940
I've been standing here for so long

189
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,940
You can't take it all

190
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,940
I came first

191
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,940
I'll get it first

192
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,940
Listen to me

193
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,940
I'm buying buns

194
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,940
Hey, pig

195
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,940
I'm sorry

196
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,940
I'm sorry

197
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,940
I didn't mean to

198
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,940
Change, change

199
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,940
I'm not giving up

200
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,940
What are you doing?

201
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,940
Stop

202
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,940
Hey, mom

203
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,940
It's me

204
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,940
Help me pick up the bags

205
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,940
I am in the break

206
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,940
Hurry up

207
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,940
I'll help you

208
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,940
There's a little baby in the water

209
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:50,940
Yes, yes

210
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,940
Remember this

211
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,940
You like Nirvana too?

212
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,940
I like it a lot. You like it too?

213
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,940
Of course.

214
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,940
I like their one the most.

215
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,940
It's super classic.

216
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,940
I can't tell.

217
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,940
You like it too?

218
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,940
You like it too?

219
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,940
You haven't told me yet.

220
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,940
How do you know I'm hiding my phone?

221
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,940
I just randomly said it. Who knows it's there?

222
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,940
Let's go.

223
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,940
Here.

224
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,940
Fang Cheng Zhi!

225
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,940
18 years old, happy birthday!

226
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,940
Be quiet.

227
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,940
You'll get a gift if you see this.

228
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,940
Here.

229
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,940
This is for you.

230
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,940
It's a unique

231
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,940
bullet head necklace.

232
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,940
I saw it on the way to the station.

233
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,940
Who saw it?

234
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,940
It's all in the afternoon.

235
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,940
Besides,

236
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,940
it's nice to be with you.

237
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,940
Isn't it?

238
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,940
Here.

239
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,940
What is it?

240
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,940
It's a bracelet.

241
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,940
I used to use a

242
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,940
toilet paper.

243
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,940
I'm not a person who uses

244
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,940
toilet paper.

245
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,940
I'll take it.

246
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,940
I'm leaving.

247
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,940
Let me see you again.

248
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,940
Go in!

249
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,940
I can't even sleep well

250
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:27,040
without a

251
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,200
to chew it.

252
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,040
He likes to eat.

253
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,040
He likes to bite aστ een.

254
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,040
сч Goodness.

255
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,860
And here are the

256
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,860
lunch boxes.

257
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,860
I'm so tired.

258
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,860
Comrade Tianxin.

259
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,860
I'll give you a bubble to blow.

260
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,860
It's super fun.

261
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,860
You're a professional again.

262
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:06,860
You're a professional again.

263
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,860
Then how dare you ask a professional.

264
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,860
Law.

265
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,860
Don't be so smart.

266
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,860
You're still in law school.

267
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,860
I'm called the great wisdom.

268
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,860
Come.

269
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,860
That's Mr. Xun?

270
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,860
What?

271
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,860
Of course.

272
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,860
What's the matter with you?

273
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,860
How many sisters-in-law?

274
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,860
What sisters-in-law?

275
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,860
Just one.

276
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,860
Hey.

277
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,860
If girls get married first,

278
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,860
and we don't,

279
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,860
isn't it a bit too messy?

280
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,860
Can we cut some strings?

281
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,860
I can smell the hormones.

282
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,860
It's said that female hormones

283
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,860
are the smell of new people.

284
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,860
Who said that?

285
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,860
Shuang Shuang.

286
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,860
What kind of chef is that?

287
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,860
I forgot.

288
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,860
I smell the smell of crime.

289
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,860
42.

290
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,860
43.

291
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,860
44.

292
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,860
Don't be lazy.

293
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,860
42.

294
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,860
What are you doing?

295
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,860
Shaoguan.

296
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,860
You've done 100 in a row.

297
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,860
You can do it without any effort.

298
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,860
Get up.

299
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,860
I'm so happy.

300
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,860
Get up.

301
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,860
Get up.

302
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,860
Get up.

303
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,860
Put the knife down.

304
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,860
Is it still hurt?

305
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,860
Hurry up.

306
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,860
Hurry up.

307
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:11,860
Put it down.

308
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:13,860
Hurry up.

309
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:20,860
Look at this.

310
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,860
Don't twist your legs.

311
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,860
See?

312
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,860
He's got real skills.

313
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,860
Every witness

314
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,860
must have the same level of training as the superman.

315
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,860
This way,

316
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,860
you can protect your family and your country.

317
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,860
No.

318
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,860
Let's practice.

319
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,860
Practice?

320
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,860
Let's go.

321
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,860
I'm going to the US.

322
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,860
Hurry up.

323
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,860
I'm going to the US.

324
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,860
I'm so tired.

325
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,860
Why do I fall in love with you

326
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,860
I'm asking myself

327
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,860
I can give up everything

328
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,860
But today I can't leave

329
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,860
You're not beautiful

330
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,860
But you're so cute

331
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,860
Miss Hui

332
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,860
My Miss Hui

333
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,860
I always fall in love with you

334
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,860
I don't know

335
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,860
Will Zhao Yan

336
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,860
have a holiday?

337
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,860
There should be an activity.

338
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,860
Don't worry.

339
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,860
Let's go see him after we finish.

340
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,860
You're so beautiful

341
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,860
And you're so cute

342
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,860
Chen Xin is so handsome.

343
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,860
He can sing.

344
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,860
I heard he's a great basketball player.

345
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,860
Your Chen Xin

346
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,860
has become a human being.

347
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,860
He

348
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,860
is just a kid.

349
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,860
Let's go.

350
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,860
We got the money.

351
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,860
Money.

352
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,860
Come on.

353
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,860
Please give me a picture.

354
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,860
Smile.

355
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,860
You smile so handsome.

356
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,860
Smile like a man.

357
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,860
Come on.

358
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,860
Miss Liu.

359
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,860
Why are you taking the bag and the photo again?

360
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,860
You're the one who's taking it.

361
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,860
Move aside.

362
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,860
You should have told me.

363
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,860
I came first.

364
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,860
Who saw you coming first?

365
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,860
You did.

366
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,860
One, two, three.

367
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,860
Why is there no one in our class

368
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,860
who can take it?

369
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,860
Handsome guys are in the art school.

370
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,860
You don't want it.

371
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,860
There's no one handsome and reliable.

372
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,860
Men aren't reliable.

373
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,860
There are.

374
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,860
Like Chen Xun.

375
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,860
Who's like that?

376
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,860
Who's like that?

377
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,860
Either you have a girlfriend,

378
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,860
or you're demanding a lot.

379
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,860
You don't want a super-handsome girl.

380
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,860
I'm going back.

381
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,860
I'm leaving first.

382
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,860
What's going on?

383
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,860
This is so unexpected.

384
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,860
Didn't you say that you're demanding a lot

385
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,860
and you don't want a super-handsome girl?

386
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,860
How do I know that she has a unique taste?

387
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,860
I remember now.

388
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,860
Her family is rich.

389
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,860
I didn't expect that Chen Xun is a little white-collar.

390
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,860
Alright.

391
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,860
That's her business.

392
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,860
Let's not say anything.

393
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,860
Let's go.

394
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,860
Why is there no one here?

395
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,860
How about we go in first?

396
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,860
No, no, no.

397
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,860
It's not suitable.

398
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,860
Let's wait.

399
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,860
Let's wait.

400
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,860
Hello.

401
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,860
We're here to see Zhao Ye.

402
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,860
The time for this month's inspection has passed.

403
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,860
You can come again next month.

404
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,860
Can you help us?

405
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,860
We'll meet for a while.

406
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,860
We don't need to delay you for a long time.

407
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:31,860
Sorry.

408
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,860
Please cooperate with our work.

409
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,860
Sir, we brought so many things.

410
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,860
You can help us burn the things.

411
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,860
I'm really sorry.

412
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,860
Please cooperate with our work.

413
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,860
Please go back.

414
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,860
What are you doing?

415
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,860
Don't be nervous.

416
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,860
Let's go.

417
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,860
What are you doing?

418
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,860
I'm sorry.

419
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,860
What are you wiping?

420
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,860
You're sorry and that's it?

421
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,860
Did I tell you that I'm a rich woman?

422
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,860
You can't do it casually.

423
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,860
Did you do it on purpose?

424
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,860
Say something.

425
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,860
What should I do?

426
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,860
You're the one who's making trouble.

427
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,860
You should compensate her.

428
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,860
No.

429
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:17,860
I can't compensate her.

430
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,860
I think you did it on purpose.

431
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,860
Enough.

432
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,860
Stop it.

433
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,860
You're raising a white-faced woman

434
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,860
because you're rich.

435
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,860
You're not as small as your heart.

436
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,860
You're trying to break other people's fortune.

437
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,860
You're pretending to be a good person every day.

438
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,860
What are you pretending?

439
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,860
Forget it.

440
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,860
She's rich.

441
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,860
What does she have to do with us?

442
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,860
Right?

443
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,860
I want to go home every day.

444
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,860
You want to go home every day?

445
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,860
Girls like this.

446
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,860
Is it necessary?

447
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,860
It's a big deal.

448
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,860
Don't be angry.

449
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,860
I'm not angry.

450
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,860
Is someone at home?

451
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,860
Ding dong.

452
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,860
Ding.

453
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:40,860
Ding.

454
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,860
What's wrong?

455
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,860
Chen Xun.

456
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,860
You're going so fast.

457
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,860
Did you eat?

458
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,860
No.

459
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,860
I want to eat.

460
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,860
Okay.

461
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,860
Chen Xun.

462
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,860
Shen Xiaotang.

463
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,860
Help me open it.

464
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,860
Thank you.

465
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,860
I want to eat.

466
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,860
You also like to eat old godmother?

467
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,860
Of course.

468
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,860
I can't eat without old godmother.

469
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,860
Okay.

470
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,860
Wait a minute.

471
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,860
What's wrong?

472
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,860
Nike's memorial key chain.

473
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,860
It's a key chain.

474
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,860
It's good, friend.

475
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,860
It's a good thing.

476
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:42,860
Of course.

477
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,860
Our school was defeated by Nike last year.

478
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,860
Second grade.

479
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,860
Which grade are you in?

480
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,860
Experimental.

481
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,860
Really?

482
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,860
We're not on the same level.

483
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,860
As the top team in the world that is self-reliant to our school,

484
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,860
we respect your school.

485
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,860
Don't be so good.

486
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,860
Our school has always been the champion.

487
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:03,860
Chen Xun.

488
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,860
Last year,

489
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,860
our school seemed to be the first.

490
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,860
Then,

491
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,860
a god was sent by your school.

492
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,860
Then the captain got a three-point.

493
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,860
Then it was reversed.

494
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,860
Isn't that the case?

495
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,860
To be honest,

496
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,860
the god in your mouth is me.

497
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,860
Really?

498
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,860
What did you say?

499
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,860
A real person doesn't show his face.

500
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,860
A shame.

501
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:23,860
Come on.

502
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,860
Let me dry it.

503
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,860
Don't.

504
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,860
A good man doesn't mention his name.

505
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,860
What's your zodiac sign?

506
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,860
Gemini.

507
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,860
No wonder.

508
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,860
You're so humble.

509
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,860
You're so happy.

510
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,860
What do you mean?

511
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,860
I don't know much about zodiac signs.

512
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,860
What else is there?

513
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,860
Loss of character.

514
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,860
Responsibility to escape.

515
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,860
And the most unreliable.

516
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,860
What are you talking about?

517
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,860
Come on.

518
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,860
Show me your hand.

519
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,860
Hurry up.

520
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,860
What?

521
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,860
Your love life is a little rough.

522
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,860
You have to toss and turn.

523
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,860
What's wrong with you?

524
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,860
It's true.

525
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,860
You're a Gemini.

526
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,860
Love is supposed to be a little rough.

527
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,860
Let me tell you the truth.

528
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,860
I've loved a woman for so many years.

529
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,860
I only have you.

530
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,860
Who?

531
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:19,860
Tao Hua.

532
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:22,860
You're so mean.

533
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,860
How is it?

534
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,860
Is it round?

535
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,860
Yes.

536
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,860
It's too hot.

537
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,860
It's too hot.

538
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:31,860
It's too hot.

539
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,860
I'm hot.

540
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,860
I'm hot.

541
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,860
I'm hot.

542
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,860
You're hot.

543
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,860
You're hot.

544
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:37,860
What are you doing?

545
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,860
Come on.

546
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,860
Show me.

547
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,860
Wait.

548
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,860
Don't you have a wife?

549
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,860
Why are you in a hurry?

550
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,860
Go.

551
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,860
I only have a wife.

552
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,860
It's none of your business.

553
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,860
I'm not going.

554
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,860
Hurry up.

555
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,860
Hurry up.

556
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,860
Look.

557
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,860
Come on.

558
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:03,860
Get up.

559
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:12,860
Happy breakfast.

560
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,860
It's much more convenient to have a cell phone.

561
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,860
This is my motorcycle.

562
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,860
It's not good to come to the signal.

563
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,860
I'll tell you.

564
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,860
I think Nokia is still good.

565
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:38,860
I predict that one day Nokia will rule the world.

566
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,860
You?

567
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:42,860
Yes.

568
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,860
What you like changes in two days.

569
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,860
How did I change my favorite thing in two days?

570
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,860
I'm a Gemini.

571
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,860
Gemini is three minutes of hot poison.

572
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,860
When did you start researching the constellation?

573
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,860
No.

574
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,860
I was chatting with a friend that day.

575
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,860
He told me.

576
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,860
Who?

577
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,860
A girl from the Faculty of Law.

578
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,860
Her name is Shen Xiaotang.

579
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,860
We can ask her to help us one day.

580
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:09,860
See if we will be a basketball team in the future.

581
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,860
Or a business team.

582
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,860
You're not serious.

583
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,860
Let me do it.

584
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,860
Do you have class on Saturday nights?

585
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,860
I'll ask someone from our dorm to have a meal with you.

586
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,860
Introduce you to the class.

587
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:27,860
That's it.

588
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:37,860
P-P-T-A-P-P-E-T-A-T-E.

589
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,860
I heard that Chen Xun's girlfriend is going to bring a best friend.

590
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:45,860
Really?

591
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,860
Is she beautiful?

592
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,860
Is she single?

593
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,860
What are you still looking for?

594
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,860
Pay attention to our dorm's image.

595
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,860
Boss.

596
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,860
Pay attention to the image, too.

597
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,860
People think we're all nerds.

598
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,860
We're not nerds.

599
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,860
Ta-da.

600
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,860
Sister-in-law is here.

601
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,860
Welcome sister-in-law.

602
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,860
Welcome.

603
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,860
Let me introduce you.

604
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,860
This is our dorm's boss, Wang Senzhao.

605
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,860
Hello.

606
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,860
This is our dorm's second boss, Gao Keshan.

607
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:17,860
This is our dorm's most unreliable and most ungrateful, Song Nian.

608
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,860
Hello.

609
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,860
Sister-in-law.

610
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:21,860
I'm the most reliable in our dorm.

611
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,860
You know?

612
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,860
You're pressing my fingers all the time.

613
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,860
Get out.

614
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:26,860
What are you doing?

615
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,860
Sit down.

616
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,860
Sit down.

617
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,860
Sit down.

618
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,860
Don't be shy.

619
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,860
You're looking for me.

620
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:33,860
Where's Lin Jia Mo?

621
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,860
She should be here soon.

622
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:35,860
I'm coming.

623
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,860
I'm going to the bathroom.

624
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:37,860
Sorry.

625
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,860
Hello.

626
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,860
Hi.

627
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,860
Wei Zhu's girlfriend?

628
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,860
The bun girl?

629
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,860
Song Nian, come on.

630
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,860
Song Nian, come on.

631
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,860
Song Nian, come on.

632
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,860
Come on.

633
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,860
What are you doing?

634
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,860
Why do you put the buns in the soup?

635
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:01,860
Exactly.

636
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,860
Give it to me.

637
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,860
Don't waste the buns.

638
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:09,860
You're a heavy drinker.

639
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:12,860
Good.

640
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,860
People should admit defeat, right?

641
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,860
Stop.

642
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,860
We're coming.

643
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,860
Come on.

644
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,860
Number five.

645
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,860
This is number five.

646
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,860
You're so drunk.

647
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:43,860
You're going to eat all the buns?

648
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,860
How about I eat them?

649
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,860
Song Nian.

650
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,860
If you were a man,

651
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,860
you would've eaten the buns.

652
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:51,860
But...

653
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,860
We should be cool.

654
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:58,860
Song Qin, if you can't eat it, you can play a big adventure.

655
00:30:58,860 --> 00:30:59,860
Okay.

656
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,860
Big adventure.

657
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,860
Okay, big adventure.

658
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,860
Two minutes for the last two minutes.

659
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,860
I'm so full.

660
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,860
Get up.

661
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,860
You won.

662
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,860
Awesome, Song Qin.

663
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,860
Really?

664
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,860
It's delicious.

665
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,860
It's delicious.

666
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,860
It's delicious.

667
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,860
It's delicious.

668
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,860
I'm hungry.

669
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,860
Let me help you.

670
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:39,860
You guys are so careless.

671
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,860
Wait for me.

672
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,860
You guys must wait for me.

673
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,860
Those treasures are worse than your mouth.

674
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,860
Boss, the atmosphere is pretty good.

675
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,860
You're lucky.

676
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,860
The atmosphere is pretty good.

677
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,860
San is also good at dealing with people.

678
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,860
Lin Jia Mo is pretty good too.

679
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,860
Lin Jia Mo is pretty good.

680
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:05,860
But that girl is too sexy.

681
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:09,860
I don't know if I can handle it.

682
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,860
I...

683
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:13,860
I must...

684
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,860
I must handle Lin Jia Mo.

685
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,860
What kind of attitude is this?

686
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,860
Girl's style.

687
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,860
The buns are still warm.

688
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,860
What are you doing?

689
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:43,860
Don't you like buns?

690
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,860
I'll give you buns every day.

691
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,860
Are you kidding me?

692
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,860
Lin Jia Mo, I'm announcing that I like you.

693
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,860
I'm going to chase you in the season 5.

694
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,860
I'm announcing that I don't like you.

695
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,860
From now on, you can give up.

696
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,860
It's none of your business if I like you.

697
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:01,860
Moreover, you will like me.

698
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,860
Are you crazy?

699
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,860
The buns are still warm.

700
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,860
Don't waste it.

701
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,860
It's a waste of food.

702
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:14,860
Zhou Jia Mo, I'm going to give you a big stomach.

703
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,860
You have to be responsible for me.

704
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,860
I'm sorry.

705
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,860
What's wrong?

706
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,860
What's wrong?

707
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,860
Lin Jia Mo, calm down.

708
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,860
Turn on the light.

709
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,860
I'm scared.

710
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,860
I'm a big dinosaur.

711
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,860
Lin Jia Mo.

712
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,860
I'm going to eat you.

713
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,860
I'm still hungry.

714
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,860
I'm sorry.

715
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,860
I'm not ready yet.

716
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,860
When we get married,

717
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,860
it will be natural.

718
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,860
You have to wait for her to get married.

719
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,860
You're not going to marry me?

720
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,860
Of course I'm going to marry you.

721
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,860
I just think

722
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:05,860
it's going to be too late.

723
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,860
I just think

724
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:13,860
it's not good for us to do this now.

725
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,860
That thing...

726
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:19,860
It's actually pretty good.

727
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:22,860
It's not what you think.

728
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,860
It's so...

729
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,860
Shouldn't good things

730
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,860
stay in good times?

731
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,860
Are you angry?

732
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,860
No.

733
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,860
I just think

734
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,860
you're in college.

735
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:47,860
It's a little different from before.

736
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:50,860
Isn't this all pretty good?

737
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,860
Maybe things happened too fast.

738
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,860
I'm not used to it.

739
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,860
Let's take it slow, okay?

740
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,860
Take it slow.

741
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,860
Don't worry.

742
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,860
By the way,

743
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,860
our parents said we should go to the family dinner together.

744
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,860
Let's go together.

745
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,860
I can't go.

746
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,860
My mom said she was in a bad mood.

747
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:23,860
I've promised to go to Thailand with her.

748
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,860
I'm sorry.

749
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,860
How about this?

750
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:31,860
Don't be upset, okay?

751
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,860
I'm not upset.

752
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,860
You think I'm like you?

753
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,860
You're not afraid of being angry?

754
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,860
I'm just afraid

755
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,860
of missing you.

756
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,860
I'll miss you a lot too.

757
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,860
How about this?

758
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,860
I'll write you a letter every day.

759
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,860
Okay?

760
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,860
I'll go clean up.

761
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,860
When we were young,

762
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:08,860
we were curious and afraid of the unknown.

763
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,860
We wanted to get close but we didn't dare to touch it.

764
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,860
Often in this confusion and hesitation,

765
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,860
we missed the most sincere moment,

766
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,860
the most beautiful person.

767
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,860
Many times,

768
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,860
youth is not a sacred place of flowers,

769
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:30,860
but a chaotic and rough end.

770
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,860
The End

771
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,860
What?

772
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,860
Beautiful.

773
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,860
I gave her a cat yesterday.

774
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,860
She's making me nervous again.

775
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,860
I'm looking for it.

776
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,860
I like difficult things.

777
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,860
Lin Jia Mo is my buddy.

778
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,860
She's also my best friend.

779
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:57,860
I advise you to not think about her while you're still young.

780
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,860
So what?

781
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,860
Are you married?

782
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,860
Fair competition.

783
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,860
You're so cool.

784
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,860
You're not a man.

785
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,860
You can go to the night club.

786
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,860
Next time.

787
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,860
I'll send you to your room.

788
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,860
Your room?

789
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,860
1513.

790
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,860
Go to my room if you have time.

791
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,860
I won't be with you two today.

792
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,860
I'm a secret.

793
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,860
Wait for me.

794
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,860
I'm going home.

795
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,860
Who is he?

796
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,860
Kuang Qiang.

797
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,860
The legendary person in the club.

798
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,860
He's not bad.

799
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,860
He saved the life.

800
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,860
The nearby bar is light.

801
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:47,860
He's got a few more cooks.

802
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,860
His family is open.

803
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,860
Really?

804
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,860
He's a man.

805
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,860
I believe you have this position.

806
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,860
I don't believe him.

807
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,860
Let's go.

808
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,860
I'll kill you if you don't have anything.

809
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,860
The number you have dialed is not available.

810
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,860
Please redial later.

811
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,860
Okay.

812
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,860
Hello?

813
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,860
Hello, is Chen Xun here?

814
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,860
Shen Xiaotang?

815
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,860
Shen Xiaotang is so hot.

816
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:54,860
What have you been doing these days?

817
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,860
Nothing.

818
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,860
Staying here.

819
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,860
I checked all the lessons.

820
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,860
I know you chose this.

821
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,860
So you're a pervert.

822
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,860
Where is Chen Xun and his girlfriend?

823
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,860
What did you do today?

824
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,860
I slept.

825
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,860
You're a rocker.

826
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,860
You're all back.

827
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,860
It's your turn to do this.

828
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,860
Do you really want to see him marry someone else?

829
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:24,860
I have to care more about him.

830
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,860
At least you should know where he is.

831
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,860
I don't need to be worried about him.

832
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,860
I just want to be with him.

833
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,860
I'm so happy when I see you.

834
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,860
I'm happy to see you like this.

835
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,860
I'll go now.

836
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,860
I need to go now.

837
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,860
I'll go.

838
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,860
I'll go now.

839
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,860
I'll go now.

840
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,860
There's no need to go.

841
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,860
I'll go now.

842
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:52,860
I'll go now.

843
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,860
I'll go now.

844
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:57,860
I want to be like this.

845
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,860
Kind like a child

846
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:31,860
Give you a pure heart

847
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:33,860
Give me a pure look

848
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:37,860
Run back to their side

849
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,860
I hope this song

850
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,860
You can sing with me

851
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,860
Bring your story

852
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:48,860
And beautiful fantasy

853
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:54,860
Back to the time of that year

854
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:10,860
I hope you and I can go to the end

855
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:14,860
Can go to the sun every day

856
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,860
We go to the sunset

857
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:21,860
In the long time

858
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:25,860
The beautiful face in the breeze

859
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,860
The beauty is the smile

860
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:32,860
There are many things to tell me

861
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:37,860
I just hope the world stops here

862
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:46,860
I hope you and I can be kind like a child

863
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:48,860
Give you a pure heart

864
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:49,860
Give me a pure look

865
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:53,860
Run back to their side

866
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:57,860
I hope this song

867
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:00,860
You can sing with me

868
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:02,860
Bring your story

869
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:04,860
And beautiful fantasy

870
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:10,860
Back to the time of that year

871
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:24,860
I hope you and I can go to the end

872
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:30,860
Can go to the sun every day

873
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,860
We go to the sunset

874
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:38,860
In the long time

875
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,860
The beautiful face in the breeze

876
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:46,860
The beauty is the smile

877
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:49,860
There are many things to tell me

878
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:54,860
I just hope the world stops here

879
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:12,860
I hope you and I can have a bright landing

880
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,860
Can go to the sun every day

881
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:19,860
Put my things on the ground

882
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:26,860
In the long time
