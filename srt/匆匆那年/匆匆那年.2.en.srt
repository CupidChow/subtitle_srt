00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
This show is sponsored by the world's thinnest smartphone, E-Life.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,120
The expert in covering up the American market, Di Qiao.

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,480
Special special guest on the show.

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,160
Life is a journey that never stops.

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,600
We are trapped in the crowd.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,680
We can't turn back.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The path we've walked, the words we've said,

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,320
the things we've done,

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,600
no matter right or wrong,

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,600
there's no chance of changing.

11
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,200
This year is 2014.

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,800
Germany won the World Cup.

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,000
The horse was lost.

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm 31 years old.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Memories, to me,

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
are a journey against time and the sea.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Those who love memories will always walk slower than others.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
If a person walks backwards,

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
can time stop?

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
If time can stop,

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
which year would you like to return to?

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
2013, the civil war in Jüliya.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The super typhoon was coming.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
2012, the Olympic Games in London.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
2011, the Japanese war.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The global population was in the 70s.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The country is in a state of chaos.

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The country is in a state of chaos.

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
1999,

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
the sky was so blue.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I was 16 years old.

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,740
You will never see the truth.

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Chengxu!

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Chengxu!

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Gabriel, I miss you!

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Chengxu.

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Come down, how could you come down?

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Don't you want to eat?

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,280
Chen Xun!

40
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,580
Enough, enough, enough. Stop yelling.

41
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,680
If you keep yelling, I won't see you sit on the chair.

42
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,780
Do you know that I will deduct points for the class?

43
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,920
Yes, yes, yes.

44
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,680
As the representative of the college entrance exam,

45
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,920
since we can't get out of the class, we can't come out to get the paper.

46
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,600
That's right.

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,480
Let me be messy

48
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,080
Your old-fashioned expression is pretending

49
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,680
Can you still wear your shoes?

50
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,680
There is only one future, I'm afraid of missing you

51
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,320
Don't you want to try it?

52
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,960
Tomorrow morning

53
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,640
Boss, three noodles.

54
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,560
I'm afraid of the sun

55
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,680
I want to lock myself

56
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,420
particles of black wine

57
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,360
directly tied up in my arms

58
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,440
Come and get me pancakes

59
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,320
Go and make them pick the fact

60
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,080
I love the way I miss you

61
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,680
Let the instant noodles

62
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,320
be positions for you

63
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,700
Sat company

64
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,280
From the top

65
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,280
He's leaving. He's going to be late.

66
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,280
Go!

67
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,280
If he's late, he'll deduct points from you.

68
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,280
How many points can he deduct?

69
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,280
Who's going to deduct?

70
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,280
Go!

71
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,280
Run.

72
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,280
Run!

73
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,280
Don't come back, you bastard!

74
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,280
Who added so much chili?

75
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,280
I'm going to wait for you.

The King's Avatar

77
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,280
Why is the hair so long?

78
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,280
What's going on?

80
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,280
The rules are the same.

81
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,280
Why are you here?

82
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,280
If anyone dares to drop the ball,

83
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,280
you'll be fired.

86
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,280
The fourth row.

87
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,280
The first one in the middle.

88
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,280
The second row in the middle.

89
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,280
The second one in the middle.

90
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,280
You three, get out!

91
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,280
Do you think you're smart?

92
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,280
You're playing tricks on me?

93
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,280
Take off your pants!

94
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,280
Stand straight!

95
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,280
Don't bend your knees.

96
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,280
You're going to stand here for a day.

97
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,280
You're going to reflect on your own fault.

98
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,280
If you do it again,

99
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,280
you'll all get out of here!

100
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,280
You're not even allowed to kick the ball now.

101
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,280
Yeah.

102
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,280
It's not the right time.

103
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,280
It's time.

104
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,280
Isn't that Chen Xun?

105
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,280
He's so handsome.

106
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,280
Can't he be Qiao Ran?

107
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,280
It seems like a live magic competition

108
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,280
is going to be played tonight.

109
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,280
I can't watch it anymore.

110
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,280
There's no other way.

111
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,280
Do you have time?

112
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,280
I'll talk to Ma Hao.

113
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,280
He has to watch it.

114
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,280
The girl opposite is watching.

115
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,280
She's watching.

116
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,280
She's watching.

117
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,280
The performance here is very exciting.

118
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,280
Don't pretend you don't know.

119
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,280
The girl opposite is watching.

120
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,280
The performance here is very exciting.

121
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,280
Don't pretend you don't know.

122
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,280
The performance here is very exciting.

123
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,280
Don't pretend you don't know.

124
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,280
The performance here is very exciting.

125
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,280
The performance here is very exciting.

126
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,280
Please be quiet.

127
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,280
I have a few words to say.

128
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,280
Where there's pressure, there's resistance.

129
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,280
Are we really going to be careful until 9 o'clock today?

130
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,280
No!

131
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,280
Yes!

132
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,280
There's a saying that says,

133
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,280
the more you practice, the better you will be.

134
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,280
That's why we're putting more effort into learning.

135
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,280
So I suggest that

136
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,280
they can't accept the way they're suppressing our freedom.

137
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,280
We're going to all read the book today.

138
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,280
We're going to all read the book today.

139
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,280
All the teachers are wolves.

140
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,280
All the teachers are wolves.

141
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,280
Please calm down.

142
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,280
We're not here to fight.

143
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,280
We're here to vote for the whole country in a more democratic way.

144
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,280
Please raise your hand if you agree with me.

145
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,280
Put your foot down.

146
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,280
Raise your hand.

147
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,280
Hurry up.

148
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,280
No disagreements?

149
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,280
No!

150
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,280
All votes passed.

151
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,280
What are you looking at?

152
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,280
Are you going to be a bad person?

153
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,280
No way.

154
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,280
I was just being aggressive.

155
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,280
Last time,

156
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,280
when it was snowing,

157
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,280
everyone went out to play.

158
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,280
He was the only one who didn't go out.

159
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,280
What else was he doing?

160
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,280
He was just like that.

161
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,280
He was so strong.

162
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,280
Teacher,

163
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,280
where's Little Prince?

164
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,280
He was just taken away.

165
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,280
Come back in a few days.

166
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,280
Thank you.

167
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,280
You took care of this?

168
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,280
You're welcome.

169
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,560
Looks like Boden is good at writing.

170
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,680
Did you borrow it from this book?

171
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,880
This is my favorite book. I've read it several times.

172
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,080
I like it too.

173
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,880
I was wondering why there are always people who want to steal from me.

174
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,280
I think so too.

175
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,680
But this isn't the best version.

176
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,880
I prefer the version with the earliest commercial printing house.

177
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:43,280
Only by using your soul can you see the essence of things.

178
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,680
The real important thing is that you can't see it with your naked eyes.

179
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,880
You read it first.

180
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,280
Give it to me after you read it.

181
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,880
Who did this? Who did this?

182
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,880
Me.

183
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,880
It's you again.

184
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,880
You can be the monitor even if you do this.

185
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,880
You're annoying!

186
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,880
If you don't want to learn, get lost!

187
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,880
I want to learn.

188
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,880
If you want to learn, then you can be honest with me.

189
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,880
I've been working for so many years and I've never seen a student like you!

190
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,880
Director, I want to ask you a question.

191
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,880
How do you write characters?

192
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,880
What?

193
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,880
What do you want to do?

194
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,880
If you don't understand, I'll explain it to you.

195
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,880
One character is a piece of cake.

196
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,880
The support of the left and right is above the sky and the ground.

197
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,880
One is freedom, the other is independence.

198
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,880
You deprived us of our freedom and denied us of our independence.

199
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,880
Director, if we can't even be human, how can we be students?

200
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,880
Shut up!

201
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,880
Do you think you're in class?

202
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,880
You're lying even if you don't admit your mistakes!

203
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,880
Everyone has the right to speak. We have the right too.

204
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,880
Shut up!

205
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,880
You like to talk, right?

206
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,880
If you like to talk, I'll let you talk.

207
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,880
Write a check. 5000 words.

208
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,880
You'll be in the school all year round.

209
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,880
You'll be in class on Saturdays and Sundays.

210
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,880
Shut up!

211
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,880
Get out.

212
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,880
Come back!

213
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,880
Wipe your face!

214
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,880
Director!

215
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,880
I'll wipe it.

216
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,880
I'll wipe it.

217
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,880
Who dares to say it?

218
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,880
Director!

219
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,880
Director!

220
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,880
Director!

221
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,880
Director!

222
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,880
This is genius.

223
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,880
Genius?

224
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,880
If you're a genius, I'll ask you a question.

225
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,880
Which hand of yours is touching the ass of the toilet?

226
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,880
Left hand!

227
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,880
No paper.

228
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,880
Shut up!

229
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,880
What's wrong? Are you still playing?

230
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,880
You really fooled Ma Hao.

231
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,380
You're like a potential for me to be a

232
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,880
I have a way.

233
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,880
I promise everyone will watch the game tonight.

234
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,880
What way?

235
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,880
This way.

236
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,880
Director!

237
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,880
This one.

238
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,880
This one.

239
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,880
This one.

240
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,880
This one.

241
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,880
This one.

242
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,880
Who's director?

243
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,880
This way.

244
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,880
This way.

245
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,880
Be quiet.

246
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,880
Don't be a fool.

247
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,880
Don't be a fool.

248
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,880
Look at yourself.

249
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,880
Stop!

250
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,880
You didn't even give me my headset.

251
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,880
What?

252
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,880
Power outage!

253
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,880
Good shot.

254
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,880
Good shot.

255
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,880
What's going on?

256
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,880
Let's go.

257
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,880
Let's go.

258
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,880
What class are we in?

259
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,880
Let's go.

260
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,880
Let's go.

261
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,880
So high.

262
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,880
Let's go.

263
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,880
1, 2, 3.

264
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,880
What a shot!

265
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,880
What a shot!

266
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,880
You must be a professional player in the first day.

267
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,880
If you're a professional player, you have to be a good player.

268
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,880
What a shot!

269
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,880
What a shot!

270
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,880
What are you doing?

271
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,880
Get off me.

272
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,880
Get out of here.

273
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,880
You're still a professional player.

274
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,880
You're still a professional player.

275
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,880
You're still a professional player.

276
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,880
You're still a professional player.

277
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,880
Wang Hui.

278
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,880
Come out.

279
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,880
The one who was at the stairs just now,

280
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,880
is it him?

281
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,880
I don't know.

282
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,880
Is it him?

283
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,880
It's him.

284
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,880
He must have told us.

285
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,880
What a fool.

286
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,880
I will investigate this matter.

287
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,880
I already know who did it.

288
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,880
I advise those people,

289
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,880
to take the initiative,

290
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,880
to confess and confess.

291
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,880
You all go to the bathroom.

292
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,880
Whoever dares to move again,

293
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,880
will be executed.

294
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,880
I'm sorry.

295
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,880
I think,

296
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,880
Fang Hui must have sold us.

297
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,880
Otherwise, how can we say,

298
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,880
I can know you all.

299
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,880
Listen,

300
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,880
not one of you,

301
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,880
have such detailed information.

302
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,880
Don't look at Fang Hui,

303
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,880
he's the worst.

304
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,880
Yes.

305
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,880
Don't guess.

306
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,880
Maybe he's a split-up,

307
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,880
and he's a tiger.

308
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,880
I don't think it's him.

309
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,880
Why did he talk to him alone?

310
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,880
He was the one who fell into the trap.

311
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,880
He must have given it to the teacher.

312
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,880
You're a bitch.

313
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,880
Some people,

314
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,880
like to please the teacher,

315
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,880
betray the group,

316
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,880
he's the worst.

317
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,880
I think we should apologize,

318
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,880
in case the public will be angry.

319
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,880
We'll pay you back sooner or later.

320
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,880
Today,

321
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,880
your classmate,

322
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,880
will do the exercise on the electric.

323
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,880
Two of you,

324
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,880
move the electric here.

325
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,880
Can you move it alone?

326
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,880
Yes, teacher.

327
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,880
He can do it alone.

328
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,880
Okay, like this.

329
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,880
The rest, do the exercise.

330
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,880
Five, six, seven, eight.

331
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,880
Start.

332
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,880
One, two, three, four.

333
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,880
Let me help you.

334
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,880
Thank you.

335
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,880
Oh, no.

336
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,880
Don't care about the money.

337
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,880
Oh, no.

338
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,880
Five, six, seven, eight.

339
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,880
Four, two, three, four.

340
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,880
You're a bastard.

341
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,880
You're a bastard.

342
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,880
I'm sorry.

343
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,880
Class, you're going to teach history class?

344
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,880
Class.

345
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,880
Class.

346
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,880
Class.

347
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,880
Excuse me.

348
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,880
Class.

349
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,880
You're so vain.

350
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,880
I know.

351
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,520
It's hard.

352
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,320
You are tough.

353
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,280
Though you выполn what I told you,

354
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,600
you aren't šmioficient,

355
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:14,360
or you can

356
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,680
Are you happy now,

357
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,880
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

358
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,880
It's there.

359
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,880
How do you know?

360
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,880
I read the code.

361
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,880
This is the number.

362
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,880
This is the classification number.

363
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,880
This is the price number.

364
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,880
This is the number.

365
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,880
In general, libraries are all so different.

366
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,880
So professional.

367
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,880
I usually bring it here.

368
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,880
Don't take it too seriously.

369
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,880
They are looking for you.

370
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,880
I know.

371
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,880
I know you didn't tell Mi.

372
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,880
Because the person who likes Little Prince

373
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,880
can't do such a thing.

374
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,880
Good.

375
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,880
You are so boring.

376
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,880
Let me help you.

377
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,880
Do you need water?

378
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,880
No, thanks.

379
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,880
Don't say that.

380
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,880
They...

381
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,880
Don't worry.

382
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,880
I'm used to it.

383
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,880
You passed?

384
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,880
You just passed.

385
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,880
What did you mean by what you said?

386
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,880
I didn't punish anyone in school.

387
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,880
It means that Fang Hui didn't tell Mi.

388
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,880
Which side are you on?

389
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,880
I'm not on either side.

390
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,880
I'm pointing at the truth.

391
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,880
You are so stubborn.

392
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,880
You are so soft-hearted.

393
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,880
You are so manly all day.

394
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,880
You are a man.

395
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,880
You bully a girl.

396
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,880
You are a man.

397
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,880
You are a man.

398
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,880
You are a man.

399
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,880
Who are you talking about?

400
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,880
I'm talking about you.

401
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,880
No.

402
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,880
You are bullying a girl.

403
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,880
You are so manly.

404
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,880
Xiao Ran.

405
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,880
You are so soft-hearted.

406
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,880
You are so soft-hearted.

407
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,880
So soft-hearted.

408
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,880
You are...

409
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,880
You are...

410
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,880
You are...

411
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,880
These people are so annoying.

412
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,880
If I were them, I would let them eat my money.

413
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,880
You are in Class One.

414
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,880
What a coincidence.

415
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,880
I just transferred to the test.

416
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,880
I'm in Class One.

417
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,880
My name is Lin Jia Mo.

418
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,880
Hello.

419
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,880
Hello.

420
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,880
My name is Fang Hui.

421
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,880
Which Hui?

422
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,880
The Hui from the word grass.

423
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,880
I'm Mo Er.

424
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,880
You are so lucky.

425
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,880
We are so fated.

426
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,880
I don't know where to get the money.

427
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,880
Let me take you there.

428
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,880
Great.

429
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,880
Thank you.

430
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,880
Let's go.

431
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,880
Give it to me.

432
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,880
I'll help you.

433
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,880
Let's eat.

434
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,880
You are so strong.

435
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,880
You can eat anything.

436
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,880
You are so good at cooking.

437
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,880
You are so good at cooking.

438
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,880
Smell it.

439
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,880
I don't know where to get the money.

440
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,880
I'm hungry.

441
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,880
You eat mine.

442
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,880
How about you?

443
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,880
It's okay. I eat less.

444
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,880
We can share it.

445
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,880
I'll help you.

446
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,880
I like the sweet and sour pork ribs the most.

447
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,880
You eat it.

448
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,880
Why do you say Fang Hui is so close to the new transfer student?

449
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,880
You are so good at it.

450
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,880
You are so good at it.

451
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,880
We finally have someone who can help us.

452
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,880
You are so kind.

453
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,880
I'm so sorry.

454
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,880
You don't know me, do you?

455
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,880
Let me introduce myself.

456
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,880
I'm Zhao Ye, a famous expert in the big experiment in the south city.

457
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,880
I'm also a good master of the fire and fire.

458
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,880
You are so rude.

459
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,880
What's your name?

460
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,880
Lin Jia Mo?

461
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,880
Which school are you from?

462
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,880
I'm from the fourth grade.

463
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,880
The fourth grade?

464
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,880
The fourth grade?

465
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,880
The fourth grade?

466
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,880
How did you transfer here?

467
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,880
I moved here.

468
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,880
You like the fire and fire expert, too?

469
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,880
I like Liu Chuan Feng.

470
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,880
I like Liu Chuan Feng, too.

471
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,880
You forgot what Chen Xing said.

472
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,880
You can't eat with a traitor.

473
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,880
Who is a traitor?

474
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,880
Who are you talking about?

475
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,880
You are a primary school student.

476
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,880
You don't play with this.

477
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,880
Are you interested in it?

478
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,880
Let's go.

479
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,880
Go up.

480
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,880
Go up.

481
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,880
Go down right.

482
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,880
The radar hasn't been turned on.

483
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,880
Qiao Ran.

484
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,880
Give me more resources.

485
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,880
Power on.

486
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,880
Hurry up.

487
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,880
Let's go.

488
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,880
Let's go.

489
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,880
Did he get hurt?

490
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,880
I'm going to play.

491
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,880
Come on.

492
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,880
Let's beat him.

493
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,880
Don't run.

494
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,880
Come on.

495
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,880
Beat him.

496
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,880
The plane.

497
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,880
The plane.

498
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,880
The plane.

499
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,880
I'm going.

500
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,880
It's too hard.

501
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,880
Come on.

502
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,880
Give me a drink.

503
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,880
I...

504
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,880
Well.

505
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,880
Do you think

506
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,880
our investigation

507
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,880
will be told to his parents?

508
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,880
If I tell my dad

509
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,880
about it,

510
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,880
he will kill me.

511
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,880
I don't think there is anything

512
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,880
going on in the school.

513
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,880
I guess it's okay.

514
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,880
It's up to him.

515
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,880
Didn't you say Zang Hui was secretive?

516
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,880
So I said he didn't tell anyone.

517
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,880
Are you two playing?

518
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,880
Why do you always say something else?

519
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,880
Hurry up.

520
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,880
I'm going to open the map.

521
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,880
Come on.

522
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,880
Go back.

523
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,880
Sit down.

524
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,880
It's been a week.

525
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,880
No one comes to me to turn himself in.

526
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,880
You are brave enough.

527
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,880
I'll give you one last chance.

528
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,880
When will someone admit it?

529
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,880
When will you stop studying?

530
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,880
No one talks?

531
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,880
Okay.

532
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,880
In that case,

533
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,880
don't blame me for being rude.

534
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,880
I'm going back.

535
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,880
Stand up.

536
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,880
You are a bad student.

537
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,880
You are guilty of the same crime as a bad student.

538
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,880
I'll give you one last chance.

539
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,880
Say it.

540
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,880
Who did it?

541
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,880
Say it.

542
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,880
I don't know.

543
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,880
I won't say it.

544
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,880
If you don't say it, I'll kill you.

545
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,880
Go to the next round.

546
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,880
Go.

547
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,880
You can't run.

548
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,880
You can't run.

549
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,880
You can't run.

550
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,880
You can't run.

551
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,880
You can't run.

552
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,880
You can't run.

553
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,880
Hold on.

554
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,880
Hold on.

555
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,880
Hold on.

556
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,880
Why are you here?

557
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,880
You're so excited to see me.

558
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,880
You're so scared.

559
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,880
Brother Hu is here too.

560
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:42,880
Everyone recalls their youth and the years of youth.

561
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,880
They will remember some people.

562
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,880
No matter how much they've been hurt and how much they've experienced,

563
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,880
these people will never change.

564
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:55,880
No matter what they're doing, what they're facing,

565
00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:00,880
when they think of them, their whole body will be filled with magical power.

566
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:06,880
If time can come, I only wish to return to that playground

567
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,880
and keep going forward with them.

568
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,880
Never stop, keep going forward.

569
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,880
You're so awesome, Fang Hui.

570
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,880
I have to apologize to you for this.

571
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,880
I was a bit too much.

572
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,880
I'm sorry.

573
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,880
To be honest,

574
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,880
when you walked out, you were too strong.

575
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,880
Yes, yes, yes. I was so cool just now.

576
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,880
I felt like my whole body was glowing.

577
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,880
Don't say that. I'm embarrassed.

578
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,880
You didn't come in just now.

579
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,880
The monkey's face is all green.

580
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,880
You ran away with me.

581
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,880
If you can't run, climb back with me.

582
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,880
This is all thanks to Fang Hui's justice.

583
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,880
Heroine,

584
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,880
you have to take care of yourself in the future.

585
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,880
This is a new way of teaching, right?

586
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,880
Friends should share the same burden.

587
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,880
Yes, yes, yes.

588
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,880
I suggest that we should all go to the same level.

589
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,880
Brother, you're so wise.

590
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,880
Well,

591
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,880
I don't care if you're bad at language,

592
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,880
you can't even do math.

593
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,880
How many people are there?

594
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,880
Let's play chess.

595
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,880
I think it's fine.

596
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,880
Let's play a game.

597
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,880
I'll do it.

598
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,880
Heaven above,

599
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,880
the land is important.

600
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,880
You're kidding.

601
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,880
I'm serious.

602
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,880
Well,

603
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,880
in this matter,

604
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,880
I did something wrong.

605
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,880
I apologize to everyone.

606
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,880
To express my sincerity,

607
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,880
I just bought a wedding dress and a VCD.

608
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,880
Let's watch it together.

609
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,880
I like it.

610
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,880
I really like this film.

611
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,880
Let's go to Qiao An's house to watch it.

612
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,880
Go to your house and make it.

613
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,880
Okay?

614
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,880
How about another day?

615
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,880
I have something to do with Fang Hui.

616
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,880
What's so mysterious?

617
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,880
Nothing.

618
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,880
We'll go to the bookstore to buy a book.

619
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,880
Buy a book?

620
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,880
What book?

621
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,880
Are you serious?

622
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,880
Go.

623
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,880
We're leaving first.

624
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,880
Bye.

625
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,880
Bye.

626
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,880
Bye.

627
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,880
She's gone.

628
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,880
The comedy is a tragedy.

629
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,880
Let's go together.

630
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,880
Go to hell.

631
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,880
Let's go together.

632
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,880
Jiang Hua.

633
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,880
Why is it me?

634
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,880
I think you're interesting.

635
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,880
Really?

636
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,880
Forget it.

637
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,880
Are you okay?

638
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,880
Who are you?

639
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,880
Do you remember me?

640
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,880
You're so cute.

641
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,880
I'm so happy.

642
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,880
Call me dad.

643
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,880
I'll sign for you.

644
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,880
Dad.

645
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,880
I just turned around.

646
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,880
Hey you, let me go.

647
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,880
Make another day nice.

648
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,880
Hey you, let me fall.

649
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,880
Let me dance and I'll be fine.

650
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,880
Hey you, my best friend.

651
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,880
What a good chance to get high.

652
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,880
Put me high.

653
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,880
Put me high.

654
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:28,880
Everyone

655
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,880

663
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,880
Suddenly look back.

664
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,880
Look back.

665
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,880
My heart is beating.

666
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:21,880
Go to hell.

667
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,880
Hey you, let me go.

668
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,880

Put me high.
