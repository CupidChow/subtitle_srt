00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:24,680
The American

3
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,400
I'm going to the UK.

4
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,400
I'm with Su Kai.

5
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,400
Su Kai!

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,920
Su Yun!

7
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,920
Lin Jiang Mo, I like you!

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,680
Fang Hui, welcome to a new life.

9
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,680
Your love life is a bit harsh.

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,160
Lin Jiang Mo, I'm announcing that I like you.

11
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,160
You promised me before.

12
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,120
Do you want to date me?

13
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,400
I have a girlfriend.

14
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,400
If you have something to say, just say it.

15
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,400
This person has already gone out of prison.

16
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,400
When did this happen?

17
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,400
Where's Sister Ding? I'll give it to you.

18
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,400
I think it's quite interesting.

19
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,400
Did you forget our friendship?

20
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,400
Do you like Shen Xiaotang?

21
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,400
Who?

22
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,400
Fang Hui!

23
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,400
I'm going to the UK.

24
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,400
I'm going to the UK.

25
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,400
I'm going to the UK.

26
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,400
I'm going to the UK.

27
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,400
I'm going to the UK.

28
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,400
I'm going to the UK.

29
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,400
I'm going to the UK.

30
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,400
I'm going to the UK.

31
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,400
I'm going to the UK.

32
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,400
I'm going to the UK.

33
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,400
I'm going to the UK.

34
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,400
I'm going to the UK.

35
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,400
I'm going to the UK.

36
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,400
I'm going to the UK.

37
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,400
I'm going to the UK.

38
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,400
I'm going to the UK.

39
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,400
I'm going to the UK.

40
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,400
I'm going to the UK.

41
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,400
I'm going to the UK.

42
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,400
When did you come back?

43
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,400
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

44
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,400
That's just a surprise.

45
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,400
Look what I brought for you, Fang Hui.

46
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,800
I'll take care of this now.

47
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,800
Bye then.

48
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,360
Little Prince's rose,

49
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,440
do you like it?

50
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,520
Thank you.

51
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,040
It must be tiring to fly international flights.

52
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,680
No.

53
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,640
I flew at noon.

54
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,400
It took me about 12 hours.

55
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,040
When I just left the airport,

56
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,320
it was morning in Beijing.

57
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,200
So I spent a long day there.

58
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,240
How was your life there?

59
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,080
It was like a dream.

60
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,480
I was used to it for a long time.

61
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,600
It felt unreal.

62
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,120
If it were me,

63
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,520
I would have run back long ago.

64
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,840
Do you remember

65
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,800
when the little prince was in a bad mood,

66
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,120
he liked to watch the sunset the most?

67
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,800
I was thinking

68
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,240
how good it would be if I could go to the planet.

69
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,720
There were 43 sunsets in a day.

70
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,440
It was a short day.

71
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,000
I was too busy to do anything.

72
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,160
So I went there.

73
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,800
Why did you come to Seuitive Palace?

74
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,400
I wanted to see the stars.

75
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,280
There was a very impressive one.

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,440
Bearing this komunivity,

77
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,120
it made me feel very proud.

78
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,040
This much salt isą

79
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,520
for the whole years at 숨Prina 120000

80
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,520
I'm sorry.

81
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,360
When my dad passed away,

82
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,760
I was a little selfish.

83
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,480
My mom took me here every day.

84
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,280
Do you remember

85
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,480
the feeling of sadness?

86
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,600
Yes.

87
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,360
We will slowly find out

88
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,480
that the pain in my heart

89
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,360
is a layer of fog.

90
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,200
When the fog is blown away,

91
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,720
I realize

92
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,560
that it's because the things I lost

93
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,160
are too beautiful.

94
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
So,

95
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,000
you remember those happy things

96
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,040
and then you forget

97
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,000
the feeling of sadness.

98
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,440
How is that possible?

99
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,120
But I believe

100
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,600
everything will be fine.

101
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,800
textbooks

102
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,240
The end

103
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,440
Zhang Yi.

104
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,360
What's wrong?

105
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,360
What's wrong?

106
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,360
Come and wait for me to work.

107
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,360
Didn't you say that when you're free, we can go together?

108
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,360
I'm not free.

109
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,360
Then when are you free?

110
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,360
There's a weekend, right?

111
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,360
Yes.

112
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,360
I'm not free on weekends.

113
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,360
What do you mean?

114
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,360
I don't mean anything.

115
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,360
Don't be busy.

116
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,360
You have to live your life.

117
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,360
What are you talking about?

118
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,360
Forget it.

119
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,360
Don't come to me.

120
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,360
Why are you so distant?

121
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,360
Why?

122
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,360
Aren't we friends?

123
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,360
Friends?

124
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,360
You're a college student.

125
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,360
I'm a person who has been in the army.

126
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,360
Can we be strangers?

127
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,360
I don't need your sympathy.

128
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,360
I don't need your sympathy.

129
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,360
You don't have to be so distant.

130
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,360
I can't.

131
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,360
I'm sorry.

132
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,360
You're back.

133
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,360
Why didn't you say anything?

134
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,360
What's wrong?

135
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,360
What are you doing?

136
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,360
You...

137
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,360
You know it yourself.

138
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,360
I'm sorry, Fang Ruixin.

139
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,360
I'm sorry, Fang Ruixin.

140
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,360
You said you were sorry, Fang Ruixin.

141
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,360
You know you're sorry.

142
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,360
Stop it!

143
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,360
Stop fighting!

144
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,360
I found Zhao Ye.

145
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,360
He's at the Four Seas Night Club.

146
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,360
Why is he at the club?

147
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,360
I've been looking for him many times.

148
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,360
He ignored me.

149
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,360
I'm so anxious.

150
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,360
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

151
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,360
He didn't let me say it.

152
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,360
I know you're angry.

153
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,360
But Zhao Ye is like this now.

154
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,360
I'm really worried about him.

155
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,360
Don't worry.

156
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,360
I'll go find him now.

157
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,360
Don't tell Zhao Ye about your business.

158
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,360
I know.

159
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,360
Don't worry.

160
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,360
Zhao Ye, someone's looking for you.

161
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,360
Are you okay, Zhao Ye?

162
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,360
Zhao Ye.

163
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,360
Qiao, Xun.

164
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,360
What are you doing here?

165
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,360
Why didn't you tell me?

166
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,360
I can't find you.

167
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,360
What?

168
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,360
You don't know Lin Jia Mo is here to block you?

169
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,360
Why are you hiding from us?

170
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,360
No.

171
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,360
You should tell us when you come out.

172
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,360
Do you know where we are looking for you?

173
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,360
You didn't tell us when you moved out.

174
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,360
Who do you think we are?

175
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,360
What's the point of meeting?

176
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,360
We're not on the same side.

177
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,360
Who are you talking about?

178
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,360
We're brothers.

179
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,360
You shouldn't have come out to meet us.

180
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,360
You shouldn't have told us.

181
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,360
I'm begging you.

182
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,360
Go away. I don't want to see you.

183
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,360
You should have said it clearly.

184
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,360
Zhao Ye.

185
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,360
Are you still calling us brothers?

186
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,360
Chen Xun was kneeling down for you.

187
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,360
Are you worthy of him?

188
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,360
Do you know

189
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,360
what I'm thinking about inside?

190
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,360
I'm thinking

191
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,360
what you're doing every day.

192
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,360
I'm thinking about that Nike Cup.

193
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,360
I'm thinking about the game you gave me.

194
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
Every game,

195
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,360
you even broke your arm.

196
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,360
I'm thinking about you.

197
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,360
I'm thinking about you.

198
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,360
I'm thinking about you.

199
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,360
I'm thinking about you.

200
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,360
When I was playing,

201
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,360
I was right next to you.

202
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,360
I still remember the game you were looking forward to.

203
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,360
Right. Do you remember?

204
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,360
You even played a little game.

205
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,360
You didn't want to play.

206
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,360
Who wants to play?

207
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,360
I'm not a player who plays outside the stadium.

208
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,360
I'm not a player who plays outside the stadium.

209
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,360
You just want to be a captain.

210
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,360
Coach, you haven't played for a long time.

211
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,360
Can you still play?

212
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,360
What do you mean?

213
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,360
I can't play. I have to work.

214
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,360
Coach, what are you doing?

215
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,360
The manager is looking for you everywhere.

216
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,360
I'll be right there.

217
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,360
I'm going to work.

218
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,360
Let's talk later.

219
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,360
Coach,

220
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,360
let's go another day.

221
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,360
Okay.

222
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,360
Let's

223
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,360
five people.

224
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,360
What about

225
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,360
the rest?

226
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,360
Just five of us.

227
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,360
Okay, that's it.

228
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,360
I'm going first.

229
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,360
I'm going.

230
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,360
You didn't sleep well last night.

231
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,360
Didn't you say you'd come to me in two days?

232
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,360
Last night,

233
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,360
we had a dinner party.

234
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,360
Last night.

235
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,360
How is he?

236
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,360
He's getting older.

237
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,360
He's not in a good state.

238
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,360
I really want to see him.

239
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,360
He said

240
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,360
he wanted to see us together.

241
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,540
At the

242
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,540
Yuhua restaurant.

243
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,360
Five people?

244
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,360
Can you think of it?

245
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,360
I'm fine.

246
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,360
That's right.

247
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,360
That's right.

248
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,360
Suo Xiaoqin,

249
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,360
my Anna.

250
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,360
Which show do you agree with?

251
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,360
It doesn't matter.

252
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,360
Do you think I'm a bad person?

253
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,360
You're definitely wrong.

254
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,360
I'm the director of our school's drama club.

255
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,360
I really think

256
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,360
I'm going to do a play.

257
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,360
Anna Kalinina,

258
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,360
I think you're a great actress.

259
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,360
You're a great actress.

260
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,360
I can't.

261
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,360
Why not?

262
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
Have you seen the drama?

263
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,360
That's the tradition of our school.

264
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,360
I have my work every year.

265
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,360
Last year's Mangsang,

266
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,360
last year's Lanwei,

267
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,360
I did it.

268
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,360
You can't do it.

269
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,360
I can't do it.

270
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,360
Who can?

271
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,360
He can't do it.

272
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,360
You're talented.

273
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,360
You have me.

274
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,360
I can adjust you.

275
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,360
You must be interested in the heroine.

276
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,360
You must be interested in the heroine.

277
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,360
I'm the boyfriend of Wu Yiguang.

278
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,360
Welcome to the art hall.

279
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,360
Come and have a look.

280
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,360
Come on, you two.

281
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,360
How is it?

282
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,360
Is it good?

283
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,360
Is there any feeling?

284
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,360
A very sacred stage performance.

285
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,360
You will perform here in the future.

286
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,360
Are you happy?

287
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,360
Come on, stop the work in your hands.

288
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,360
Stop it. I'm the director.

289
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,360
Respect me.

290
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,360
I've worked hard.

291
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,360
The first female actor in our show,

292
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,360
Zuo Xiaoqing.

293
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,360
Fang Hui.

294
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,360
Fang Hui.

295
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,360
Let's give her a round of applause.

296
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,360
Everyone is very enthusiastic.

297
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,360
Director.

298
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,360
Why are you late?

299
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,360
The first female actor is very suitable for Zuo Xiaoqing.

300
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,360
Let me introduce.

301
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,360
This is our second female actor.

302
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,360
She is very talented.

303
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,360
Shen Xiaotang.

304
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,360
Shen Xiaotang.

305
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,360
Do you want to play Zuo Xiaoqing?

306
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,360
Look at her panic.

307
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,360
What's going on?

308
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,360
Hello.

309
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,360
Director, I'm sorry.

310
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,360
We have something else to do.

311
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,360
What's going on?

312
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,360
What's worse than acting?

313
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,360
You think I'm a fool?

314
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,360
Fang Hui.

315
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,360
Let's stop acting.

316
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,360
I'm fine.

317
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,360
Why don't you talk?

318
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,360
You don't understand.

319
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,360
I had a strong love.

320
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,360
But now my love is more slow.

321
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,360
It's more long-lasting.

322
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,360
When she left with you,

323
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,360
I did curse.

324
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,360
But now I won't.

325
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,360
You forgot the taste of love.

326
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,360
The taste of love.

327
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,360
Living like you,

328
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,360
there is no love.

329
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,360
It's just a habit.

330
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,360
It's no different from grave.

331
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,360
What you said...

332
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,360
The taste of love you said...

333
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,360
Is it the taste of burnt pepper?

334
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,360
I can't see...

335
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,360
I can't see...

336
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,360
Love gives you

337
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,360
any happy expression.

338
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,360
Okay.

339
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,360
Then you say.

340
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,360
Tell me the love you understand.

341
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,360
Love is...

342
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,360
Stop.

343
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,360
Don't be anxious.

344
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,360
This is not right.

345
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,360
This is your character's heart.

346
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,360
Your character has actions.

347
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,360
You have to do this.

348
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,360
You have to speak louder.

349
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,360
You can't speak out.

350
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,360
Okay.

351
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,360
Let's do it again.

352
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,360
If you really feel uncomfortable,

353
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,360
you can speak out.

354
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,360
As long as it's right.

355
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,360
Right.

356
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,360
Think of your ex-boyfriend.

357
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,360
Your love.

358
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,360
Let's do it again.

359
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,360
I'll help you.

360
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,360
Then you say.

361
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,360
Tell me your understanding of love.

362
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,360
Love is pure.

363
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,360
It's complete.

364
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,360
When in pure love,

365
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,360
you paint other colors,

366
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,360
this kind of love

367
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,360
is no longer perfect.

368
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,360
It can't be called love.

369
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,360
You'd better not.

370
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,360
Director.

371
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,360
I think he's changed.

372
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,360
It doesn't seem right.

373
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,360
It's a little different from the character.

374
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,360
Trust me.

375
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,360
You have to be confident.

376
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,360
This stage is yours.

377
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,360
Understand?

378
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,360
Come on.

379
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,360
Look at me.

380
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,360
Look at my eyes.

381
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,360
It doesn't matter if you don't look.

382
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,360
Hold my hand.

383
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,360
Don't be nervous.

384
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,360
Hold my hand.

385
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,360
Every step you take,

386
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,360
your heart is beating.

387
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,360
It's beating.

388
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,360
It's beating.

389
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,360
Understand?

390
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,360
What are you doing?

391
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,360
I'm talking to the actors.

392
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,360
I'm doing art.

393
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,360
Director.

394
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,360
The light is about to break.

395
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,360
What's wrong with the light?

396
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,360
Don't make trouble.

397
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,360
What are you talking about?

398
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,360
Where's my light broken?

399
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,360
Sit down.

400
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,360
I'm doing art.

401
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,360
The airport teacher?

402
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,360
I'm doing art.

403
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,360
I'm doing art.

404
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,360
Kill him.

405
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,360
Okay.

406
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,360
Did you see it?

407
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,360
Where's my hand?

408
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,360
I saw it.

409
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,360
Get away.

410
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,360
I'm so mad.

411
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,360
You thought you could control it.

412
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,360
You knew it.

413
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,360
You can't be a teammate

414
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,360
if you like two girls at the same time.

415
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,360
What do you mean?

416
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,360
I'm joking.

417
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,360
I'm joking.

418
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,360
Do you think I'm not sad?

419
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,360
To be honest,

420
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,360
you're a little bit greedy.

421
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,360
You're a secretive person.

422
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,360
You want to be good at it.

423
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,360
Who wants to be good at it?

424
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,360
I just want to make the fans feel good.

425
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,360
I just want to make Fang Hui feel better.

426
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,360
He's always so serious.

427
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,360
He likes to hold back.

428
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,360
What if he gets sick?

429
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,360
What should we do?

430
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,360
You're thinking too much.

431
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,360
If you want him to get better,

432
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,360
unless you break the balance,

433
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,360
don't be ugly.

434
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,360
Think about both sides.

435
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,360
You'll lose twice.

436
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,360
So you mean

437
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,360
I don't care about him?

438
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,360
You can't.

439
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,360
You're not from the Northeast.

440
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,360
Why are you so aggressive?

441
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,360
What's going on?

442
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,360
This photo

443
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,360
looks like Song Tao's grandson.

444
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,360
Look at him.

445
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,360
Look at him.

446
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,360
You're good.

447
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,360
He doesn't love you for nothing.

448
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,360
You're so angry.

449
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,360
Did you learn it when your dad was away?

450
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,360
I'm sorry I'm late.

451
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,360
We'll drink later.

452
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,360
Right.

453
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,360
I'll introduce you to everyone again today.

454
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,360
Shen Xiao Tang,

455
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,360
my girlfriend.

456
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,360
Sit down.

457
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,360
Shen Xiao Tang, come.

458
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,360
You're close.

459
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,360
You'll drink later.

460
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,360
I heard you two got the certificate.

461
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,360
Yes.

462
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,360
We must get it.

463
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,360
Let's take a picture.

464
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,360
I'll take a look.

465
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,360
It's good.

466
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,360
National certification.

467
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,360
It's so nice.

468
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,360
You two should hurry up.

469
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,360
Brothers and sisters,

470
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,360
we have a new beginning

471
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,360
in Shenzhen Anjia Liye,

472
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,360
the daughter of our late father.

473
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,360
Why do you have so many

474
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,360
literary skills?

475
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,360
I'm hosting the wedding.

476
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,360
You must invite me to host it.

477
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,360
You're not reliable.

478
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,360
Cheers.

479
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,360
Chen Xu,

480
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,360
why do you have such a good wife?

481
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,360
Your mother doesn't do good things.

482
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,360
Why do you have such a good life?

483
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,360
Go to your mother's.

484
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,360
I think

485
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,360
your mother will get the certificate tomorrow.

486
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,360
Right. Hurry up.

487
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,360
Why are you so heavy?

488
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,360
I'm not fat.

489
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,360
Let me tell you.

490
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,360
What?

491
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,360
I'm not fat.

492
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,360
I'm not.

493
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,360
When do you think we'll get married?

494
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,360
As long as you want.

495
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,360
Really?

496
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,360
I think

497
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,360
we should run away

498
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,360
to the faraway place.

499
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,360
Okay?

500
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,360
Will you come back?

501
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,360
Let's get this first.

502
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,360
Okay.

503
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,360
You pay me nine yuan.

504
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,360
Okay.

505
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,360
It's late.

506
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,360
It's half past ten.

507
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,360
What if I can't go back to eat?

508
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,360
I'll go with you.

509
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,360
I'll go with you.

510
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,360
I'm so sorry.

511
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,360
When I was away,

512
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,360
I missed you so much.

513
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,360
I don't know

514
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,360
Chen Xu and Chen Xiao Ni

515
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,360
are still together.

516
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,360
I don't know

517
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,360
what happened between them.

518
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,360
I don't know.

519
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,360
I don't know.

520
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,360
I don't know why

521
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,360
Chen Xu and Fang Hui

522
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,360
broke up.

523
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,360
I don't know

524
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,360
what happened between Zhao Ye and him.

525
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,360
I only know

526
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,360
Zhao Ye

527
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,360
is not the Zhao Ye

528
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,360
we know.

529
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,360
Don't think like that.

530
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,360
Zhao Ye is still the Zhao Ye.

531
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,360
Zhao Ye.

532
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,360
I only care about him.

533
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,360
Jia Mu.

534
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,360
We have to be confident about him.

535
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,360
Give him more time

536
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,360
to find him.

537
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,360
They're here.

538
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,360
Let's go.

539
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,360
Let me say something.

540
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,360
Let's make a deal.

541
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,360
In front of Zhao Ye today,

542
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,360
no one is allowed to step on the bad things.

543
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,360
Okay?

544
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,360
Let's go.

545
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,360
Let's go.

546
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,360
Zhou Xiao Hua, you're finally here.

547
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,360
I thought you wouldn't come.

548
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,360
Sit down.

549
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,360
It's almost time to rest.

550
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,360
I almost didn't find you.

551
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,360
Hello.

552
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,360
How is it? Did you drink anything today?

553
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,360
I did.

554
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,360
Is the skin white?

555
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,360
Yes.

556
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,360
Waiter, five bottles of beer.

557
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,360
One box.

558
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,360
Well,

559
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,360
I haven't seen you for a long time.

560
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,360
I'm back.

561
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,360
You're good, Chen Xu.

562
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,360
Zhao Ye, look at these dishes.

563
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,360
They're all your favorites.

564
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,360
Have some dishes.

565
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,360
Thank you.

566
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,360
Do you remember?

567
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,360
Yes, I do.

568
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,360
Our signature is on it.

569
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,360
You still keep it?

570
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,360
So easy.

571
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,360
When I see this,

572
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,360
I remember the year...

573
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,360
Come on.

574
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,360
You're all drunk.

575
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,360
Zhao Ye, come out.

576
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,360
I can't talk.

577
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,360
I can't talk.

578
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,360
The first glass of beer,

579
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,360
welcome back.

580
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,360
Thank you.

581
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,360
Fang Hui,

582
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,360
you can't drink like that.

583
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,360
You'll get drunk.

584
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,360
You should take care of your wife.

585
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,360
Zhao Ye,

586
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,360
you're in Jia Mo, right?

587
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,360
Well,

588
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,360
Jia Mo,

589
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,360
I was

590
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,360
rude.

591
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,360
Don't mind it.

592
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,360
I apologize.

593
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,360
I'll punish myself.

594
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,360
Actually,

595
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,360
I did something wrong.

596
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,360
I'm sorry.

597
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,360
I'm sorry.

598
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,360
I'm sorry.

599
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,360
Zhao Ye.

600
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,360
Fang Hui.

601
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,360
It's great

602
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,360
that you're back.

603
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,360
I'll toast you.

604
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,360
Thank you.

605
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,360
Fang Hui, drink slowly.

606
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,360
Drink slowly.

607
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,360
Stop drinking.

608
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,360
Qiao Ran,

609
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,360
I wish you all the best in England.

610
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,360
It's okay.

611
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,360
Jia Mo,

612
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,360
thank you

613
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,360
for always being with me.

614
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,360
Thank you.

615
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,360
What's wrong?

616
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,360
Chen Xun,

617
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,360
I wish you and Shen Xiao Tang...

618
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,360
Can you stop talking about it?

619
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,360
Why?

620
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,360
Zhao Ye,

621
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,360
I and Chen Xun...

622
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,360
Can you stop talking about it?

623
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,360
He's good to others.

624
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,360
Fang Hui.

625
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,360
No.

626
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,360
Really?

627
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,360
What are you doing?

628
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,360
Who are you hitting?

629
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,360
Is it your turn to hit?

630
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,360
Is it your turn to hit?

631
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,360
I'll hit you.

632
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,360
I'll hit you.

633
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,360
Mom, don't go.

634
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,360
What did you tell me?

635
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,360
You said you'd take good care of him.

636
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,360
And you're taking care of him like this?

637
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,360
You're a jerk.

638
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,360
Li Yu,

639
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,360
you said you'd

640
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,360
be with him forever.

641
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,360
Li Yu,

642
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,360
you said you'd be his brother.

643
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,360
You've changed.

644
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,360
Brother?

645
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,360
Do you take me as your brother?

646
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,360
Okay.

647
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,360
Why didn't you contact us after you got out of prison?

648
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,360
Why did you hide from us?

649
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,360
You said we were brothers, right?

650
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,360
Yes.

651
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,360
You're all right.

652
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,360
It's my fault.

653
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,360
It's all right.

654
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,360
It's all right.

655
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,360
That's

656
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,360
the reason

657
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,360
why you called me here today.

658
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,360
That's the reason why you called me here today.

659
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,360
Come on, hit me.

660
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,360
Come on, hit me.

661
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,360
Come on, hit me.

662
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,360
Come on, hit me.

663
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,360
Hit me.

664
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,360
I'll kill you.

665
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,360
I'll make you two pay.

666
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,360
What's this?

667
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,360
What's this?

668
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,360
They don't eat anything.

669
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,360
Thank you so much.

670
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,360
Look at yourselves.

671
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,360
We didn't say we were the best five in high school.

672
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,360
Do you forget?

673
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,360
Do you forget?

674
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,360
What's wrong with you?

675
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,360
They killed me.

676
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,360
When you are not,

677
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,360
no one

678
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,360
will kill you.

679
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,360
One chairman

680
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,360
was even killed

681
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,360
two people were even killed

682
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,360
three men were even

683
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,360
killed

684
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,360
Electra

685
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,560
What's wrong with you?

686
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,360
You shouldn't have appointment

687
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,360
I'm sorry.

688
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Xun Xun.

689
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,560
When we break up,

690
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,600
you can't leave me.

691
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,360
No.

692
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,240
Wen Hui.

693
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,600
I know you hate me.

694
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,960
You hate me.

695
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,040
Can you stop treating yourself like this?

696
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,320
I feel so bad.

697
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,360
Wen Hui.

698
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,160
I'm sorry.

699
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,880
I remember you told me

700
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,560
you would never say sorry to me.

701
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,680
I remember.

702
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,360
Do you remember

703
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,360
we drew a board together

704
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,360
and went home together?

705
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,360
I kissed you.

706
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,360
Do you remember you took me to the karaoke

707
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,360
and gave me a ring?

708
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,360
Do you remember

709
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:03,360
you said we would get married

710
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,360
and have a baby?

711
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,360
We would be together forever.

712
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,360
I remember.

713
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,360
I remember. I remember everything.

714
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,360
Wen Hui.

715
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,360
Xun Xun.

716
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,360
Can we break up?

717
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,360
Can we break up?

718
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,360
Just like before.

719
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,360
We can get married and get back together.

720
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,360
Xun Xun.

721
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,360
Let's not get married again.

722
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,360
Let's not get separated again.

723
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,360
Okay?

724
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,360
Don't be like this.

725
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,360
Tell me how to break up.

726
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,360
Tell me.

727
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,360
I know.

728
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,360
I know I did wrong in many places.

729
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,360
I'll change.

730
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,360
Can I change?

731
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,360
I can't change.

732
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,360
Don't be like this.

733
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:24,360
Why do you want me?

734
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,360
I love you.

735
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,360
Wen Hui.

736
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,360
Don't be like this.

737
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,360
You can't be like this.

738
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,360
Did you marry him?

739
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,360
You don't like me anymore?

740
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,360
Wen Hui.

741
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,360
I'm sorry.

742
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,360
I can't go back.

743
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,360
I'm sorry.

744
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,360
Okay.

745
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,360
From now on,

746
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,360
don't text me anymore.

747
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,360
Don't look for me anymore.

748
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,360
Chen Xu.

749
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,360
If one day,

750
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,360
you marry Shen Xiao Tang,

751
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,360
don't tell me.

752
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,360
Don't.

753
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,360
Yes.

754
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,360
Yes.

755
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,360
Yes.

756
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,360
Yes.

757
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,360
Yes.

758
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,360
Yes.

759
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,360
Yes.

760
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,360
Yes.

761
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,360
Yes.

762
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,360
Yes.

763
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,360
Yes.

764
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,360
Yes.

765
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,360
Yes.

766
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,360
Yes.

767
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,360
Yes.

768
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,360
Yes.

769
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,360
Will you be crazy with me forever?

770
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,360
I will.

771
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,360
My love life is lost.

772
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,360
I won't let you be alone.

773
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,360
I will.

774
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,360
I'm going up first.

775
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,360
Let me go.

776
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:22,360
I'll take the flight tomorrow morning.

777
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,360
Have a safe flight.

778
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:33,360
Send me a letter when you arrive.

779
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,360
But

780
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,360
if you need me,

781
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,360
I'll stay.

782
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,360
I know

783
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,360
it's not the right time.

784
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,360
But

785
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,360
I want to tell you.

786
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,360
I really want to tell you.

787
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,360
I like you.

788
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,360
I like you all the time.

789
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,360
Actually,

790
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,360
there's another part

791
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,360
of a butterfly.

792
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,360
I didn't finish reading it.

793
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,360
I didn't know

794
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:56,360
how to read it.

795
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,360
I'm sorry.

796
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,360
That day,

797
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,360
I picked a five-color

798
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,360
jasmine from the tree.

799
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,360
I gave it to her.

800
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,360
She gave me one too.

801
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,360
If this jasmine

802
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,360
is beautiful,

803
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,360
I'll give her

804
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,360
all my happiness.

805
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,360
She once

806
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,360
asked me

807
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,360
who I can't forget.

808
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,360
I've always wanted to tell her.

809
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,360
The one I can't forget

810
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,360
is you.

811
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,360
The one I like now

812
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,360
is you.

813
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,360
Whether it was before,

814
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,360
now,

815
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,360
or in the future,

816
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,360
the one I don't want to forget

817
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,360
is you.

818
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,360
Can't you bear it?

819
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,360
I'm sorry.

820
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,360
I'm sorry.

821
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,360
I'm sorry.

822
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,360
I'm sorry.

823
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,360
I'm sorry.

824
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,360
I'm sorry.

825
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:10,360
I'm sorry.

826
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,360
I'm sorry.

827
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,360
I'm sorry.

828
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,360
I'm sorry.

829
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,360
I'm sorry.

830
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,360
I'm sorry.

831
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,360
I'm sorry.

832
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,360
I'm sorry.

833
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,360
I'm sorry.

834
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,360
I'm sorry.

835
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:37,360
älä ключ

836
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,360
What's going on?

837
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,180
Everyone, let's clap together

838
00:49:54,520 --> 00:50:17,960
Police

839
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:27,360
Haming is thinking about how many red roses love has

840
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:35,360
Maybe it's because of the cold, the cold, the cold, the cold, the cold, the cold

841
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:43,360
I don't remember the beautiful memories of that time

842
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:52,360
Only left behind the remaining fragrance

843
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:58,360
The perfect love that was once in the past

844
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:06,360
No one will shed a tear for it

845
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:12,360
The beautiful memories that were once in the past

846
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:20,360
Only left behind the remaining fragrance

847
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:27,360
The perfect love that was once in the past

848
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:35,360
No one will shed a tear for it

849
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:41,360
The beautiful memories that were once in the past
