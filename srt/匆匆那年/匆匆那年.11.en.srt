This show is sponsored by the world's thinnest smartphone, E-Life.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,120
The American expert in coverage, Li Qiao.

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,480
The show is available on all platforms.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,600
If one day I want to ask you,

5
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,640
you must be sick.

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,880
Go and come back safely.

7
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,880
Take care of them for me.

8
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,200
Li Qiao?

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,280
Let's go.

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,720
I mean,

11
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,960
you must take about what men think of you.

12
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,080
Look, did you like this suit?

13
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,600
Am I pretty?

14
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,680
If I am, how can I stand with you there?

15
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,960
Neat as nothing.

16
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,000
You're so boring.

17
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,360
I should have asked you earlier.

18
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,680
Shang Man.

19
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,000
What's wrong?

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,480
Didn't you and еb pe局

21
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,880
eat the food?

22
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,160
Really?

23
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,120
I ate it all last night,

24
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,800
and it's really umami.

25
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,800
Wait, wait, wait.

26
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,800
Actually,

27
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,800
it's not that bad.

28
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,800
It's just that

29
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,800
I have a high taste.

30
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,800
Enough, enough. Let's go.

31
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
Fang Hua and Chen Xun have already arrived at the restaurant.

32
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,800
If we don't hurry up,

33
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,800
they will eat all the food they like.

34
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
Hurry up. Hurry up.

35
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,800
Lin Xia Mo.

36
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,800
What's wrong?

37
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,800
What's wrong?

38
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,800
Nothing.

39
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,800
Sit tight.

40
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,800
Okay.

41
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,800
Look, Zhou Ying, slow down. My dress.

42
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,800
Zhou Ying.

43
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,800
It's annoying.

44
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
Slow down.

45
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,800
He's the one who wants to eat.

46
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,800
Okay.

47
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,800
What's wrong?

48
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,800
Sit down. Sit down.

49
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
Why are you here so early?

50
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,800
It's okay.

51
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,800
Jia Mo, look.

52
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,800
See what's left.

53
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,800
We told her to order.

54
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,800
It's the same old thing we always eat.

55
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,800
Where is she?

56
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,800
She hasn't arrived yet.

57
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,800
Order first.

58
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,800
What's wrong?

59
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,800
We'll talk later.

60
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,800
What's wrong with you two?

61
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,800
What are you talking about?

62
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Nothing.

63
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,800
Look.

64
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,800
Look.

65
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
Hello, everyone.

66
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,800
It's so comfortable.

67
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,800
It's like a play.

68
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,800
Jia Mo is beautiful again.

69
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,800
Sit down.

70
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,800
Sit down.

71
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,980
You came back from the

72
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,800
I went to Qinghai River, Tibet.

73
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,800
I traveled for more than twenty days.

74
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,800
Amazing.

75
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Did you go alone?

76
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,800
Yes.

77
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,800
But I met a lot of interesting people along the way.

78
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,800
I even took a picture.

79
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,800
Xue Shan.

80
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,800
You went alone?

81
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,800
Of course.

82
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
You even rode a bike.

83
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,800
You look good.

84
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,800
You look like a college student.

85
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
Let Zhang Ye have a look.

86
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
It's okay.

87
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,800
Where did you learn photography?

88
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
I just learned it.

89
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
I joined the photography club in our school.

90
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,800
But I'm bad at it.

91
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,800
No.

92
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,800
You're very good.

93
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,800
You're very professional.

94
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,800
Really?

95
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,800
Really.

96
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,800
Do you still play soccer in school?

97
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,800
I have to play.

98
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,800
Really?

99
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,800
Really?

100
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,800
I even joined the sports department of our school.

101
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,800
I even became a vice minister.

102
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,800
I often organize basketball competitions.

103
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,800
You joined so many activities.

104
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,800
Will it affect your study?

105
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,800
The university is different from high school.

106
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800
High school is just for studying.

107
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,800
I think the university

108
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
is just using the limited youth

109
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
to experience more life.

110
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,800
Look, the youth is here.

111
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,800
Okay.

112
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,800
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

113
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,800
For the sake of a new life,

114
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
let's go.

115
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,800
Of course.

116
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,800
For the sake of a new life,

117
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,800
cheers.

118
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,800
Jia Mu, come up.

119
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,800
How is it, Zhang Ye?

120
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,800
Do you want me to take you around?

121
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,800
No, you go first.

122
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,800
Then we go.

123
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
Bye.

124
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
Be careful.

125
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,800
Bye.

126
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,800
So cool.

127
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,800
When we go to college,

128
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,800
we will have a good time.

129
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
It has to be a family start.

130
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,800
Ma Na.

131
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,800
You...

132
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
You play.

133
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
I...

134
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
I play.

135
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
What are you thinking?

136
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,800
I remind you.

137
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,800
If you don't play, it will be too late.

138
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,800
It's already late anyway.

139
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,800
It's already like that.

140
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
How can a girl play the role of a dream robot?

141
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,800
Right?

142
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,800
I really said it.

143
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
What's wrong with saying it?

144
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,800
You can't say it again if you say it.

145
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,800
You don't know how to get angry.

146
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
Forget it.

147
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,800
Let's wait for the captain to leave.

148
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,800
I tell you.

149
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
There is a captain in the basketball court.

150
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,800
There is no captain in love.

151
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,800
Does he have evidence?

152
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,800
Nothing.

153
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,800
How do you feel?

154
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,800
So happy.

155
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,800
I'm here.

156
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,800
You must be very busy these days.

157
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,800
I'm fine these days.

158
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,800
Just meet some friends.

159
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
What's wrong?

160
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,800
Nothing.

161
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,800
I just said.

162
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
You must be with Zheng Xue.

163
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,800
After all, I haven't seen it for so long.

164
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,800
Is Zheng Xue back?

165
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,800
What's wrong?

166
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,800
What's wrong?

167
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,800
We broke up.

168
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,800
It's almost a year.

169
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,800
Why did you break up?

170
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,800
Maybe I was too much.

171
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,800
I was too much.

172
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,800
Then there is no one to bother.

173
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
He said it first.

174
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,800
He went out and found an outsider.

175
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
Maybe he thought about it before.

176
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
I don't know.

177
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,800
You are so handsome.

178
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,800
There are many beautiful girls in college.

179
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,800
Many are behind you.

180
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,800
Don't be unhappy.

181
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,800
I am very happy.

182
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,800
After all, it's not your fault.

183
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,800
This is not a matter of who is wrong.

184
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,800
People always grow.

185
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,800
The thought of the police will also change.

186
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,800
But some people won't change.

187
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,800
Some people don't even change their thoughts.

188
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,800
Just like me.

189
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,800
I haven't changed.

190
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
I am still the same as before.

191
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
I am not trashy.

192
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,800
I still like to watch the ball.

193
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,800
I still like to go to the wind.

194
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,800
I still like to listen to the song of the boy in the back street.

195
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,800
I still like to

196
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,800

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800

00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,800
We are together.

200
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,060
Jiamu,

201
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,280
Even if you like to have cis love,

202
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,600
I don't like to...

203
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,640
Like what?

204
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,280
I do love you anyway,

205
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,580
we will be together whenever sonary happens.

206
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,500
If it doesn't work, things we can discuss later.

207
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,420
I only have a phrase for you.

208
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:04,640
You want a whole

209
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,640
I'm here.

210
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,640
I'm here.

211
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,640
Zhao Ye.

212
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,640
I have something to tell you.

213
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,640
How can a girl say this first?

214
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,640
You'd better tell me first.

215
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,640
I...

216
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,640
I'm with Su Kai.

217
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,640
What did you say?

218
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,640
I'm with Su Kai.

219
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,640
When?

220
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,640
Last night.

221
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,640
When they sent me back.

222
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,640
Where's Zheng Xue?

223
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,640
They broke up.

224
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,640
Zheng Xue found a foreign boyfriend abroad.

225
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,640
Are you okay?

226
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,640
I'm fine.

227
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,640
I'm fine.

228
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,640

I'm fine.

234
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,640
He's so handsome.

235
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,640
You like him so much.

236
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,640
You're careful to be jealous of girls.

237
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,640
Are you really okay?

238
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,640
Lin Xia Mo.

239
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,640
I have something to give you.

240
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,640
What is it?

241
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,640
Hand-made.

242
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,640
It's very good.

243
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,640
What's wrong?

244
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,640
Zhao Ye.

245
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,640
You're so disgusting.

246
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,000
At the Pavilion!

247
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,440
Chen Lyu

248
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,280
My favorite garlic and garlic.

249
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,880
How is it?

250
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,240
Look at your face.

251
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,920
Wipe it.

252
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:43,800
Su Kai.

253
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,360
Wipe it.

254
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,400
You must be nice to Jia Mo.

255
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,040
You can trust me.

256
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,840
We are all from the same family.

257
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,920
If you are not nice to Jia Mo,

258
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,920
we can't spare you.

259
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,280
I know what you mean.

260
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,720
Come on.

261
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:04,760
Come on.

262
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,440
To Mr. Liang.

263
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,680
Come on.

264
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,320
Mr. Liang.

265
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,080
Mr. Liang.

266
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,440
Come on.

267
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,040
Come on.

268
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,520
It's a deep feeling.

269
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,480
Take a sip.

270
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,240
Take a sip.

271
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:16,680
Come on.

272
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,360
Come on.

273
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,880
It's not bad to drink it.

274
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:30,960
Again?

275
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,280
Come on.

276
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,560
Cheers.

277
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,200
Cheers.

278
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,680
What?

279
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,600
Drink it all.

280
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,760
Again?

281
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,080
Again.

282
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,440
Cheers.

283
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,280
When can you drink it?

284
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,800
Daye.

285
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,880
Okay.

286
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,600
One more.

287
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,720
Again.

288
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,840
One last.

289
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,360
Tell me how to drink it.

290
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,000
Cheers.

291
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,760
You two.

292
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,600
It's a hundred years.

293
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,240
You can be a judge.

294
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:24,880
Uncle.

295
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,440
Uncle.

296
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,760
We are about to fight.

297
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,680
What?

298
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,760
Drink again.

299
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,960
Stop drinking.

300
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,760
Okay, judge.

301
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,520
I'll drink it.

302
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,320
I'll leave first.

303
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,000
Okay.

304
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,720
Take care.

305
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,160
Bye.

306
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,080
Be careful.

307
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,520
Bye.

308
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,800
You two can drink it.

309
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,960
Enough.

310
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,320
Stop talking.

311
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,080
Are you unhappy?

312
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,320
If you are, I'll drink with you.

313
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,720
I'm not unhappy.

314
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,040
Look at me.

315
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,440
I'm so happy.

316
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,560
Okay.

317
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,760
Enough.

318
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,240
Enough.

319
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,760
Now I can be a good friend

320
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,400
with Lin Jia Mo for the rest of my life.

321
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,360
Yes, good friend.

322
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,320
We are good friends.

323
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,280
Daye.

324
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:16,840
Are you okay?

325
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,800
So many pills.

326
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,920
It's a big problem.

327
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,880
Let's call a taxi for him.

328
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,520
Okay.

329
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,760
Call a taxi.

330
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,160
Where can we find a taxi?

331
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,360
Be better.

332
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,600
Damn.

333
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,600
Aren't you Dong Chun's grandchildren?

334
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,800
Hey.

335
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,600
What are you doing?

336
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,600
Are you going to fight with Su Da Zhao?

337
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,000
You are not bad.

338
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,320
Yes.

339
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,320
When did you get such a beautiful girl?

340
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,040
You can't fly with her.

341
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,840
Yes.

342
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,880
You can't fly with her.

343
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,280
What do you mean?

344
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,200
Nothing.

345
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,000
What do you mean?

346
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,160
Su Da Zhao.

347
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,600
Long time no see.

348
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,200
Yes, long time no see.

349
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,920
Su Da Zhao.

350
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,840
It's your fault.

351
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,960
You are so beautiful.

352
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,840
You should have seen it with us.

353
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,160
Yes.

354
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,440
Why should I see it with you?

355
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,200
You are so beautiful.

356
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,440
Forget it.

357
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,840
You want to be fat.

358
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,200
Who is Su Da Zhao?

359
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,960
Right?

360
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,760
What are you doing?

361
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,880
Brother Hou.

362
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,080
Brother Hou.

363
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,800
Brother Hou.

364
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,520
Run.

365
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,680
Kill them.

366
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,840
Kill them.

367
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,040
Go after them.

368
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,080
This way.

369
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,040
This way.

370
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,320
Hurry up.

371
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,360
I can't run.

372
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,360
Take a break.

373
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,360
I can't run.

374
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,520
How are you?

375
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,480
Are you scared?

376
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,480
I can't run.

377
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,080
How are you?

378
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,000
Tian Mo, are you okay?

379
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Does your foot hurt?

380
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,120
Look at me.

381
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,880
I don't like it.

382
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,880
Your feet stink.

383
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,000
His feet are not stinky.

384
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You didn't see Zhou Yong from the basketball team.

385
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,040
That foot.

386
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It's really stinky.

387
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
You are talking nonsense.

388
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:33,880
Okay.

389
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,480
It's cold on the ground.

390
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,480
Put it on.

391
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,480
These guys.

392
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,880
If we meet again,

393
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,080
I won't let any of them run.

394
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,880
You didn't see it tonight.

395
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,120
You are so aggressive.

396
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:47,880
Okay.

397
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,880
It's too messy tonight.

398
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,680
Let's go back.

399
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,080
Go.

400
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,080
Go.

401
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,880
Go home.

402
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,920
Go home and find your mom.

403
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,200
The wind blows in the east.

404
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,600
The sky is clear and the flowers are in the north.

405
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,640
The flowers are in the north.

406
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,640
The flowers are in the north.

407
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,240
Hurry up.

408
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,240
Slow down.

409
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,040
Don't run.

410
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,800
Hello, Shi Hao.

411
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,080
Why didn't you call me?

412
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,080
What?

413
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,080
You want to run again?

414
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,080
Go.

415
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,280
What's this?

416
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,680
Why didn't you tell me?

417
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,880
Hello.

418
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,480
Are you here?

419
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,880
Yes.

420
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,680
That's good.

421
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,080
I heard that you have many beautiful girls in your drama.

422
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,080
I only see you if there are many beautiful girls.

423
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,480
Wenxun.

424
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,480
Hurry up.

425
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,480
I won't talk.

426
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,480
My mom is urging me.

427
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,480
Cheng Xu.

428
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,360
It's okay.

429
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,360
I'm just asking.

430
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,960
Go.

431
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,360
She's married.

432
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,760
You're so great.

433
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,760
You're so great.

434
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,760
You're so great.

435
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,760
You're so great.

436
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,040
Shi Hao.

437
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,040
Take it.

438
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,040
Take it.

439
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,040
Don't hide.

440
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,040
Come on.

441
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,040
Hold it.

442
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,440
This kid.

443
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,440
You can do it.

444
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,440
You can do it.

445
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,440
Let me do it.

446
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,640
Be polite.

447
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,840
You're so great.

448
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,840
Okay.

449
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,840
You.

450
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,040
You two are great.

451
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,120
What's wrong?

452
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,120
Wait.

453
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,120
You have to pack a red envelope.

454
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,120
A wedding envelope.

455
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,120
Congratulations.

456
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,120
Congratulations.

457
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,120
You know how to drink water.

458
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,120
Thank you.

459
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,120
You're so great.

460
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,120
I told you to practice your writing.

461
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,120
Look at your bad handwriting.

462
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,120
You'll be a college student.

463
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,120
It's embarrassing to go out.

464
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,120
Is it Shi Hao?

465
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,120
Yes.

466
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,120
Please come with us.

467
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,120
Don't move.

468
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,120
Don't move.

469
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,120
What's going on?

470
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,200
What's going on?

471
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,200
You know what you've done?

472
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,200
What have I done?

473
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,200
You hit someone.

474
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,200
They're all in the hospital.

475
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,200
That's impossible.

476
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,200
My son wouldn't do that.

477
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
No, no.

478
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,200
You must have made a mistake.

479
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,200
Let's investigate.

480
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,200
Let's investigate.

481
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,200
My son never hits people.

482
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,200
Don't interfere with work.

483
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,200
Or else.

484
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,200
No.

485
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,200
No.

486
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,200
Son.

487
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,200
Son.

488
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,200
This notice just arrived.

489
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,200
It's not hot yet.

490
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,200
This person just took it away.

491
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,200
Auntie.

492
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,200
Did you make it clear?

493
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,200
He must be fine.

494
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,200
Don't be sad.

495
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,200
Did that bitch really hit someone?

496
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,200
She did hit someone.

497
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,200
But don't blame her.

498
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,200
She's bullying someone.

499
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,200
Stop crying.

500
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,200
Are you annoyed?

501
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,280
Don't be angry.

502
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,280
Since she really hit someone.

503
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,280
Then it's also right to lock her up for a few days.

504
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,280
Isn't this a sin?

505
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,280
Why is that?

506
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,280
My son never fights.

507
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,280
Auntie.

508
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,280
Don't worry.

509
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,280
There must be a way.

510
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,280
Uncle.

511
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,280
Auntie.

512
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,280
I sent a message to Xiao.

513
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,280
Let's go and see her.

514
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,280
Don't worry.

515
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,280
With our friends here.

516
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,280
She will be fine.

517
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,280
Did you go to see Qiao Ran?

518
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,280
No.

519
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,280
I sent her a message.

520
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,280
Then you go first.

521
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,280
I'll go to see Su Kai.

522
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,280
See if he can help.

523
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,280
Jia Mu.

524
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,280
This is because.

525
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,280
Jia Mu knows.

526
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,280
I'm sorry.

527
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,280
How is it?

528
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,280
I can't tell the situation.

529
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,280
I guess it's nothing.

530
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,280
At most, it will be released after half a month.

531
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,280
It seems that someone is deliberately making trouble.

532
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,280
The public security bureau's mouth is very tight.

533
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,280
No.

534
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,280
Can't we use some money to protect him?

535
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,280
Don't think about it.

536
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,280
We'd better beat that kid.

537
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,280
A breath of air.

538
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,280
Damn.

539
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,280
This grandson is the one who owes to beat.

540
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,280
Xue Xu.

541
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,280
Don't find anything.

542
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,280
It's not good for Zhao Ye.

543
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,280
He's a bandit.

544
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,280
Who does he know?

545
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,280
Can't you guess who he is?

546
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,280
This kind of person should have a lot of grudge.

547
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,280
Fang Hui.

548
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,280
When did you become so afraid of things?

549
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,280
I thought you were not afraid of anything.

550
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,360
Tang.

551
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,360
Zhen Xuan.

552
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,360
Don't let them go.

553
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,360
This is a big trouble.

554
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,360
What if Zhao Ye is in prison?

555
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,360
Jia Mu.

556
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,360
Su Kai.

557
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,360
Something happened.

558
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,360
What's wrong?

559
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,360
Zhao Ye was caught.

560
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,360
When did it happen?

561
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,360
This morning.

562
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,360
What should we do?

563
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,440
What should we do?

564
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,440
Don't worry.

565
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,440
I'll ask my dad.

566
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,440
Zhao Ye's thing is my thing.

567
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,440
I'll help you.

568
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,440
Dad.

569
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,440
I want to ask you a favor.

570
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,440
You don't have to say it.

571
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,440
Get out.

572
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,440
It's not what you think.

573
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,440
What?

574
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,440
You hit people and you have a reason?

575
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,440
But they were the ones who provoked me first.

576
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,440
Do you know who was hit?

577
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,440
Did you do it?

578
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,440
No.

579
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,440
Then what does it have to do with me?

580
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,440
Ridiculous.

581
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,440
But the one who hit people, he's my buddy.

582
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,440
We were all in the same school in high school.

583
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,440
He's my very, very good friend.

584
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,440
He's already been...

585
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,440
Friend?

586
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,440
Okay.

587
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,440
Tell me what a friend is.

588
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,440
Friend?

589
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,440
Friends are friends with very good relationships.

590
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,440
Nonsense.

591
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,440
Friends are a bowl of rice, a future,

592
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,440
a ladder to help you climb up.

593
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,440
Friends are useful.

594
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,440
Those who are useless are friends of wine and meat.

595
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,440
Why do you care about him?

596
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,520
How old are you?

597
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,520
How many people have you seen?

598
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,520
How many times have you been hit?

599
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,520
Can you tell what is real and what is fake?

600
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,520
You think you're leaving me?

601
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,520
What are you?

602
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,520
Dad, I'm begging you.

603
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,520
Please help him.

604
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,520
He finally got into college.

605
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,520
If he goes in, everything is in vain.

606
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,520
His parents are going crazy now.

607
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,520
And that night, he was also helping me.

608
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,520
If he doesn't hit,

609
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,520
the one who was hit is me.

610
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,520
Shut up.

611
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,520
I'm not going to hit you.

612
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,520
I'm not going to hit you.

613
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,600
Shut up.

614
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,600
If you dare to talk to me like that again,

615
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,600
get out of this house.

616
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,600
Or you go beg your dad again.

617
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,600
Or I can go beg.

618
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,600
My dad is a man of his word.

619
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,600
No one begs.

620
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,600
Zhou Yi has been in for days.

621
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:16,600
What if something happens to him?

622
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,600
No.

623
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,600
Zhou Yi is so kind.

624
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,600
He will be fine.

625
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,600
Don't think too much.

626
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,600
How can I not think too much?

627
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,600
I'm so worried about him now.

628
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,600
I'm afraid he'll be wronged and bullied inside.

629
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,600
But I can't do anything.

630
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,600
How about we go to the prison?

631
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,600
We just rush in and get him out.

632
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,600
Jia Mo, Jia Mo, calm down.

633
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,680
The more we do now, we must not be impulsive.

634
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,680
But I can't calm down now.

635
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,680
He went in for me.

636
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,680
I hate myself now.

637
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,680
I have no money, no power, no way to help him.

638
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,680
I can only be here in a hurry.

639
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,680
Because...

640
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:16,680
Because he is a good friend of mine.

641
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,680
And it's also because of me.

642
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,680
I'm really guilty.

643
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,680
I'm sorry.

644
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,000
For the past year,

645
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:51,160
Cripe the

646
00:29:51,160 --> 00:30:10,240
zuci

647
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,880
Is your buddy's letter accurate?

648
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,800
Yes, it is.

649
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,000
It's been transferred to the police station.

650
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,880
What does that mean?

651
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,720
It's a post-trial.

652
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,600
Waiting for a verdict.

653
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,880
He's going to jail?

654
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,360
You guys should be prepared.

655
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,480
It might be like that.

656
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,800
I'll go find a monkey tomorrow.

657
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,400
Don't go.

658
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,000
Zhao Ye has made enough people worried.

659
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,400
Don't cause trouble.

660
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,880
I'm going to apologize to him.

661
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,400
Don't be like this anymore.

662
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,520
Hello, mom.

663
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,040
Help me find a patient named Monkey.

664
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,200
He's probably in the hospital.

665
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,200
Wait a minute.

666
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,720
I just finished the discharge procedures.

667
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,400
How is that possible?

668
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,200
Isn't the injury quite serious?

669
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,800
How did he leave the hospital so soon?

670
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,040
I just finished the discharge procedures.

671
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,120
He probably hasn't left yet.

672
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,600
Why don't you go to the third floor to have a look?

673
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,400
Thank you, nurse.

674
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,160
Let's go to the third floor.

675
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,880
I always feel like there's something wrong.

676
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,560
Look at that monkey.

677
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,680
He's totally fine.

678
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,880
He's totally fine.

679
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,000
You're making me feel so uncomfortable.

680
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,600
Xiao Xu, go over there.

681
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,800
Don't go.

682
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,600
Don't stop me.

683
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,360
Xiao Xu, calm down.

684
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,160
I'm not going to let you go.

685
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,160
You, you, go away.

686
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,440
Liu.

687
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,800
This is the real deal.

688
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,960
You should repeat it.

689
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,480
Yes, what is this called?

690
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,400
This is called playing with your life.

691
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,680
Yes, Liu.

692
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,440
I shouldn't find the person in—

693
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,240
Try one more time.

694
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:50,960
Brother,

695
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,680
how's it going?

696
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,560
What's up?

697
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,240
I came to see if you've got anything going on.

698
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,840
You're so free.

699
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,120
Go inside and see your item.

700
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,600
I think you miss them too much.

701
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,640
So you came here to see our Monkey brother?

702
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,320
He sent you inside.

703
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,600
Press it.

704
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,000
Move.

705
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,640
Come on.

706
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,280
Look.

707
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,120
It's okay.

708
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,160
You can't break it.

709
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,560
You broke it.

710
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,720
You can't break it today.

711
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,560
Come on.

712
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,640
I'm telling you.

713
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,800
If you dare to touch me,

714
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,600
I'll let that idiot

715
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,320
stay in there for ten more years.

716
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,920
Xiao Bai...

717
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,080
Don't stop there.

718
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:37,920
Please be little.

719
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,080
No.

720
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,200
I was wrong, too.

721
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,200
I'm sorry.

722
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,200
I'm sorry for saying this for my brother.

723
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,200
My brother...

724
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,200
He doesn't like to think about things.

725
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,200
He's relying on me.

726
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,200
He's not stopping me from doing something.

727
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,200
I'm begging you.

728
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,200
I'm begging you.

729
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,200
Let them go.

730
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,200
I'm sorry.

731
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,200
I'm sorry!

732
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,200
Is he crazy?

733
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,200
He's a fool.

734
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,200
He doesn't dare to kill anyone.

735
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,200
He's a fool.

736
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,200
I'm sorry.

737
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,200
Jiang Ran.

738
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,200
There's really no way out.

739
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,200
Why did I eat so many fruits

740
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,200
and have no way to beg him?

741
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,200
What happened?

742
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:47,200
Why did you suddenly die?

743
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,200
Tell me.

744
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,200
Why?

745
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,200
I'm sorry.

746
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,200
Please forgive me.

747
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,200
Today, according to the sixth act

748
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,200

was found guilty of

753
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,200
a crime of searching for a letter.

754
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,200
Zhao Ye, the defendant,

755
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,200
was born on April 15, 1983.

756
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,200
He's a high-ranking cultural figure.

757
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,200
He's a criminal.

758
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,200
He was also charged with a crime of searching for a letter.

759
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,200
He was arrested on July 20, 2001.

760
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,200
He's now brought to the court.

761
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,200
Zhao Ye.

762
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,200
Zhao Ye.

763
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,200
Son.

764
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,200
Son.

765
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,200
According to the explanation of the case of the Public Prosecution and Justice Act,

766
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,200
the 56th and the fourth act of the Public Prosecution and Justice Act,

You.

806
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,200
How is it?

807
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,200
Do I look like a fool?

808
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,200
Lin Yang Mo, you're crazy.

809
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,200
You're crazy.

810
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,200
You're crazy.

811
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,200
You're crazy.

812
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,200
You're crazy.

813
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,200
I'm crazy.

814
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,200
You're not happy.

815
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,200
I'm really sad.

816
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,200
I won't let you down.

817
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,200
I'll tell you the secret

818
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,200
in case you're scared to death.

819
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,200
If you don't tell me, I'm afraid you'll suffocate me.

820
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,200
How can you be so happy about this?

821
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,200
Lin Yang Mo is the best.

822
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,200
Lin Yang Mo.

823
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,200
Su Dasha.

824
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,200
Su Dasha.

825
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,200
How dare you hit me?

826
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,200
Take me to the hospital.

827
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,200
Take me to the hospital.

828
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,960
So sad...

829
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,160
Is that too much?

830
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:07,320
Do you know that you used to be my dream?

831
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:14,980
It is just that this dream is too short.

832
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:20,180
It's too short for me to do anything.

833
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:25,180
I was too short to do anything.

834
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,180
I was already awake.

835
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,180
Just like you said,

836
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:39,180
there is something that might change.

837
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,180
When it changes,

838
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:49,180
maybe I don't even know.

839
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,180
I don't know.

840
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,180
Jiang Meng,

841
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:04,180
I know it's useless for me to say anything now.

842
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:07,180
But you have to remember,

843
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:10,180
I really like you.

844
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,180
I'm sorry.

845
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:23,180
Are we still friends?

846
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,180
Thank you.

847
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,180
Goodbye.

848
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,180
I'm sorry.

849
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:43,180
Miss,

850
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:44,560
this is the

851
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:47,180
thing that that bastard hid in the pot.

852
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,180
Take a look.

853
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:52,180
Is it a new cup?

854
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:55,180
Thank you, uncle.

855
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:14,180
The most difficult question in love is these two.

856
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,180
The person who loves me, I don't love.

857
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,180
And the person I love, doesn't love me.

858
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:23,180
Between all the difficulties,

859
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,180
there are usually three people who are hurt.

860
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:29,180
However, there will always be regrets and regrets in youth.

861
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:32,180
It makes us grow up rapidly.

862
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:37,180
It's not easy to be a good person.

863
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:40,180
It makes us grow up rapidly.

864
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:42,180
In the future,

865
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:44,180
don't miss it.

866
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:46,180
You shouldn't miss it.

867
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:52,180
Fang Hui, welcome to welcome new life.

868
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:54,180
All universities have one dream.

869
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:57,180
It's a love that's full of love.

870
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,180
According to the situation, it's a friend.

871
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:01,180
Are you a bastard?

872
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,180
Welcome to the camp.

873
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:04,180
Instructor, why don't you send him?

874
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:06,180
Be quiet.

875
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,180
What's wrong with you?

876
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:10,180
Who told you to come here first?

877
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,180
What are you doing?

878
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:13,180
I'm not doing this to make you feel better.

879
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:15,180
You're here to earn money and raise a white-faced man.

880
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:18,180
Chen Xun.

881
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,180
You're not marrying me?

882
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:52,180

884
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,980
Moving to you

885
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:02,980
I can't help but want to say to you

886
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:05,680
How many times to enfinish

887
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,680
I can't open my mouth

888
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,680
I want to hold your tenderness

889
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,680
Always nodding

890
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,680
How I wish the sky

891
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,680
could be lit up

892
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,680
forever

893
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,680

00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,680
Your eyes that don't close

896
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,680
I fell into

897
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,680
a deep love

898
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,680
I fell into a deep love

00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,680
I fell into a deep love

900
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,680
Do you have

901
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,680
the purest fairy tale

902
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,680
You are

903
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,680
