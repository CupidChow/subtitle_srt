The United States does not cover the official website.

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,520
Please be considerate and make a special appointment.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,240
Your love life is a bit harsh.

5
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,680
Lin Jia Mo, I declare that I like you.

6
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,440
I declare that I don't like you.

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,040
Shouldn't good things

8
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,920
stay in the good times?

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,680
Xu Xiao Tang?

10
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,760
I'm here. Where are you?

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,120
99, 99, 99...

12
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,920
Little sister, why do you keep saying 99?

13
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,560
Stop talking.

14
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,080
I was just listening.

15
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,120
Why are you so quiet?

16
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,040
I'm the only one in our dorm.

17
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,280
Everyone left.

18
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,440
So sad.

19
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,880
I don't even have a meal partner.

20
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,920
How about we have a meal together tomorrow?

21
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,040
Sure.

22
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,440
See you tomorrow.

23
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,760
Bye.

24
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,440
Come on.

25
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,440
Let me introduce you.

26
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,440
This is our dorm's leader, Wang Sen Zhang.

27
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,440
This is Shen Yao Tang.

28
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,440
Hello, Wang Sen Zhang.

29
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,440
Hello.

30
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,440
Our boss is great.

31
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,440
He is the highest score in our dorm.

32
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,440
625.

33
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,440
625?

34
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,440
That's awesome.

35
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,440
In fact, we are not that stupid.

36
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,440
Don't be modest.

37
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,440
Our boss will definitely have a bright future.

38
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,440
Enough. Stop being so polite.

39
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,440
Let's order three.

40
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,440
Do you want to try?

41
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,440
Come on.

42
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,440
19.

43
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,440
20.

44
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,440
Go.

45
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,440
You don't know what's good.

46
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,440
I'll order.

47
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,440
Let's go.

48
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,440
Let him pay.

49
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,440
Find a seat first.

50
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,440
Boss, is it good?

51
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,440
It's good.

52
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,440
I'll take a look.

53
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,440
Boss, what are you doing?

54
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,440
I want to send this back to my brother.

55
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,440
I haven't seen this burger bag before.

56
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,440
Let me see.

57
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,440
Burger bag.

58
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,440
Boss.

59
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,440
My paper is a little cleaner.

60
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,440
You can use it as a letter.

61
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,440
I used to write letters to my classmates like this.

62
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,440
Thank you.

63
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,440
The patient is now in the hospital.

64
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,440
Tianxin.

65
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,440
It's good to be a good girl.

66
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,440
You have to be serious.

67
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,440
What's wrong?

68
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,440
Why did you drop the chain?

69
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,440
Look at it.

70
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,440
Look at it.

71
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,440
It's a chain.

72
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,440
It's a chain.

73
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,440
Lift it.

74
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,440
It's lifted.

75
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,440
Lift it.

76
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,440
It's better.

77
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,440
Is it better?

78
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,440
Move it a little more.

79
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,440
Stop.

80
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,440
Stop.

81
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,440
Stop.

82
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,440
Don't move.

83
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,440
Why are you holding it?

84
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,440
Hold it.

85
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,440
Hold it.

86
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,440
It's over.

87
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,440
Chunsheng.

88
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,440
Chunsheng.

89
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,440
Chunsheng.

90
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,440
It's out.

91
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,440
It's out.

92
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,440
The fireball is out.

93
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,440
After the fireball hits 44 years,

94
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,440
the fireball will be out.

95
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,440
Happy New Year.

96
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,440
Happy New Year.

97
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,440
Happy New Year.

98
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,440
Happy New Year.

99
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,440
Happy New Year.

100
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,440
Happy New Year.

101
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,440
Happy New Year.

102
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,440
Chunsheng.

103
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,440
Till the end.

104
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,440
How to have a happy new year?

105
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,440
Look at it.

106
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,440
It's from me.

107
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,440
Now I finally get to have a happy new year.

108
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,440
Because I think your happiness is like this.

109
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,440
Because you've got a happy new year.

110
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,440
Like what?

111
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,440
They said nothing.

112
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,440
You look the same.

113
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,440
How to say happiness in Chinese?

114
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,440
Fashion already.

115
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,440
My husband,

116
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,440
He's not there.

117
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,440
So I always...

118
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,440
So,

119
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,440
But we're brothers.

120
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,440
How to say happiness?

121
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,440
It's ending, like it.

122
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,440
Just take care.

123
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,400
People will laugh at that even though your face is skinny.

124
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,440
But he's still the same.

125
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:38,700
What a local

126
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,420
I changed my script

127
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,780
Great

128
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,380
I'll take the last one.

129
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,780
What have you been doing these days?

130
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,980
Nothing. I'm just staying here.

131
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,140
What's wrong?

132
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,140
Nothing.

133
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,980
Guan Haomett

134
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,500
Zusammen

135
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,700
What are you doing?

136
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,060
You're goingthest.

137
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,460
If I get angry,

138
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,980
how can I make up?

139
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:49,980
You have a good trick, you ask me?

140
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,980
If I have a trick, don't talk nonsense.

141
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,980
Girls are just a thin skin.

142
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,980
If you stick to her,

143
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:03,980
one day, the sky will move, and the gold will not open.

144
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,980
Zhang Hu Rong is going to have a concert again.

145
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,980
Really?

146
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,980
Didn't she go to the concert?

147
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,980
She gave up in 1995.

148
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,980
How much is the ticket?

149
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,980
I don't know.

150
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,980
You like Zhang Hu Rong?

151
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,980
My girlfriend likes her.

152
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,980
What? You really want to go?

153
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,980
Nonsense.

154
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,980
This ticket is not cheap.

155
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,980
You don't look at who I am.

156
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,980
It's not easy to make money.

157
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,980
Burn money for true love.

158
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:41,980
Awesome.

159
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,980
Your girlfriend will be moved.

160
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,980
Keep your mouth shut.

161
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,980
I'm going to give her a surprise.

162
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,980
Good girl.

163
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,980
Study hard.

164
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,980
What?

165
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,980
Still looking at the sky?

166
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,980
Why are you like a brother?

167
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:02,980
You are like a brother.

168
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,980
We are chatting.

169
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:05,980
Brother Qiang.

170
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,980
You taught me how to be a fat girl.

171
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,980
What do you mean?

172
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,980
How did you make your girlfriend like you?

173
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,980
This?

174
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,980
There is no free lunch in the world.

175
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,980
Lunch?

176
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:24,980
Just made it.

177
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,980
Brother Hu Rong.

178
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,980
You say first.

179
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,980
How to make a girl?

180
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,980
Just three words.

181
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,980
Just do it.

182
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,980
I'm so tired.

183
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,980
Make it again.

184
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,980
Welcome to the physical training class.

185
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,980
There are not many people in this class.

186
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,980
Most of them are female classmates.

187
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,980
This is...

188
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,980
Teacher, I'm late.

189
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,980
Welcome to this boy.

190
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,980
It's not easy for a boy to be able to be aware of the physical shape of the body.

191
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,980
Come and introduce yourself.

192
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,980
I want to see you off.

193
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,980
Come on.

194
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,980
Everyone, press your legs first.

195
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,980
Relax.

196
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,980
Come on.

197
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:23,980
This boy.

198
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,980
If you can't do it, you can change to a lower pole.

199
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,980
It's okay, teacher.

200
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,980
I can do it.

201
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,980
What?

202
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,980
What?

203
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,980
We are really fated.

204
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,980
You are sick.

205
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,980
I checked and all the options are enough.

206
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,980
I just knew you chose this.

207
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,980
Is it easy for me?

208
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,980
So you are a pervert.

209
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,980
Have you ever seen such a handsome pervert?

210
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,980
Jiang Meng.

211
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,980
Jiang Meng.

212
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,980
Are you playing?

213
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:19,980
I can't play basketball.

214
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,980
What do you mean?

215
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,980
I'm talking to you.

216
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,980
Say it.

217
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,980
Why does Lin Jia Mo like to do this?

218
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,980
What do you mean?

219
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,980
It's okay. I just...

220
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,980
I just want to ask you.

221
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,980
Why do you like to do this?

222
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,980
I just want to ask you.

223
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,980
Why do you like to do this?

224
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,980
It's okay. I just want to ask you.

225
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,980
Do you know what his zodiac sign is?

226
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,980
Blood type.

227
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:43,980
And...

228
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,980
What does he like to do?

229
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,980
He knows his enemy and he knows his enemy.

230
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,980
That's right.

231
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,980
You are good at this.

232
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,980
Don't you like to challenge the difficulty?

233
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,980
You are so good.

234
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,980
You need to be good at this.

235
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,980
It's easy to play basketball.

236
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,980
Enough.

237
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,980
Let's go.

238
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,980
I'm telling you.

239
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,980
Don't tell anyone.

240
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,980
I'm sick. I'm telling others.

241
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,980
Lin Jia Mo...

242
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,980
likes to collect water.

243
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,980
I'm talking about you.

244
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,980
I'm just playing.

245
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,980
Really.

246
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,980
I'm telling you.

247
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,980
I'm not helping you.

248
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,980
Don't make trouble.

249
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,980
Don't look at Lin Jia Mo.

250
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,980
She is a beautiful woman now.

251
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,980
When she was in high school, she was a ballerina.

252
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,980
What is she doing?

253
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,980
What is she doing?

254
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,980
Let's listen to her.

255
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:37,980
Do you like her?

256
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,980
I like her.

257
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,980
Stop.

258
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,980
What are you singing?

259
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:57,980
You are making a mess.

260
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,980
You are making a mess with me.

261
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,980
Boss.

262
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,980
Look.

263
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,980
I've found many places.

264
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,980
You are the most reliable.

265
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:05,980
Look. I'm a young man.

266
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,980
I'm very experienced.

267
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,980
I can do anything.

268
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,980
I'm telling you.

269
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:12,980
I'm very busy.

270
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,980
I'm always here.

271
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,980
I'm always here.

272
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,980
Okay.

273
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,980
Where is the work?

274
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,980
I don't know.

275
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,980
What's wrong with you?

276
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,980
Look at her.

277
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:33,980
I'm sorry.

278
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,980
I'm sorry.

279
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,980
I'm sorry.

280
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,980
I'm sorry.

281
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:46,980
What?

282
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,980
It's really you.

283
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,980
Why are you here?

284
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,980
What a coincidence.

285
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,980
Wait. Hurry up.

286
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,980
Get up.

287
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,980
I see you didn't do anything.

288
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,980
What are you laughing at?

289
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,980
You are a rocker.

290
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,980
You are also going to the sea.

291
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:09,980
I'm doing a little bit of self-examination.

292
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:10,980
I'm doing a little bit of self-examination.

293
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,980
I'm doing a little bit of self-examination.

294
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,980
You are quite suitable for this.

295
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:14,980
Well.

296
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,980
Why are you here?

297
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,980
Why are you here?

298
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:18,980
Me?

299
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,980
Yes.

300
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,980
Begonia.

301
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,980
Begonia.

302
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:28,980
Good evening, everyone.

303
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:29,980
Good evening, everyone.

304
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,980
Good evening, everyone.

305
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:31,980
I'm Begonia.

306
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,980
Tonight, I'm going to sing

307
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,980
Happy You, So I'm Happy.

308
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,980
You are so happy

309
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,980
So I smiled

310
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:58,980
Your eyes are red

311
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,980
My day is ruined

312
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,980
The sky is laughing

313
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,980
Since it says you are happy

314
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,980
So I'm happy

315
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,980
My day is over

316
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,980
What else do I want

317
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,980
I can't help it

318
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,980
I can't help it

319
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,980
The sky is so beautiful

320
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,980
I'm so happy

321
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,980
I'm so happy

322
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,980
I'm so happy

323
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,980
On the day of Begonia's birthday,

324
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,980
S gave her favorite football shoes as a birthday surprise.

325
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,980
I was moved and cried.

326
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,980
It's not necessarily true.

327
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:54,980
But I...

328
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,980
What's this?

329
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,980
A pair of gloves.

330
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,980
For your boyfriend?

331
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,980
Li Qi.

332
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,980
If you drink Pepsi,

333
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,980
can you give me all the bottles?

334
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:11,980
Why?

335
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,980
If you collect 100 bottles of Pepsi,

336
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,980
you can give me a key chain.

337
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,980
My boyfriend likes that.

338
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,980
You are so virtuous.

339
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,980
Your boyfriend must be happy to see you.

340
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,980
Now, it's not popular.

341
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,980
Men are all cheap.

342
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,980
You can't be nice to him.

343
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,980
My boyfriend is not like that.

344
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,980
They were in the same high school.

345
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,980
They have different feelings.

346
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,980
Men are all the same.

347
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,980
You should learn from him.

348
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,980
You should learn from him.

349
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,980
You should learn from him.

350
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:45,980
Cool.

351
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,980
I'm back.

352
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,980
I'm tired.

353
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,980
You are so beautiful today.

354
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,980
Of course.

355
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,980
He is the little boy in the business department.

356
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,980
He has to buy it for us.

357
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,980
I'm not angry.

358
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:56,980
Really?

359
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,980
He is so beautiful.

360
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,980
He must be in a special body.

361
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,980
Special.

362
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,980
By the way, Fang Hui.

363
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,980
Guess who I saw at the door just now.

364
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,980
Who?

365
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,980
Chen Xu.

366
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,980
He is not with you.

367
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,980
You are wrong.

368
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,980
How could it be?

369
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,980
They came back when I came back.

370
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,980
That girl is wearing a big makeup.

371
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,980
It seems to be our school.

372
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,980
Right.

373
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,980
Shen Xiaotang from the law department.

374
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,980
Shen Xiaotang?

375
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,980
I know her.

376
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,980
She is a student.

377
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,980
She loves to be a hot star.

378
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:34,980
All the cultural activities in our school are organized by her.

379
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,980
Fang Hui.

380
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,980
You should be careful.

381
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,980
Your Chen Xun is very attractive.

382
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,980
She is a friend of mine.

383
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,980
She told me about her.

384
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:46,980
They are friends.

385
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,980
You believe her?

386
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,980
You are really...

387
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,980
I don't know if you are a real god or not.

388
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,980
She is stupid.

389
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,980
Wang Yue.

390
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,980
Yes.

391
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,980
Li Qi.

392
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,980
Yes.

393
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,980
Wang Wenjuan.

394
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,980
Yes.

395
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,980
Chen Xun.

396
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,980
Yes.

397
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,980
Li Min.

398
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:06,980
Yes.

399
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,980
Wang Senzhao.

400
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,980
Yes.

401
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:09,980
Song Ning.

402
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,980
Song Ning.

403
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:13,980
Yes.

404
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:14,980
I am here.

405
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,980
Next time you call me, you should answer me quickly.

406
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:18,980
Wang Jing.

407
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,980
Yes.

408
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,980
Wang Xiaoyuan.

409
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,980
Yes.

410
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,980
Zhao Kexin.

411
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,980
Yes.

412
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,980
Let's go.

413
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,980
What's wrong?

414
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,980
What's wrong?

415
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,980
What did you do today?

416
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,980
You didn't come to the math class again.

417
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,980
I overslept.

418
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,980
The teacher has called you twice.

419
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,980
If you don't go, you will hang up.

420
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,980
Who cares about the class in the university?

421
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:04,980
Besides,

422
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,980
can I hang up?

423
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,980
OK.

424
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,980
I know you are good for me.

425
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,980
I promise I can graduate successfully.

426
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,980
Don't you believe me?

427
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,980
Hurry up.

428
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:22,980
Lin Jia is waiting.

429
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,980
Why hasn't she come out yet?

430
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,980
Don't worry.

431
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,980
You all go back.

432
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,980
She doesn't want to see anyone.

433
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,980
Impossible.

434
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,980
Did you tell her who we are?

435
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,980
Yes.

436
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,980
She doesn't want to see us.

437
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,980
We have no choice.

438
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,980
No.

439
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:50,980
Brother police.

440
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,980
Please persuade her again.

441
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,980
She will definitely see us.

442
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,980
Just let us go.

443
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,980
She really doesn't want to see you.

444
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,980
Brother police.

445
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,980
Can you help me give this letter to her?

446
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:12,980
OK.

447
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,980
Thank you.

448
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,980
I got it.

449
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,980
I got it.

450
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,980
I got it.

451
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,980
Give it to me.

452
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,980
Are you sick?

453
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:51,980
Can you cure me?

454
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,980
Can you stop harassing me?

455
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,980
No.

456
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,980
Where do you like me?

457
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:02,980
Can I change it?

458
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,980
I like you everywhere.

459
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,980
Unless you go back to the prison.

460
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,980
OK.

461
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,980
I will tell you clearly.

462
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,980
I already have someone else in my heart.

463
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,980
You don't have to bother.

464
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,980
Isn't it just Chen Xu?

465
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,980
Let me ask you.

466
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,980
Where is he now?

467
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,980
You play the ball yourself.

468
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:24,980
Why doesn't he come to accompany you?

469
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:25,980
Where did he go?

470
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,980
Is it your turn to care about this?

471
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,980
I don't care.

472
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:36,980
I am like this.

473
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,980
I am like this.

474
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:39,980
You don't have to care about me.

475
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:40,980
I can do whatever you say.

476
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,980
I will accompany you.

477
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,980
I will play with you.

478
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:43,980
I will accompany you to class.

479
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,980
I will accompany you to eat, walk, and study.

480
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,980
I will not go anywhere.

481
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,980
I will accompany you.

482
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,980
Xia Mo.

483
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,980
Tegin.

484
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:02,980
You are a turtle.

485
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:03,980
Give it to him.

486
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,980
The red tea I said is ready.

487
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,980
It has been a long time.

488
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,980
Look at you.

489
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,980
Are you trying to serve me?

490
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,980
Boss.

491
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,980
You are so hot.

492
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,980
I will accompany you.

493
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,980
How can you be able to play with me?

494
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,980
OK.

495
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:25,980
Sorry.

496
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:28,980
What's going on?

497
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,980
What are you doing?

498
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,980
What is it?

499
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,980
Get out of your work.

500
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:33,980
You are counting on me.

501
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,980
Hurry up and clean up.

502
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,980
Yes.

503
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,980
This is not good.

504
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,980
Wipe it.

505
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,980
I am not a duck.

506
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,980
Why are you giving me a brush?

507
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:53,980
What?

508
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,980
This is a side effect.

509
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,980
Come and disinfect.

510
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,980
Be careful.

511
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:03,980
Thank you.

512
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:04,980
Thank you for what?

513
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,980
Do you want some more?

514
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:07,980
No need.

515
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:11,980
I say you have a lot of life experience.

516
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,980
I am working alone.

517
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,980
I always bump into each other.

518
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,980
I am sick and become a doctor.

519
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,980
I say why are you working?

520
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,980
I lack money.

521
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,980
Lack of expenses.

522
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:22,980
I like to carry my bag alone.

523
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,980
Go around and see the tourism.

524
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,980
OK.

525
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,980
What about you?

526
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:29,980
Why are you working?

527
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,980
I really lack money.

528
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,980
Then you can only continue to work hard.

529
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,980
I am going out.

530
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:36,980
I will sing later.

531
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,980
OK.

532
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,980
For you.

533
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,980
Why are you giving me a gift?

534
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,980
Didn't you have a good class the other day?

535
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,980
Did I make you angry?

536
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,980
I am not angry.

537
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,980
I am just a little bit worried.

538
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,980
I am afraid you will not study.

539
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:06,980
I promise.

540
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,980
From tonight, I will have a good class.

541
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:16,980
Where did you get it?

542
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,980
It is not possible to get it with 100 machines.

543
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,980
I have another gift for you.

544
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,980
Don't mind him.

545
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,980
Don't laugh.

546
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:33,980
I promise.

547
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,980
I will not laugh.

548
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,980
You are still laughing now.

549
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,980
You know it yourself.

550
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,980
You can even make a woolen handkerchief.

551
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,980
You are good, my little phoenix.

552
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,980
I just learned it.

553
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,980
Do you want to try it on?

554
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,980
No.

555
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,980
It must be suitable.

556
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:58,980
Put it on.

557
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,980
Let me see if it is small.

558
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,980
It must be suitable.

559
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,980
Put this on too.

560
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,980
Try it on.

561
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:05,980
No.

562
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:06,980
I will wear it when I go back.

563
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,980
It is okay.

564
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,980
I made instant noodles the other day.

565
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,980
It was hot.

566
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,980
It is okay.

567
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,980
Why are you so careless?

568
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:18,980
It is not painful.

569
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,980
Did you apply the medicine?

570
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,980
No.

571
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:25,980
Where are you going?

572
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,980
I am going to the bathroom.

573
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,980
Where did you buy so many medicines?

574
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,980
I don't know which one is good.

575
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:47,980
I bought all of them.

576
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,980
Young people, wine, sandals.

577
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:53,980
It is painful.

578
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:54,980
Be careful.

579
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,980
It is painful.

580
00:24:58,980 --> 00:24:59,980
Is it painful?

581
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,980
It is okay.

582
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,980
Let's go to watch a movie tomorrow.

583
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:12,980
You have time again.

584
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,980
I am busy.

585
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,980
I have time to squeeze it.

586
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,980
Don't be angry.

587
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:23,980
Okay?

588
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:33,980
You are here so early today.

589
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,980
Miss Shen Xiaotang.

590
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:43,980
You are a talent.

591
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,980
You can sing and collect things.

592
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,980
You can also cure your wounds.

593
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,980
If you put it in ancient times,

594
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,980
you are a good listener,

595
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:52,980
a good cook and a good singer.

596
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:53,980
Don't praise me.

597
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:54,980
I don't like to praise.

598
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:56,980
I am a big earthen girl.

599
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:59,980
I can only burn firewood and kill chickens.

600
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:01,980
Enough.

601
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,980
I am here.

602
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,980
Hello.

603
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:06,980
I am working.

604
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:07,980
What's wrong?

605
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,980
It's okay.

606
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:15,980
I will leave.

607
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:25,980
Okay.

608
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:28,980
If you are a man,

609
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,980
you can take Yang Qing with you.

610
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,980
I can go with you.

611
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,980
Do you really want to see her marry someone else?

612
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,980
Xiao Qiao.

613
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:46,980
Come with me.

614
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,980
I want to marry.

615
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,980
You really want to marry that man?

616
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,980
It has nothing to do with him.

617
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,980
You are protecting him.

618
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:00,980
I forgot it.

619
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:01,980
Are you a man?

620
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,980
Xiao Qiao.

621
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:11,980
Do you still love him?

622
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:15,980
Don't force me.

623
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:23,980
I have to go.

624
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:26,980
Xiao Qiao.

625
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,980
I only have one question.

626
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,980
I won't stop you until you are done asking.

627
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,980
Tell me.

628
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,980
I have never had money.

629
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,980
Not until now.

630
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,980
You said you would be happy with me

631
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:46,980
no matter what kind of life we had.

632
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,980
How did it change suddenly?

633
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:53,980
We are together.

634
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:56,980
It's not a life.

635
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,980
It's a life.

636
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,980
It's a life.

637
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:04,980
I don't want to give up on you.

638
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:08,980
But I am not a child anymore.

639
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,980
I can't lie to myself forever.

640
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,980
Qian.

641
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:19,980
Please.

642
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,980
Please give me another chance.

643
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,980
But this time,

644
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,980
I am not the one who is to blame.

645
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,980
But I love you.

646
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,980
I will love you forever.

647
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,980
Qian.

648
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:37,980
Qian.

649
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,980
Qian, I beg you to leave.

650
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,980
Let's go.

651
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,980
Take a seat.

652
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,980
Come on.

653
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,980
Get up.

654
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:12,980
Go out.

655
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,980
There is no tower outside.

656
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,980
Get up.

657
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,980
Think about

658
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,980
If you need money, just tell me.

659
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,980
I'll help you find a way.

660
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:36,980
Thank you.

661
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:38,980
Thank you, bro.

662
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,980
Sorry. The subscriber you dialed is powered off.

663
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,980
Sorry. The subscriber you dialed is powered off.

664
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,980
I'm sorry.

665
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,980
You...

666
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:58,980
You're silly.

667
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,980
You're really here waiting for someone.

668
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:03,980
Sorry.

669
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:04,980
I said, let's go.

670
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:05,980
No.

671
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,980
I... I... I really have something to do.

672
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,980
Do you remember my hair?

673
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,980
Yang Qing and his family didn't agree to be together.

674
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,980
They wanted to elope.

675
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,980
How could you say that?

676
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,980
I know. I know.

677
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,980
I made a mistake for you.

678
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,980
Can you stop treating me like this?

679
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,980
How can I treat you like this?

680
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:30,980
I didn't fight.

681
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:31,980
I didn't make a fuss.

682
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,980
I was silly and waited for you for three hours.

683
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,980
It's my fault.

684
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,980
No. You're not wrong.

685
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:42,980
I...

686
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:44,980
You can hit me.

687
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,980
You can scold me.

688
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,980
It's okay.

689
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:47,980
No problem.

690
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,980
But can you stop asking questions alone?

691
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:51,980
I'm not angry.

692
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,980
You're obviously angry.

693
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,980
Didn't we agree that we won't hide anything from each other?

694
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,980
Just say it.

695
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,980
You promised me before.

696
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:09,980
You won't make me wait again.

697
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,980
You won't make me worry.

698
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,980
You always forget.

699
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:17,980
I'm not sure.

700
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,980
What?

701
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,980
Fang Wei, I was wrong.

702
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:28,980
I admit my mistake.

703
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:29,980
I was too good to be wrong.

704
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:30,980
No.

705
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:31,980
I'm afraid you'll get hurt.

706
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,980
You're not in my life.

707
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:49,980
You hit me.

708
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,980
You can scold me.

709
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,980
But you can't say I don't love you.

710
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,980
I love you.

711
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,980
You're the most important person in my heart.

712
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,980
I wish I could give you my heart.

713
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,980
You don't care about me at all.

714
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:16,980
No one cares about me.

715
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,980
I'm just a kid.

716
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:24,980
You've been a bad girl to us.

717
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,980
I'm just a fool.

718
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,980
Don't be silly.

719
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,980
Don't call yourself a kid.

720
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:46,980
I'm heartbroken.

721
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:51,980
Really?

722
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:55,980
I don't want to.

723
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,980
I'm afraid you'll think I'm not a kid.

724
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,980
I want to be closer to you.

725
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,980
But I can't see your feet.

726
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,980
I don't know what you're thinking.

727
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,980
I don't want to see it.

728
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,980
I'm so tired.

729
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:15,980
I want to see it.

730
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,980
How can you leave me?

731
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:21,980
What is it?

732
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,980
What do you think?

733
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:25,980
What do you think?

734
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:27,980
What do you think?

735
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:29,980
Forget it.

736
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,980
Forget it.

737
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:40,980
What?

738
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,980
compensation?

739
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:44,980
Do you think I'm a bank?

740
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,980
You're taking money.

741
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,980
I really want to ask you something.

742
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,980
Just help me.

743
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,180
Why did you run away?

744
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,740
I'll give you all my money.

745
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,340
I can't run away.

746
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,380
I can't give you a free salary.

747
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,020
I'll transfer you a job.

748
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,300
You can leave after you close down every day.

749
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,300
Okay.

750
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,500
You really lack money.

751
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,340
Did something happen?

752
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,260
It's not my business.

753
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,580
It's my brother's business.

754
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:38,740
Qian Mo.

755
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:42,420
I heard that a guy is chasing you.

756
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,260
You mean the one who committed suicide?

757
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,780
He's so annoying.

758
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,820
He's so annoying.

759
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,820
He's like a big nose.

760
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,100
He can't even get rid of it.

761
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,460
That's good.

762
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,940
You should fall in love.

763
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,820
Are you...

764
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,620
You mean...

765
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,300
Zhao Ye...

766
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,260
He doesn't want to see us?

767
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,020
Jia Mo.

768
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,020
You're thinking too complicatedly.

769
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,460
That's Zhao Ye.

770
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,100
He won't think too much.

771
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,580
But people change.

772
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,140
Especially in that kind of environment.

773
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,940
What if he's bad at studying?

774
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,900
What if he's bullied?

775
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,780
Or he'll be in a place like this for a long time.

776
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,620
Jia Mo.

777
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,540
We won't change.

778
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,900
We'll be together forever.

779
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,340
When Zhao Ye comes back,

780
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:38,020
we'll watch them play.

781
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:38,980
Okay?

782
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,260
I remember Chen Xun said

783
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,700
we have to watch the Olympic Games together.

784
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,780
Stop thinking.

785
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:51,740
Here.

786
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,180
Don't think about it after drinking milk.

787
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:58,860
By the way,

788
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,540
why did Chen Xun go out to work?

789
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,220
I don't think so.

790
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,820
They're just talking nonsense.

791
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,060
I told you.

792
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:08,940
Chen Xun doesn't have money.

793
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,100
Why would he go out to work?

794
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,980
But Fang Hui.

795
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,740
You should care more about him.

796
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,300
At least you should know where he is.

797
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,820
This is the ice.

798
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:24,980
The receipt.

799
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,140
And me.

800
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,820
I'll give you some money.

801
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:29,940
Take it.

802
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,700
Thank you.

803
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,060
I couldn't win Sun Tao before.

804
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,700
You guys...

805
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,580
You guys still see me as a person.

806
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,740
You guys see me as a brother.

807
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:56,180
I'm so confused.

808
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,660
If I come back,

809
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,580
I'll think I'm not the same as I am today.

810
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,460
Qiang.

811
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:06,900
Thank you.

812
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,060
You're my greatest benefactor.

813
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:10,900
Without you,

814
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,380
I might never be able to get up again.

815
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,260
Don't worry.

816
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,460
I'll get out of this.

817
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,820
I won't let you down.

818
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,060
If he leaves like this,

819
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,980
you'll really get something.

820
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:28,980
After you leave,

821
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,060
get yourself a new job.

822
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,540
Or else,

823
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,260
don't come back to see me.

824
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,020
Don't worry.

825
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,780
Where are you going?

826
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,620
We're going to

827
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,260
go to Shenzhen.

828
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,460
When you're settled,

829
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,580
let us know.

830
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,060
Brother Sun.

831
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,660
This is a token of my gratitude.

832
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:00,700
Take it.

833
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,100
What are you doing?

834
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,460
Chen Xue.

835
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,860
I want to help them.

836
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,660
Don't worry about it.

837
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,300
No.

838
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,180
Let her finish her work.

839
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,660
I'm very touched by your relationship.

840
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:12,780
I, Shen Xiaotang,

841
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,220
like people with true feelings.

842
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,820
I don't have much money.

843
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,060
I don't have any other intentions.

844
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,460
Just take it, Brother.

845
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,020
Take it.

846
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,620
Don't let them down.

847
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,380
Thank you, Shen...

848
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:28,660
Shen Xiaotang.

849
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,220
Thank you.

850
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,020
Thank you.

851
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,700
After giving it to Brother Feng,

852
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,580
all the expenses have been spent, right?

853
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,540
Money is an external object.

854
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,620
It's fun to have it.

855
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,900
I always want to see this.

856
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,420
Moreover,

857
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,060
your hair is real love.

858
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,500
I think true love should be rewarded.

859
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,460
You're quite torturous.

860
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,420
What's wrong with torturous?

861
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,620
The meaning of life is torturous.

862
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:54,820
What are you doing?

863
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,020
Get out of here.

864
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,620
I'm going to see him for a while.

865
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:58,620
You didn't see that

866
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,820
there are guests here for dinner.

867
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,060
Get out of here.

868
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:01,900
What are you doing?

869
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,020
You're too much.

870
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:04,740
Waiter.

871
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,460
Please pack for us.

872
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,060
Okay.

873
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:14,980
Okay, thank you.

874
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,340
It's 78 yuan in total.

875
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,420
Can you help us

876
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,420
with two more pairs of chopsticks?

877
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,020
Okay.

878
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,220
Wait a minute.

879
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,740
Hurry up.

880
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,460
Don't be so fast.

881
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,620
Hurry up.

882
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,620
Hurry up.

883
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,220
Brother Feng,

884
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,220
I want to take this.

885
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,220
Hurry up.

886
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,220
Hurry up.

887
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,420
Brother Feng, I want to take this.

888
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,420
Hurry up.

889
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:54,820
Some people say

890
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,220
love is a game of life.

891
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,820
We always use love as an excuse

892
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,820
to hurt the one we love most.

893
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,020
It seems that only in this way

894
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,420
can we confirm our love for each other repeatedly.

895
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,620
In fact, the more afraid we are of losing,

896
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,420
the easier it is to lose.

897
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,020
Love

898
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,820
should be a peaceful encounter.

899
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,420
The two stand on the same side of the world together

900
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,820
and move forward together.

901
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,220
It's good to make trouble.

902
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:41,820
I mean,

903
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:42,820
it's romantic

904
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,820
to take love

905
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:47,420
to an unknown place together.

906
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,420
Yes.

907
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,420
What did you say?

908
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,220
The elopement

909
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,620
can only be done when there is a real courage and love.

910
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,820
If you elope with the girl you like,

911
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:04,820
where will you go?

912
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,220
I will go to the sun.

913
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,420
Aren't you afraid of being hot?

914
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,620
Why should I be hot?

915
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,620
The important thing is that you go with her.

916
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,420
And you don't plan to come back.

917
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,020
What about me?

918
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:24,820
What about you?

919
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:26,820
Do you want to

920
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,620
have a relationship with me?

921
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,820
I will go to the sun with you.

922
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,220
I...

923
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,620
I don't have a girlfriend.

924
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,220
Don't be so ungrateful.

925
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:13,620
Can't you just bow to the world

926
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,220
when you're under the roof?

927
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,620
Who is the roof?

928
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,020
I want to give this song

929
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:37,620
to the girl I like.

930
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:39,220
Give it back to her.

931
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:44,020
I want to give this song to the girl I like.

932
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:44,820
Give it back to her.

933
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:54,420
I hope to have a bright floor.

934
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:58,220
I want to sunbathe every day.

935
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:01,420
Put all my things on the ground.

936
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:05,220
And live the old days.

937
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:09,020
I didn't have long hair back then.

938
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:15,020
And my most beloved girl

939
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:20,020
I hope you and I

940
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:23,020
Can be as kind as children

941
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:25,020
Give you a pure heart

942
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,020
Give me a pure appearance

943
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:31,020
And run back to their side

944
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:34,020
I hope this song

945
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:38,020
Can be sung with me

946
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:42,020
With your story and beautiful fantasies

947
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:48,020
Back to the time of the year

948
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:04,020
I hope you and I can go to the end

949
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:08,020
And shine the sun every day

950
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:11,020
We go to the sun with our knife

951
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:15,020
And sing the old times

952
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:19,020
The beautiful face of the breeze

953
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:23,020
The beauty is the way you smile

954
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:26,020
There are many things to tell me

955
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:31,020
I hope time will stop here

956
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:37,020
I hope you and I

957
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:41,020
Can be as kind as children

958
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:43,020
Give you a pure heart

959
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:45,020
Give me a pure appearance

960
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:49,020
And run back to their side

961
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:52,020
I hope this song

962
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:56,020
Can be sung with me

963
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:59,020
With your story and beautiful fantasies

964
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:05,020
Back to the time of the year

965
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:22,020
I hope you and I can go to the end

966
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:26,020
And shine the sun every day

967
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:29,020
We go to the sun with our knife

968
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:33,020
And sing the old times

969
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:37,020
The beautiful face of the breeze

970
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:40,020
The beauty is the way you smile

971
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:44,020
There are many things to tell me

972
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:49,020
I hope time will stop here

973
00:46:56,020 --> 00:47:00,020
I hope you and I can go to the end

974
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:04,020
And shine the sun every day

975
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:08,020
We go to the sun with our knife

976
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:13,020
And sing the old times

977
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:17,020
The beautiful face of the breeze

978
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:21,020
The beautiful face of the breeze

979
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:24,020
The beautiful face of the breeze

980
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:27,020
The beautiful face of the breeze
