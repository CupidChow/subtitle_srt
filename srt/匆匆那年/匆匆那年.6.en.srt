This show is sponsored by the world's thinnest smartphone, E-Life.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,120
The American expert in coverage, Di Qiao.

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,360
Broadcasts all over the city.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,880
I like you.

5
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,680
Do you like me?

6
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,200
I hope you're the happiest person in the world.

7
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,800
I wish you happiness.

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,280
Yes or no.

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,400
Yes.

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,120
Let's tell Zhao Yue and the others about this.

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,200
What kind of girl do you like?

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,680
Many people have an unpredictable past.

13
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,560
Some people in my heart,

14
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,720
no matter what they do,

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
they should always be friends.

16
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,880
Is the past that important?

17
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,440
If you trust the other person,

18
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,240
you should tell them everything.

19
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,200
I have a lot of things I haven't told you.

20
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,480
I told you to get out.

21
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,160
What's going on?

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,840
This woman

23
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,640
killed my brother.

24
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,080
Do you remember what I told you before?

25
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,760
About my friend who was killed by someone?

26
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,960
The guy in the Eighth School

27
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,560
died for a scourge.

28
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,920
That scourge is Fang Hui.

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,800
Who are you talking about?

30
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,040
I'm talking about her. What's wrong?

31
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,040
Sit down.

32
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,760
Look at her.

33
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,960
Look at her.

34
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,360
I'm not that kind of person.

35
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,480
I think Tang can't lie to you.

36
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,880
Have you asked him about the past?

37
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,880
It's me.

38
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,520
He's from the Eighth School.

39
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,200
He should ask about that.

40
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,280
Yes.

41
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,280
Everyone knows it.

42
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,280
So ridiculous.

43
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,560
Nonsense.

44
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,080
I don't think he's going to tell you about his past.

45
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,160
Tell me.

46
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,480
Stop pretending.

47
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,640
You're the same as my brother.

48
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,000
You're like a shoe.

49
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,960
If you say that no matter how much he has done

50
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,240
and loved her for half a year,

51
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,560
I don't care about you.

52
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,720
You don't have to care.

53
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,840
From now on, you should be a street-sweeper.

54
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,240
I'll pass by you.

55
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,520
I won't be a thief.

56
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,520
Stop talking.

57
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,720
I'm leaving.

58
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,240
Don't be a bad guy.

59
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,560
This woman

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,360
killed my brother.

61
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,840
Are you

62
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,360
me or not?

63
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,480
You're the same as my brother.

64
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,960
You're like a shoe.

65
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,000
I'll give it to you.

66
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,600
He's from the Eighth School.

67
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,400
He should ask about that.

68
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,160
Is the past that important?

69
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,240
Is it not enough

70
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,520
now?

71
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,560
I'm not that important.

72
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,560
Isn't it enough?

73
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,200
I think he has no intention

74
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,560
to tell you about his past.

75
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,600
I have many things

76
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,040
that you haven't told me.

77
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,800
You don't hate me, do you?

78
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,640
Gee.

79
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,000
Xue.

80
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,840
Why are you here?

81
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,400
What do you think?

82
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,800
Just say what you want to say.

83
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,480
So,

84
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,280
what they said is true?

85
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,480
If you think so,

86
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,120
then so be it.

87
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,080
Fang Wei,

88
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,720
can you tell me

89
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,960
what happened?

90
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,240
Is it meaningful for me to say this now?

91
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,440
Of course it's meaningful.

92
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,840
From the beginning to now,

93
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,800
have I ever kept anything from you?

94
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,200
What about you?

95
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,040
You didn't tell me anything.

96
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,880
Do you really not trust me?

97
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,320
So, in your heart,

98
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,360
I'm such a person.

99
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,440
What do you like about me?

100
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,560
Have you ever trusted me?

101
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,480
I wanted to tell you the truth.

102
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:49,960
But now,

103
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,760
it's meaningless.

104
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,680
I'm just like this

105
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,120
to you.

106
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,200
Listen.

107
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,680
I'm going to tell you seriously today.

108
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,480
Even if you killed and set fire to people in the past,

109
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,520
I still like you.

110
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,840
I still like you.

111
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,120
But you,

112
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,000
don't lie to me.

113
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,320
I'm different from him.

114
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,840
I'm a good student.

115
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,320
I just want to study.

116
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,320
He's playful.

117
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,480
He wants to be a big brother and join the society.

118
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,240
I still don't know

119
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,000
why he likes me.

120
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,880
Everyone thinks

121
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,200
he's a good person.

122
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,160
But we

123
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,560
never said anything.

124
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,280
From now on,

125
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,480
Xiaojian is my woman.

126
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,400
If you dare to bully her,

127
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,400
you'll be in trouble with me.

128
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,600
I thought we'd be over in a few days.

129
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,920
But I didn't expect...

130
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,640
Yang Yang,

131
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,240
stay here and play with me.

132
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,240
You say...

133
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,280
Ra ne.

134
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,760
You don't need to check the woman of that woman.

135
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,520
Did you see who is he?

136
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,400
That bastard.

137
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,560
Die.

138
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,560
Xue.

139
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,560
Let's go.

140
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,560
Come on!

141
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,560
Come on!

142
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,560
Everyone thinks

143
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,560
I should have left immediately.

144
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,560
No one listens to me.

145
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,560
I can never change.

146
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:09,560
I've been wearing white until I graduated from middle school.

147
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,560
I'm so scared.

148
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,560
You'll abandon me after I tell you.

149
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,560
Fool.

150
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,560
I told you.

151
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,560
Even if you killed and set fire before,

152
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,560
I still like you.

153
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,560
I love you.

154
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,560
I'll always love you.

155
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,560
Don't cry.

156
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,560
I'm here.

157
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,560
I'm afraid you'll cry.

158
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,560
If you cry again,

159
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,560
I'll cry with you.

160
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,560
Did you forget something today?

161
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,560
What?

162
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,560
A gift.

163
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,560
Here.

164
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,560
When did you buy it?

165
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,560
I like it.

166
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,560
It's good that you like it.

167
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,560
Fang Hui.

168
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,560
I will never

169
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,560
let you get hurt again.

170
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,560
Hello, is there anything I can help you with?

171
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,560
Hello.

172
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,560
Please call 53421 for me.

173
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,560
The message says

174
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,560
that you...

175
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,560
Are you free today?

176
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,560
Okay, just a moment.

177
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,560
No.

178
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,560
How about...

179
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,560
Do you want to watch a movie today?

180
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,560
Is it Qiao Er calling 53421 for you?

181
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,560
Do you want to watch a movie today?

182
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,560
Forget it.

183
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,560
I'll leave a message

184
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,560
and go to the library to do my homework.

185
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,560
Okay.

186
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,560
It's so hot today.

187
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,560
I haven't come to you yet.

188
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,560
I went to the library in the city today.

189
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,560
But I still haven't found

190
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,560
the little prince from the 1979 version.

191
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,560
Do you really want that version?

192
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,560
I watched that version when I was a kid.

193
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,560
It's a childhood memory.

194
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,560
Don't worry.

195
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,560
I will definitely find it.

196
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,560
It doesn't matter.

197
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,560
It's good to keep some things in memory.

198
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,560
Well,

199
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,560
are you free today?

200
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,560
Yes.

201
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,560
You two are here.

202
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,560
Hurry up.

203
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,560
It's been a long time since I went to the library.

204
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,560
I'm not going.

205
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,560
I haven't finished my homework.

206
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,560
Okay, hurry up.

207
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,560
Go with me.

208
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,560
Ye, you're so annoying.

209
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,560
You always come out to play.

210
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,560
You'll get the eagle later.

211
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,560
What are you looking at?

212
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,560
What are you doing?

213
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,560
Let me see.

214
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,560
It's so boring.

215
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,560
The whole summer vacation is going to end.

216
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,560
Ye, have you finished your homework?

217
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,560
No, but I still have homework.

218
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,560
I told you.

219
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,560
He's just copying us.

220
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,560
I'm not copying you.

221
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,560
I didn't take a break.

222
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,560
I've copied all the hidden characters of Mary.

223
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,560
You've never seen me.

224
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,560
Ye, don't be so arrogant.

225
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,560
When the school starts, you can copy anyone.

226
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,560
Sister Jia Mo.

227
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,560
Sister Jia Mo.

228
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,560
What good movies are there recently?

229
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,560
Can I invite you to watch a movie?

230
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,560
Get out.

231
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,560
I heard that there is a very good movie.

232
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,560
The Lamp.

233
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,560
That song is sung by Zhang Xin Zhe.

234
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,560
It's very nice.

235
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,560
There's only one word.

236
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,560
I only say it once.

237
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,560
I'm afraid that the people who hear it will not be able to hear it.

238
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,560
Go.

239
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,560
Let's watch it together.

240
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,560
Jia Mo, let's go together.

241
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,560
No, thanks.

242
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,560
I'm doing my best.

243
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,560
Let's play the test.

244
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,560
Come on.

245
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,560
Okay.

246
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,560
Get up.

247
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,560
It's time to do the test.

248
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,560
Come on.

249
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,560
Let's say that the five of us go to ride the roller coaster.

250
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,560
From the first row to the fifth row.

251
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,560
How will you line up?

252
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,560
Who?

253
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,560
Fang Hui.

254
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,560
You go first.

255
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,560
I don't dare to ride the roller coaster.

256
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,560
This is to make you pretend.

257
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,560
Yes.

258
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,560
It's not for you to do.

259
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,560
Think about it.

260
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,560
Come on.

261
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,560
You go first.

262
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,560
I think.

263
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,560
The first one is Chen Xun.

264
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,560
The second one is me.

265
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,560
The third one is Fang Hui.

266
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,560
The fourth one is Jia Mo.

267
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,560
You're the last one.

268
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,560
You put me in the last one.

269
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,560
Let me see.

270
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,560
The fifth one is the person you dislike the most.

271
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,560
I'm the most dislikeable person.

272
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,560
Do I make you dislike me that much?

273
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,560
I do dislike you.

274
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,560
You're so accurate.

275
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,560
I'm also very dislikeable to you.

276
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,560
The second and the fourth are your good friends.

277
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,560
The first one is the person you trust the most.

278
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,560
Why do you trust him but not me?

279
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,560
When am I not reliable?

280
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,560
Come on.

281
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,560
He's just too scared to be the first one.

282
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,560
He's just too scared to be the first one.

283
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,560
He's just too scared.

284
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,560
What about the third one?

285
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,560
The third one is the person you love the most.

286
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,560
The person you love the most?

287
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,560
Who am I going to rely on?

288
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,560
Fang Hui.

289
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,560
I think this is reliable.

290
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,560
Why is this question so accurate?

291
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,560
It's not accurate.

292
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,560
Yes.

293
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,560
It's not accurate.

294
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,560
It's purely entertainment.

295
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,560
It's not accurate.

296
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,560
It's not accurate?

297
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,560
Yes.

298
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,560
I also think it's not accurate.

299
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,560
You trust me.

300
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,560
I believe you.

301
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,560
If you were to answer that question,

302
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,560
what would you do?

303
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,560
Guess.

304
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,560
I can't guess.

305
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,560
Come here.

306
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,560
What's wrong?

307
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,560
So annoying.

308
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,560
Don't drink it.

309
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,560
My clothes are wet.

310
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,560
You can wear mine if you're wet.

311
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,560
Do you really want to know the answer to that question?

312
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,560
If we ever ride a roller coaster together,

313
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,560
I'll hold you in my arms.

314
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,560
I'll hold you tightly.

315
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,560
I won't let you be in danger.

316
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,560
Let's go.

317
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,560
This time, our class was selected

318
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,560
to participate in the 50th anniversary celebration.

319
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,560
It's a rare opportunity.

320
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,560
I hope everyone can treat it seriously.

321
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,560
Lin Jia Mu,

322
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,560
we need a male partner to cooperate with you.

323
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,560
Which male classmate would like to?

324
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,560
Teacher, I'm willing.

325
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,560
Everyone, look at it seriously.

326
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,560
Come on, you two, get ready.

327
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,560
If you dare to step on my foot, I'll kill you.

328
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,560
Don't worry. I'm a genius. I can do it as soon as I learn it.

329
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,560
Ready, seven.

330
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,560
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

331
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,560
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

332
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:12,560
Three, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

333
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,560
Four, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

334
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,560
Okay.

335
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,560
You haven't gone home yet?

336
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,560
You're still up?

337
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,560
I'm playing football.

338
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,560
Really?

339
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,560
You're always playing football.

340
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,560
I'll be back soon.

341
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,560
Okay, come on.

342
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,560
Zhang Wei wore a leather jacket that day.

343
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,560
Look.

344
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,560
Those shoes look good in magazines.

345
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,560
Why are the shoes so ugly?

346
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,560
I'm not playing football.

347
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,560
I'm playing football.

348
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,560
It's none of your business.

349
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,560
Are you done?

350
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,560
What's wrong?

351
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,560
I'm tired.

352
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,560
I'm going to take a break.

353
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,560
The recruitment for the team has begun again.

354
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,560
You didn't attend last year.

355
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,560
You're not going to save your life this year?

356
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,560
I don't like competitions.

357
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,560
I think some things are boring if they don't win.

358
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,560
But I'm fine.

359
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,560
Okay, okay, okay.

360
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,560
What a big picture.

361
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,560
Chen Xun.

362
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,560
What?

363
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,560
Do you like Fang Hui?

364
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,560
Guess.

365
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,560
Is Fang Hui a good friend?

366
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,560
She's pretty good.

367
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,560
She's very kind.

368
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,560
Very simple.

369
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,560
She's a new star.

370
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,560
She always takes pictures for others.

371
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,560
And she's not stingy.

372
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,560
She's not stingy.

373
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,560
She's not weak.

374
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,560
She's smart.

375
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,560
She's kind.

376
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,560
That's why I like her.

377
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,560
Come on, guys.

378
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,560
Guys, stand in your positions.

379
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,560
Come on.

380
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,560
Face me first.

381
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,560
Stretch out your legs.

382
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,560
Let's practice together.

383
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,560
Girls, turn around.

384
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,560
Come on.

385
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,560
Xiaoran, what's wrong with you today?

386
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,560
Are you not feeling well?

387
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,560
Maybe I didn't sleep well last night.

388
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,560
You don't look well.

389
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,560
How about you ask Mr. Huang for a leave later?

390
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,560
I'm fine.

391
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,560
I didn't sleep well.

392
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,560
Last night,

393
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,560
I was so tired.

394
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,560
I was so tired.

395
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,560
I was so tired.

396
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,560
I was so tired.

397
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,560
I was so tired.

398
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,560
I was so tired.

399
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,560
Can you be a little more serious?

400
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,560
You're full of thoughts.

401
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,560
Fang Hui, aren't you going to celebrate your birthday?

402
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,560
Let's have a birthday party for him.

403
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,560
Of course.

404
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,560
Of course.

405
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,560
Of course.

406
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,560
No, it's too troublesome.

407
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,560
What's so troublesome?

408
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,560
Just tell me how you want to spend your birthday.

409
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,560
We can spend it for you.

410
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,560
No, I don't want to.

411
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,560
Okay.

412
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,560
It's settled.

413
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,560
Okay.

414
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,560
Xiaoran, you've ordered a lot.

415
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,560
What do you think?

416
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,560
I...

417
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,560
Don't be afraid.

418
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,560
Come on, stop playing.

419
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,560
Come down.

420
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,560
Come on, come on.

421
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,560
Don't make a fuss.

422
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,560
I was playing with their film at that time.

423
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,560
Whose home is this?

424
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,560
Why are you so happy?

425
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,560
Let's go.

426
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,560
Are you crazy?

427
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,560
Where's Qiao Ran?

428
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,560
She said she had something to do at home.

429
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,560
She went back first.

430
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,560
What's going on?

431
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,560
Didn't we agree to put Fang Hui back to buy gifts?

432
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,560
Ignore her.

433
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,560
Okay, okay.

434
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,560
Forget about it.

435
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,560
I'm good at making fire.

436
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,560
Let's go.

437
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,560
Come on, you're just like that.

438
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,560
I'm going first.

439
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,560
Let's go.

440
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,560
Let's go.

441
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,560
I'm coming.

442
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:57,460
To the

443
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,560
Why are you here?

444
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,560
Can you still come back?

445
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,560
I'm worried about you.

446
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,560
What's wrong with you recently?

447
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,160
You're always so calm.

448
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,360
I'm fine.

449
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,560
Qiao Ran.

450
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,160
We have nothing to say, right?

451
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,640
Why didn't you tell me?

452
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,960
Tell you what?

453
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,640
Your true thoughts.

454
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,800
I'm afraid that

455
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,000
we can't even be friends.

456
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,800
Shouldn't friends be honest?

457
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,200
Fang Hui.

458
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,040
Do you think

459
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,440
I'm timid

460
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,560
and weak?

461
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,320
How could you?

462
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,280
I think you're

463
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,200
very brave and strong.

464
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,840
But I don't even have the courage to tell the truth.

465
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,200
When I react,

466
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,760
everything will be too late.

467
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,160
You didn't try.

468
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,520
How could you know it's too late?

469
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,200
Actually, I...

470
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,520
Actually, I...

471
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:58,440
monuments

472
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,760
Excuse me, where's Yang Yue Yang?

473
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,040
It's too hot to be here.

474
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,840
Today is day 7.

475
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,240
Why are we still here?

476
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,280
Alright.

477
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,480
Let me deliver it to you.

478
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,960
Go and see mother?

479
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,920
Just back.

480
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,200
Does she okay affiliation?

481
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,320
It looks normal.

482
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,080
It's just like how uncle dissipated remove of unfinished work.

483
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,560
No, it's different.

484
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,540
Look,

485
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,920
It's new now,

486
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,560
and the crime is on TV.

487
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,360
This time, uncle brought us to Hei Yang Soup.

488
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,360
I didn't know that I was so greedy.

489
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,960
I put half a bottle of vinegar in his face.

490
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,960
It made him feel sour and his teeth didn't reach.

491
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,960
You're the only one who's a little big.

492
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,960
Other kids call me dad and wear a red dress.

493
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,160
They don't even talk.

494
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,160
You, on the other hand,

495
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,960
snatched his hat directly.

496
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,760
You said that I would be a police officer in the future.

497
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,560
Don't be so stupid.

498
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,960
How can you not remember that you're so stupid?

499
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,360
That time, uncle taught us the secret of Hei Yang Soup.

500
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,160
Do you remember?

501
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,160
Put pepper in it.

502
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,160
Look at me.

503
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,160
The taste has changed.

504
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,160
If my dad were still alive,

505
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:47,160
he wouldn't have thought that his life has changed so much.

506
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,760
We wouldn't have changed.

507
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,760
Why are you suddenly so serious?

508
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,960
I'm telling the truth.

509
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,160
No matter what happens in the future,

510
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,160
we will be good brothers for life.

511
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,160
The End

512
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,160
Hello?

513
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,960
Good news. Good news.

514
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,760
Life is like a joke.

515
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,960
Life is like a nonsense.

516
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,160
Good news.

517
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,960
Life is like a joke.

518
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,560
Life is like a nonsense.

519
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,160
Good news.

520
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,360
Why doesn't this kid come to class and say something?

521
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,560
Maybe something happened at home.

522
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,960
Students, students.

523
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,360
Come here. Come here.

524
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,560
Come here.

525
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,160
Good news.

526
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,960
Turn it off. Turn it off.

527
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,360
The school received a temporary notice.

528
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,560
They said that the Education Bureau should balance the honor of each school.

529
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,960
They gave the opportunity to our school to attend the national celebration to the first-year students.

530
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,960
So the dance in our class was cancelled.

531
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,560
Why?

532
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,160
Enough. Enough. Stop arguing.

533
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,160
I know that you have worked hard.

534
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,360
Although you can't attend,

535
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,560
but this time, you still have a memorable experience, right?

536
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,560
Okay. Everyone, calm down.

537
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,360
Go to class.

538
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,560
Teacher He.

539
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,560
Qiao Ran asked for leave. Do you know that?

540
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,760
I know. She said that something happened at home.

541
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,560
Did she say anything?

542
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,160
Isn't Qiao Ran's family special?

543
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,360
I didn't ask. I'm afraid that she can't tell.

544
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,160
What's wrong?

545
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,560
Nothing.

546
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,560
Go back.

547
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,560
Okay.

548
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,160
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

549
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,560
I'll go first. Thank you.

550
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,560
Okay.

551
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,560
Hello?

552
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,960
Who was calling me just now?

553
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,560
Dear friend, hello.

554
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,760
Do you also have a marriage?

555
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,760
I'm very happy to be served by you.

556
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,760
God's order!

557
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,960
Which god's order called you?

558
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,160
It's you, this god's order.

559
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,560
I'll go first.

560
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,560
Okay.

561
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,560
Thank you.

562
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,560
Bye.

563
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,560
Bye.

564
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,560
Bye.

565
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,560
Bye.

566
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,560
Bye.

567
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,560
Bye.

568
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,560
Bye.

569
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,560
Bye.

570
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,560
Bye.

571
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,560
Bye.

572
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,560
Bye.

573
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,560
What should I give her?

574
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,560
Su Kai is already in the third grade.

575
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,560
He must be very tired from studying.

576
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,560
Why don't you give her a kiss and kiss heart?

577
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,560
No.

578
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,560
She's studying hard enough. I gave her a kiss and kiss heart.

579
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,560
I gave her a lot of pressure.

580
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,560
That's true.

581
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,560
I have to give her one.

582
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,560
She can see it every day and use it.

583
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,560
She can see it every day and use it.

584
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,560
Right?

585
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,560
You...

586
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,560
Jia Mu!

587
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,560
Wait a minute.

588
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,560
Why are you here too?

589
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,560
We're here to shop.

590
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,560
Where's Zhao Ye?

591
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,560
You have to tell him not to play around.

592
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,560
He's in the college entrance examination.

593
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,560
Otherwise, he can't even get a special education.

594
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,560
What's wrong?

595
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,560
You look down.

596
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,560
I'll buy you ice cream.

597
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,560
No need. We're leaving.

598
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,560
Wait a minute.

599
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,560
You're usually very lively.

600
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,560
Why are you so sudden today?

601
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,560
Is she okay?

602
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,560
Tell me if you have something on your mind.

603
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,560
I'm here for free.

604
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,560
Who's got something on my mind?

605
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,560
You have a bad temper.

606
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,560
Okay, I'm leaving.

607
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,560
Right.

608
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,560
Please tell your class's high school doctor

609
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,560
not to call me again.

610
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,560
Don't buy me water again.

611
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,560
I'm very grateful to him.

612
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,560
But I really don't have any chance with him.

613
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,560
It's because of him.

614
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,560
Yes.

615
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,560
His name is Zheng Xue.

616
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,560
She's my girlfriend.

617
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,560
Okay, I got it.

618
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,560
I'll tell him. Bye.

619
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,560
Jia Mu.

620
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,560
Jia Mu, wait for me.

621
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,560
Jia Mu.

622
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,560
Why does he have a girlfriend?

623
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,560
Why does he have a girlfriend?

624
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,560
Why?

625
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,560
I haven't told him that I'm Gao Yi Yi.

626
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,560
I'm going to buy him water.

627
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,560
I'm going to collect a lot of S's

628
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,560
and give him a dollar.

629
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,560
Why?

630
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,560
I'm going to do a lot of things.

631
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,560
I have a lot of plans.

632
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,560
Until the day he graduates,

633
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,560
I don't want to stand in front of him

634
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,560
and tell him

635
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,560
that I'm Gao Yi Yi.

636
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,560
Gao Yi Yi is me.

637
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:33,560
I like you very much.

638
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,560
I like you.

639
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,560
Why?

640
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,560
I'm not stupid.

641
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,560
How could you?

642
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:49,560
Everyone will be like this when they meet this.

643
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,560
I want you to stop being stupid.

644
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,560
I want to continue being stupid.

645
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,560
If you keep being like this,

646
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,560
will there be no result?

647
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,560
Life is far away.

648
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,560
He can't see me now.

649
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,560
It doesn't mean that he will always be like this.

650
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,560
I want to be good to him.

651
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,560
I don't want to say goodbye.

652
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,560
But one day,

653
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,560
he will see me

654
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,560
and know my good.

655
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,560
Stupid girl.

656
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,560
You're hurting me.

657
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,560
You're hurting me.

658
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,560
Su Kai.

659
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,560
What?

660
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,560
This is for you.

661
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,560
Why do you suddenly think of a gift?

662
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,560
You're a senior.

663
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,560
I want to give you a gift.

664
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,560
I wish you a successful study this year.

665
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,560
Thank you.

666
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,560
This is expensive.

667
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,560
Why did you spend so much money?

668
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,560
I don't have any.

669
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,560
You must bring it.

670
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,560
No problem. I'll bring it as long as I play.

671
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,560
Su Kai.

672
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,560
This is Lin Jia Mo, right?

673
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,560
He didn't come to say hello that day.

674
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,560
He invited us to dinner today.

675
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,560
You should come too.

676
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,560
I forgot to say that we're going to dinner tonight.

677
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,560
I'm not going.

678
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,560
Let's drink.

679
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,560
Cheers.

680
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,560
Cheers.

681
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,560
I'll drink.

682
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,560
I'll drink too.

683
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,560
Zhao Ye.

684
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,560
Give me some food.

685
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,560
You're still eating this?

686
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,560
Don't just eat it.

687
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,560
Say something.

688
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,560
First of all,

689
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,560
I wish you

690
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,560
happiness and sweetness.

691
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,560
Good.

692
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,560
I wish you

693
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,560
a successful study this year.

694
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,560
No.

695
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,560
Zhao Ye.

696
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,560
I'll drink.

697
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,560
Let me drink.

698
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,560
What's wrong?

699
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,560
Let's drink.

700
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,560
Let him drink.

701
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,560
You're so strong.

702
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,560
Let's call it a day.

703
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,560
Let's call it a day.

704
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,560
Let's drink.

705
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,560
Let's drink.

706
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,560
Zhao Ye.

707
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,560
Take Jia Mo and An Jue home.

708
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,560
I'll take you home if something happens.

709
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,560
Don't drink.

710
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,560
Wine.

711
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,560
Okay.

712
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,560
I'll take the wine.

713
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,560
I'll drink with you today.

714
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,560
Zhao Ye.

715
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,560
You have to hold on.

716
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,560
We've been

717
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,560
around the city for two days.

718
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,560
Are we going home?

719
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,560
You must be very unhappy today.

720
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,560
I knew you'd be unhappy.

721
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,560
You must be unhappy.

722
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,560
If you're unhappy,

723
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,560
I'll feel bad

724
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,560
if I follow you.

725
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,560
I love you.

726
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,560
I love you.

727
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,560
I really love you.

728
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,560
I can only let you

729
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,560
see how much I love you.

730
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,560
See how much I love you.

731
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,560
Baby.

732
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,560
I love you so much.

733
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,560
I can only let you

734
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,560
have a love

735
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,560
I can only

736
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,560
have a love

737
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,560
I can only be at ease.

738
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,560
I love you.

739
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,560
I love you.

740
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,560
Talk to her.

741
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,000
I have to tell you this.

742
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,080
Pro gather here to bring something for you.

743
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:02,720
Pro gather here

744
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,800
to be a good usage.

745
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,720
Why can't I be a good use?

746
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,960
You don't know Zhou Si Shang too well.

747
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,240
Why do you care?

748
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,160
Giving moments states what Zhao Squid Tyler meant.

749
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,400
Still,

750
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,200
Now everything is totally smart.

751
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,720
No two in the life

752
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,160
Troubles as lovers.

753
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,360
They just all know.

754
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,880
I can't do nothing

755
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,320
Do you think it's unfair?

756
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,200
But I tell you

757
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,920
This is the way of the world

758
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,920
You can't emphasize fairness

759
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,520
If it's fair

760
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,480
Li He shouldn't die

761
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,640
Tongtong, that bastard

762
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,920
Shouldn't live either

763
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:45,960
Yes

764
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,880
I'm the one who gave up your car

765
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,680
I'm the one who bullied you

766
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,000
What's wrong?

767
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,480
Do you think I'm a jerk?

768
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,800
But I have no choice

769
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,120
If I don't do something

770
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,160
I'm sorry to Li He

771
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,000
I don't blame you

772
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,800
Damn

773
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,600
You don't blame me?

774
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,040
Well

775
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,640
Let's not talk about the past

776
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,040
Let's talk about the past

777
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,520
You can't be with Chen Xun

778
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:20,840
Li He

779
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,600
Like my brother

780
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,040
Chen Xun is like my brother

781
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,040
I'm afraid you three will be connected

782
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,520
I can't break this quilt

783
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,280
Don't blame me

784
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,040
You can't be with Chen Xun

785
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,480
Come on, come on, come on

786
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,400
Come on, come on, come on

787
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,360
Come on, come on, come on

788
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,040
Brother

789
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,080
No one is with me

790
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,920
I'm not used to it

791
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,120
Where did he go?

792
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,680
I don't know

793
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,360
I've been protecting him for many times

794
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,280
He didn't come back

795
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,120
He wasn't like this before

796
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,160
That's right

797
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,400
I played with Qiao Zhen that day

798
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,480
I know you

799
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,600
Know me?

800
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,200
What?

801
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,680
I know you

802
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,680
I mean you're kind

803
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,560
I mean you're kind

804
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,960
What do you mean?

805
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,600
I think Qiao Zhen likes you

806
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,440
What are you talking about?

807
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,240
I'm a good friend of Qiao Zhen

808
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,360
Just like Jia Mu and Zhao Ye

809
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,800
I just feel it

810
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,200
Feel it

811
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,160
Let's call him again

812
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,120
How is it?

813
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,480
No one answered

814
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,600
No one answered the phone at home

815
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,200
He didn't answer his wife

816
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,200
What should we do?

817
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,600
Let's wait a little bit

818
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,160
Let's go first

819
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,280
Aquí

820
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,380
Happy Birthday to you!

821
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,880
Shitou, happy birthday!

822
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,320
Wang Hui, happy 17th birthday.

823
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,000
From now on,

824
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,320
be happy every day.

825
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,000
Thank you.

826
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,040
Wang Hui,

827
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,280
I see this little boy

828
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,720
and I want to be with you.

829
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,080
The sun rises,

830
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:40,920
the moon sets.

831
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,040
I'm not going to be with you.

832
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:42,920
Thank you, Xiao Ying.

833
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,120
Wang Hui, happy birthday.

834
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,040
Thank you, Jia Mu.

835
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,480
It's a pity that Qiao Ran didn't come.

836
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,400
We agreed to go hiking together.

837
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,240
Yeah.

838
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,200
He didn't come,

839
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:55,920
so he didn't say anything.

840
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,840
I'm sorry, I'm late.

841
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,600
Where have you been?

842
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,000
Yeah.

843
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,880
You didn't come,

844
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,920
so you didn't call me.

845
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:06,840
You'll die.

846
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,040
I had something to do,

847
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,280
so I didn't have time to tell you.

848
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:09,880
I'm sorry.

849
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,520
You can call us.

850
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,120
Yeah, you have to punish me.

851
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,280
I'll punish you

852
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,600
for going back to the mountain.

853
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,480
No, no, no.

854
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,080
I'll punish you.

855
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:17,720
Are you serious?

856
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,920
You can't touch us.

857
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,680
Wang Hui, happy birthday.

858
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,880
Is it the one you wanted?

859
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,240
Yeah.

860
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,440
Where did you find it?

861
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,160
I went to a bookstore two days ago.

862
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,480
I saw it last night.

863
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,240
Thank you.

864
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,280
And I hope you

865
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,760
never change.

866
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,160
You're good

867
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:38,880
now.

868
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,160
Let's go hiking together.

869
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,560
Let's go.

870
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,440
Let's go.

871
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:48,880
Hurry up.

872
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,440
Let's go.

873
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,280
Xiao Xiao, be careful.

874
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:51,760
Xiao Xiao, be careful.

875
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,720
Let's go.

876
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:53,880
Be careful.

877
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,160
Come on.

878
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,080
Come on.

879
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,720
No.

880
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,960
Do you have a version of the 8700?

881
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,120
No.

882
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,840
Do you have a version of the 8700?

883
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,280
8700.

884
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,640
Sorry, I don't have it.

885
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,040
Hello, do you have a version of the 8700?

886
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,000
You can ask this bookstore.

887
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,560
But it's a little far from here.

888
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,040
Okay, thank you.

889
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,800
Really?

890
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,120
That's great. I'll be right there.

891
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,440
Is this the one you want?

892
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,280
Yes, where did you find it?

893
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,840
I went to a bookstore a few days ago.

894
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:26,960
I saw it last night.

895
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,000
We're here!

896
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,000
We're here!

897
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,800
We're here!

898
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:43,400
We're here!

899
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,840
We're here!

900
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,280
There are many kinds of feelings.

901
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,120
For a person,

902
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,440
you don't have to be with him.

903
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,120
Because you know what he's most precious.

904
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,160
You just want him to be happy.

905
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,320
Even if there's no place for you

906
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,040
in this happiness.

907
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,360
기박경

908
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,680
Too beautiful!

909
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:29,800
Love that€·

910
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,280
It's too weak,

911
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:42,320
I've been refining the red line

912
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,320
Let me go!

913
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,320
I'll kill you!

914
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,320
Let me go!

915
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,320
Do you know what I'm most afraid of?

916
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,320
What if you two leave?

917
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:18,320
I have a secret.

918
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,320
What do you feel when you receive it?

919
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,320
Let me go!

920
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,320
I'll kill you!

921
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,320
Let me go!

922
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,320
I'll kill you!

923
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,320
Let me go!

924
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,320
I'll kill you!

925
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,320
Let me go!

926
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,320
I'll kill you!

927
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,320
Let me go!

928
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,320
I'll kill you!

929
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,320
Let me go!

930
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,320
I'll kill you!

931
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:56,320
Let me go!

932
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,320
I'll kill you!

933
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,320
Let me go!

934
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:59,320
I'll kill you!

935
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,320
Let me go!

936
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:01,320
I'll kill you!

937
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,320
Let me go!

938
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,320
I'll kill you!

939
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,320
Let me go!

940
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,320
I'll kill you!

941
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,320
Let me go!

942
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,320
I'll kill you!

943
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,320
Let me go!

944
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,320
I'll kill you!

945
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,320
Let me go!

946
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,320
I'll kill you!

947
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:29,320

Everyone

949
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,320
Grow

950
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:42,320
Your own journey

951
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,320
I've been through one stop

952
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,320
Next stop

953
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:54,320
I can't stop

954
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,320
Keep looking

955
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:02,320
How many obstacles are there on the way

956
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:07,320
Suddenly look back

957
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,320
Look back

958
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:15,320
I've been through one stop

959
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,320
Hey you let me go

960
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:20,320
Back to our time

961
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,320
Hey you let me fly

962
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:25,320
The wind is blowing too fast

963
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,320
Hey you my best friend

964
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,320
We still remember

965
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,320
Let's get up and fight

966
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:35,320
We still love
