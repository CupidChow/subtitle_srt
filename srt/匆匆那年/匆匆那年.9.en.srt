00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
This show is sponsored by the world's thinnest smartphone, E-Life.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,520
The American expert in covering up the problem, Di Xiao.

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,440
Zhang Ye.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,320
No one can stop him.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,040
Only Zhang Ye wants to go to our home.

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:16,760
Chen Xun.

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,000
Can you stop being so selfish?

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,440
I'm afraid we can never go back to the way we were.

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,520
If you don't want to fight, you can stop.

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,120
Why not?

11
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,240
Which one is more painful, hard work or regret?

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,360
You can't forget your friends.

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,040
You've been performing well lately.

14
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:36,640
You're still...

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,840
Yes.

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,920
Who am I?

17
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,240
I've liked you since I first met you.

18
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,240
But I only have Cheng Xu in my heart.

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,640
Let me fight.

20
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,560
I can also fight with a sword.

21
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,560
No way!

22
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,320
No.

23
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,600
Let's break up with each other.

24
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,400
You're at your final year of high school.

25
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,440
Just worry about the exam.

26
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,120
Don't go on a relationship with boys and girls.

27
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,440
I'm most happy today.

28
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,720
I'm so happy.

29
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,520
What's your name?

30
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,080
Walk slowly.

31
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,800
You pick a long line for two hours.

32
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,940
Old girl, you pick a line.

33
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,720
If you think I should be true to you?

34
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,360
Be a apologize.

35
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,480
Come on, come on.

36
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,760
I'm kidding.

37
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,440
You're right.

38
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,640
Right?

39
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,640
Don't drag me. I'll show you later.

40
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,640
Listen to me.

41
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,640
When the class is over,

42
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,640
I'll give you the notes of the week.

43
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,640
Then, I'll check the notes in the afternoon.

44
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,640
I'll see where I made a mistake.

45
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,640
That's right.

46
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,640
You have to have the spirit of making mistakes.

47
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,640
You have entered the most important stage of your life.

48
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,640
In this year,

49
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,640
your life will change completely.

50
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,640
But I'll say the ugly things first.

51
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,640
Sir.

52
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,640
Sir.

53
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,640
People should know shame.

54
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,640
Taking money from parents

55
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,640
and not doing what they learn

56
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,640
is not shame.

57
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,640
The third year of high school

58
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,640
doing nothing to do with the college entrance examination

59
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,640
is not shame.

60
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,640
Chen Xu,

61
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,640
are you going back?

62
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,640
Yes.

63
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,640
Do you know that the practical meeting is going to be held today?

64
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,640
Sit back.

65
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,640
I repeat myself again.

66
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,640
In our class,

67
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,640
we must stop the situation

68
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,640
where men and women have contact with allergy.

69
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,640
The college entrance examination

70
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,640
is the cross the bridge of thousands of horses.

71
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,640
This is the first time in your life

72
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,640
that you have divided into three, six, nine classes.

73
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,640
Whoever can go to a good college

74
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,640
and have a good future

75
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,640
should start from now on.

76
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,640
When you are in the classroom,

77
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,640
you can write down which college you want to go to

78
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,640
on the blackboard.

79
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,640
Now,

80
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,640
stand up.

81
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,640
Raise your right hand.

82
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,640
Come with me.

83
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,640
I am confident.

84
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,640
I am outstanding.

85
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,640
Life can be a few twists and turns.

86
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,640
Make up your mind.

87
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,640
Go ahead.

88
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,640
What are you looking at?

89
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,640
Let me see which college you are going to go to.

90
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,640
You are so good at it.

91
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,640
You are really good at it.

92
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,640
Why didn't you tell me

93
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,640
which radio school you are going to go to?

94
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,640
None of your business.

95
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,640
I am going to go to the school.

96
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,640
It's not a big deal.

97
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,640
Why do you have to go to the school?

98
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,640
Let's go to the school.

99
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,640
No, he can't go.

100
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,640
Why?

101
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,640
He hasn't finished his three experiments today.

102
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,640
He will die if you let him play.

103
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,640
He will die if I say so.

104
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,640
It's embarrassing.

105
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,640
You are good, Lin Jia Mo.

106
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,640
You are like Zhao Ye's mother now.

107
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,640
You are so...

108
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,640
You asked me to supervise your study.

109
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,640
You even said that you will never be soft.

110
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,640
Who said that?

111
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,640
I can't say that.

112
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,640
I am useless.

113
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,640
I can't help you this time.

114
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,640
The strategy is already failed.

115
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,640
I will ask you a question.

116
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,640
Bye.

117
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,640
Why do you want to take the broadcasting major?

118
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,640
If I become the host,

119
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,640
Su Kai can see me on TV every day.

120
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,640
You are so brave.

121
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,640
But I heard that the competition is very fierce.

122
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,640
If I fail...

123
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,640
What are you talking about?

124
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,640
I will definitely pass.

125
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,640
You...

126
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,640
You are so brave.

127
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,640
You are so brave.

128
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,640
You can pass the entrance exam.

129
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,640
Yes.

130
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,640
What about you?

131
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,640
Are you going to the same school as Chen Xun?

132
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,640
I am afraid that I can't pass the exam.

133
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,640
I will be separated from him.

134
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,640
No.

135
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,640
Our school is the focus.

136
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,640
As long as you study hard, you will definitely pass.

137
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,640
Let's cheer together.

138
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,640
Let's see.

139
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,640
Xiaolei.

140
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,640
Please stop.

141
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,640
I have something to say.

142
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,640
When I was in class three,

143
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,640
a boy passed a girl a message.

144
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,640
I got it.

145
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,640
The content is very bad.

146
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,640
Why are you laughing?

147
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,640
I am telling you.

148
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,640
Now you are in class three.

149
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,640
If you have these things in your mind,

150
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,640
please tell me.

151
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,640
Otherwise, I will be polite if I find it.

152
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,640
Do you understand?

153
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,640
Yes.

154
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,640
Thank you.

155
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,640
You are welcome.

156
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,640
Is it sweet?

157
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,640
Yes.

158
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,640
I am telling you.

159
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,640
Next time I will take you to my grandma's

160
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,640
sweet and sour soup.

161
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,640
It is delicious.

162
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,640
There is a layer of sugar.

163
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,640
The stuffing is red.

164
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,640
But we are so nervous to study now.

165
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,640
We don't have time to go.

166
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,640
Why do you think so much?

167
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,640
Look at me.

168
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,640
I should study and play.

169
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,640
Do you think

170
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,640
Mr. Jia knows about us today?

171
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,640
No.

172
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,640
Don't think too much.

173
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,640
If you think about it,

174
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,640
you might as well

175
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,640
put your energy in the test.

176
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,640
Yes.

177
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,640
What are you doing?

178
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,640
You are my wife.

179
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,640
I want to save money.

180
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,640
Is that Mr. Jia?

181
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,640
Did he see us?

182
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,640
It is okay.

183
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,640
There are so many clothes on.

184
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,640
He can't recognize us.

185
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,640
Stop.

186
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,640
You are late.

187
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,640
I went to ask the teacher.

188
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,640
Liar.

189
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,640
Mr. Jia called me just now.

190
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,640
You are so ridiculous.

191
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,640
Girls are the most important.

192
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,640
You are so stupid.

193
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,640
You are so stupid.

194
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,640
You are so stupid.

195
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,640
Listen.

196
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,640
Girls are the most important.

197
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,640
You are so stupid.

198
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,640
You are so stupid.

199
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,640
Listen.

200
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,640
From tomorrow,

201
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,640
you can't call,

202
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,640
go home,

203
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,640
or talk to your classmates.

204
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,640
You should use all your energy

205
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,640
on the college entrance examination.

206
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,640
Do you understand?

207
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,640
I understand.

208
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,640
I understand.

209
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,640
What did I say?

210
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,640
What do we want to do?

211
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,640
Why did he kick her?

212
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,640
Keep your voice down.

213
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,640
You are so annoying.

214
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,640
What?

215
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,640
I don't even have the right to talk.

216
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,640
I just have the right to talk.

217
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,640
Stop it.

218
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,640
Is it useful?

219
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,640
Fang Hui is so annoying.

220
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,640
I'm fine.

221
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,640
I'll go back first.

222
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,640
Why are you afraid of me?

223
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,640
We like each other

224
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,640
and we are like a couple.

225
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,640
The school is so big.

226
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,640
What's wrong with having a lover?

227
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,640
Calm down.

228
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,640
Don't make a fuss.

229
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,640
Just calm down.

230
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,640
Okay.

231
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,640
You can practice earlier.

232
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,640
You are so happy.

233
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,640
I don't even have a chance.

234
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,640
Am I right, Xia Mo?

235
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,640
No.

236
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,640
I'm serious.

237
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,640
Don't worry.

238
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,640
Don't worry.

239
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,640
Don't take the school's plan seriously.

240
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,640
It's important to review it.

241
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,640
Yes.

242
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,640
Chen Xu, you have good grades.

243
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,640
I won't talk to you.

244
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,640
Fang Hui, let's do well next time.

245
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,640
We can use our grades to shut him up.

246
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,640
Just one year.

247
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,640
Just go through it.

248
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,640
I can't go through it.

249
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,640
There's nothing you can't go through.

250
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,640
We should review it.

251
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,640
We will get into the same university.

252
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,640
Let's see what they have to say.

253
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,640
Yes.

254
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,640
The danger of being in love

255
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,640
is not the study.

256
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,640
It's the other person.

257
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,640
The wound is deep and rebellious.

258
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,640
It's tiring.

259
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,640
It's hard to get on stage.

260
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,640
The result is

261
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,640
the one who is clear will hate

262
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,640
and the one who is fast will be angry.

263
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,640
I hope all students

264
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,640
can be rational

265
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,640
and be happy

266
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,640
when they are in their youth.

267
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,640
You must be rational.

268
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,640
Be clear.

269
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,640
Restrain yourself.

270
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,640
Restrain yourself again.

271
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,640
What are you doing?

272
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,640
I...

273
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,640
I'm looking for

274
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,640
my classmate to answer the questions.

275
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,640
Look at your mouth.

276
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,640
You can't even make it clear.

277
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,640
You're still answering the questions.

278
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,640
Be honest.

279
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,640
Be honest.

280
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,640
Is this a big boy?

281
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,640
No.

282
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,640
What are you doing?

283
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,640
Nothing.

284
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,640
What are you doing?

285
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,640
I'm looking for you to answer the questions.

286
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,640
Answer the questions?

287
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,640
Okay.

288
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,640
I'll finish it later.

289
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,640
Jia Mu.

290
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,640
You danced so well just now.

291
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,640
Really?

292
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,640
You must have passed the first test.

293
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,640
I'm not good at praising.

294
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,640
Okay.

295
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,640
See you later.

296
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,640
You five

297
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,640
will be a scene-watching product.

298
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,640
It's called

299
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,640
Fire In the Scene.

300
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,640
You can play it freely.

301
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,640
Are you ready?

302
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,640
Start.

303
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,640
What are you doing?

304
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,640
What are you doing?

305
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,640
What are you doing?

306
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,640
That...

307
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,640
What is that?

308
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,640
Everyone is listening to me.

309
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,640
Go away.

310
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,640
Hurry up.

311
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,640
I don't want to die.

312
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,640
Stop.

313
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,640
I know the answer.

314
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,640
I'm going to ask

315
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,640
the girl in the middle.

316
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,640
What did you do just now?

317
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,640
I...

318
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,640
I was just

319
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,640
making fire with water.

320
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,640
I was making fire.

321
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,640
Okay.

322
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,640
You can't find it yet.

323
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,640
Let's find it first.

324
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,640
I don't know.

325
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,640
Don't say it.

326
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,640
Be quiet.

327
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,640
If you see me,

328
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,640
you'll be in trouble.

329
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,640
We can't find it.

330
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,640
We can't find it.

331
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,640
I'll help you.

332
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,640
You can't find it.

333
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,640
If you don't believe me,

334
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,640
there must be another one.

335
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,640
Don't be angry.

336
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,640
I'm not angry.

337
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,640
I'm not angry.

338
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,640
I'm not angry.

339
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
I'm not angry.

340
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,640
Fire in the scene.

341
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,640
Fire in the scene.

342
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,640
Fire in the scene.

343
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,640
I'm the host.

344
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,640
Please sign my name.

345
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,640
What?

346
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,640
How is that possible?

347
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,640
Excuse me.

348
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,640
Excuse me.

349
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,640
What are you doing?

350
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,640
What are you doing?

351
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,640
We can't find it.

352
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,640
We can't find it.

353
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,640
Do you think

354
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,640
I'm a failure?

355
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,640
I'm so self-conscious.

356
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,640
Why do I

357
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,640
always pursue

358
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,640
things that I can't pursue?

359
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,640
I like Su Kai.

360
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,640
I'm taking the art exam.

361
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,640
Jia Mo, don't be sad.

362
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,640
These teachers are weird.

363
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,640
They don't want such an outstanding person.

364
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,640
They want to make you angry.

365
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,640
How am I outstanding?

366
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,640
I'm just a

367
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,640
self-less fool.

368
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,640
Don't say that.

369
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,640
In my eyes,

370
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,640
you're the best.

371
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,640
The best.

372
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,640
Stop it.

373
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,640
Lin Jia Mo is the best.

374
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,640
You...

375
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,640
You're so naughty.

376
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,640
You even tore your pants.

377
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,640
You're quite talented.

378
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,640
I'm still in reality.

379
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,640
Reality is still far away.

380
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,640
It's not that far.

381
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,640
I think

382
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,640
it's a good thing

383
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,640
that you didn't get the exam.

384
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,640
This entertainment industry

385
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,640
is too messy.

386
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,640
It's not suitable for you.

387
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,640
You should return to college.

388
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,640
Maybe we can still

389
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,640
be together in the same school.

390
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,640
What are you talking about?

391
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,640
I'm so annoyed

392
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,640
if I stay with you for another four years.

393
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,640
I'm so annoyed

394
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,640
if I stay with you for another four years.

395
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,640
I'm so annoyed

396
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,640
if I stay with you for another four years.

397
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,640
Is it that annoying?

398
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,640
You're so childish.

399
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,640
Mom,

400
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,640
where are my books and my tape?

401
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,640
I've put them away.

402
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,640
I'll give them to you

403
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,640
after the exam.

404
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,640
Why did you touch my things?

405
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,640
Because you're not aware of it.

406
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,640
These are all

407
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,640
written by Chen Xun, right?

408
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,640
I'm not sure.

409
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,640
I don't know.

410
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,640
I don't know.

411
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,640
I don't know.

412
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,640
Tear it up.

413
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,640
Tear it up yourself.

414
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,640
Did you hear me?

415
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,640
Mom.

416
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,640
If you don't listen,

417
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,640
transfer to another school.

418
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,640
I'm sorry.

419
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,640
Come on!

420
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,340
Cheers,

421
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,640
Mr. Liu!

422
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,640
We're the champions!

423
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,640
Come on!

424
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,640
We're the champions!

425
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,640
We're the champions!

426
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,400
You can do it!

427
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,240
You can do it!

428
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,720
Remember to put everything in

429
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,280
I will let you know that I miss you

430
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:30,440
I don't want to let you go

431
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,800
I will let you go

432
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,120
I will let you go

433
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,400
I will let you go

434
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,800
Zhen Xun

435
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,440
Can you come back later?

436
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,520
Don't worry, we just came here

437
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,040
Stay a little longer

438
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,920
We haven't talked to each other for a long time

439
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,120
Don't you miss me?

440
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,400
See you in the studio

441
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,960
Okay

442
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,960
Why do I feel that you have lost weight these two days?

443
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,800
Don't you eat well when you are a child?

444
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,480
Xia

445
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,560
What?

446
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,080
This time, the test is useless

447
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,000
Don't worry, it's just a test

448
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,040
Besides, your ranking has improved

449
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,840
But it's still very far from you

450
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,880
I'm afraid

451
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,680
I'm afraid we can't get into the same university

452
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,240
Then I won't report Qing Hua

453
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,080
I'll report a university that we can both get into

454
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,120
No, I can't drag you

455
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,760
Why are you so stupid?

456
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,240
How can this be called dragging you?

457
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,920
We must go to the same university

458
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,120
So we can graduate together

459
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,480
Find a job together

460
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,000
Get married and have children together

461
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,680
Don't blame yourself

462
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,640
I don't care about money

463
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,920
I don't care about my dad

464
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,920
I don't care about my dad

465
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,920
Fang Hui

466
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,000
Will you marry me?

467
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,920
Will you be crazy with me for the rest of your life?

468
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,160
Others said that I was willing to wear a ring

469
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,120
How can you be like this?

470
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,400
I'm like this

471
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,000
Are you willing or not?

472
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,040
I'm willing

473
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,160
I bet

474
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,760
Nigga

475
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,720
They are notpoints

476
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,000
It tells women

477
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,320
That's great

478
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,920
Not points

479
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,320
Judge

480
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,320
How can you talk?

481
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,320
Do you have any qualities?

482
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,320
You have qualities?

483
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,320
Study hard

484
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,320
Study hard

485
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,320
When we get into the same university

486
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,320
Let's see what they say

487
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,320
Stop

488
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,320
Continue

489
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,320
Turn around

490
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,320
Pack your things

491
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,320
Move your car here

492
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,320
You can sit here

493
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,320
What are you doing?

494
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,320
What does it have to do with you?

495
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,320
What does it have to do with you?

496
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,320
Teacher Jiang

497
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,320
I'll sit

498
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,320
What are you doing?

499
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,320
Sit down

500
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,320
I'm telling you

501
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,320
If you talk nonsense, you'll drop out of school

502
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,320
Sit down

503
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,320
Sit down

504
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,320
Look at your own report

505
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,320
Aren't you ashamed?

506
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,320
I saw you carry your schoolbag

507
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,320
I made you a seat

508
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,320
That's close to me

509
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,320
Look at them

510
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,320
They are top 50

511
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,320
They are going to the top

512
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,320
What about you?

513
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,320
I'm afraid you can't even get a second grade

514
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,320
They can't even look at you

515
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,320
Take this certificate

516
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,320
Let your parents see

517
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:06,320
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

518
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,320
What's going on?

519
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,320
I wrote this song

520
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,320
I want to give this song

521
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,320
To the most brilliant students

522
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,320
And teachers

523
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,320
To the students who really love it

524
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,320
I want to give it to

525
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,320
The one I like

526
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,320
Fang Hui

527
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,320
I want to give it to

528
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,320
Fang Hui

529
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,320
I'm still standing on the ground

530
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,320
In the time that used to be

531
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,320
In the time that used to be

532
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,320
My hair was not that long

533
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,320
My eyes were bright

534
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,320
My eyes were bright

535
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,320
In my heart

536
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,320
There is a paradise

537
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,320
And the girl I love the most

538
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,320
And the girl I love the most

539
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,320
And the girl I love the most

540
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,320
That's ridiculous

541
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,320
That's ridiculous

542
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,320
You're a traitor

543
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,320
You're a traitor

544
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,320
You're so ridiculous

545
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,320
You're a traitor

546
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,320
I'm going

547
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,320
Hurry up

548
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,320
Open the door

549
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,320
Open the door

550
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,320
Open the door

551
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,320
Hurry up

552
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,320
Open the door

553
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,320
Come on

554
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,320
Come on, Zhou Yi

555
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,320
Open the door

556
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,320
You

557
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,320
I'm waiting for you

558
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,320
Open the door

559
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,320
Zhou Yi, open the door

560
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,320
You're a traitor

561
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,320
Open the door

562
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,320
Come on

563
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,320
Come on

564
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,320
Come on

565
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,320
Hurry up

566
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,320
Open the door

567
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,320
Come on

568
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,320
I hope that you and I

569
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,320
Will have a happy life

570
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,320
The most pure person

571
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,320
Is my true self

572
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,320
I run back to them

573
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,320
I forget the past

574
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,320
You're a traitor

575
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,320
You're a traitor

576
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,320
You're a traitor

577
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,320
Open the door

578
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,320
Hurry up

579
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,320
Open the door

580
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,320
Open the door

581
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,320
Open the door

582
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,320
Open the door

583
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,320
You're a traitor

584
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,320
You're a traitor

585
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,320
Who opened the door?

586
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,320
I have to

587
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,320
If I don't do it

588
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,320
These bastards will blow up the school

589
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,320
Play music

590
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,320
Play music in the school's studio

591
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,320
School education is the right way

592
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,320
If you lose the exam

593
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,320
You're responsible

594
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,320
Then dance another ten rounds

595
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,320
Zhou Yi, dance twenty rounds

596
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,280
Qiao Ran, come

597
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,280
Open the door

598
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,320
You. Give me your seat

599
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,320
Nothing different

600
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,320
Who to come

601
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,320
In the EXO exam

602
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,320
Our Ban Youjie got

603
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,320
The best score

604
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,320
prisoners

605
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,320
Qiao Ran, come up and read your homework.

606
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,320
Teacher, forget it.

607
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,320
You're a boy, you're embarrassed?

608
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,320
Someone has no impression.

609
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,320
A flower of the Dingxiang, Qiao Ran.

610
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,320
Every year in spring,

611
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,320
the season of the Dingxiang blooming,

612
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,320
I will remember someone.

613
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,320
He once told me that

614
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,320
I can bring luck to people.

615
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,320
That little flower has been lying in my hands.

616
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,320
Every time I see him sad,

617
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,320
I feel that all the sorrows in the world

618
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,320
will pass.

619
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,320
As long as you believe in it,

620
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,320
you will be lucky.

621
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,320
Later, the little flower brought the fragrance.

622
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,320
But the flower of the Dingxiang in my memory

623
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,320
still brings

624
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,320
the eternal freshness and not decaying.

625
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,320
Forever bringing the beautiful memory of the future

626
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,320
in my memory.

627
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,320
Becoming the softest place in my heart

628
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,320
in the world.

629
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,320
I hope you are the happiest person in the world.

630
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,320
That year in spring,

631
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,320
I remembered

632
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,320
he will forget me.

633
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,320
I wish you happiness.

634
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,320
Come on.

635
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,320
You are going to be released.

636
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,320
You are released.

637
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,320
Qiao Ran,

638
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,320
you are good at writing three-word poems.

639
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,320
You are a poet.

640
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,320
Zhao Ye, stop mocking him.

641
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,320
You should learn from him.

642
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,320
Yes.

643
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,320
Don't be a teacher when you write poetry in the college entrance examination.

644
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,320
Yes.

645
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,320
I can't believe that the college entrance examination is coming soon.

646
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,320
Yes.

647
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,320
I remember when I was in college,

648
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,320
I said

649
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,320
I don't know what we would feel

650
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,320
after the last day of the college entrance examination.

651
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,320
I didn't expect it would come soon.

652
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,320
Really.

653
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,320
Today,

654
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,320
it's so fast.

655
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,320
What are you going to do after the examination?

656
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,320
I want to sleep for three days and three nights.

657
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,320
I want to make up for all the sleep I've had in the past three years.

658
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,320
You are a pig.

659
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,320
You sleep for three days and three nights.

660
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,320
I am a pig.

661
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,320
What are you?

662
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,320
What do you want to do?

663
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,320
To touch me?

664
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,320
No.

665
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,320
I just want to

666
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,320
read all the movies,

667
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,320
dramas, comics and novels

668
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,320
I've seen this year.

669
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,320
I want to imagine it.

670
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,320
After the examination,

671
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,320
I plan to go on a trip.

672
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,320
With Fang Hua.

673
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,320
Look at you, Su An Nan.

674
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,320
Thank you.

675
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,320
Let's go on a trip, too.

676
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,320
Get lost.

677
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,320
I just hope I can finish the examination successfully.

678
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,320
You will.

679
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,320
Do you remember, Huang Hui?

680
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,320
You were so cool when you were in the first year of high school.

681
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,320
You didn't talk to us.

682
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,320
I was embarrassed.

683
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,320
Do you remember?

684
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,320
He took you to the playground at that time.

685
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,320
I said it.

686
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,320
You are crazy.

687
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,320
So what?

688
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,320
I will say it.

689
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,320
To be honest,

690
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,320
I think

691
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,320
the most obvious choice I've made in my life

692
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,320
is to transfer to the university to do experiments.

693
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,320
The happiest thing is

694
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,320
to know your friends.

695
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,320
Me, too.

696
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,320
Me, too.

697
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,320
Me, too.

698
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,320
Me, too.

699
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,320
Who says the world is not a movie?

700
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,320
We will never be apart.

701
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,320
No one can separate us.

702
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,320
We will never be apart.

703
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,320
Why are you so little?

704
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,320
But...

705
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,320
You...

706
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,320
I...

707
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,320
I will see you at home.

708
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,320
I think

709
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,320
we should leave something at school.

710
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,320
It belongs to the five of us.

711
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,320
What should we leave?

712
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,320
There is a pit.

713
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,320
How about this?

714
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,320
We should buy the pictures of the five of us.

715
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,320
How about this, Zhao Yi?

716
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,320
We will bury you first.

717
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,320
What should we do?

718
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,320
We should engrave our names on that tree.

719
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,320
Great idea.

720
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,320
Let's go.

721
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,320
Let's go.

722
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,320
Let's go.

723
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,320
Okay.

724
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,320
Let's go.

725
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,320
Let me help you.

726
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,320
Jianguo said there is a love poem.

727
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,320
There is another one.

728
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,320
Let's see what is inside.

729
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,320
It's really okay.

730
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,320
What love poem?

731
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,320
I can write it.

732
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,320
Is it sweet?

733
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,320
Are you nervous?

734
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,320
Why should I be nervous?

735
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,320
It's just a test.

736
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,320
Don't worry.

737
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,320
We have to go to the four-year university together.

738
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,320
So we must do well this time.

739
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,320
Do you know that?

740
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,320
I know.

741
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,320
My love poem is

742
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,320
I won't let you be alone.

743
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,320
I will do well.

744
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,320
I will do well.

745
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,320
Oh, no.

746
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,320
What did you do?

747
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,320
Don't think about it.

748
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,320
It's just a test.

749
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,320
Why do you think so much?

750
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,320
You should tell me.

751
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,320
Tell me about my love poem.

752
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,320
No.

753
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,320
What's wrong with you?

754
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,320
You have a fever.

755
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,320
I guess I have a cold.

756
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,320
Can you still hold on?

757
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,320
I'm fine.

758
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,320
Don't worry.

759
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,320
I will do well.

760
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,320
Hold on.

761
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:05,320
We will go to the university together in the future.

762
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,320
We will graduate together.

763
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,320
We will have a baby together.

764
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,320
As long as we are together,

765
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,320
no matter how far it is,

766
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,320
we will not go on.

767
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,320
I'm afraid.

768
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,320
I'm afraid that we can't go to the same university.

769
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,320
I'm afraid that we can't go to the same university.

770
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,320
I'm afraid that we can't go to the same university.

771
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,320
She is the top 50 in the whole grade.

772
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,320
She is in the top 50 in the whole grade.

773
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,320
She is in the top 50 in the whole grade.

774
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,320
She is in the top 50 in the whole grade.

775
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,320
Zhang Hui.

776
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,320
Will you marry me?

777
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,320
My love poem is

778
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,320
I won't let you go alone.

779
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,320
The line on the blackboard

780
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,320
Fang Wei likes Chen Xun.

781
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,320
I didn't write it.

782
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,320
I can help you.

783
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,320
What are you thinking?

784
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,320
Everything changes.

785
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,320
How many secrets do you want me to keep for you?

786
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,320
Qiao Ran won't let you say it.

787
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,320
I said you.

788
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,320
What's the secret?

789
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,320
I said you.

790
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,320
What's the secret?

791
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,320
I said you.

792
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,320
You can't say it.

793
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,320
You are lying.

794
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,320
This is it.

795
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:56,320
I want to give this song to my favorite Fang Wei.

796
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:01,320
I want to give this song to my favorite Fang Wei.

797
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,900
I hope to have a bright bed

798
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:08,520
I can sunbathe every day

799
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:12,160
Put all my things on the floor

800
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,880
To remember the old times

801
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:19,640
I didn't have long hair at that time

802
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:23,240
At that time, my eyes were bright blue

803
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,960
I want to eat some food

804
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,960
An ideal paradise

805
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:31,960
And my most beloved girl

806
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,960
I hope you and I

807
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,960
Have a kind heart

808
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,960
Give you a pure heart

809
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,960
Give me a pure look

810
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,960
Run back to them

811
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,960
I hope this song

812
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,960
You can sing with me

813
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,960
Bring your story and beautiful fantasy

814
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:04,960
Back to the time of Songsong

815
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,960
I hope you and I

816
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,960
Can walk to the end

817
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,960
I can sunbathe every day

818
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,960
We walk to the sunset

819
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,960
To remember the old times

820
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:35,960
The beautiful face of the breeze

821
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:39,960
The beauty is your smile

822
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,960
There are many things to tell me

823
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,960
I hope the world is right here

824
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,960
I hope you and I

825
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:57,960
Have a kind heart

826
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,960
Give you a pure heart

827
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,960
Give me a pure look

828
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,960
Run back to them

829
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,960
I hope this song

830
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,960
You can sing with me

831
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,960
Bring your story and beautiful fantasy

832

Back to the time of Songsong

833
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,960
Back to the time of Songsong

834
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,960
I hope you and I

835
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,960
Can walk to the end

836
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,960
I can sunbathe every day

837
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,960
We walk to the sunset

838
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,960
To remember the old times

839
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,960
The beautiful face of the breeze

840
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,960

I hope the world is right here

843
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:22,960
I hope I can have a bright bed

844
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,960
I can sunbathe every day

845
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:29,960
Put my things on the floor

846
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:36,960
To remember the old times
