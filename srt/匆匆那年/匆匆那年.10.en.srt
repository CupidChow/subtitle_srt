00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
This show is sponsored by the world's thinnest smartphone, E-Life.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,520
The American brand is a good sponsor.

3
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,520
Yes.

4
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,920
What kind of girl do you like?

5
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,720
Oh my god!

6
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,800
In my heart, some people, no matter what they do,

7
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,960
they will always be friends.

8
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,400
Is the past that important?

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,640
Can you tell me what happened?

10
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,880
Do you like friends?

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,880
I will never let you down.

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,000
Why would I lie to you?

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,360
But she has a girlfriend! She has Zheng Xue!

14
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,640
I'm afraid we won't be able to go back to how we were before.

15
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,600
You can't forget your friends.

16
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,200
I've liked you since I first met you.

17
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,400
But I only have Zheng Xue in my heart.

18
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,560
Yes!

19
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,720
The most important thing for a girl is to love yourself!

20
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,040
You've disappointed me!

21
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,120
Just one year.

22
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,400
Just go through it.

23
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,120
When we get into the university,

24
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,480
let's see what they say.

25
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,920
I have to give it to my favorite,

26
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,160
Fang Hui.

27
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,800
This is so good!

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,920
Jiayou!

29
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,400
Besides Ms. Cheng,

30
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,520
what else could she expect?

31
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,800
Congratulations!

32
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,800
The last question was so weird. How many points did you get?

33
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,800
I didn't do it in a hurry.

34
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,800
13 points, bro. What are you thinking about?

35
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,800
It's none of your business. The exam is over.

36
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,800
That's right. I've found a good place for you.

37
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Relax.

38
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,800
Come on, let's drink.

39
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,800
Let's drink.

40
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,800
What did Mr. Zhan say?

41
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,800
Don't touch the honey.

42
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,800
Dr. Guan.

43
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,800
I touched the honey today. How about it?

44
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Okay, okay, okay.

45
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,800
Well, let's let Mr. Hou say a few words.

46
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Okay, okay, okay.

47
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,800
First of all, I wish you all a good luck.

48
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,800
Mr. Fan Xiaoxian, who is out of the sea of pain.

49
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,800
To be honest, I don't think I'm a very competent class teacher.

50
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,800
I think you should thank Mr. Zhai.

51
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,800
Mr. Hou, let's not talk about such a happy thing.

52
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,800
I know. Mr. Zhai usually demands strict measures from you.

53
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,800
But if Mr. Zhai doesn't wear a high-school degree, you don't have this achievement today.

54
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,800
You have to repay him with gratitude. Right?

55
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,800
Yes.

56
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:16,800
You are very good at the field of business.

57
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,800
And a very cute kid.

58
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,800
I'm really happy to be with you.

59
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,800
So I'm going to break up soon.

60
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,800
I'm a little reluctant.

61
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,800
There is still a long way ahead.

62
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,800
I sincerely hope that you can have a smooth journey.

63
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,800
If you encounter any difficulties, you can call me anytime.

64
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,800
We are not students. We are still friends.

65
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,800
I wish you all the best.

66
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,800
Get into a good university.

67
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,800
Cheers.

68
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
Come on.

69
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,800
Cheers.

70
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,800
Cheers.

71
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
Let's go to the bar.

72
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,800
Go.

73
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,800
Let's have a drink.

74
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,800
Okay.

75
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,800
Okay. Why are you drinking so fast?

76
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,800
Actually, there is something I have been wanting to tell you.

77
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,800
I'm afraid that if I don't tell you today, I won't have a chance in the future.

78
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,800
What's wrong?

79
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,800
What's the matter?

80
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,800
Actually, I have always liked Chen Xun.

81
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,800
I really like him.

82
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,800
But I will never tell him.

83
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,800
Because he doesn't have me in his heart.

84
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,800
There is no one.

85
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,800
Only you.

86
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,800
So I always bully you.

87
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
I'm just teasing you.

88
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,800
Actually, I envy you.

89
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,800
I envy him being with you.

90
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,800
The line on the blackboard,

91
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,800
I also like Chen Xun.

92
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,800
I didn't write it.

93
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,800
I saw his classroom that day.

94
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,800
I wrote it with my left hand.

95
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,800
You mean,

96
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,800
Chen Xun wrote it?

97
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,800
He is afraid that you won't get along with him.

98
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,800
You must cherish him.

99
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,800
Why are you drinking so much?

100
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,800
I'm fine.

101
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,800
I just heard a secret.

102
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,800
Do you want to hear it?

103
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,800
What secret?

104
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,800
Xiao Cao just told me.

105
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,800
He said,

106
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,800
The words on the blackboard,

107
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,800
Chen Xun wrote it.

108
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,800
It's that sentence.

109
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,800
Fang Hui likes Chen Xun.

110
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,800
So he arranged everything.

111
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
Why didn't he tell me?

112
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,800
It's important to know this.

113
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,800
Mom.

114
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,800
I just know that

115
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,800
I like him

116
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,800
because I saw this.

117
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,800
What if

118
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,800
I was like Chen Xun

119
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,800
and wrote your name

120
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,800
and my name on the blackboard?

121
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,800
Will you like me?

122
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,800
I'm sorry.

123
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,800
Fang Hui.

124
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,800
Can I hug you?

125
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,800
I'm sorry.

126
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,800
Love is like a pair of lovers

127
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,800
They are in love

128
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,800
They are thinking about

129
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:27,800
how many roses they can eat

130
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:32,800
Maybe after a year, two years, three years, four years,

131
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,800
they will change

132
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,800
It's better to think about it

133
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,800
than to think about it

134
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,800
A rose

135
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,800
is talking about Fang Hui, right?

136
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,800
Actually, I knew

137
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,800
that it was impossible for us

138
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,800
But I never gave up.

139
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,800
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

140
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,800
It's useless.

141
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,800
Why is it useless?

142
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,800
You always like this.

143
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,800
You don't tell everyone anything.

144
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,800
You can't tell everything

145
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,800
even if we fight together.

146
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,800
It's better to hide it from everyone.

147
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,800
The bigger the person,

148
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,800
the more secrets there are.

149
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,800
Please keep this secret for me.

150
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,800
Okay?

151
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
Okay.

152
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,800
But how many secrets do you want me to keep for you?

153
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,800
What?

154
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,800
Why didn't you take the college entrance examination?

155
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,800
Why don't you tell everyone?

156
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,800
You cried?

157
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,800
No.

158
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,800
I just thought that

159
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,800
we were going to be separated.

160
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,800
I was a little sad.

161
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,800
Don't worry.

162
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,800
We are just going to different universities.

163
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,800
We will meet more often in the future.

164
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,800
Besides,

165
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,800
now there is QQ.

166
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,800
I'm even nervous about you because of QQ.

167
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,800
Don't worry.

168
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,800
What about us?

169
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,800
I'm worried that I didn't do well in the exam.

170
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,800
If I get into the second grade,

171
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,800
or go to the second grade again...

172
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,800
It won't happen.

173
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,800
Trust me.

174
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,800
We will definitely go to the same university.

175
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,800
Chen Xun.

176
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,800
I have a question for you.

177
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,800
Say it.

178
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,800
Will we never be separated?

179
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,800
Why not?

180
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,800
I'm serious.

181
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,800
I promise

182
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,800
that we will never be separated.

183
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,800
Will you get married?

184
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,800
Yes.

185
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,800
Will you have a child?

186
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,800
Yes.

187
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,800
Will you have a family?

188
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,800
Yes.

189
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,800
We will

190
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,800
buy food together,

191
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,800
cook,

192
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,800
and raise our children.

193
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,800
When you get old,

194
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,800
can you be like now?

195
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,800
Yes.

196
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,800
I promise.

197
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,800
I promise.

198
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,800
I promise.

199
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,800
I'm worried.

200
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,800
I'm worried that one day,

201
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,800
everything will change.

202
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,800
It won't.

203
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,800
Trust me.

204
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,800
Okay?

205
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,800
I trust you.

206
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,800
I trust you.

207
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,800
Hello?

208
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,800
Why did you kiss me?

209
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,800
Don't.

210
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,800
Don't.

211
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,800
It's so nice.

212
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,800
I can't stand Zhao Yue's bad voice.

213
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,800
That's right.

214
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,800
Today's theme is friendship.

215
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,800
Do you understand?

216
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,800
I think today,

217
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,800
we must sing together.

218
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,800
Yes.

219
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,800

288
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,800
Till the day I die

289
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,800
Don't go.

290
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,800
I have seen Chen and Xiao.

291
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,800
My name is YI一李 Bien.

What's going on?

296
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,800
We should go.

297
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,800
Bye.

298
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,800
Go.

299
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,560
Let's go.

300
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,120
Bye.

301
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,120
Bye.

302
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,920
Where are we going next?

303
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,280
A bar.

304
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,160
You're so good at making fun of me.

305
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,800
I have to make fun of you today.

306
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,840
I've finished the exam.

307
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,040
Why don't you have some fun?

308
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,080
What fun?

309
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,640
Why don't we buy some good food

310
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,720
and have a chat?

311
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,400
So boring.

312
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,880
I fell asleep after eating for five minutes.

313
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,720
Whatever.

314
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,320
It's hard to have fun.

315
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:00,880
Right.

316
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,680
No.

317
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,480
We haven't talked for a long time.

318
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,800
And Qiao Ran,

319
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,400
I have something to tell you.

320
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,880
It's settled.

321
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,280
I'll go buy some good food.

322
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,400
What's going on?

323
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,280
You two still have a little secret.

324
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,000
What secret?

325
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,920
Come on.

326
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,680
There's a live broadcast.

327
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,440
Hurry up.

328
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,320

332
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,680

The audience is cheering for them

345
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,680
The audience is cheering for them

346
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,680
This one

347
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,680
Why is it power outage?

348
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,680
No way

349
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,680
Is your house on the 17th floor?

350
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,680
Yes

351
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,680
Look, I said go to the bar

352
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,680
Now it's down

353
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,680
It's on the 17th floor, climb

354
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,680
Come with me

355
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,680
Let's go

356
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,680
You all help me

357
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,680
Go, go, go

358
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,680
You all go

359
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,680
You all look at the two sides

360
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,680
What are you doing?

361
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,680
It's better to see someone

362
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,680
No big deal

363
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,680
Zhao Ying, you close the door

364
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,680
Go to the door

365
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,680
You sit on the balcony, I take the drink

366
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,680
Go, go

367
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,680
Where is the card?

368
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,680
The phone

369
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,680
Did you play?

370
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,680
Why didn't you hand in the card?

371
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,680
I put it in the wrong place

372
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,680
It's here

373
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,680
Why don't you go?

374
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,680
What are you thinking?

375
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,680
I'm going to the bathroom

376
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,680
I'm going to the bathroom

377
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,680
I'm going to the bathroom

378
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,680
I'm going to the bathroom

379
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,680
I'm going to the bathroom

380
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,680
Yes

381
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,680
Why is it okay?

382
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,680
Why is no one talking?

383
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,680
Don't you say you want to be high?

384
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,680
I'm tired

385
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,680
I can't move

386
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,680
Where is this?

387
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,680
You say

388
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,680
In 2008

389
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,680
When the Beijing Olympics was held

390
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,680
What is Beijing like?

391
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,680
Must be very lively

392
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,680
Many people

393
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,680
More lively than 50 years of the Qing Dynasty

394
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,680
Yes

395
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,680
The competition will be held at our door

396
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,680
What is the code?

397
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,680
You have to come

398
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,680
F13, Marbury

399
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,680
All have to come

400
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,680
Look like a chicken

401
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,680
Can you see those shooting stars at the scene?

402
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,680
You can also be a volunteer

403
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,680
What FC Marbury to pick up the ball

404
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,680
Maybe later

405
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,680
The brothers have already joined the national team

406
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,680
Wait to pick up the ball for me

407
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,680
That's it

408
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,680
By 2008

409
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,680
Let's watch the Olympic Games together

410
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,680
Okay?

411
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,680
Qiao Ran

412
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,680
Did you come too?

413
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,680
I must come

414
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,680
Such an important moment

415
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,680
I must be with everyone

416
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,680
Right?

417
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,680
You say

418
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,680
What will our sisters be like in 2008?

419
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,680
2008

420
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,680
I'm 26 years old

421
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,680
Almost 30

422
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,680
Oh my god

423
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,680
I dare not think

424
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,680
What dare not think

425
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,680
After 2008

426
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,680
You are as beautiful as now

427
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,680
Of course

428
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,680
I must have been married

429
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,680
I may have a child

430
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,680
Wait

431
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,680
Who are you married to?

432
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,680
I'm not married to you

433
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,680
Can you not be so aggressive?

434
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,680
Anhui

435
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,680
You

436
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,680
I

437
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,680
I do not know

438
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,680
Maybe it's almost the same as now

439
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,680
What do you mean by almost the same?

440
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,680
By that time

441
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,680
Maybe we both have children

442
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,680
What?

443
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,680
You are counting the number

444
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,680
Super Olympic team

445
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,680
Qiao Ran, what about you?

446
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,680
I

447
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,680
I think I may be a doctor

448
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,680
I think I may be a doctor

449
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,680
You are so boring

450
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,680
You know what to do in the future

451
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,680
What do you do after 50

452
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,680
Where do you live, you know all

453
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,680
What else is there to do?

454
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,680
Chen Yixuan, you have a special word

455
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,680
Called blind flow

456
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,680
What blind flow?

457
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,680
What about you? What do you want to do?

458
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,680
I just want

459
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,680
Hurry up and make money

460
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,680
You make money

461
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,680
You still make money

462
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,680
I just want to make money quickly

463
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,680
Change my dad's motorcycle

464
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,680
Buy my mom a fully automatic washing machine

465
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,680
I just don't want them to be so tired

466
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,680
I just want to make money quickly

467
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,680
I just want to make money quickly

468
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,680
I just want to make money quickly

469
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,680
I just want to make money quickly

470
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,680
I just want to make money quickly

471
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,680
I just want to make money quickly

472
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,680
I just want to make money quickly

473
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,680
I just want to make money quickly

474
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,680
I just want to make money quickly

475
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,680
I just want to make money quickly

476
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,680
I just want to make money quickly

477
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,680
I just want to make money quickly

478
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,680
I just want to make money quickly

479
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,680
I just want to make money quickly

480
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,680
Bye bye

481
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,680
Bye bye

482
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,680
Bye bye

483
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,680
Let's go swimming together this weekend

484
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,680
Let's go swimming together this weekend

485
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,680
Let's talk about it

486
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,680
Don't come, Qiao Ran

487
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,680
You must come

488
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,680
Yes

489
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,680
Okay, bye bye

490
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,680
Bye bye

491
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,680
Be safe, bye bye

492
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,680
Be safe, bye bye

493
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,680
That's not wrong, right?

494
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,680
That's a beautiful woman

495
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,680
What are you thinking about?

496
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,680
What are you thinking about?

497
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,680
Don't you want to go to college?

498
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,680
I didn't bring her to college in the year of the pig

499
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,680
Then what do you want to do?

500
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,680
I might go to the UK

501
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,680
With my mom

502
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,680
You don't tell us such a big thing

503
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,680
You don't tell us such a big thing

504
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,680
Actually I envy you

505
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,680
Parents are all around

506
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,680
It feels like home

507
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,680
I have no dad since I was a kid

508
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,680
Mom, I'm so far away

509
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,680
I finally have a chance to reunite with my family

510
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,680
Do you understand this feeling?

511
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,680
But

512
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,680
But you can't leave without saying a word

513
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,680
But you can't leave without saying a word

514
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,680
Some words

515
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,680
Can't be said

516
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,680
Can't be said

517
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,680
Son, you said you usually simulate

518
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,680
More than 600 points

519
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,680
Then the Tsinghua Beidang is stable

520
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,680
Why is it so different from the college entrance examination?

521
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,680
Don't say anything

522
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,680
The exam is over

523
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,680
Wait to see the results

524
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,680
Wait to see the results

525
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,680
Did you check the result?

526
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,680
Not bad

527
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,680
I

528
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,680
I have 570 points

529
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,680
Then can we go to the same school?

530
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,680
Then can we go to the same school?

531
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,680
Of course

532
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,680
Look

533
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,680
We are the same size

534
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,680
We are the same size

535
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,680
Of course we can't be separated

536
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,680
I'll see you in the afternoon

537
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,680
Don't think too much

538
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,680
I'm going to take this one

539
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,680
I'm going to take this one

540
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,680
I'm going to pay

541
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,680
I'm going to pay

542
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,680
I'm going to pay

543
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,680
Why isn't Qiao Ran here?

544
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,680
Why isn't Qiao Ran here?

545
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,680
Is she okay?

546
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,680
Wang Gui

547
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,680
I'm so sorry

548
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,680
They are brothers and sisters

549
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,680
They are brothers and sisters

550
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,680
They are brothers and sisters

551
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,680
It's too bad

552
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,680
I can't watch it

553
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,680
Then don't watch it

554
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,680
I can't watch it

555
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,680
Be careful

556
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,680
Be careful

557
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,680
Xia Mo, look

558
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,680
Look, the teacher is sick and in the hospital

559
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,680
She's in the hospital

560
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,680
Is she okay?

561
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,680
Did you contact Qiao Ran?

562
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,680
She said she couldn't come to her room

563
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,680
What the hell is she doing?

564
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,680
She's so important

565
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,680
Stop

566
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,680
Teacher Chen

567
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,680
Teacher Chen

568
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,680
Come on

569
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,680
It's okay

570
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,680
Why are you here?

571
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,680
We heard you were sick

572
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,680
We came to see you

573
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,680
It's so hot

574
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,680
Why are you running?

575
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,680
Sit down

576
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,680
Sit down

577
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,680
Come on

578
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,680
Sit down

579
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,680
The exam results are out in the last two days

580
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,680
Do you know the result?

581
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,680
How was the exam?

582
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,680
Teacher Zhai

583
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,680
We all got the first wish

584
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,680
Really?

585
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,680
Great

586
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,680
I'm sorry

587
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,680
Teacher

588
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,680
You are so strict

589
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,680
I didn't expect

590
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,680
You came to see us

591
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,680
Teacher Chen

592
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,680
We don't know how to be nice

593
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,680
We always make you angry

594
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,680
I'm sorry

595
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,680
You

596
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,680
Are all good kids

597
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,680
Good kids

598
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,680
Now

599
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,680
Seeing you

600
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,680
You all can get in the hospital

601
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,680
Teacher

602
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,680
You can rest assured

603
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,680
What's wrong?

604
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,680
I'll call the nurse

605
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,680
I'll call the nurse

606
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,680
Teacher Chen

607
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,680
Have some water

608
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,680
It's okay

609
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,680
I'll drink it later

610
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,680
Sit down

611
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,680
Teacher Chen

612
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,680
Qiao Ran came to see you

613
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,680
She just left before you came

614
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,680
This kid

615
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,680
He is so thoughtful

616
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,680
Before she left

617
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,680
She wanted to see you

618
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,680
Go?

619
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,680
Where is she going?

620
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,680
To England

621
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,680
What?

622
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,680
You don't know?

623
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,680
I don't know

624
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,680
What are you doing?

625
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,680
You two go back first

626
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,680
I'll go to Zhao Li's house and get something

627
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,680
I'll go with you

628
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,680
Don't forget

629
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,680
It's hot

630
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,680
I'll go to you after I get something

631
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,680
Okay

632
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,680
Bye

633
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,680
When did you know?

634
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,680
I just knew

635
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,680
That day at Qiao Ran's house

636
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,680
I saw her didn't call me

637
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,680
I thought you were a professional

638
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,680
You can hold it in

639
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,680
What are you doing with Qiao Ran?

640
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,680
Qiao Ran doesn't allow me to say

641
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,680
You don't say? You two treat me as your brother

642
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,680
Don't be so self-righteous

643
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,680
If Qiao Ran doesn't say, she must have her own thoughts

644
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,680
What do you mean?

645
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,680
You two are selfish

646
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,680
You two always have to be self-righteous

647
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,680
You always stand on your own words

648
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,680
You two are so unhappy with Qiao Ran

649
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,680
Okay, I'm unhappy

650
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,680
If I'm unhappy, you can tell her

651
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:54,320
The

652
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,320
What's wrong?

653
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,320
I thought you weren't coming

654
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,320
Why aren't you coming?

655
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,320
I thought you weren't coming

656
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,960
You want me to come

657
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,960
To play soccer?

658
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,960
No?

659
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,960
We both haven't played alone for a long time

660
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,960
Give it to him

661
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,180
Give her the ball

662
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,760
Who wants the ball?

663
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,700
I think I can win

664
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,160
I'll go.

665
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,080
What are you doing?

666
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,200
Look.

667
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,440
You can't even let me win.

668
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,560
Who let you win?

669
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,160
I couldn't win you at all.

670
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,520
You can't win me.

671
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,680
You didn't have to.

672
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,760
You're just a coward.

673
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,440
You only know how to run away.

674
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,480
You said you were not a coward.

675
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,560
I said you were not.

676
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,520
I'm telling you,

677
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,960
you can never win me.

678
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,520
Because you don't have the guts to compete with me.

679
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,320
Chen Xu.

680
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,120
Listen to me.

681
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,640
It's not the end.

682
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,400
Don't think you can win.

683
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,920
What do you mean?

684
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,120
Ye Zili.

685
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,360
I can't win you at all.

686
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,160
If one day I want to win you,

687
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,480
will you win me?

688
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,960
You are not a coward.

689
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,840
You don't have a warriorlet True master Lian Sheng

690
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,680
Your friend hasn't taken a hit yet.

691
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,400
What?

692
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,960
Still want to take a hit?

693
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,960
I'm afraid it's too late to be bold.

694
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,960
You think about it over there.

695
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,960
Go well and come back well.

696
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,960
Didn't we agree that

697
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,960
we would go to the party together?

698
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,960
I'm afraid that you can't.

699
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,960
We will go to the party together.

700
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,960
You too.

701
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,960
You should take good care of her.

702
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,960
Take care of her for me.

703
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,960
You see Zhao Yan is in trouble.

704
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,960
You have to look after her.

705
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,960
And put her back.

706
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,960
Jia Mo and her daughter

707
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,960
are watching her.

708
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,960
Don't say it.

709
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,960
Why are you so sweet?

710
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,960
Like an old lady.

711
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,960
When are you leaving?

712
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,960
The day after tomorrow.

713
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,960
What do you think?

714
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,960
Don't you want everyone to be jealous of you?

715
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,960
You are right.

716
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,960
The person I really want to face the separation with

717
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,960
is myself.

718
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,960
I'm sorry.

719
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,960
I'm sorry.

720
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,960
Tao Tian Yi will come to pick you up in the morning.

721
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,960
We will go together.

722
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,960
Okay.

723
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,960
I know.

724
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,960
I'm sorry.

725
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,960
I'm sorry.

726
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,960
I'm sorry.

727
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,960
Qiao Ran.

728
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,960
Qiao Ran.

729
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,960
Qiao Ran.

730
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,960
Open the door.

731
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,960
Qiao Ran.

732
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,960
Damn.

733
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,960
On the way to grow up,

734
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,960
we faced all kinds of separation.

735
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,960
We believed that

736
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,960
separation was to meet again.

737
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,960
So we said goodbye.

738
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,960
The world is too big.

739
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,960
Those who said they would never separate

740
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,960
may regret it

741
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,960
and forget it all.

742
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,960
Goodbye is not goodbye.

743
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,960
It's a promise.

744
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,960
We are together.

745
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,960
We are together.

746
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,960
The End

747
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:33,960
Jia Mu.

748
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,960
I've liked you for a long time.

749
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:37,960
This is you.

750
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:38,960
This is me.

751
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,960
The two of us will be together forever.

752
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,960
Jia Mu.

753
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,960
I'm taking care of you.

754
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,960
You are my friend.

755
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,960
Who dares to bully you?

756
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,960
I will kill him.

757
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,960
Brother Ye.

758
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,960
Momo.

759
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,960
Brother Ye.

760
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,960
Who is it?

761
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,960
Who is it?

762
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,960
Hello?

763
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:22,960
Captain?

764
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,960
Captain, you're back.

765
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,960
The End

766
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,960
The End

767
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,960
The End

768
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,960
The End

769
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,960
