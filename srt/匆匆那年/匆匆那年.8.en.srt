4
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,000
I wish you happiness.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,480
Yes or no?

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,920
Yes.

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,120
What kind of girl do you like?

8
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,280
Oh my god!

9
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,080
Many people have an unfeeling past.

10
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,360
Some people, in my heart, no matter what they do,

11
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,640
they will always be friends.

12
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,120
Is the past that important?

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,880
I told you to get lost!

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,840
Can you tell me what happened?

15
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,120
Do you like me?

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,200
Because I like you.

17
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,160
Because of him?

18
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,880
His name is Zheng Xu. She is my girlfriend.

19
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,720
Let's not talk about the past.

20
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,200
You can't be with Chen Xun.

21
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,400
We are always together!

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,120
You know everything!

23
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,680
You can't just leave her alone.

24
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,200
You are crazy.

25
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,160
We can't have someone like that.

26
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,480
I will never let you down.

27
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,480
Are you kidding me?

28
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,800
Why would I lie to you?

29
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,160
But she has a girlfriend.

30
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,120
She has Zheng Xu.

31
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,240
Way to go, Huang response!

32
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,240
Shawn, run!

33
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,240
Hurry up!

34
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,240
Zhaoyi, you didn't eat?

35
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,240
Your leg is too high!

36
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,240
Zhaoyi, use more strength!

37
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,240
Use more strength!

38
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,240
Use more strength!

39
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,240
Gather!

40
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,240
You didn't eat?

41
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,240
You can't even eat?

42
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,240
Look at your foot!

43
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,240
This is the best in all schools!

44
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,240
What about our results?

45
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,240
You're shouting to get into the finals every day!

46
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,240
Can you do it?

47
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,240
Now start the first round of practice!

48
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,240
Start!

49
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,240
Zhaoyi, come here!

50
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,240
What's wrong with you today?

51
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,240
Is your bone broken?

52
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,240
You're still trying to be a bad boy?

53
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,240
Are you going to embarrass yourself?

54
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,240
50 rounds of rice.

55
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,240
Why?

56
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,240
80 rounds!

57
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,240
100 rounds!

58
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,240
Are you two okay?

59
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,240
It's okay.

60
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,240
He's a little upset today.

61
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,240
I'll give him a little money to make him feel better.

62
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,240
Zhaoyi!

63
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,240
You two are still not in the mood?

64
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,240
Please let you worry about him.

65
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,240
It's a big deal.

66
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,240
Is it necessary?

67
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,240
I didn't expect him to react so big.

68
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,240
I always thought he was heartless.

69
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,240
Actually, he's a very ordinary person.

70
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,240
He's very serious.

71
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,240
Chenxu.

72
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,240
When you were chasing Fang Hui,

73
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,240
if he rejected you,

74
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,240
would you still talk to him?

75
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,240
Yes.

76
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,240
I will keep talking until he agrees.

77
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,240
It's good that Qiao Ran is here.

78
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,240
I called Qiao Ran two days ago.

79
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:45,480
She said she was preparing for the final of the

80
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,240
The final is here.

81
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,240
Let's go.

82
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,240
Are you all right?

83
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,240
Did you see Qiao Ran?

84
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,240
Did you see Qiao Ran?

85
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,240
Did you see him?

86
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,240
No, no, no.

87
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,240
Let's go together.

88
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,240
You guys go first.

89
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,240
What's wrong?

90
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,240
Nothing.

91
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,240
I'm leaving. Bye.

92
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,240
Bye.

93
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,240
Bye.

94
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,240
Bye.

95
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,240
Hello.

96
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,240
How big are you?

97
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,240
Try it on.

98
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,240
I'm wearing a size 44.

99
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,240
Okay, wait a minute.

100
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,240
Son, eat some meat.

101
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,240
Eat more.

102
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,240
You eat too.

103
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,240
Dad.

104
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,240
I want to discuss something with you.

105
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,240
Do you know that?

106
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,240
The best high school basketball game in the country.

107
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,240
I'm the first to send it this time.

108
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,240
My basketball shoes are broken.

109
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,240
Can you buy me another pair of feet?

110
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,240
I know.

111
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,240
I'll talk to you later.

112
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,240
Come on, son, eat one more.

113
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,240
Eat quickly. It's getting cold.

114
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,240
Dad, I asked around.

115
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,240
The basketball game is over.

116
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,240
The high school is still in the bonus.

117
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,240
I'm sure I'll play well.

118
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:31,240
You say you guys are the most active and capable in terms of work.

119
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,240
Just because of teacher Mi Mi.

120
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,240
Can't be like those people who will shoot horses.

121
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,240
Just go.

122
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,240
This is too much of a bully.

123
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,240
We're all easy to do.

124
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,240
Just this matter.

125
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,240
Don't let your son know.

126
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,240
Influence his study.

127
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,240
Zhang Ye, you paid for the tuition.

128
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,240
Didn't you just pay?

129
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,240
That's from last month.

130
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,240
You have to pay again.

131
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,240
I'm not paying.

132
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,240
When are you going to pay?

133
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,240
Can you stop this?

134
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,240
You have to wait two days for the landlord to close.

135
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,240
I'll make it up to you later.

136
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,240
Can you be polite?

137
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,240
Fang Huai is not serving everyone.

138
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,240
You said you wouldn't pay.

139
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,240
You have a fire in your heart.

140
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,240
Don't always take others out.

141
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,240
You're in a bad mood.

142
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,240
Look at your temper.

143
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,240
Is it worth it to be so rude?

144
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,240
No wonder I can't stand it.

145
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,240
Say that again.

146
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,240
What's wrong with you?

147
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,240
Who do you think you are?

148
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,240
Who do you think you are?

149
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,240
You think you're funny?

150
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,240
You think you're funny?

151
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,240
You think you're useless?

152
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,240
You think you're a teacher?

153
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,240
You think you're a teacher?

154
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,240
Enough!

155
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,240
Enough!

156
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,240
Are you going to do it or not?

157
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,240
This is a single fight.

158
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,240
Be careful to open your hands when you fight.

159
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,240
Come on.

160
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,240
Come on.

161
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,240
Go on.

162
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,240
Let's see.

163
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,240
It's a lesson.

164
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,240
It's been a long time.

165
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,240
The ball is pretty good.

166
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,240
Brothers, I think we don't have to fight in the group.

167
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,240
It's like we're bullying them, right?

168
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,240
What are you doing?

169
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,240
What do you mean?

170
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,240
What are you doing?

171
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,240
What are you doing?

172
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,240
It's okay.

173
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,240
I just came to see you.

174
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240
I'm just afraid.

175
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,240
You forgot how I bullied you last year.

176
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,240
What are you talking about?

177
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,240
Brother.

178
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,240
You have a bad temper.

179
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,240
Don't be impulsive.

180
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
Let's see if the ball is good.

181
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,240
Why are you pulling me?

182
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,240
Are you afraid of him?

183
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,240
Go on.

184
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,240
You know he's in a bad mood.

185
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,240
Why are you still arguing with him?

186
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,240
You're sick.

187
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,240
But your words are a little too hurtful.

188
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,240
You know he's to Jia Mo.

189
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,240
I'm not speaking for you.

190
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,240
I'm not talking to you.

191
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,240
I'm the one who bullied you.

192
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,240
I can't let him go.

193
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,240
Not bad.

194
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,240
You haven't seen it for a few days.

195
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,240
Your skills have improved.

196
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,240
My skills are already good.

197
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,240
That's good.

198
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,240
Come and help us.

199
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,240
We're about to play the final.

200
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,240
Our team needs a capable player like you.

201
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,240
I'm not interested.

202
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,240
I don't think you're brave.

203
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,240
You're angry at me, right?

204
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,240
I'm not angry.

205
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,240
Then why are you angry?

206
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,240
I'm not angry.

207
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,240
I'm just angry.

208
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,240
You're not angry.

209
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,240
Then why are you still angry at me?

210
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,240
Let me ask you a question.

211
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,240
Is basketball important in technology?

212
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,240
Or is it important in your skills?

213
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,240
Of course it's technology.

214
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,240
Then my skills are better than yours.

215
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,240
Why were you able to be the captain?

216
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,240
You only care about your personal performance.

217
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,240
You don't know how to cooperate.

218
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,240
To be honest,

219
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,240
you haven't been the captain yet.

220
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,240
You have a question?

221
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,240
Then you play.

222
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,240
Put your feet forward.

223
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,240
Yeah.

224
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,240
Yeah.

225
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,240
Yeah.

226
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,240
Yeah.

227
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,240
Come.

228
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,240
Good.

229
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,240
Let's go.

230
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,240
Everyone, come here.

231
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,240
Everyone, come here.

232
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,240
Come.

233
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,240
Come here!

234
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,240
Zhaoyi, what did the coach say?

235
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,240
I told you to block the shot!

236
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,240
I blocked it later

237
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,240
You are Zhong Feng, you know?

238
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,240
Where is the blue board?

239
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,240
Where is the blue board ball?

240
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,240
You were like training me and Sun yesterday

241
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,240
I ran for more than 30 rounds, my legs were soft

242
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,240
Are you questioning my training method?

243
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,240
Are you questioning if you lost the game today?

244
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,240
Are you blaming me?

245
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,240
Don't arrange such a big training

246
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,240
Wrong!

247
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,240
If you don't want to play, you can stop

248
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,240
If I don't play, I won't play

249
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,240
Zhaoyi, say it again

250
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,240
Say it again!

251
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,240
I won't play

252
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,240
Why are you so cool?

253
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,240
Okay, don't come back if you leave

254
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,240
Are you okay?

255
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,240
Forget it

256
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,240
Everyone is not feeling well

257
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,240
The captain said a few words

258
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,240
What?

259
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,240
You guys are running for the first time

260
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,240
I am the only one running there

261
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,240
You are a pervert

262
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,240
I won't play this game

263
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,240
You are so stubborn

264
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,240
Can you get over it without playing?

265
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,240
I...

266
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,240
Let's go

267
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,240
Thank you

268
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,240
Does it still hurt?

269
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,240
Old wound, it's okay

270
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,240
I think Zheng Xue is a little upset.

271
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,240
What's wrong with you?

272
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,240
Zheng Xue is going abroad.

273
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,240
Zheng Xiaoqi.

274
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,240
Don't tell anyone about this.

275
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,240
I'm not going to tell anyone.

276
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,240
I'm not going to tell anyone.

277
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,240
I'm afraid it will affect the game.

278
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,240
It's okay.

279
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,240
What I care about most now is the game.

280
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,240
The rest...

281
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,240
Zheng Xiaoqi.

282
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,240
Don't be sad.

283
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,240
Zhao Ye may be in a bad mood because of the game.

284
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,240
He's been under too much pressure lately.

285
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,240
I'm afraid we can never go back to the way we were.

286
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,240
Don't think too much.

287
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,240
Please eat.

288
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,240
It's all my fault.

289
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,240
I shouldn't have told Zhao Ye that I like Su Kai.

290
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,240
Who do you like? That's your freedom.

291
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,240
Zhao Ye should think about it.

292
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,240
That's his own problem.

293
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,240
I don't dare to talk to him now.

294
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,240
Su Kai is also in a particularly bad state.

295
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,240
I'm so confused now.

296
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,240
I'm confused.

297
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,240
Zhao Ye and I...

298
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,240
We're strangers now.

299
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,240
Some cumin.

300
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,240
Here you go.

301
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,240
Do you want spicy food?

302
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,240
Yes.

303
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,240
Here you go.

304
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,240
Don't buy too much blood.

305
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,240
No.

306
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,240
You're always embarrassing me.

307
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,240
Dad.

308
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,240
You're too petty.

309
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,240
With my skills,

310
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,240
I can beat them to the ground.

311
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,240
By the way, dad, I've asked around.

312
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,240
If I get a second grade certificate in basketball,

313
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,240
I can get 20 points in the college entrance examination.

314
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,240
I'm working hard in the culture department.

315
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,240
We'll definitely get into the sports university.

316
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,240
When I make money,

317
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,240
I'll buy you and my mom a lot of good things.

318
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,240
We won't look at the price.

319
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,240
We won't look at the price.

320
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,240
Whatever you order, it's the same.

321
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,240
Good wine.

322
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,240
Why haven't we seen each other for a few days?

323
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,240
You're just leaving?

324
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,240
How's your exam?

325
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,240
Can you get the first place?

326
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,240
I don't care.

327
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,240
I've finished the exam.

328
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,240
How was your cup?

329
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,240
You have to get the first place this time.

330
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,240
Good.

331
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,240
You're full of confidence.

332
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,240
It's not that.

333
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,240
I just want to get a good score.

334
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,240
That's great.

335
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,240
But,

336
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,240
you have to get a good score.

337
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,240
Don't forget your friends.

338
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,240
You... you know everything?

339
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,240
Of course I know.

340
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,240
Chen Xun, Fang Hui, Jia Mo.

341
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,240
They call me every day.

342
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,240
Especially Jia Mo.

343
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,240
One day a day.

344
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,240
What's wrong with me?

345
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,240
What did Jia... what did Jia Mo say?

346
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,240
He told me to tell you.

347
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,240
Don't rely on yourself when you have something to do.

348
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,240
And us.

349
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,240
I'm sorry.

350
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,240
So early?

351
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,240
Don't you want to go so early?

352
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,240
Your shoulder is injured.

353
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,240
Why didn't you tell everyone?

354
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,240
You didn't say it even if your foot hurts.

355
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,240
If it hurts, you can take a break.

356
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,240
Do you remember the training of the Kaltar people?

357
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,240
Which one is more painful?

358
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,240
Effort or regret?

359
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,240
I'm sorry.

360
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,240
The End

361
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,240
Great.

362
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,240
Great.

363
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,240
That's awesome.

364
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,240
What are you doing?

365
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,240
Everyone saw this game today.

366
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,240
If it wasn't for the final death,

367
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,240
we would have gone home.

368
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,240
Everyone has been training hard recently.

369
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,240
Especially Zhao Yi.

370
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,240
He's active and good at playing.

371
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,240
The last game.

372
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,240
Second high school.

373
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,240
Although we lost,

374
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,240
but...

375
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,240
We are not afraid of them.

376
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,240
We will fight with our own strength to win them.

377
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,240
Do you have confidence?

378
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,240
Yes.

379
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,240
I'm angry.

380
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,240
You said you were angry.

381
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,240
No.

382
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,240
Give me back the ball.

383
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,240
I won't give it to you.

384
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,240
Give it to me.

385
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,240
Are you talking to me?

386
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,240
You are sick.

387
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,240
You are sick.

388
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,240
You are sick.

389
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,240
You are sick.

390
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,240
You are sick.

391
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,240
You are sick.

392
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,240
You are sick.

393
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,240
You are sick.

394
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,240
You are sick.

395
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,240
I am sick.

396
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,240
I heard that you have been

397
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,240
very busy recently.

398
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,240
You have been

399
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,240
very good recently.

400
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,240
Of course.

401
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,240
Who am I?

402
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,240
I'm Ying Mu Huan.

403
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,240
When did I change your bad habit?

404
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,240
You are playing with the ball.

405
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,240
This is the field.

406
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,240
You are so good.

407
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,240
Come here.

408
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,240
You are playing with the ball.

409
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,240
Don't say anything else.

410
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,240
We must win the championship.

411
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,240
Do you have confidence?

412
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,240
Yes.

413
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,240
Today's training is based on the power of the field.

414
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,240
Spread your body.

415
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,240
Good.

416
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,240
You are going to be a player.

417
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,240
Really?

418
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,240
You are a player?

419
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,240
We will play with you for free.

420
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,240
Don't worry.

421
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,240
We won't charge you.

422
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,240
You.

423
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,240
Don't move.

424
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,240
To be honest,

425
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,240
you should save some energy.

426
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,240
If you save some energy,

427
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,240
you will lose tomorrow.

428
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,240
Say it again.

429
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,240
Don't move.

430
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,240
Don't move.

431
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,240
Jiang Jiang, let me tell you.

432
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,240
I'm not interested in

433
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,240
talking nonsense with you.

434
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,240
See you tomorrow on the field.

435
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,240
See you on the field.

436
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,240
Go.

437
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,240
Let's continue.

438
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,240
Su Kai can't convince me.

439
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,240
He asked you to be a player.

440
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,240
I came here by myself.

441
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,240
Now everyone is working hard for that.

442
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,240
Do you have to be so aggressive

443
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,240
about that?

444
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,240
Jia Mu, let's not talk about this.

445
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,240
No.

446
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,240
We must make it clear today.

447
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,240
Why don't you go on the field?

448
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,240
You don't know this.

449
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,240
I don't want to know this.

450
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,240
I only know now

451
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,240
that Su Kai put your name on it.

452
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,240
That's because he trusts you.

453
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,240
Can't you trust him once?

454
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,240
Are you sure?

455
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,240
I'm sure.

456
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,240
I'm sure.

457
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,240
I'm sure.

458
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,240
Go.

459
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,240
Go.

460
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,240
You should know

461
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,240
who is the captain.

462
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,240
You are bullying people

463
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,240
based on your ranking.

464
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,240
This team has better technology

465
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,240
than mine.

466
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,240
I know that.

467
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,240
But we are a team

468
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,240
and we need cooperation.

469
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,240
Enough.

470
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,240
Since it is like that,

471
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,240
we should fight separately.

472
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,240
I'm going to the final soon.

473
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,240
Are you nervous?

474
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,240
Jia Mu,

475
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,240
have you ever been on a plane?

476
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,240
No.

477
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,240
Then tell me,

478
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,240
can you see our school

479
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,240
on the plane?

480
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,240
I can't.

481
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,240
I can't.

482
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,240
I can't.

483
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,240
The final is over.

484
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,240
Today's plane.

485
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,240
I don't understand.

486
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,240
In China,

487
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,240
we can go to a good university.

488
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,240
Why do we have to go abroad?

489
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,240
At least,

490
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,240
we can be together

491
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,240
here.

492
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,240
Maybe he doesn't need me.

493
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,240
Su Kai,

494
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,240
he doesn't need you.

495
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,240
He doesn't need you.

496
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,240
I need you.

497
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,240
I bought the water.

498
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,240
I called the BP machine.

499
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,240
I went to the basketball court every day

500
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,240
to see you.

501
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,240
The happiest thing in school every day

502
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,240
is to see you.

503
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,240
I remember every word you said.

504
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,240
I know every thing you did.

505
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,240
I like every thing you like.

506
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,240
From the first time I saw you,

507
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,240
I like you.

508
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,240
Let me be with you.

509
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,240
I'm sorry.

510
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,240
I want to wait for him

511
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,240
to come back.

512
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,240
You are the kindest

513
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,240
and the cutest girl in my life.

514
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,240
I always see you as my sister.

515
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,240
You will be

516
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,240
in the future.

517
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,240
I'm fine.

518
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,240
After Su Kai's college entrance examination,

519
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,240
I will treat him to a meal

520
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,240
to celebrate.

521
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,240
Be careful.

522
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,240
Damn.

523
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,240
Are you okay?

524
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,240
I'm fine.

525
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,240
In my heart,

526
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,240
you are a big green onion.

527
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,240
Cut the meat

528
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,240
and put it in the rice noodle.

529
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,240
Ten years later,

530
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,240
you will be a green onion.

531
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,240
I wish you

532
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,240
to stop putting rice noodle in the rice noodle.

533
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,240
I want to

534
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,240
eat every minute of your life.

535
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,240
I'm fine.

536
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,240
Let's go.

537
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,240
I'm fine.

538
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,240
I'm fine.

539
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,240
I'm fine.

540
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,240
I'm fine.

541
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,240
I don't understand.

542
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,240
Why do you have to drag me?

543
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,240
Don't.

544
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,240
Today is such an important day.

545
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,240
We should cheer for Zhao Ye.

546
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,240
Yes. Let's go.

547
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,240
Let's go.

548
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,240
Why are you here?

549
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,240
We prepared

550
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,240
some gifts for you.

551
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,240
It's a proposal.

552
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,240
Gifts?

553
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,240
No.

554
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,240
I don't have it.

555
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,240
Take it.

556
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,240
Take a look.

557
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,240
Damn.

558
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,240
This...

559
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,240
This must be expensive.

560
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,240
We bought it for you.

561
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,240
I won the competition two days ago.

562
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,240
I got some bonus.

563
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,240
I added some pressure.

564
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,240
I have a small meal.

565
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,240
I saved some.

566
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,240
Don't cry.

567
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,240
Okay.

568
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,240
Try it.

569
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,240
It's so suitable.

570
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,240
It's so suitable.

571
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,240
I promise.

572
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,240
I won't let you down.

573
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,240
Come on.

574
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,240
Come on.

575
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,240
Come on.

576
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,240
Come on.

577
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,240
Come on.

578
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,240
I've said what I should say.

579
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,240
Now I'll say a few words.

580
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,240
Maybe you think

581
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,240
I care too much about this champion.

582
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,240
But I want to tell you.

583
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,240
No matter I win or lose today,

584
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,240
I have no regrets.

585
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,240
I will be very proud to tell others

586
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,240
that I used to be in a best basketball team.

587
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,240
I played a best basketball game

588
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,240
with a group of best teammates.

589
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,240
You are the best.

590
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,240
Come on.

591
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,240
Let's drink.

592
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,240
Cheers.

593
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,240
Come on.

594
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,240
Come on.

595
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,240
Come on.

596
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,240
Come on.

597
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,240
Come on.

598
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,240
Come on.

599
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,240
Come on.

600
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,240
Come on.

Go, go, go, go!

00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,240
Go, go, go, go!

00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,240
Go, go, go, go!

00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,240

00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,240
Go, go, go, go!

00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,240
Go, go, go, go!

00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,240
Go, go, go, go!

00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,240
Go, go, go, go, go!

00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,240
Go, go, go, go!

00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,200
Hurry foot down?

618
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,240
Come on!

619
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,240
Go!

620
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,240
Go, go, go, go!

621
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,240
Go, go, go, go!

622
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,240
Go, go, go,

623
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:13,040
Let's go, You

624
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,840
Protect! Protect!

625
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,720
Highness, Prince Emeritus...

626
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,720
Sixth Prince!

627
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,400
Joe!

628
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,420
Fourth Prince, how's yourof立 senhor?

629
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,720
Fifth Prince.

630
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,120
It hurts!

631
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,720
What's wrong?

632
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,120
How are you?

633
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,720
I'm fine.

634
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,120
Don't move. I'm fine.

635
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:04,320
After this game, you don't need to use your arm anymore.

636
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,920
I don't need to use my arm.

637
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,120
Don't force yourself. Listen to the doctor.

638
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,920
I'm begging you, captain.

639
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,320
After this game...

640
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,120
Brother, I really can't.

641
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,520
I can't.

642
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,320
Let me do it.

643
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,320
I can also use the front wind.

644
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,120
Let me do it.

645
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,320
Tell the referee. Change the person.

646
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,320
Change Chen Qun.

647
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,120
Who is Chen Qun?

648
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,720
Chen Qun?

649
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,520
The brothers will bring the champion back.

650
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,920
Okay.

651
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,320
I'll go and win the game!

652
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,320
Ren Jingjiao!

653
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:31,120
Chen Qun!

654
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,120
Chen Qun!

655
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:39,920
Ren Jingjiao!

656
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,880
Goal!

657
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,400
He scored it!

658
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,640
One-on-one game

659
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:17,240
Nothing more

660
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,320
Goal!

661
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:22,360
Will the top wing make a goal

662
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:22,480
You must get the green cards

663
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,480
Lee Hsu, with the short ball

664
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,800
Coach Ye, goal!

665
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:31,880
Hot Desire

666
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,520
No hands

667
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,000
Field

668
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,920
Foot longer

669
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,680
One goal

670
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,680
What?

671
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,680
The car is moving...

672
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,680
What's going on?

673
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:53,680
Chen Xun, fighting!

674
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,680
Chen Xun, fighting!

675
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,680

Fighting!

686
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,680
Fighting!

687
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,680
Fighting!

688
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,680
Fighting!

689
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,680
Fighting!

690
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,680
Fighting!

691
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,680
Fighting!

692
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,680
Fighting!

693
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,680
Fighting!

694
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,680
Fighting!

695
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,680
Fighting!

696
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,680
Fighting!

697
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,680
Fighting!

698
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,680
Fighting!

699
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,680
Fighting!

700
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,680
Fighting!

701
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,680
Fighting!

702
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,680
Fighting!

703
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,680
Fighting!

704
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,680
Fighting!

705
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,680
Last 10 seconds! Fighting!

706
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,680
Fighting!

707
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,680
Captain!

708
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,680
Yeah!

709
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,880
Next year's game, Coach Chen moisturizing the guys inside the house!

710
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,880
Oh...

711
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,880
Xiaoxiao, come here.

712
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,180
Wait here.

713
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,880
Banana, banana!

714
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:38,140
Bo increasingly

715
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,680
and eternal existence.

716
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,680
But where did all those brothers

717
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,680
who were playing later go?

718
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,680
When I think back, what are brothers?

719
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:54,680
A brave, courageous, and courageous person.

720
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,680
A collision of sweat and muscle.

721
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,680
A friendly and trustworthy look.

722
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,680
Those brothers who stood by me together

723
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:06,680
will never be forgotten.

724
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,680
The End

725
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:24,680
I wish you a smooth and smooth college.

726
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,680
Thank you.

727
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,680
I also wish you a good college.

728
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,680
Cheers.

729
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,680
Waiter, check please.

730
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,680
I'll do it.

731
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,680
I'll do it.

732
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,680
I'll do it.

733
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,680
How can I let you do it?

734
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,680
I'll do it.

735
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,680
I think that's enough.

736
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:02,680
Anyway, I don't want to lose a single one.

737
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:10,680
This is the thing that I've been collecting since I was in high school.

738
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:16,680
Each of the books has an S on it.

739
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,680
From today on,

740
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,680
I...

741
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,680
I don't like you anymore.

742
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,680
I won't look into you anymore.

743
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,680
You don't have to hide from me anymore.

744
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,680
I just hope...

745
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,680
I just hope that we can...

746
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,680
No one hates anyone.

747
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,680
No one...

748
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,680
No one...

749
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,680
Don't forget anyone.

750
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,680
I don't like talking.

751
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,680
I won't say unnecessary words.

752
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,680
High school seniors.

753
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,680
Everything you do is unnecessary.

754
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:42,680
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

755
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,680
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

756
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,680
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

757
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:56,680
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

758
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,680
High school seniors.

759
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:02,680
You have to give up everything for the college entrance examination.

760
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,680
Especially boys and girls.

761
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,680
You can't be in a relationship.

762
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,680
I've found out.

763
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,680
Don't blame me for being rude.

764
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,680
Pack your things and go home.

765
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,680
Do you understand?

766
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,680
Yes.

767
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,680
Boss.

768
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,680
Just one year.

769
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,680
Just endure it.

770
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,680
If you can't endure it, transfer to another school.

771
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,680
Teacher, forget it.

772
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:42,680
You can still be in the top of the top in the college entrance examination.

773
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,680
This is amazing.

774
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,680
This is amazing.

775
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,680
Come on.

776
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:54,680
If you don't give up, these kids will blow up the school.

777
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:57,680
You have a fever.

778
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:25,680
You have a fever.

779
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,680
You have a fever.

780
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,680
You have a fever.

781
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,680
You have a fever.

782
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,680
You have a fever.

783
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,680
You have a fever.

784
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,680
You have a fever.

785
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,680
You have a fever.

786
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,680
You have a fever.

787
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,680
You have a fever.

788
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,680
You have a fever.

789
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,680
You have a fever.

790
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,680
You have a fever.

791
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,680
You have a fever.

792
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,680
You have a fever.

793
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,680
Everyone.

794
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:09,680
Growth, my own journey.

795
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,680
I have missed one stop.

796
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:22,680
I can't stop the next stop.

797
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,680
I keep looking at the sky

798
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:32,680
How many waves are there on the way

799
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:39,680
Suddenly look back, look back

800
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:45,680
My car is going to the stop

801
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,680
Hey you let me go

802
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,680
Back to our time

803
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,680
Hey you let me go

804
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,680
Back to our time

805
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,680
Hey you my best friend

806
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,680
Our children smile

807
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:05,680
Never separate

808
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:25,680
Na na na na na na na

809
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:31,680
Everyone

810
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:51,680
I still look back

811
00:47:51,680 --> 00:48:00,680
Na na na na na na na na

812
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:01,680
Everybody

813
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:10,680
Na na na na na na na na

814
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:11,680
Everyone

815
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:31,680
Na na na na na na na na

816
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:37,680
Everyone
