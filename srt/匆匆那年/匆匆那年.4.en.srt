Episode 2

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,520
I want to recommend a classmate.

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,680
Who?

6
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,560
Fang Hui.

7
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,360
You are a very special friend.

8
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,160
Really?

9
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,560
Help me go to the shopping mall and ask for a leave.

10
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,840
I can make up a reason.

11
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,840
This is our captain, Su Kai.

12
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,960
Get in the car.

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,880
Fang Hui.

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,200
Fang Hui.

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,480
Let me kick you for a while.

16
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,400
No.

17
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,520
Don't force yourself.

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,520
I can.

19
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,080
Teacher, you're awake.

20
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,680
You didn't have breakfast, right?

21
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,680
Remember to eat breakfast next time.

22
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,480
Lie down for a while.

23
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,160
Thank you.

24
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,520
What do you want to eat? I'll buy it.

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,800
It's okay.

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,800
Thank you.

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,920
You are really...

28
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,920
Why don't you say it if you're upset?

29
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,320
I thought it would be fine to endure it.

30
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,920
Thank you.

31
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,920
Why are you being polite to me?

32
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,920
If you have something to say, just tell me.

33
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,520
Do you know why I'm so worried about you?

34
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,520
Actually, I...

35
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,520
What's wrong?

36
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,520
I told her a ghost story.

37
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,520
Look at her.

38
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,520
Are you okay?

39
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,520
Are you okay?

40
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,520
You fainted and you're still fighting.

41
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,520
Eat this first.

42
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,520
Thank you.

43
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,520
Chen Xun.

44
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,520
Chen Xun.

45
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,520
Qiao Ran.

46
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,520
Chen Xun.

47
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,520
Why are they both their letters?

48
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,520
I said they were both in the post office.

49
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,520
This letter has content.

50
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,520
Which little girl gave it to Chen Xun?

51
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,520
Chen Xun.

52
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,520
There are so many letters of yours.

53
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,520
Fang Huai.

54
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,520
Do you like Chen Xun?

55
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,520
No.

56
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,520
Then, he sent you to the infirmary today.

57
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,520
Aren't you touched?

58
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,520
It's just a help between classmates.

59
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,520
Oh, I know.

60
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,520
You actually like Qiao Ran, right?

61
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,520
Don't talk nonsense.

62
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,520
Don't talk nonsense.

63
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,520
Tell me what you're afraid of.

64
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,520
I won't tell anyone.

65
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,520
What are you doing?

66
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,520
I'll see when I get home.

67
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,520
I'll see when I get home.

68
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,520
You're still here?

69
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,520
What's wrong?

70
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,520
I think I have to do some English class today.

71
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,520
I forgot which one it is.

72
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,520
Second grade to third grade.

73
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,520
Are you okay?

74
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,520
Does your head still hurt?

75
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,520
I'm fine.

76
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,520
Let's go.

77
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,520
You're so good.

78
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,520
How do you do this?

79
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,520
You're lying to me.

80
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,520
I'm just kidding.

81
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,520
How did you learn this?

82
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,520
Chen Xun taught me.

83
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,520
He plays it better than me.

84
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,520
You and Chen Xun

85
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,520
met a long time ago, right?

86
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,520
We were classmates in primary school.

87
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,520
We have a good relationship.

88
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,520
Actually,

89
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,520
I sometimes feel weird.

90
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,520
I don't know why.

91
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,520
I don't know why.

92
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,520
I don't know why.

93
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,520
It's weird.

94
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,520
You two have different personalities.

95
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,520
You're so quiet.

96
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,520
He's so noisy.

97
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,520
How can you play together?

98
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,520
Don't be deceived by his appearance.

99
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,520
He looks noisy.

100
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,520
Actually, he's very reliable.

101
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,520
He's reliable?

102
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,520
Really.

103
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,520
Let me tell you something.

104
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,520
When I was ten years old,

105
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,520
my dad suddenly got a big disease.

106
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,520
My mom is not at home.

107
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,520
I was so anxious.

108
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,520
Chen Xun helped me

109
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,520
to find a big guy.

110
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,520
I'm so grateful to him.

111
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,520
So,

112
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,520
don't think he's not reliable.

113
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,520
He always puts his friends

114
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,520
first in everything.

115
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,520
He's very loyal.

116
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,520
I'm sorry.

117
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,520
I'm sorry.

118
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,520
I'm sorry.

119
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,520
I'm sorry.

120
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,520
I'm sorry.

121
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,520
I'm sorry.

122
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,520
I'm sorry.

123
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,520
I'm sorry.

124
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,520
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,520
I'm sorry.

126
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,520
I'm sorry.

127
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,520
I'm sorry.

128
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,520
I'm sorry.

129
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,520
I'm sorry.

130
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,520
Don't beat your feet.

131
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,520
Make a spell.

132
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,520
Rabbits?

133
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,520
It's not a bullshit.

134
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,520
Chen Xun's dad

135
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,520
didn't kill people.

136
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,520
So stylish.

137
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,520
çok freestyle.

138
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,520
What's the name?

139
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,520
Qi Wu Bai Guo.

140
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,520
You should teach the teacher in primary school.

141
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,520
You're so silly.

142
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,520
Go away.

143
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,520
Silly boy.

144
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,520
Thanks.

145
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,520
You're so silly.

146
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,520
I'll give you.

147
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,520
Take it.

148
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,520
I'll give you.

149
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,520
I think the queen is a psycho.

150
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,520
She thinks all the girls are attracted by boys.

151
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,520
I think she's the one who's addicted.

152
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,520
Why don't we have a classmate?

153
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,520
We have. It's good.

154
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,520
Who is it?

155
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,520
Fang Hui and Qiao Ran.

156
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,520
They're all special.

157
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,520
You're so silly.

158
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,520
Really?

159
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,520
Do you know Qiao Ran's personality?

160
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,520
You've seen too much.

161
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,520
What's wrong?

162
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,520
Did he eat the medicine?

163
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,520
Go back.

164
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,520
Stop.

165
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,520
Thank you.

166
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,520
Have a good rest.

167
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,520
I'll play with you.

168
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,520
You're done?

169
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,520
Thank you.

170
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,520
Lin Yan Mo.

171
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,520
You played well today.

172
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,520
Of course.

173
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,520
Who else can it be?

174
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,520
You...

175
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,520
Do you know how to write the word modest?

176
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,520
Yan Mo.

177
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,520
Yan Mo.

178
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,520
Come to see us play football often.

179
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,520
Right.

180
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,520
I found you're very lucky.

181
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,520
When did I become lucky?

182
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,520
You're blushing.

183
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,520
You're blushing again.

184
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,520
I'm...

185
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,520
I'm...

186
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,520
I'm...

187
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,520
I'm...

188
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,520
I'm...

189
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,520
I'm...

190
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,520
That's what I meant.

191
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,520
Let's have dinner together.

192
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,520
Come over later.

193
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,520
Okay.

194
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,520
Really?

195
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,520
Okay.

196
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,520
It's settled.

197
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,520
You'll be in the seat.

198
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,520
I'll be the one to take off.

199
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,520
You're good at acting.

200
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,520
Let's go.

201
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,520
Senior.

202
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,520
Where do you play football?

203
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,520
At school.

204
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,520
I sometimes play with my friends in the school.

205
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,520
Can I go and see you play?

206
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,520
Just watch?

207
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,520
You have to go on stage.

208
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,520
Look, I played with Zhao Ye a few days ago.

209
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,520
I beat him to the ground.

210
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,520
I really hope I can play with you.

211
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,520
No.

212
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,520
Actually, I'm not that good.

213
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,520
Let me take it.

214
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,520
Okay.

215
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,520
Thank you.

216
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,520
Let's go.

217
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,520
You're here.

218
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,520
That's Xia Mo's cup.

219
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,520
Xia Mo.

220
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,520
Hello.

221
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,520
Where are you going?

222
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,520
I'm back.

223
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,520
Why are you so tired from playing football?

224
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,520
Are you hot?

225
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,520
I'm hot.

226
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,520
Why didn't you watch your eyes?

227
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,520
What's wrong?

228
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,520
What's wrong?

229
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,520
What happened?

230
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,520
Who's looking for trouble?

231
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,520
What's wrong with me?

232
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,520
Who's looking for trouble?

233
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,520
Who do you think you are?

234
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,520
I didn't see you.

235
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,520
Who's looking for trouble?

236
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,520
Who's looking for trouble?

237
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,520
Who's looking for trouble?

238
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,520
What are you doing?

239
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,520
Don't go.

240
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,520
Don't go.

241
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,520
Don't go.

242
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,520
Don't go.

243
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,520
Don't go.

244
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,520
Let's go.

245
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,520
We have to help him.

246
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,520
I didn't see him.

247
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,520
He's so blind.

248
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,520
He wants us to go back and call someone.

249
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,520
Let's go.

250
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,520
Let's go.

251
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,520
Are you okay?

252
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,520
What's wrong with the hospital?

253
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,520
Captain.

254
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,520
Let's go and get him.

255
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,520
Where is he?

256
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,520
He just left.

257
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,520
Let's go.

258
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,520
Stop.

259
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,520
Do you know that if you cause trouble outside the school,

260
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,520
you will be fired by the school team?

261
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,520
Listen up.

262
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,520
No one is allowed to cause trouble again.

263
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,520
Don't tell anyone about what happened today.

264
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,520
If anyone asks about it tomorrow,

265
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,520
tell them I was kicked out of the school and got a bruise on my face.

266
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,520
Is that okay?

267
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,520
What else?

268
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,520
And,

269
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,520
the school is on duty.

270
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,520
They will definitely trouble you.

271
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,520
You have been on the road for two days.

272
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,520
You should be more careful when you meet them.

273
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,520
Take a detour.

274
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,520
Don't cause trouble again.

275
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,520
Captain, I'm sorry.

276
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,520
Captain,

277
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,520
please get the bandage.

278
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,520
Thank you.

279
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,520
You're so bad, Xia Mo.

280
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,520
Shen Yi,

281
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,520
I want to eat two pieces of beef today.

282
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,520
You can buy it.

283
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,520
Okay.

284
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,520
Does it hurt?

285
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,520
No.

286
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,520
It's okay.

287
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,520
Come on.

288
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,520
Let's continue.

289
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,520
Xia Mo, let's go.

290
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,520
You're here.

291
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,520
Let me do it.

292
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,520
Okay.

293
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,520
Okay.

294
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,520
See if you like it.

295
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,520
Why are you so slow?

296
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,520
I'm tired.

297
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,520
It's not my fault.

298
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,520
I deserve it.

299
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,520
It's not my fault.

300
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,520
I deserve it.

301
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,520
You're so shy.

302
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,520
Do you like to be married?

303
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,520
You're the worst.

304
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,520
I'm sorry.

305
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,520
I'm back.

306
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,520
Stop talking.

307
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,520
Stop talking.

308
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,520
The article of Shi Tie Sheng

309
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,520
is full of his philosophical thoughts on life.

310
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,520
Especially this one,

311
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,520
I and my brother.

312
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,520
I'm sure you caught him.

313
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,520
I couldn't spare him.

314
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,520
Next, let's find a classmate to read the text.

315
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,520
Fang Hui.

316
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,520
Fang Hui.

317
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,520
Teacher,

318
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,520
Fang Hui is not feeling well today.

319
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,520
Okay.

320
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,520
Then another one.

321
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,520
Chen Xi.

322
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,520
What are you laughing at?

323
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,520
What's so funny?

324
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,520
It's here.

325
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,520
Go on.

326
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,520
Class is on.

327
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,520
One afternoon 15 years ago,

328
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,520
I entered Yuan Zhong with a wheelchair.

329
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:52,520
He prepared everything for a soulless person.

330
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,520
At that time,

331
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:58,520
the path the sun was on was getting bigger and bigger.

332
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,520
And it was more and more red.

333
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,520
In the full moon,

334
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,520
in the dim light,

335
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,520
it's easier for a person to see time

336
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,520
and see his own body.

337
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,520
Come on.

338
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,520
You're not a rice cooker.

339
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,520
You don't have the ability to do this.

340
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,520
I'll teach you.

341
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,520
Don't fight if you can't.

342
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,520
Forget it.

343
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,520
I'm tired.

344
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,520
Let's take a break.

345
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,520
Who wrote the words on the blackboard?

346
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,520
I don't want to know.

347
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,520
I guess it was written by Fang Hui.

348
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,520
She wrote you

349
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,520
to confess to you.

350
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,520
And then she wrote it herself.

351
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,520
No one knows.

352
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,520
It must be written by Fang Hui.

353
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,520
Can you not practice?

354
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,520
I told you it's impossible.

355
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,520
Why did Fang Hui write it?

356
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,520
How do you know so much?

357
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,520
Could it be you?

358
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,520
What are you thinking?

359
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,520
We're just friends.

360
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,520
Friends?

361
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,520
You wrote it.

362
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,520
Let me share it with you.

363
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,520
Write this word on it.

364
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,520
You deliberately disturbed the public.

365
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,520
And then you confess to us.

366
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,520
I'm so impressed.

367
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,520
Bro,

368
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,520
you're a 36-year-old man.

369
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,520
What kind of business?

370
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,520
What are you thinking?

371
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,520
Who wrote it?

372
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,520
Let me think.

373
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,520
You like Fang Hui.

374
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,520
She likes you.

375
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,520
What about me?

376
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,520
Who left last night?

377
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,520
Whoever has the key to our class,

378
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,520
must have her fingerprint on it.

379
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,520
There's only one truth.

380
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,520
Have you finished?

381
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,520
Go to class.

382
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,520
I'm not right about this.

383
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,520
Isn't it boring?

384
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,520
Go away.

385
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,520
You two.

386
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,520
You two wrote it.

387
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,520
The last group,

388
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,520
Fang Hui and Chen Xun.

389
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,520
You two sweep the stage.

390
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,520
This is very dirty.

391
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,520
Sweep it.

392
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,520
I specifically wrote it.

393
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,520
I said some girls,

394
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,520
they like others,

395
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,520
why do they harm others?

396
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,520
Lin Jia Mo, what do you mean?

397
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,520
Who likes who?

398
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,520
What do you mean?

399
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,520
Whoever knows, says who.

400
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,520
Chen Xun,

401
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,520
aren't you going to hug your daughter-in-law?

402
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,520
Fang Hui, don't be so noisy.

403
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,520
It's said that a couple is a good match.

404
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,520
It's not tiring to work.

405
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,520
It's tiring.

406
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,520
It's tiring.

407
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,520
Hurry up.

408
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,520
You're making a mess.

409
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,520
Come on.

410
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,520
Come up.

411
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,520
I'm not going.

412
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,520
Don't look down.

413
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,520
Look up.

414
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,520
Do you know

415
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,520
why the sun is the sun?

416
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,520
Because it never cares

417
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,520
about others' taste.

418
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,520
But I...

419
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,520
I'm not the sun.

420
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,520
You think you are, you are.

421
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,520
In my eyes,

422
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,520
you are.

423
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,520
I'm Chen Xun.

424
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,520
What are you doing?

425
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,520
So stupid.

426
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,520
So stupid.

427
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,520
So stupid.

428
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,520
You have to learn to speak loudly to the world.

429
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,520
I'm me.

430
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,520
I'm not afraid.

431
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,520
Shout out.

432
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,520
It's very enjoyable.

433
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,520
I'm Fang Hui.

434
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,520
Louder.

435
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,520
Come with me.

436
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,520
Come on.

437
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,520
One, two, three.

438
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,520
I'm Chen Xun.

439
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,520
I'm the best.

440
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,520
I'm the best.

441
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,520
Louder.

442
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,520
You fell in love with him, didn't you?

443
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,520
Are you okay, son?

444
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,520
I'm fine.

445
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,520
I'm fine.

446
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,520
I'm telling you the truth.

447
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,520
This thing

448
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,520
happened to me so suddenly.

449
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,520
In the past...

450
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,520
Okay, okay.

451
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,520
Son,

452
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,520
hurry up and finish your homework.

453
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,520
Here.

454
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,520
Now,

455
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,520
you can cancel this month.

456
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,520
Give me the book.

457
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,520
I just want a tool.

458
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,520
A...

459
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,520
Look at me.

460
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,520
Is this kid doing something bad?

461
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,520
Where did you throw it?

462
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,520
He took the phone away again.

463
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,520
Eat more.

464
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,520
Please.

465
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,520
Don't be so painful, okay?

466
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,520
Please.

467
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,520
Don't be so charming, okay?

468
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,520
Mom.

469
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,520
Hello.

470
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,520
Chen Xun is your classmate?

471
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,520
He said he wanted to talk to you about math.

472
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,520
Okay.

473
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,520
I'll go to the bathroom.

474
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,520
Don't talk for too long.

475
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,520
Hello.

476
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,520
That question.

477
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,520
X equals 5, Y equals 11.

478
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,520
Are you okay?

479
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,520
I'm fine.

480
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,520
That's good.

481
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,520
I have an idea.

482
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,520
If they dare to trick you again,

483
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,520
I'll go to the bathroom.

484
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,520
I'll go with you.

485
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,520
No.

486
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,520
Why are you afraid?

487
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,520
I like you anyway.

488
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,520
You...

489
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,520
Do you like me?

490
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,520
If you like me, say yes.

491
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,520
If you don't like me, say no.

492
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,520
Enough.

493
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,520
Stop talking.

494
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,520
The food will be cold.

495
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,520
Coming.

496
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,520
Wait. Don't hang up.

497
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,520
Come.

498
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,520
If you like me, say yes.

499
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,520
If you don't like me, say no.

500
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,520
Bye.

501
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,520
Be my girlfriend.

502
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,520
Have some vegetables.

503
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,520
I'm sorry.

504
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,520
Xiao Cao.

505
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,520
Are you itchy?

506
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,520
Just take the exam.

507
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,520
Don't make small moves.

508
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,520
The teacher is looking at the stage

509
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,520
with one eye and two eyes.

510
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,520
Zhao Yan.

511
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,520
Stop writing.

512
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,520
Have you taken the class?

513
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,520
What?

514
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,520
This question.

515
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,520
The question is over.

516
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,520
I'm done.

517
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,520
I'm done.

518
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,520
I'm done.

519
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,520
I'm done.

520
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,520
I'm done.

521
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,520
I'm done.

522
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,520
I'm done.

523
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,520
After the game,

524
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,520
why do you feel cold?

525
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,520
Read it.

526
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,520
Because...

527
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,520
Because the wind is strong.

528
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,520
What are you laughing at?

529
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,520
You can't write it.

530
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,520
Who can write it?

531
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,520
Listen.

532
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,520
That day, the captain had to stop me.

533
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,520
If it wasn't for the captain,

534
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,520
those little thieves

535
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,520
would have been beaten up.

536
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,520
I didn't need to go to you.

537
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,520
It's not necessary.

538
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,520
Who is it?

539
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,520
Where is the senior?

540
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,520
He is in the locker room.

541
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,520
Yes, I think so.

542
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,520
What are you holding?

543
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,520
Nothing.

544
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,520
So mysterious.

545
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,520
Let me see.

546
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,520
Make a fuss.

547
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,520
Let me share with you.

548
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,520
I want to share with you.

549
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,520
There is water.

550
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,520
Give it to me.

551
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,520
Don't touch it.

552
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,520
Give it to me.

553
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,520
Give it to me.

554
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,520
What's wrong?

555
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,520
Lin Xing Mo.

556
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,520
Lin Xing Mo.

557
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,520
Did you get into trouble again?

558
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,520
Wipe it off.

559
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,520
Hurry up.

560
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,520
Wipe it off.

561
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,520
You're a big thief.

562
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,520
I'll beat you up.

563
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,520
Jia Mo.

564
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,520
If it rains suddenly,

565
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,520
and you choose a umbrella,

566
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,520
what color will you choose?

567
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,520
Choose one.

568
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,520
Blue.

569
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,520
This question is about

570
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,520
what kind of boy you like.

571
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,520
Blue is a boy you like

572
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,520
who is smart and wise.

573
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,520
He knows what you don't know.

574
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,520
Is it correct?

575
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,520
It's correct.

576
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,520
Jia Mo.

577
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,520
I'm sorry.

578
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,520
I was wrong.

579
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,520
What does it mean to choose another one?

580
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,520
If you choose another one,

581
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,520
what will you get?

582
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,520
I'm sorry.

583
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,520
I was wrong.

584
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,520
I can't lose.

585
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,520
I'm annoying you.

586
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,520
Go away.

587
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,520
Is it necessary?

588
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,520
It's just a meal box.

589
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,520
So annoying.

590
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,520
Did you have a fight?

591
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:46,520
Zhao Ye is really annoying sometimes.

592
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,520
He's very naughty.

593
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,520
He's not mature at all.

594
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,520
A boy is a little childish.

595
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,520
Didn't you say that

596
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,520
the age difference between men and women is three years?

597
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:01,520
But Zhao Ye's psychological age is only three years old.

598
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,520
I'm sorry.

599
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,520
Let's go, girls.

600
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,520
Don't cry.

601
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,520
Don't you have a nose?

602
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,520
What are we going to do?

603
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,520
You tell me.

604
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,520
If you lose,

605
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,520
I'll dye your hair

606
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,520
into the color of a cherry blossom.

607
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,520
How about it?

608
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,520
Do you look like a cherry blossom?

609
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,520
Zhao Ye is so handsome.

610
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,520
Zhao Ye is so handsome.

611
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,520
Zhao Ye is so handsome.

612
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,520
Ye.

613
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,520
Come out.

614
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,520
Come out.

615
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,520
Come out.

616
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,520
Stop.

617
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,520
Stop.

618
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,520
Dad.

619
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,520
You.

620
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,520
What the hell is wrong with your hair?

621
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,520
No.

622
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,520
I...

623
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,520
I paid you to get your degree.

624
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,520
You're a hooligan.

625
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,520
No, dad.

626
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,520
Dad, no.

627
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,520
Dad, listen to me.

628
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,520
What?

629
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,520
Stop.

630
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,520
Dad, listen to me.

631
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,520
Dad, listen to me.

632
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,520
Dad, listen to me.

633
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,520
Dad, listen to me.

634
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,520
Dad, listen to me.

635
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,520
Dad, listen to me.

636
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,520
Dad.

637
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,520
Stop.

638
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,520
Let him wash.

639
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,520
That's what I'm going to do.

640
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,520
Dad, Dad.

641
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,520
Don't touch it.

642
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,520
Dad, listen to me.

643
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,520
Stop.

644
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,520
Dad, you're so naughty.

645
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,520
Dad, listen to me.

646
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,520
Dad, listen to me.

647
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,520
Stop chasing him.

648
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,520
Hey.

649
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,520
The question I asked you the other day...

650
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,520
didn't even answer.

651
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,520
You're not going to say anything?

652
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,520
What?

653
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,520
If you don't say anything,

654
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,520
you can't go home today.

655
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,520
I'm just watching.

656
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,520
What else can I do?

657
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,520
Let's talk about it another time.

658
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,520
Dad.

659
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,520
Look at me.

660
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,520
Stop it.

661
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,120
I'm not.

662
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,360
I'm serious.

663
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,760
Come to see me at noon.

664
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,040
There are too many people. I can't see you.

665
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,120
I have my own way to make you see me.

666
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,520
Hey.

667
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,880
How are you feeling?

668
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,240
I'm fine.

669
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,800
I can't control what others say.

670
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,480
That's right.

671
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,880
Let others say what they want.

672
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,320
Help me hold this.

673
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,520
Help me hold this.

674
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,200
What are you wearing?

675
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,680
It's said that the five-spice incense

676
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,680
will bring happiness to people.

677
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,520
I'm sorry.

678
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,480
Look.

679
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,480
I found it.

680
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,280
I hope you are the happiest person in the world.

681
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,160
Thank you.

682
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,520
I found it.

683
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,520
I'll give it to you.

684
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,880
I wish you happiness.

685
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,520
Do you want to see me play?

686
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,720
No.

687
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,080
Didn't you say it?

688
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,240
No.

689
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,880
I didn't agree.

690
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:43,920
Cheng Jun.

691
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,920
Those people were just at the school gate.

692
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,920
Where is Zhao Ye?

693
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,880
Zhao Ye was blocked.

694
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,000
The boatman is helping you.

695
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,760
Hurry up.

696
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,760
Don't go.

697
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,040
I'll be back soon.

698
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,760
Everyone.

699
00:34:59,240 --> 00:34:59,920
You didn't see me.

700
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,920
You forgot to put the ball here.

701
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,040
No.

702
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,640
How can I forget?

703
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,480
My brothers are all

704
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,160
my colleagues.

705
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,760
You are very arrogant, right?

706
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,360
No.

707
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,360
Let's talk about it later.

708
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,000
How is Brother Hou?

709
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,760
What about me?

710
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,760
It's your fault.

711
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:17,920
Are you still

712
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,400
as arrogant as Brother Hou?

713
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,880
I...

714
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,680
What's wrong?

715
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,400
You want to make a fuss, right?

716
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,400
Brothers.

717
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,920
It's not right to hit people.

718
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,960
Are you crazy?

719
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,440
Are you very arrogant?

720
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,440
Get off the boat.

721
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,440
Come on.

722
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,440
Come on.

723
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,440
Hit it.

724
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,440
Come on.

725
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,440
Hit it.

726
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,440
Come on.

727
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,440
Come on.

728
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,440
Hit it.

729
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,440
Come on.

730
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,440
Hit it.

731
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,440
Hit it.

732
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,440
Hit it.

733
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,440
Hit it.

734
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,440
Hit it.

735
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,440
Hit it.

736
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,440
Hit it.

737
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,440
Come on.

738
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,440
Come on.

739
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,440
Come on.

740
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,440
Come on.

741
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,440
You are not the one who hit the ball.

742
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,440
You are still angry.

743
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,440
You are so annoying.

744
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,440
Can you die if you hit the ball?

745
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,440
You are so annoying.

746
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,440
You are so annoying.

747
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,440
Are you okay, Senior?

748
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,440
I'm fine.

749
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,440
I'm done.

750
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,440
I'm fine.

751
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,440
I'm sure I'm fine.

752
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,440
Where is Chen Xun?

753
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,440
Chen Xun?

754
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,440
He is behind you.

755
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,440
No.

756
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,440
He is behind you.

757
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,440
He is behind you.

758
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,440
Fang Hui.

759
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,440
What are you doing here?

760
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,960
Nothing.

761
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,960
Do you hate me?

762
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,960
If you hate me,

763
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,960
just give me a good word.

764
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,960
Can you tell me the truth?

765
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,960
Do I have to make you hate me?

766
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,960
You don't even look at me.

767
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,960
I hate people who fight.

768
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,960
I don't even think about it.

769
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,960
If I get hurt,

770
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,960
how worried my parents will be.

771
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,960
Are you going back to the classroom?

772
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,960
Is that question

773
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,960
true or not?

774
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,960
This is the last time I ask you.

775
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,960
I will never ask you again.

776
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,960
Is it true

777
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,960
or not?

778
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,960
Yes.

779
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,960
No.

780
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,960
I didn't hear it clearly.

781
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,960
Did I hear

782
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,960
the fight just now?

783
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,960
Did I get into the wrong place?

784
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,960
Yes.

785
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,960
Yes.

786
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,960
Did you hear it clearly?

787
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,960
Then you ask me.

788
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,960
Are you

789
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,960
true

790
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,960
or not?

791
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,960
Yes.

792
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,960
Yes.

793
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,960
Yes.

794
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,960
Yes.

795
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,960
Yes.

796
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,960
Yes.

797
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,960
Yes.

798
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,960
Yes.

799
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,960
Yes.

800
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,960
Yes.

801
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,960
Yes.

802
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,960
Yes.

803
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,960
Yes.

804
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,960
Yes.

805
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,960
Yes.

806
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,960
Yes.

807
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,960
Yes.

808
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,960
Yes.

809
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,960
The word like at that time

810
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,960
was so hard to say.

811
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,960
The action that had been determined

812
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,960
had to be turned back and forth,

813
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,960
and tried again and again.

814
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,960
It was in the ring of countless times.

815
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,960
But this personal love

816
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,960
made all the people who were passionate about me

817
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,960
and you

818
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,960
lose their minds.

819
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,960
Because

820
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,960
no one

821
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,960
or any person

822
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,960
could bring

823
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,960
the most real,

824
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,960
the purest excitement.

825
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,960
A Lot Of People

826
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,360
Have a Unprecedented Past

827
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,960
If you have anything,

828
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,960
tell me.

829
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,960
Who doesn't know

830
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,960
about your past?

831
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,960
You're so difficult!

832
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,960
What did you bring?

833
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,960
I brought.

834
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,960
What's wrong?

835
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,960
You.

836
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,960
I had a secret with you.

837
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,960
If these two people are in good relationship,

838
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,960
is it right

839
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,960
You know how the other party will react?

840
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,960
What are you doing?

841
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,960
If you want to do this, then let's not be together anymore.

842
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,960
You treat me like a friend!

843
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,960
Hey, you wouldn't know

844
00:40:51,960 --> 00:41:02,960
Every woman loves her

845
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,960
Baby, you I just found

846
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,960
Who would ever want to see it

847
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,960
It's no matter

848
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,960
You want to leave

849
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:40,800
人類

850
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:47,800
Growing up, my own journey

851
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,800
I've been through one stop, the next stop

852
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,800
I can't stop

853
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:07,800
How many times have I been left behind?

854
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:13,800
Suddenly looking back, looking back

855
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:20,800
My journey is always going to be smooth

856
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,800
Hey you, let me go, let's go through our generation

857
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:30,800
Hey you, let's have fun, let's go through the fast-paced world

858
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,800
Hey you, my best friend, we'll always remember

859
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,800
We'll never separate

860
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:05,800
Everyone

861
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:25,800
We'll never separate

862
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,800
Everyone

863
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,800
Everyone

864
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:12,800
Everyone
