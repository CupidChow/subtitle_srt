00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,360
world's thinnest smartphone, E-Life.

4
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,120
Have you forgotten the friendship between the five of us?

5
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,800
Do you like Shen Xiaotang?

6
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,040
Let's break up.

7
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,520
Let go of me.

8
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,200
I don't need your sympathy.

9
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,120
I've found Zhao Ye.

10
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,760
Chen Jun was scared to death for you.

11
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,160
Do you think you can beat him?

12
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,880
He's better than others.

13
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,600
This is the reason why you called me here today.

14
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,360
Come on.

15
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,400
Let me take care of you.

16
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:50,000
If I had been the one

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,800
who fell in love with you at first,

18
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,480
it would have been so great.

19
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,400
You're the best person

20
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,400
I've ever met.

21
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,400
But I

22
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,400
will never be with anyone again.

23
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,400
We've missed each other.

24
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,400
No matter who's with you,

25
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,400
I just want you to be happy.

26
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,400
I won't lose you.

27
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,200
You are the only one who can help us.

28
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,520
Please.

29
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:24,460
I

30
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,080
Thank you.

31
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,080
The more you grow up, the more you understand

32
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,080
There is the best thing in the world

33
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,080
It's called not getting it

34
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,080
In the beginning, you were my secret

35
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,080
I was afraid you would know

36
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,080
And I was afraid you wouldn't know

37
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,080
And I was afraid you would know but you didn't know

38
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,080
I won't say it, you won't say it

39
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,080
You have a face and a name

40
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:06,080
Now, let me continue to love you in the name of a friend

41
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,080
www.sterilege.com

42
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,080
Hello who is this I'm here

43
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,080
Give me that

44
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,080
You are going to go down

45
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,080
Okay

46
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,920
I'm leaving.

47
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,320
It's so annoying.

48
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,600
Are you okay?

49
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,360
I'm fine.

50
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,000
This is for you.

51
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,360
So romantic.

52
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,040
I wanted to show that this has been last night.

53
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,440
I almost thing my head bought up.

54
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,480
If it had been last night,

55
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,000
you wouldn't have practiced that much.

56
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,640
That's what started your whole life, right?

57
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:43,500
If you

58
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,360
can solve the problems later,

59
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,240
you'll have a different life.

60
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,740
I don't want to do it anymore.

61
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,740
You know what?

62
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:55,140
When I was in high school, I really liked to use a small pen to copy love poem,

63
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,740
or love chicken soup.

64
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,140
How come I find it so funny now?

65
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,740
Just this kind. Look.

66
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,740
It's fine if it's wrong.

67
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,540
It really doesn't matter.

68
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,940
What nonsense is this?

69
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,740
Of course, it's too boring.

70
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,240
I'm going to finish eating and then I'm going to cook. Wait for me.

71
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,340
Jiang Wu said there's Love Poem.

72
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,340
It really doesn't matter.

73
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,640
What kind of Love Poem is this?

74
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,240
I wrote it.

75
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,240
I finally found you.

76
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,240
Why did you turn off your phone?

77
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,240
I ran out of battery.

78
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,240
Why haven't you called me for a while?

79
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,240
I have an exam.

80
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,240
I have a lot of classes.

81
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,240
I saw them enter the north gate of the city.

82
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,240
And Shen Xiaotang said that he had moved away.

83
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,240
So fast.

84
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,240
Men are all thinking about the second half.

85
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,240
They are thinking about meeting their parents and getting married.

86
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,240
I am scared.

87
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,240
What's going on?

88
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,240
What should I do?

89
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,240
I will show the students what I am good at.

90
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,240
I will show you.

91
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,240
I am so scared.

92
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,240
I am so scared.

93
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,240
I am so scared.

94
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,240
I am so scared.

95
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,240
I am so scared.

96
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,240
I am so scared.

97
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,240
I am so scared.

98
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,240
I am so scared.

99
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,240
I am so scared.

100
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,240
I am so scared.

101
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,240
I am so scared.

102
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,240
I am so scared.

103
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,240
I am scared.

104
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,240
Si Tugao.

105
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,240
Suppose your dad wouldn't haveocking on you?

106
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,240
here.

107
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:16,800
Here you go.

108
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,120
Good luck, man.

109
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,160
Coming!

110
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:46,900
Down.

111
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,860
I hope

112
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,720
I can get a cool house

113
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,500
Where I can

114
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,500
to sunbathe

115
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,500
Put all my things on the ground

116
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,500
and relive the old times

117
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,500
I didn't have long hair back then

118
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,500
My eyes back then were clear blue

119
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,500
There is an ideal paradise in my heart

120
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:40,500
And the girl I love most

121
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,500
I hope you and I

122
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,500
can be as kind as children

123
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,500
I'll give you a pure heart

124
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,500
and a pure look

125
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,500
and run back to them

126
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:03,500
I hope you can sing this song with me

127
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,500
Bring your story and your beautiful fantasy

128
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:14,500
and go back to the time of those days

129
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,500
I...I'm here to give you something

130
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,500
I've looked everywhere

131
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,500
There's a small company looking for a salesperson

132
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,500
You can take a look

133
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,500
How about you get a driver's license?

134
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,500
If you know how to drive...

135
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,500
I have a job

136
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,500
From now on, I'll be a salesman

137
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,500
I'll be a salesman

138
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,500
I'll be a salesman

139
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,500
From now on, don't meddle in my business

140
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,500
Of course I will

141
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,500
We're friends

142
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,500
I'm different from you

143
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,500
I have a past

144
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,500
I've been there

145
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,500
Don't be so naive, okay?

146
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,500
We'll work hard together

147
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,500
We'll find it

148
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,500
Go

149
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,500
Go

150
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,500
What are you looking at? Get lost

151
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,500
Zhao Yi

152
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,500
You bastard

153
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,500
What's wrong with you?

154
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,500
Zhao Yi, let's go downstairs

155
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,500
Let's go

156
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,500
What's wrong with you?

157
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,500
You're really that bastard

158
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,500
What's wrong with you?

159
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,500
I don't have any rules

160
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,500
Rules? It's your mother's

161
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,500
I'm the one who has rules

162
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,500
Get your glasses off

163
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,500
Hurry up

164
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,500
Don't touch me

165
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,500
Let's go

166
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,500
This is different

167
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,500
What do you mean?

168
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,500
It's the same as before

169
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,500
It's all in ashes

170
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,500
When did you say that?

171
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,500
A while ago

172
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,500
Why are you here?

173
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,500
There's a man inside

174
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,500
He's nice to me

175
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,500
He talks to me

176
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
This is where you should be

177
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,500
You don't know

178
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,500
Who's here

179
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,500
You're here too

180
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,500
This is part of my life

181
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,500
I'm different from you

182
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,500
My life is arranged by my father

183
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,500
I just have to keep going

184
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,500
What dreams and dreams are so ridiculous

185
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,500
Sometimes I think

186
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,500
If I had a change with you

187
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,500
At least I would live happily

188
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,500
Boy

189
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,500
You're still the same as before

190
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,500
Do you remember the training with Kate?

191
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,500
What's wrong? I'm leaving

192
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,500
Captain

193
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,500
I'm different from you

194
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,500
My life is arranged by my father

195
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,500
I just have to keep going

196
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,500
What dreams and dreams are so ridiculous

197
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,500
Sometimes I think

198
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,500
If I had a change with you

199
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,500
At least I would live happily

200
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,500
What dreams and dreams are so ridiculous

201
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,500
Sometimes I think

202
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,500
If I had a change with you

203
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,500
At least I would live happily

204
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,500
What dreams and dreams are so ridiculous

205
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,500
Sometimes I think

206
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,500
If I had a change with you

207
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,500
What dreams and dreams are so ridiculous

208
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,500
Sometimes I think

209
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,500
If I had a change with you

210
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,500
At least I would live happily

211
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,500
My life is arranged by my father

212
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,500
I just have to keep going

213
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,500
What dreams and dreams are so ridiculous

214
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,500
Sometimes I think

215
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,500
If I had a change with you

216
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,500
At least I would live happily

217
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,500
Kate

218
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,460
Zhou Jia Mo

219
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,460
No need

220
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,460
It's okay.

221
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,660
Really no need.

222
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:10,860
Thank you.

223
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,460
Li Jia Mu

224
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,660
Can we talk?

225
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,660
I know you've never seen me.

226
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,260
I also think it's impossible for us.

227
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,260
I also know that you live in your heart.

228
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,660
You will always let him live.

229
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,860
I used to like someone like you.

230
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,060
He also likes others.

231
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,860
I used to want to be like you.

232
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,060
Mo Mo is good to him.

233
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,660
Mo Mo collects all his things.

234
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,460
Mo Mo's thinking.

235
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,060
But then.

236
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,260
I found myself wrong.

237
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,060
I even missed the most precious person around me.

238
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,060
Now I understand.

239
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,860
But some things can't be forgotten.

240
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,460
That's right.

241
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,860
So I won't fight with him anymore.

242
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,660
I won't bother you anymore, Li Jia Mo.

243
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,660
I won't go to class with you anymore.

244
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,460
I won't go to the self-study with you anymore.

245
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,060
I won't play basketball with you anymore.

246
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,060
No one will fight with you anymore.

247
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,420
You're stealing my buns.

248
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:28,020
I just hope you can be happy.

249
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,220
My feet are fine.

250
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,420
Not smelly.

251
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:50,980
Mom.

252
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,020
Mom.

253
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,220
Dad.

254
00:18:59,220 --> 00:18:59,980
Come on.

255
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,220
Come on.

256
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,420
You're here.

257
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,020
What's up?

258
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,620
Why am I like this?

259
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,140
Have a rest.

260
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,140
I'm Jiang Mo's friend.

261
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,140
What's up?

262
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,140
What are you looking at?

263
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,140
Are you looking for a fight?

264
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,140
I'm pretty angry.

265
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,140
It's okay.

266
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:42,140
I just came to get some justice.

267
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,140
You can talk?

268
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,140
Who are you talking to?

269
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,140
Is that enough?

270
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,140
I'm just wondering.

271
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,140
Which part of you is better than me?

272
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,140
Not just a little bit.

273
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,140
Do you have any respect?

274
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,140
Don't take me for a job.

275
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,140
Are you sick?

276
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,140
I tell you, Zhao Ye.

277
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,140
I like Lin Jia Mo.

278
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,140
Lin Jia Mo rejected me for you.

279
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:12,140
You pushed her out.

280
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,140
Who's sick?

281
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,140
Who's sick?

282
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,140
Such a good girl.

283
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:24,140
You don't cherish her in front of you.

284
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,140
Zhao Ye, you're a fool.

285
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,140
Anyway, you can't do anything.

286
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:36,140
If you dare to let her fall into her eyes,

287
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:40,140
Zhao Ye, I will never let you go.

288
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,140
I will never let you go.

289
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,140
I want to eat chicken with rice.

290
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,140
Let's go to the second store.

291
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,140
Which chicken with rice is better?

292
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,140
I'm not hungry.

293
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,140
I'm going to finish it.

294
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,140
No, I want to finish it today.

295
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,140
Shan Xue.

296
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,140
Come here.

297
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,140
What?

298
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,140
Have you seen Fang Hui recently?

299
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,140
No.

300
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,140
What's wrong?

301
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,140
Nothing serious.

302
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,140
I just can't find her.

303
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,140
What's the situation?

304
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,140
Look.

305
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,140
This is the phone message I sent her.

306
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,140
She didn't reply.

307
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:56,140
We haven't contacted each other much recently.

308
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,140
How about I leave first?

309
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,140
No need. I've finished.

310
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,140
Nothing serious.

311
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,140
Let's go.

312
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,140
Xiaodan, wait a minute.

313
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,140
Jia Mo.

314
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,140
If she has a reply,

315
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,140
tell me immediately.

316
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,140
Okay.

317
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,140
Xiaodan.

318
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,140
Lin Jia Mo.

319
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,140
Do you dare to play basketball?

320
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,140
Jia Mo.

321
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,140
What are you doing?

322
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,140
Didn't you tell me to get lost?

323
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,140
I'm going to get lost now.

324
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,140
Jia Mo.

325
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,140
I'm sorry.

326
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,140
I was wrong.

327
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:09,140
I've had a bad brain since I was a child.

328
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:13,140
I've been stupid and stupid since I was a child.

329
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,140
Don't be angry, okay?

330
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,140
You're a fool.

331
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,140
Yes, I'm a fool.

332
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,140
Don't be angry.

333
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,140
You're a fool.

334
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,140
Yes, I'm a fool.

335
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,140
Don't be angry.

336
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,140
You're a big fool.

337
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,140
Yes, I'm a big fool.

338
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,140
Don't be angry.

339
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,140
Why are you doing that?

340
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,140
I have nothing now.

341
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,140
I can't give you anything.

342
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,140
I'm afraid I've been like this all my life.

343
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,140
I think you should find a better person.

344
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,140
I hate you.

345
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,140
I like you.

346
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,140
You don't choose her by herself,

347
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,140
unless you like her.

348
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,140
I hate you.

349
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,140
you

350
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,140
You need to stop being stupid.

351
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,140
That's right.

352
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,140
Yes, yes, yes...

353
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,140
You don't know me.

354
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,140
I'll go to sleep.

355
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,140
What do you think?

356
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,140
I was just about to tell you

357
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,140
I called Qin yesterday

358
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,140
Guess what?

359
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,140
What?

360
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,140
Tao Zi is going to be a father

361
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,140
Wow, this girl has no white stones in her waist

362
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,140
It's so hard

363
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,140
I really have some feelings

364
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:56,140
In this life, it's like this

365
00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:01,140
Getting married, having a child, getting a house, raising a dog

366
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,140
Washing clothes, cooking

367
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,140
Every girl wants these

368
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,140
You have to think about it for yourself

369
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,140
I'm not afraid

370
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,140
I have it in my heart

371
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,140
Let's do it again

372
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,140
Let's do it again

373
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,140
Let's do it again

374
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,140
Can you still drink?

375
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,140
I'm getting old

376
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,140
I'm getting old

377
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,140
Stop drinking

378
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,140
You're finally here

379
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,140
Take it away

380
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,140
You're drinking in the river

381
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,140
What are you drinking? Come home with me

382
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,140
You're having a bad time

383
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,140
Stop drinking

384
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,140
Come home with me

385
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,140
Come home, okay?

386
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,140
I'm happy today

387
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,140
Drink more

388
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,140
Too much pressure

389
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,140
I'm scared

390
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,140
Let's go back

391
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,140
Okay, don't let him get off the car

392
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,140
Let's go

393
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,140
Let's get the teeth out

394
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,140
Go

395
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,140
Go

396
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,140
Go

397
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,140
You like me

398
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,140
You say yes

399
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,140
Don't like me

400
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,140
You say no

401
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,140
Yes

402
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,140
Or no

403
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,140
Yes

404
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,140
I am too

405
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,140
Yes

406
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:09,140
I hope I have a bright landing bed

407
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:14,140
I can sunbathe every day

408
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,140
I want to drink water

409
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,140
Feng

410
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,140
Look who I am

411
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,140
Come here

412
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,140
Come here

413
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,140
I'll sing for you

414
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:47,140
Please take a look at who I am

415
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,140
Jia Mo

416
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,140
It's me

417
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,140
Did he contact you?

418
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,140
No

419
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,140
Okay, I got it

420
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,140
Bye

421
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,140
Bye

422
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,140
Cheng Xun

423
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,140
Huh?

424
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,140
Go back to the dorm

425
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,140
Get your summer clothes back

426
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,140
It's hot today

427
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,140
Okay

428
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,140
What?

429
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,140
You're so annoying

430
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,140
I can't get off

431
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,140
Who?

432
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,140
Who?

433
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,140
I'm playing

434
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,140
Drink

435
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,140
You're back

436
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,140
I came back to get something

437
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,140
This is a sweet potato

438
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,140
How's it going?

439
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,140
Is school okay?

440
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,140
It's fine

441
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,140
You just have a good time

442
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,140
Live your life

443
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:45,140
Brother, this is called sour

444
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,140
What are you doing?

445
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,140
You're so lazy

446
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,140
Don't do anything serious

447
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,140
Hurry up and eat

448
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,140
I'm hungry

449
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,140
Brother Qiang

450
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:00,140
Are you still in the dark during the break?

451
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,140
Brother

452
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,140
This time it's not a bull

453
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,140
It's a bitch

454
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,140
Bitch

455
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,140
That's right

456
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,140
Bitch is good at everything

457
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,140
She's a very tired person

458
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,140
She doesn't know anything

459
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,140
She's lying like a dead fish

460
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,140
Why are you looking at me?

461
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,140
What?

462
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,140
You don't believe me?

463
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:22,140
I believe you

464
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,140
Tell me

465
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,140
Tell me

466
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:27,140
This girl is from our school

467
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,140
Maybe you all know her

468
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,140
Who?

469
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,140
You made her so bad?

470
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,140
She's a manager

471
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,140
She's our agent

472
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,140
Who?

473
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,140
Fang Hui

474
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,140
Where's the water?

475
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,140
Look

476
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,140
Who are you talking about?

477
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,140
Fang Hui

478
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,140
What happened?

479
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,140
Say it again

480
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,140
Say it again

481
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,140
Are you crazy?

482
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,140
How dare you

483
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,140
How dare you

484
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,140
Asshole

485
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,140
Asshole

486
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,140
Asshole

487
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,140
Asshole

488
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,140
How dare you

489
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,140
Asshole

490
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,140
How dare you

491
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,140
Asshole

492
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,140
How dare you

493
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,140
Asshole

494
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,140
Asshole

495
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,140
Asshole

496
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,140
Asshole

497
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,140
Asshole

498
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,140
Asshole

499
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,140
Asshole

500
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,140
Asshole

501
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,140
Asshole

502
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,140
Asshole

503
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,140
Asshole

504
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,140
Listen to me

505
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,140
Listen to me

506
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,140
Don't touch me

507
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,140
Don't touch me

508
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,140
That Fang Hui

509
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,140
Is her ex-girlfriend

510
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,140
Her first love

511
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,140
Chief

512
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,140
Chief

513
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,140
Chief

514
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,140
What's wrong with your first love?

515
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,140
What's wrong with your first love?

516
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,140
My first love

517
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,140
I don't know who did it

518
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,140
Brother Qiang

519
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,140
Don't punish me

520
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,140
Chief

521
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:52,140
Why don't you make a time stop for what we talked about earlier?

522
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,140
Let's go

523
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,140
She loves you so bad

524
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,140
She's thought of this

525
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:36,640
Sun

526
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,640
You said it. What's the matter?

527
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,640
Why are you doing this?

528
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,640
Why are you torturing yourself like this?

529
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,640
I'm fine. I'm fine.

530
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,640
What kind of person is Kuang Qiang?

531
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,640
I know better than you.

532
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,640
Yes.

533
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,640
He chased me.

534
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,640
He's a good man.

535
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,640
He's a good man.

536
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,640
He's a good man.

537
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,640
He chased me.

538
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,640
I didn't refuse.

539
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,640
You can live with Shen Xiao Tao.

540
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,640
I can do it too.

541
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,640
Let me ask you.

542
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,640
Do you love Kuang Qiang?

543
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,640
I and Shen Xiao Tao, that's because I love him.

544
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,640
I love you.

545
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,640
You hate me.

546
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,640
You hate me.

547
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,640
You can beat me or scold me.

548
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,640
But I'm begging you.

549
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,640
Can you not hurt yourself like this?

550
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,640
I don't care.

551
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,640
I care.

552
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,640
I care.

553
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:06,640
Do you know how painful it is for you to do this to yourself?

554
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,640
Do you know what it feels like to be heartbroken?

555
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,640
It's heartache.

556
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,640
I look at you, hug my hand,

557
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,640
and pull someone else.

558
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,640
It's heartache.

559
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,640
I dream every night.

560
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,640
It's endless darkness.

561
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,640
It's heartache.

562
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,640
When I'm on the bed with someone else,

563
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,640
I miss you so much.

564
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,640
Can you still come back?

565
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,640
The school is too small to make a big deal.

566
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,640
Isn't it just a drawback?

567
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,640
Is it worth it?

568
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,640
What are you thinking about?

569
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,640
Nothing.

570
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:02,640
What did you call Fang Hui before?

571
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,640
What do you mean?

572
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,640
Nothing.

573
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,640
Something you call her.

574
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,640
Baby, wife, or something like that.

575
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,640
No.

576
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,640
I'm not a bad boy.

577
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,640
What's wrong with you?

578
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,640
Don't tell me you have a first love affair.

579
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,640
I'm going to sleep.

580
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,640
I'm going to sleep.

581
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,640
Are you done?

582
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,640
Almost.

583
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,640
The legend of hot blood.

584
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,640
Great.

585
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,640
Forget it.

586
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,640
How long can you make money?

587
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,640
Don't worry.

588
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,640
I've calculated it.

589
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,640
We have a good location.

590
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,640
Normal business can be done in one year.

591
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,640
I hope there won't be any accident.

592
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,640
Of course not.

593
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,640
It's slowly coming.

594
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,640
We'll open a branch tomorrow.

595
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,640
The third year is the year after next.

596
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,640
You're good.

597
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,640
You're making progress.

598
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,640
You don't believe me?

599
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,640
I'm going to build a empire.

600
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,640
I'll wipe your saliva first.

601
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,640
Qiao Ran called me a few days ago.

602
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,640
She said she was back.

603
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,640
She's finally gathered people.

604
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,640
I want to ask everyone to gather.

605
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,640
Can you get it?

606
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,640
Why not?

607
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,640
Call her.

608
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,640
I said, Chen Xun.

609
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,640
Will you bring Shen Yang Tang?

610
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,640
She's a woman.

611
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,640
What can you do if she takes you?

612
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,640
You're going to drive her out.

613
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,640
You're right.

614
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,640
Long pain is better than short pain.

615
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,640
How can I face you?

616
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,640
It's over.

617
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,640
It will always be.

618
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,640
Fang Hui, what did you do when you were in bed?

619
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,640
I was so worried.

620
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,640
That's right.

621
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,640
I miss you every day.

622
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,640
It's okay.

623
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,640
It's good that it's okay.

624
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:01,640
Qiao Ran, let's see what you did.

625
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,640
I'll do the pressure.

626
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,640
Shut up.

627
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,640
Waiter, add the pressure.

628
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,640
Add it.

629
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,640
You're so good.

630
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,640
Add it.

631
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,640
What's your name?

632
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,640
I like to eat this.

633
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,640
You two are in love.

634
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,640
You promised me.

635
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,640
No, absolutely not.

636
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,640
We are called pure revolutionary friends.

637
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,640
I don't think I'm going to be a beggar.

638
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,640
Stop it.

639
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,640
I came back from abroad.

640
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,640
You're back from abroad.

641
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,640
Are you serious?

642
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,640
Come on.

643
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,640
Come on.

644
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,640
It's okay.

645
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,640
I'm happy to go with you for the first time.

646
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:58,640
Chen Xun said you were very good and sweet.

647
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,640
Especially Qiao Ran.

648
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,640
It's good that you came back.

649
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,640
We'll drink till we're drunk.

650
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,640
Sit down.

651
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,640
Waiter, serve the dishes.

652
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,640
Look.

653
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,640
What dishes did you order?

654
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,640
What dishes did she add?

655
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,640
I can do it.

656
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,640
You order.

657
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,640
Fang Wei, what's wrong with you?

658
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,640
It's okay.

659
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,640
I'm a little uncomfortable.

660
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,640
Waiter, bring some hot water.

661
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,640
Should I order her soup?

662
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,640
Yes, it's uncomfortable.

663
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,640
Eat first.

664
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,640
I'm leaving.

665
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,640
Have some soup.

666
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,640
I'll send you back later.

667
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,640
You're here.

668
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,640
Sit down.

669
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,640
Then I'll have vegetable soup.

670
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,640
I'll bring some vegetable soup.

671
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,640
Come in.

672
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,640
What's wrong with you?

673
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,640
I didn't practice smoking.

674
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,640
I'll go buy a cigarette.

675
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,640
You sit down.

676
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,640
Okay.

677
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,640
Let's eat first.

678
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,640
Eat first.

679
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,640
What's wrong?

680
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,640
Nothing.

681
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,640
Don't hide it.

682
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,640
You're in trouble this month.

683
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,640
What's wrong?

684
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,640
What's wrong?

685
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,640
What's wrong, Shen Xue?

686
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,640
You said you didn't drink.

687
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,640
Why did you spit it out?

688
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,640
That's right.

689
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,640
What's wrong with you?

690
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,640
Are you uncomfortable?

691
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,640
I might be pregnant.

692
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,640
What are you talking about?

693
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,640
That's right.

694
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,640
You must be hungry.

695
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,640
I'm not lying.

696
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,640
What are you talking about?

697
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,640
That child is mine.

698
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,640
Shen Xue.

699
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,640
What are you talking about?

700
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,640
Say it again.

701
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,640
Say it again.

702
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,640
You bastard.

703
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,640
What are you laughing at?

704
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,640
What's wrong with her?

705
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,640
What's going on?

706
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,640
It's not like that.

707
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,640
That child is not her.

708
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,640
Who is she?

709
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,640
Don't look.

710
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,640
This is between us.

711
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,640
Leave it alone.

712
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,640
Let's go.

713
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,640
I can't see you ruin yourself.

714
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,640
What is the reason?

715
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,640
Fang Hui is a clean girl.

716
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,640
She is always like this.

717
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,080
哎ай jail

718
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,740
So many things are happening

719
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,760
but you don't change

720
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:30,860
Xue

721
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:31,940
Why did you come here?

722
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,260
Let me ask you

723
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:09,260
I don't regret returning to the dream, I only hate it too hastily.

724
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:14,260
This sentence has been reflected in my mind countless times.

725
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:21,260
That day, I slept for a long time.

726
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:26,260
I was so tired that I couldn't sleep.

727
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:31,260
I was so tired that I couldn't sleep.

728
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:34,260
I slept for a long time.

729
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:38,260
I dreamed that he was always smiling at me.

730
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:41,260
The whole person was shining.

731
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:48,260
That person was almost all the beauty of my youthful memories.

732
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:52,260
He was walking with time in a hurry.

733
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:56,260
I seemed to never be able to catch up with him again.

734
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:06,260
I was so tired that I couldn't sleep.

735
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:11,260
I was so tired that I couldn't sleep.

736
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:16,260
I was so tired that I couldn't sleep.

737
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:21,260
I was so tired that I couldn't sleep.

738
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:26,260
I was so tired that I couldn't sleep.

739
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:30,260
Translated by Hua Chenyu English Subs

740
00:47:57,260 --> 00:48:00,260
Why is it so cold?

741
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:03,260
Is it that cold?

742
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:05,260
It's like we're in class.

743
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:07,260
It's too cold.

744
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:10,260
We can't even see the sun.

745
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,260
It's so beautiful.

746
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:14,260
It's like we're in class.

747
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,260
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

748
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:21,260
Sorry, the subscriber you have dialed is unavailable.

749
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:29,260
The subscriber you have dialed is unavailable.

750
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:43,260
Since that day,

751
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:48,260
I have never been able to get through this number.

752
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:51,260
This girl named Fang Hui

753
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:54,260
disappeared in my life.

754
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:55,660
never appeared before.

755
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:15,180
I almost walked

756
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,660
through all the places

757
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:17,740
related to him.

758
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:21,860
But he never left any trace of me.

759
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:27,020
Zhang Guorong left that year.

760
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,300
All the alleys and alleys

761
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:30,700
were singing his songs.

762
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:32,860
They all said

763
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:34,300
he was still here

764
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,580
and just went somewhere else.

765
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:38,220
But

766
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:40,300
if the whole world

767
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,660
wanted to find someone,

768
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:44,540
why couldn't they?

769
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:55,220
OK.

770
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:20,300
What are you doing?

771
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:22,540
You came again?

772
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,220
It's my birthday again.

773
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:25,460
Dr. Qiao is here.

774
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:26,460
It's on time.

775
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:27,860
Can it not be on time?

776
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:29,260
It will take you a minute.

777
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:30,460
It will take me a thousand dollars.

778
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:32,060
No, no.

779
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:34,660
One hundred million.

780
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:36,660
I've been studying for so many years.

781
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:38,660
I just haven't found a way to cure your mental illness.

782
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:39,660
Cut it out.

783
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,060
What is this?

784
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:44,060
This is a genealogical disease.

785
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:46,060
It's only for your old Chinese medicine.

786
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:48,060
Chen Xun.

787
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,660
How's your company recently?

788
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:52,060
Is your work going well?

789
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:53,260
What do you ask?

790
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:54,260
I'm bored.

791
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:56,060
I don't understand.

792
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:57,460
How many times have I told you?

793
00:51:58,660 --> 00:51:59,860
Why are you here?

794
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:01,460
I'm afraid you'll be worried about me.

795
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:03,260
Look at him.

796
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:05,660
He's still so arrogant.

797
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:08,660
He's just like when he was fighting with Ma Hou.

798
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:10,260
Don't say that.

799
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:12,860
If you don't mention Ma Hou,

800
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:14,660
I can't remember him.

801
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:18,860
Why were we so...

802
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:20,460
so confused back then?

803
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:22,460
Why did we have to fight with Ma Hou?

804
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:25,660
He's just jealous of our youth.

805
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:31,060
Chen.

806
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:34,860
How's it going with the girl I introduced to you?

807
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:38,260
I've been too busy lately.

808
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:39,460
I'm telling you.

809
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,260
That girl is really nice.

810
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:43,060
Really, really nice.

811
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:44,660
I don't think I can find her in the village.

812
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:45,660
Wait for my chance.

813
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:46,660
I have a chance.

814
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:48,860
I'm tired.

815
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:50,660
Hey.

816
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,660
When are you two going to hold the wedding?

817
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:56,460
We have to wait for the right time.

818
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:59,660
You two just prepare a good amount of money for me.

819
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:02,060
You two will be my bridesmaids.

820
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:03,460
None of you are allowed to run.

821
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:04,260
Do you understand?

822
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,660
I'll find you two

823
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:09,660
the most beautiful bridesmaids.

824
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:10,860
What are you talking about?

825
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:15,460
I only have one bridesmaid.

826
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:20,860
What do you mean you only have one bridesmaid?

827
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:22,460
Ah!

828
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:25,260
Luo Mumu.

829
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:26,860
You came to our friend.

830
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:28,060
I wanted to tell people.

831
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:29,060
I couldn't tell anyone anyway.

832
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:31,460
When I saw Miss trigger,

833
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:34,460
I was just...)

834
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:46,660
Happy birthday.

835
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:47,660
Happy birthday.

836
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:48,260
Happy birthday.

837
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:48,940
Chen Xu.

838
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:51,980
Chen Xu.

839
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,180
Will he come back?

840
00:53:58,540 --> 00:53:59,420
One day.

841
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:08,980
Don't drink too much.

842
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:10,220
Let's eat something.

843
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:11,460
Let's go.

844
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:12,780
Let's go eat something.

845
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:15,060
Let me be alone for a while.

846
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:19,900
Well.

847
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:21,820
I don't think I'll be able to last today.

848
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:20,260
Add the sauce

849
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:22,260

866
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,000

Growing up my own journey
