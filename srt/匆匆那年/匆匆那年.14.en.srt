world's thinnest smartphone, E-Life.

00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,960
I'm going to the UK.

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,960
Go back safely.

6
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,960
I'm going back with Su Kai.

7
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,960
What are you doing?

00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,960
Chen Yu, Chen Yu, I like you.

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,960
Hello, welcome to the new life.

10
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,960
I have only one dream in college.

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,960
To have a romantic relationship.

12
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,960
Your love life is a bit harsh.

13
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,960
Lin Jiang Mo, I declare that I like you.

14
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,960

23
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,960

I declare that I like you.

28
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,960
Your love life is a bit harsh.

29
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,960
Lin Jiang Mo, I declare that I like you.

30
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,960
I declare that I don't like you.

31
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,960
It's really you.

32
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,960
I really don't want to see you.

33
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,960
Can you stop bothering me?

34
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,960
I can't.

35
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,960
You promised me before.

36
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,960
The meaning of life is to torture.

37
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,960
Then let's torture you today.

38
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,960
Do you want to have a relationship with me?

39
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,960
I have a girlfriend.

40
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,960
Are you serious?

41
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,960
I'm joking with you.

42
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,960
You scared me.

43
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,960
The rain is a little smaller.

44
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,960
Let's go.

45
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,960
I love you.

46
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,960

59
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,960
I love you.

00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,960

00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,960
I love you.

66
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,960
I love you.

67
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,960
I love you.

68
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,960
I love you.

69
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,960
I love you.

70
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,960
I love you.

71
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,960
I love you.

72
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,960
I love you.

73
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,960
I love you.

74
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,960
I love you.

I love you.

77
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,960
love you.

78
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,960
I love you.

79
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,960
I love you.

80
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,960
I love you.

81
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,960
I love you.

82
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,960
I love you.

83
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,960
I love you.

84
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,960
I love you.

85
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,960
I love you.

86
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,960
I love you.

87
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,960
I love you.

88
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,960
I love you.

89
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,960
I love you.

90
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,960
I love you.

91
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,960
I love you.

92
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,960
I love you.

93
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,960
I am the one, my heart is through the ocean of eternity or rage.

94
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,960
I always first pure contracts even devotees interview me,

95
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,880
but that delicateness is never enough.

96
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:19,000
Otherwise it will be

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Will you be with me?

98
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I will.

99
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Why are you here?

100
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm here to visit my class.

101
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You're here to visit your class?

102
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I brought you some food.

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You're really good.

104
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Han Xun, let's go.

105
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Let me introduce you.

106
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
This is my girlfriend, Fang Hui.

107
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
This is Shen Xiaotang, whom I often mention to you.

108
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You must be from the school of food and drink.

109
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Hello.

110
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Hello.

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Hello.

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
She is a singer from our school.

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I heard that you know a lot about star-studying.

114
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm just a little bit of a researcher.

115
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What's your star-studying?

116
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm a virgin.

117
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Virgin girls are very serious when they fall in love.

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Chen Xin, someone is taking care of you.

119
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yes, yes.

120
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Hi.

121
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Hi.

122
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You're back.

123
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Where did you go to play?

124
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I didn't go anywhere.

125
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I just stayed at home.

126
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Look, my mom is so fat.

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
By the way, there are many letters for you.

128
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Really?

129
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
New semester, new signs.

130
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The competition has begun.

131
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Girls, come and have a look.

132
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Come and have a look.

133
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Girls, come and have a look.

134
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Come and have a look.

135
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Boss.

136
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Come and have a look.

137
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Sign up with me.

138
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
A man's star.

139
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Sing a song.

140
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What's the rush?

141
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You're going to sing your little song.

142
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I guess that girl will be very confused.

143
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Don't tease me.

144
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Come and have a look.

145
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Come and have a look.

146
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What?

147
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'll sign up for that song.

148
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Hi.

149
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Do you have a girl named Pan in your department?

150
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
She just broke up with her boyfriend.

151
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What's the situation?

152
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
How would I know?

153
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Introduce her.

154
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Why are you keeping it a secret?

155
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I don't have time for that.

156
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That new student is not a good person.

157
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You must not talk to him.

158
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I know him.

159
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I know him.

160
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Don't worry.

161
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
He is not a good person.

162
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
He knows that he is going to meet a girl every day.

163
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
He doesn't do anything good.

164
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You should be polite.

165
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
This is for you.

166
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I have something else to do.

167
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You give it to him.

168
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Hello.

169
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Where is your umbrella?

170
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Thank you.

171
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You are welcome.

172
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Are you tired?

173
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Take it easy.

174
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Thank you.

175
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You sing very well.

176
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You are too polite.

177
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Why are you here so late?

178
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Hurry up.

179
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
The movie is about to start.

180
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You didn't go to class today, did you?

181
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
What time is it?

182
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I asked for leave for you.

183
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What's wrong with you?

184
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You skipped class right after the school started.

185
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I came back late yesterday.

186
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I didn't get up today.

187
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Why are you always like this?

188
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You can't delay your study even if you work.

189
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I have to stay in school to study.

190
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I can study in the society.

191
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Why are you still being so polite?

192
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Didn't you promise me that you would go to class?

193
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Alright.

194
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I was wrong.

195
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Let's go.

196
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I don't want to go to your concert.

197
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Why?

198
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I worked so hard

199
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
just to take you to the concert.

200
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You don't want to go now.

201
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Why?

202
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Don't worry.

203
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm not tired.

204
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Really.

205
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You are happy.

206
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
But you didn't think

207
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
how worried I would be

208
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
if you worked in a bar

209
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
and hang out with those people.

210
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm not worried about you.

211
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
After all,

212
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
you just don't want me to go to your bar.

213
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I didn't say that.

214
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You didn't say that.

215
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But you think so.

216
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I can't think about it.

217
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Can you stop being like this?

218
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
If you have something to say,

219
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
don't keep going around.

220
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I have nothing to say.

221
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Wait.

222
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What's wrong with me?

223
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What did I do?

224
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Why are you like this?

225
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm really boring.

226
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Yes.

227
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm really boring.

228
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Who are you looking for?

229
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Wait.

230
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Why are you here again?

231
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Police officer.

232
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I received a lot of emails.

233
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
They said the address was wrong.

234
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
They were looking for a person.

235
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Can you help me look inside?

236
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Let me see.

237
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
This person has been released.

238
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
How come I don't know?

239
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
When did this happen?

240
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Some time ago.

241
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Xiao Ye.

242
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Auntie.

243
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I want to ask.

244
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
This family...

245
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
This family?

246
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
They moved out.

247
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
They moved out?

248
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I heard that their son

249
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
committed a crime and went to jail.

250
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
He came back two days ago.

251
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
He must be embarrassed to see people.

252
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Do you know where they moved to?

253
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I don't know.

254
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I don't know.

255
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I don't know.

256
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I don't know.

257
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Did they go to jail?

258
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I don't know.

259
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Thank you.

260
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Why are you so unhappy these days?

261
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Nothing.

262
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Your husband is here.

263
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm leaving.

264
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Li Qi.

265
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Let's go together.

266
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Let's go together.

267
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
What are you doing?

268
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You two talk.

269
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'm leaving.

270
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Bye.

271
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Bye.

272
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Tomorrow, the singer will have a performance.

273
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Come and see me sing.

274
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I have a class tomorrow.

275
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Don't go.

276
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's boring if you don't come to see me sing.

277
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I really don't have time.

278
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm leaving.

279
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm leaving.

280
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Don't go.

281
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm leaving.

282
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You made a mistake.

283
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm leaving.

284
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,260
Girl, Miss!

285
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,820
muscles are burnt

286
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,840
the sun caught on eyes

287
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,220
Keep warming yourself

288
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,020
please make you think

289
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,920
Cute girl

290
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,560
still Strategy A

291
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,020
Still Strategy A

292
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,800
Kingdom!

293
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,600
We're Everyone's favorite

294
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,160
Silly girl

295
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,220
I wish to have a bright place

296
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,580
I can go to the sun every day

297
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,180
Put all my things on the ground

298
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,780
And relive the old times

299
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:24,620
I didn't have long hair back then

300
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,220
My eyes were bright and clear

301
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,980
There is a paradise in my heart

302
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:37,580
And my most beloved girl

303
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,500
I haven't heard you sing this song

304
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,700
I wrote it myself

305
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,420
Really? You are so talented

306
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,460
You can rock and rock

307
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:52,540
How about you sing this song when you are rich

308
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,340
I am rich?

309
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,940
I thought I would be eliminated today

310
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,580
No, they all like you

311
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,300
Xue Yinchang is very good and very strong

312
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:09,340
You are so strong today

313
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:22,220
You left a few days ago

314
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,260
I have always been like this

315
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,300
I am happy and unhappy

316
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,140
Everyone is like this

317
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:33,420
I thought I was talking about you

318
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,820
Don't be narcissistic

319
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,940
You are not as capable as me

320
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,340
Where is your girlfriend?

321
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,340
She didn't come?

322
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:54,380
She doesn't like me singing these songs

323
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,140
She is noisy

324
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,740
Yes, she is

325
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:00,220
Girls don't like it

326
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,660
You are not a girl

327
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,580
You were dancing

328
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,060
So I am a psycho

329
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,820
Psycho?

330
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,020
You should be treated

331
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,540
Get out

332
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,820
Here

333
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,300
What?

334
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,580
The test is on the floor

335
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,020
Here you are

336
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,140
Chen Gregory

337
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,020
Hey

338
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,380
Chen Xin

339
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,140
You even told her

340
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,480
what went wrong with the mill

341
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,060
I know

342
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,120
I was so busy

343
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,220
Hurry and eat

344
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:38,600
Keep it

345
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,220
I will be back

346
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:40,700
Elle

347
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,980
are you selling it to me

348
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,060
No

349
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,680
After I want to leave

350
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,980
I will ask her about this

351
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,720
grenades

352
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,540
Everyone

353
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,060
I hate you

354
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,220
and her

355
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,380
I am telling you

356
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,160
I am indignant

357
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:58,980
Chen Xin

358
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,980
Don't be so gloomy.

359
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,980
Go for it, Singer Contest!

360
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,980
What are you doing?

361
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,980
So handsome.

362
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,980
Shut your mouth.

363
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,980
The sweat is almost running down your neck.

364
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,980
Wait, why are you here?

365
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,980
I just learned to play the instrument.

366
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,980
I'll play it for you.

367
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,980
Chengxu.

368
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,980
You can go back to your room.

369
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,980
I'll be back soon.

370
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,980
Hurry up.

371
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,980
What's wrong?

372
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,980
What's going on?

373
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,980
Zhao Ye has been released from prison.

374
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,980
But he moved. I can't find him anywhere.

375
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,980
When did this happen?

376
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,980
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

377
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,980
It's too late to say now.

378
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,980
Let's go.

379
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,980
Call Fang Hui.

380
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,980
You call her?

381
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,980
Me?

382
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,980
You two are making trouble again.

383
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,980
Okay, leave it alone.

384
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,980
Zhao Ye is like this now.

385
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,980
Can you two stop making trouble?

386
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,980
Can you let me save my heart?

387
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,980
Is he here?

388
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,980
The boss said

389
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,980
he hasn't seen him for more than a year.

390
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,980
It means

391
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,980
he hasn't been out since he came out.

392
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,980
Where did he go?

393
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,980
Don't worry.

394
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,980
Zhao Ye is a big trouble.

395
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,980
He can't disappear by chance.

396
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,980
Let's go eat first.

397
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,980
Okay.

398
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,980
I'm not going.

399
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,980
Don't. Let's go together.

400
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,980
Let's go.

401
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,980
This is braised beef.

402
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,980
I often come here. It's delicious.

403
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,980
Try it.

404
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,980
Shen Xun.

405
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,980
It's getting cold.

406
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,980
Eat it while it's hot.

407
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,980
Don't sit here.

408
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,980
Drink some water.

409
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,980
I'm not going.

410
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,980
What's wrong with you?

411
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,980
Turn around.

412
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,980
Why are you so careless?

413
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,980
I said I'll give you a massage.

414
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,980
You didn't.

415
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,980
Does it hurt?

416
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,980
You two.

417
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,980
I'm going.

418
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,980
Well.

419
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,980
I'm leaving.

420
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,980
Bye.

421
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,980
Fang Hui.

422
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,980
I'm not going to

423
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,980
work at the bar.

424
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,980
Why?

425
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,980
I went to the bar

426
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,980
to get a job.

427
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,980
I wanted to make you happy.

428
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,980
Now you're not happy.

429
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,980
What's the point

430
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,980
of working there?

431
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,980
Actually,

432
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,980
you can't do it on purpose.

433
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,980
Fang Hui.

434
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,980
You can do it on purpose.

435
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,980
Fang Hui.

436
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,980
Look at me.

437
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,980
In the college entrance examination,

438
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,980
there were three big questions

439
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,980
in the final question.

440
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,980
Do you remember?

441
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,980
Three questions.

442
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,980
I didn't do it on purpose.

443
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,980
I did it

444
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,980
to get into the university with you.

445
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,980
I want to be with you.

446
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,980
I...

447
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,980
You...

448
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,980
Why didn't I hear you say it?

449
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,980
I just want

450
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,980
to be with you.

451
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,980
Be with you well.

452
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,980
You understand?

453
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,980
No.

454
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,980
For this goal,

455
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,980
I can't do anything.

456
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,980
I can't do anything.

457
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,980
Do you understand?

458
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,980
So,

459
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,980
don't doubt me anymore.

460
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,980
Let's not talk about it anymore.

461
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,980
I'm sorry.

462
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,980
Where is he?

463
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,980
Where is he?

464
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,980
Big sister.

465
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,980
You've been sleeping all morning.

466
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,980
Why are you so tired recently?

467
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,980
Li Jiang Mo.

468
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,980
I can help you.

469
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,980
What can you help me with?

470
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,980
I can help you with

471
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,980
the exam.

472
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,980
I can help you with

473
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,980
what?

474
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,980
Help you with finding someone.

475
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,980
Don't find your friend

476
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,980
who has been in the university.

477
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,980
I have my own way.

478
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,980
It's none of your business.

479
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,980
You're looking for so many people.

480
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,980
How can you find him?

481
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,980
It's none of your business.

482
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,980
It's mine.

483
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,980
Luo Jiang Mo.

484
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,980
Don't be so rude.

485
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,980
You don't appreciate me helping you.

486
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,980
He's hiding from you.

487
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,980
I'm telling you again.

488
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,980
Don't meddle in my business.

489
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,980
You'd better stay away from me.

490
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,980
Do you understand?

491
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,980
You just said you wouldn't do it.

492
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,980
I was in a hurry.

493
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,980
You haven't finished this month.

494
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,980
Just take some money.

495
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,980
I just got this money.

496
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,980
I'm fine with it.

497
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,980
Why did you suddenly quit?

498
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,980
I've been called many times.

499
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,980
If I don't go to class,

500
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,980
I'll be in charge of teaching.

501
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,980
When did you start to be so sad

502
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,980
about studying?

503
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,980
Can't we bow to the world under the roof?

504
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,820
Who is the roof?

505
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,260
What do you want to say?

506
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,180
I think you have something to say.

507
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,860
I just don't want to do it.

508
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:30,900
Okay?

509
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,300
Okay.

510
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,460
As long as you understand.

511
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,660
I have nothing to be confused about.

512
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,380
Shen Xiaotao.

513
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,500
Do you think you know me that well?

514
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,300
Chen Xu.

515
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,660
I don't have time to know you.

516
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,140
Do whatever you want.

517
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,060
Goodbye.

518
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:07,820
I'm sorry.

519
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,220
The food is not good.

520
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,340
I'm not hungry.

521
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,580
Boss, don't eat cabbage.

522
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,980
Have some braised pork.

523
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,380
No need.

524
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,860
I like cabbage.

525
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,740
And someone likes cabbage.

526
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,300
I'm a meat seller.

527
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,220
When I first came to Dongtian,

528
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,780
there was no other food.

529
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,100
It's cabbage.

530
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,820
I don't like cabbage.

531
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,900
I always tell them.

532
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,020
Boss, I don't eat cabbage.

533
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,300
If someone doesn't eat cabbage,

534
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,460
he will die.

535
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,500
From then on, I like cabbage.

536
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,220
You believe that?

537
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,820
Then you haven't eaten cabbage for more than ten days?

538
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:53,940
Of course.

539
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,940
When I was a kid, I ate cabbage in a thin layer.

540
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,620
This time, I ate cabbage for a month.

541
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,940
Next time, I ate potatoes.

542
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,420
I can eat cabbage for a month.

543
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,660
Then later on,

544
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,660
you didn't find out that grandma said

545
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,460
that she would die if she didn't eat cabbage.

546
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,700
Did she lie to you?

547
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:13,380
People who know how to kill people are all liars.

548
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,060
People's lives are like weeds.

549
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,420
Police can do anything.

550
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,740
No matter what, they can't leave.

551
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,220
They can do anything.

552
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,540
Why is it you again?

553
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,740
Why is it you again?

554
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:36,820
Here.

555
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:38,980
What?

556
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,260
Look. Look.

557
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,860
Look.

558
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,260
The person you're looking for is Zhao Ye, right?

559
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,620
Huo Hua Ye.

560
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,260
I've been working in the Public Security Bureau for a long time.

561
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,580
Help me check this person.

562
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,100
Work here.

563
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,060
Right here.

564
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,260
Thank you.

565
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,780
Okay. Go ahead.

566
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,020
Go ahead and settle down.

567
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,820
Or I'll go with you.

568
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,180
It's very messy over there.

569
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,340
No need. I can go by myself.

570
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,460
Okay.

571
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,140
Then be careful.

572
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,820
Call me anytime.

573
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,020
24 hours a day.

574
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,320
I'll pay for the rest and you can leave in the morning.

575
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,020
It's already veryursed.

576
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,340
Can you help me to BLACK headphones?

577
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,460
Then with this help of mine,

578
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,900
there is only a few of us left.

579
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,020
No need.

580
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,340
Hallo.

581
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,900
Hello.

582
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,900
Mr. whatsapp.

583
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,540
Hello.

584
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,140
Hello.

585
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,360
Yin Jia Mu.

586
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,780
You smile?

587
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,540
I'll do it.

588
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,540
You're making a movie.

589
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,540
You're playing in the real world.

590
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,540
What are you waiting for?

591
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,540
This is called theory.

592
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,540
Can you be more clever?

593
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,540
The first one, the second one,

594
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,540
the third one,

595
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,540
You're so sincere.

596
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,540
And this one,

597
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,540
Come and see this girl.

598
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,540
She's so bad.

599
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,540
How about it?

600
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,540
I tell you,

601
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,540
All women are the same.

602
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,540
You have to listen to your partner.

603
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,540
Understand?

604
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,540
Xing Kuang Ling,

605
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,540
I want to remind you.

606
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,540
You can be careful with your words.

607
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,540
What are you listening to?

608
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,540
Don't bother me.

609
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,540
Wait.

610
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,540
What do you mean?

611
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,540
Why are you doing my computer?

612
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,540
I'm not doing anything.

613
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,540
I don't like you.

614
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,540
I don't like you.

615
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,540
You talk to me after you talk to me.

616
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,540
I tell you,

617
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,540
I've seen you not sleeping for a long time.

618
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,540
Can you appreciate this movie?

619
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,540
Look at you.

620
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,540
How many women have you seen?

621
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,540
You're still a cook.

622
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,540
Stinky cat.

623
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,540
Who are you talking about?

624
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,540
I said you're a stinky cat.

625
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,540
You let me say it again.

626
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,540
I've said it.

627
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,540
I'm not stinky.

628
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,540
What do you want to say?

629
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,540
You're stinky.

630
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,540
You're stinky.

631
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,540
I'm not stinky.

632
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,540
I'm not.

633
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,540
You're not.

634
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,540
You're not.

635
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,540
I'm not.

636
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,540
I'm not.

637
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,540
I'm not.

638
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,540
I'm not.

639
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,540
I'm not.

640
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,540
Sit down.

641
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,540
Chen Xun.

642
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,540
You wrote the wrong question.

643
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,540
What's wrong?

644
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,540
Are you uncomfortable?

645
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,540
Headache.

646
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,540
Are you okay?

647
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,540
I'm fine.

648
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,540
I'm fine.

649
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,540
I'll send you to the hospital.

650
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,540
Chen Xun.

651
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,540
Those who want to go to the sun

652
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,540
don't hide your face.

653
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,540
Which school?

654
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,540
The school that I went to last time.

655
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,540
I'm sorry.

656
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,540
I'm sorry.

657
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,540
Who is it?

658
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,540
I'm sorry.

659
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,540
I'm sorry.

660
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,540
I'm sorry.

661
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,540
I'm sorry.

662
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,540
I'm sorry.

663
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,540
I'm sorry.

664
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,540
I'm sorry.

665
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,540
I'm sorry.

666
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,540
I'm sorry.

667
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,540
I'm sorry.

668
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,540
I'm sorry.

669
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,540
I'm sorry.

670
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,540
I'm sorry.

671
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,540
I'm sorry.

672
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,540
I'm sorry.

673
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,540
I'm sorry.

674
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,540
I'm sorry.

675
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,540
I'm sorry.

676
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,540
I'm sorry.

677
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,540
I'm sorry.

678
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,540
I'm sorry.

679
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,540
I'm sorry.

680
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,540
I'm sorry.

681
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,540
I'm sorry.

682
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,540
I'm sorry.

683
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,540
I'm sorry.

684
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,540
I'm sorry.

685
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,540
I'm sorry.

686
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,540
I'm sorry.

687
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,540
I'm sorry.

688
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,540
Xing Xun.

689
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,540
Yes.

690
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,540
What are you doing this afternoon?

691
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,540
Practicing the zither.

692
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,540
Stop it.

693
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,540
Let's go shopping.

694
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,540
Well...

695
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,540
The song contest is about to start.

696
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,540
I should practise the song well.

697
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,540
How about another day?

698
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,540
What about tomorrow?

699
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,540
Tomorrow...

700
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,540
I don't know.

701
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,540
I really don't have time these days.

702
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,540
When I compete in the competition,

703
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,540
I will definitely be with you.

704
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,540
Why don't you have time to be with me

705
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,540
when you are working?

706
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,540
If you don't work now,

707
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,540
will you still be so busy?

708
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,540
What do you have to do with your time?

709
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,540
I didn't do anything.

710
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,540
Didn't I tell you?

711
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,540
I'm practicing singing.

712
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,540
Is the singer contest so important?

713
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,540
Is the singer contest so important?

714
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,540
Am I important?

715
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,540
I didn't mean that.

716
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,540
What does that mean?

717
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,540
No, I'm singing

718
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,540
to let you hear it.

719
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,540
That singer contest

720
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,540
is organized by Shen Xiaotang, right?

721
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,540
No, what do you mean?

722
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,540
Can we not talk

723
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,540
like this?

724
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,540
Why didn't we stay together

725
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,540
in high school

726
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,540
when we were in college?

727
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,540
Do you think

728
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,540
it's boring to talk to me?

729
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,540
It's boring

730
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,540
to stay with me.

731
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,540
What do you want to say?

732
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,540
I think it's boring.

733
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,540
Really?

734
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,540
She will make you

735
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:26,540
not be afraid to leave.

736
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:45,540
How I wish you and I

737
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:49,540
could be as kind as children.

738
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,540
Give you a pure heart,

739
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,540
give me a pure look,

740
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:58,540
I'll go back to them.

741
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:02,540
I hope this song

742
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:06,540
you can sing with me.

743
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,540
I have to sing

744
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,540
the song I like

745
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,540
to let go of my classmates.

746
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,540
Chen Xin,

747
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,540
those who want to go to the sun

748
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,540
don't be so sad.

749
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,540
Good luck in the singer contest.

750
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,540
Hello,

751
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,540
hello.

752
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,540
Oh no, it's on fire.

753
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,540
The clothes are all burnt.

754
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,540
It's on fire.

755
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,540
What?

756
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,540
No way.

757
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,540
I heard it was the fire from the front door.

758
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,540
Really.

759
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,540
What about the people inside?

760
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,540
I don't know.

761
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,540
Let's go and have a look.

762
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,540
Let's go.

763
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,540
People always say goodbye.

764
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,540
But many of them

765
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,540
happen suddenly

766
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,540
when we don't realize it.

767
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,540
We can't just say goodbye

768
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,540
and say goodbye.

769
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,540
Because it's easy to say goodbye,

770
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,540
it's hard to say goodbye.

771
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,540
If you love her,

772
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,540
unless you're living or dead,

773
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,540
don't ever

774
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,540
separate from her.

775
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,540
Never,

776
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,540
never

777
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,540
separate from her.

778
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,540
What are you doing, Xia Mo?

779
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,540
In this matter,

780
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,540
if there must be a bad person,

781
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,540
I hope I can be the bad person.

782
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,540
Have you forgotten

783
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,540
our friendship?

784
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,540
One person leaves another person

785
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,540
because he doesn't love her enough.

786
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,540
Why are you following this person?

787
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,540
Tai Yi.

788
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,540
Don't be so cruel.

789
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,540
I'm not.

790
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,540
I'm not.

791
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,540
I'm not.

792
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,540
I'm not.

793
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,540
I'm not.

794
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,540
I'm not.

795
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,540
I'm not.

796
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,540
I'm not.

797
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,540
I'm not.

798
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,540
I'm not.

799
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,540
Don't tell them you saw me.

800
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,540
You're a

801
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,540
bad person.

802
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,540
Do you like Shen Xiao Tao?

803
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,540
Back off.

804
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:19,540
I hope I can have a bright bed.

805
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:23,540
I can sunbathe every day.

806
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:27,540
I can put my things on the ground.

807
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,540
I can live longer than before.

808
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,540
Back then,

809
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,540
my hair wasn't that long.

810
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,540
Back then,

811
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,540
my eyes were clear.

812
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,540
I can see the sun.

813
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,540
I can see the moon.

814
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,540
I can see the moon.

815
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:47,540
My eyes are clear.

816
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:51,540
I have an ideal paradise in my heart.

817
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:56,540
And I have the girl I love most.

818
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:02,540
I hope that you and I

819
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:05,540
will be kind as children.

820
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,540
I'll give you a pure heart

821
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:09,540
and a pure look.

822
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:13,540
Run back to their side.

823
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:18,540
I hope you can sing this song with me

824
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:22,540
With your story and beautiful image

825
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:28,540
Back to the time of that year

826
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:33,540
I hope you and I can walk to the end

827
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:37,540
And shine the sun every day

828
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:41,540
We can climb to the top of the mountain to see the sunset

829
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:45,540
And sing about the old times

830
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:49,540
The breeze has already stopped the rain

831
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:53,540
And the wind has already stopped the rain

832
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:58,540
Back to the time of that year

833
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:02,540
The breeze has already stopped the rain

834
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:07,540
And the wind has already stopped the rain

835
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:12,540
And the wind has already stopped the rain

836
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:16,540
And the wind has already stopped the rain

837
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:21,540
And the wind has already stopped the rain

838
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:25,540
I give you pure eyes and my pure appearance

839
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:29,540
And return to their path

840
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:35,540
I hope you can sing this song with me

841
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:39,540
With your story and beautiful image

842
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:46,540
Back to the time of that year

843
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:56,540
I hope you and I can walk to the end

844
00:43:56,540 --> 00:44:00,540
And shine the sun every day

845
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:04,540
We can climb to the top of the mountain to see the sunset

846
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:08,540
And sing about the old times

847
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:12,540
The breeze has already stopped the rain

848
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:16,540
And the wind has already stopped the rain

849
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:20,540
And the wind has already stopped the rain

850
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:24,540
There are many things to tell me

851
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:29,540
I hope the story will be in this place

852
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:46,540
I hope to have a bright landing pad

853
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:50,540
I hope to be able to shine the sun every day

854
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:54,540
And put my things on the ground

855
00:44:54,540 --> 00:45:01,540
And sing about the old times

856
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:20,540
