This show is sponsored by the world's thinnest smartphone, E-Life.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,120
The American expert in coverage, Di Qiao.

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,480
Broadcasts are available all over the city.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,280
An Xue!

5
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,280
I like you anyway.

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,160
Do you like me?

7
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,960
I hope you are the happiest person in the world.

8
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,320
The school is blocked.

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,480
The whole school is in your hands.

10
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,240
Hurry up!

11
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,000
Don't go.

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,400
I'll be back soon.

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,320
Yes or no?

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,680
Yes.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,680
Yes!

16
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:52,840
Yes!

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,520
Yes!

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,360
Yes!

19
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,080
Yes!

20
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,720
Yes!

21
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,440
Yes!

22
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:56,960
Yes!

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,760
Yes!

24
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,480
Yes!

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yes!

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yes!

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yes!

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yes!

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yes!

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yes!

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Yes!

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yes!

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yes!

34
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yes!

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yes!

36
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yes!

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yes!

38
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yes!

39
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes!

40
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yes!

41
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yes!

42
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yes!

43
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yes!

44
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yes!

45
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yes!

46
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yes!

47
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yes!

48
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yes!

49
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yes!

50
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yes!

51
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yes!

52
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yes!

53
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yes!

54
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yes!

55
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let's go.

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Let's go.

57
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You go first.

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Okay.

59
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Let's go.

60
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Can you stop sending me notes in class?

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And don't always make trouble with me.

62
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Why?

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm afraid that others will see it.

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What's wrong with that?

65
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Are you afraid that others will see it?

66
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I won't bring you breakfast in the future.

67
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What?

68
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Okay.

69
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm kidding.

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Why are you angry?

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Why is Chen Jun not here?

72
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Is he going to flirt with the little girl again?

73
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's a pity.

74
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What?

75
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Are you jealous?

76
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm jealous.

77
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I feel sorry for the little girl who is in her hands.

78
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
There is a reason.

79
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
There is no reason.

80
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What?

81
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What do you mean?

82
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What do you mean?

83
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What do you mean?

84
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You are a man of your word.

85
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Don't force me.

86
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
How dare you tease me with English?

88
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Chen Guoruo.

89
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Chen Guoruo.

90
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Over there.

91
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yes.

92
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What?

93
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Such a vulgar magazine.

94
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Why do you still want to know?

95
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You are so strange.

96
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You sound like a reciting a poem.

97
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Who do you want to listen to?

98
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Whose song is this?

99
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Zhang Guoruo.

100
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The one who sings the line of the soul.

101
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The night is like a road.

102
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The dream is like a road.

103
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The wind is like a rice cake in the dream.

104
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Chen Jun,

105
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I said,

106
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
why do I remember you like to listen to rock music?

107
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Who am I?

108
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Rock music is two-time.

109
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,480
Because this kid has been to the

110
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,480
hostel.

111
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
This circle is so messy.

112
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What?

113
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
He is so handsome.

114
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
How can he be in the hostel?

115
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
This is the past.

116
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
If I knew he was in the hostel,

117
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I would never like him.

118
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I would never like him.

119
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Jia Mu.

120
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
People are complicated.

121
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Many people

122
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
have an unpredictable past.

123
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
What should we do?

124
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I don't know.

125
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What do you mean?

126
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
People I don't like

127
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
should be more friendly.

128
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What's the big deal?

129
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What's important now

130
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
is to be happy.

131
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
People with bad points in the past,

132
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
no matter how good they are in the future,

133
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
they are not perfect.

134
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Do you understand?

135
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I can't tell, Jia Mu.

136
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You are a perfectionist.

137
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Of course.

138
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Of course.

139
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Wang Hui.

140
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You think so, too, right?

141
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I think

142
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
the future is more important.

143
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The past can't be changed.

144
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Now we are experiencing it.

145
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Only the future is the hope.

146
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I also think

147
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
the past is not so important.

148
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What is this?

149
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Give it to me.

150
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Take care of me.

151
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I will fight for you.

152
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Give it to me.

153
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Senior.

154
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Jia Mu.

155
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What's up?

156
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Well,

157
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
our school newspaper

158
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
wants to write a report

159
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
about the basketball team.

160
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I want to interview you first.

161
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Well,

162
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm so embarrassed.

163
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You are my friend.

164
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Don't reject me.

165
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm sorry.

166
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm sorry.

167
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm sorry.

168
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm sorry.

169
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm sorry.

172
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Here is the thing.

173
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I will ask you

174
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
your personal information first.

175
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
For example,

176
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
your horoscope,

177
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
your blood type,

178
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
your birthday.

179
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Jia Mu.

180
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Didn't you ask about the basketball team?

181
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You don't understand.

182
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Well,

183
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
the star of the investigation,

184
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
no, the introduction,

185
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
the interview stars

186
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
should talk about the horoscope first

187
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
and then clarify the topic.

188
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Well,

189
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm from No. 23, October.

190
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I should be from Tianpin.

191
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Blood type.

192
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I really don't know about blood type.

193
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's okay.

194
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What TV series do you like?

195
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I don't watch TV series.

196
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
But I can say that I'm used to it.

197
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Of course you are.

198
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Who do you think you are like?

199
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I think I'm like the captain of Xiang Yang.

200
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm honest.

201
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm like him.

202
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Really?

203
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Yes, I'm like him.

204
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Okay, next is the 58th question.

205
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Jia Mu.

206
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
How many more questions?

207
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Almost.

208
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Isn't it for better creation?

209
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Your great image.

210
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What kind of girl do you like?

211
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
This question.

212
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Just say it.

213
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Say it.

214
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
A more cheerful girl.

215
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Cheerful.

216
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What kind of appearance do you like?

217
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
All okay.

218
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Just think about it.

219
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Do you like long hair

220
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
or short hair?

221
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Straight hair?

222
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Or curly hair?

223
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Then I'll go with long hair.

224
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Long hair and curly hair.

225
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Okay.

226
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Okay.

227
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Finally, introduce your favorite song.

228
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Do you know the boys in the back?

229
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
They have a song called Everybody.

230
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's very good.

231
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Boys in the back.

232
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I got it.

233
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Why did you bring me here?

234
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'll introduce you to someone.

235
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Let's go.

236
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The song that's running around in the car

237
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
flows through the day.

238
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
This is my guitar master, Qi.

239
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Hello, Qi.

240
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Hello.

241
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Isn't he handsome?

242
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
He's awesome.

243
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's your first time here.

244
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'll sing you any song you want to hear.

245
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm good at everything.

246
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Qi, you sing him the song,

247
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Girl.

248
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Okay, let's sing this.

249
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Okay?

250
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Okay.

251
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Girl.

252
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Okay.

253
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Okay.

254
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Okay.

255
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Okay.

256
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Okay.

257
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Okay.

258
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Okay.

259
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Okay.

260
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Okay.

261
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Okay.

262
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Okay.

263
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Okay.

264
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Okay.

265
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Okay.

266
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Okay.

267
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Okay.

268
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Okay.

269
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Okay.

270
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Okay.

271
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Okay.

272
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Okay.

273
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Okay.

274
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Okay.

275
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Okay.

276
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Okay.

277
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Okay.

278
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Okay.

279
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Okay.

280
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Oh, girl.

281
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
My girl.

282
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'll give it to you.

283
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So fast.

284
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I made it last time.

285
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You go first.

286
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'll see if you're a good dancer.

287
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'll go back after you leave.

288
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You go first.

289
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You go first.

290
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You go first.

291
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You go first.

292
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You go first.

293
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You go first.

294
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's too close to my house.

295
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You go first.

296
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
My mom will be back soon.

297
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
What does it mean?

298
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I miss you.

299
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I miss you.

300
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I miss you.

301
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I miss you.

302
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I miss you.

303
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I miss you.

304
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I miss you.

305
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I miss you.

306
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I miss you.

307
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I miss you.

308
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I miss you.

309
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I miss you.

310
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I miss you.

311
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I miss you.

312
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I miss you.

313
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I miss you.

314
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I miss you.

315
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I miss you.

316
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I miss you.

317
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I miss you.

318
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I miss you.

319
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I miss you.

320
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I miss you.

321
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I miss you.

322
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I miss you.

323
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I miss you.

324
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I miss you.

325
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I miss you.

326
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I miss you.

327
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I miss you.

328
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I miss you so.

329
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I miss you so.

330
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I miss you.

331
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I miss you.

332
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I miss you so.

333
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I miss you.

334
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I miss you.

335
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I miss you so.

336
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
hopefully

337
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
you remember all of these.

338
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
How are you doing?

339
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I feel a little lonely

340
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
so I adjust my emotions.

341
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
essential

342
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
am I the only person

343
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
who can take care of you

344
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Am I the only one?

345
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What's wrong?

346
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Look at you, you're so weak.

347
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Move aside.

348
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You!

349
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Awesome!

350
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm so happy.

351
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Do you want some instant noodles?

352
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Zhao Ye, don't say that.

353
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm so happy.

354
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm so happy.

355
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
What's this?

356
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
What's this?

357
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's so cool.

358
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You're wearing this?

359
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Leave it.

360
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You must be a girl.

361
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You're so hardworking.

362
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's none of your business.

363
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I gave it to her. What's wrong?

364
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
She gave it to me.

365
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You gave it to her?

366
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
What do you mean?

367
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Why did you give her this?

368
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Why didn't you give it to me?

369
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
One for each person.

370
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You choose first.

371
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'll take it.

372
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'll take it.

373
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'll take it.

374
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'm so unlucky.

375
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I spent one month without spending money.

376
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I think it's cute.

377
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
But you should get it back.

378
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Don't mention me.

379
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I have something to do.

380
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I want to have a look.

381
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Let's go back.

382
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Why did you go to Chen Xun's hand?

383
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Are you two...

384
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
No.

385
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Why are you so nervous?

386
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I won't grab it from you.

387
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
No, I...

388
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Alright, I'll tell you a secret.

389
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'll tell you

390
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
who I like.

391
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Who?

392
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Sit.

393
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Tell me how you two got together.

394
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Just...

395
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Just us two.

396
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
No. I need to hear the details.

397
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Who told you two to be together?

398
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
He told me first.

399
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I knew it.

400
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Tell me more.

401
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Did he say

402
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
that he likes you

403
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
or that he loves you?

404
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Or did he say

405
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
that he likes me?

406
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
What about you?

407
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Why do you like Chen Xun?

408
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Don't talk about me.

409
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What's this?

410
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Take a look.

411
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You even know the name of Su Ka's classmate?

412
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Who am I?

413
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I never play the game of not preparing.

414
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Did he prepare this too?

415
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
This...

416
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's a mistake.

417
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
But...

418
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
What's the use of knowing his classmate's name?

419
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Of course it's useful.

420
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Only if you know the name of the person who is the most important to you.

421
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I know.

422
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I know.

423
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I know.

424
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I know.

425
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I know.

426
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I know.

427
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I know.

428
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Only by knowing the past of a person

429
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
can you grasp his future tightly.

430
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm here.

431
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Does Jia Mao know?

432
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You told her?

433
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
She guessed it herself.

434
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
That's great.

435
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm so bored.

436
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Be quiet.

437
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Yes, madam.

438
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm going back.

439
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Yes, madam.

440
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Come again.

441
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Bye.

442
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Bye.

443
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm going back.

444
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Bye.

445
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Bye.

446
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Bye.

447
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Bye.

448
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Bye.

449
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Bye.

450
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Bye.

451
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Bye.

452
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Bye.

453
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Bye.

454
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Bye.

455
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Bye.

456
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Bye.

457
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Bye.

458
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Bye.

459
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Bye.

460
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Bye.

461
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Bye.

462
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Bye.

463
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Bye.

464
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Bye.

465
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Bye.

466
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Bye.

467
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Bye.

468
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Bye.

469
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Bye.

470
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Bye.

471
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Bye.

472
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Bye.

473
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Bye.

474
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Bye.

475
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Bye.

476
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Bye.

477
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Bye.

478
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Bye.

479
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Bye.

480
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Bye.

481
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Bye.

482
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Bye.

483
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Bye.

484
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Bye.

485
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Bye.

486
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Bye.

487
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Bye.

488
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Bye.

489
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Bye.

490
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Bye.

491
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Bye.

492
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Bye.

493
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Bye.

494
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Bye.

495
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Bye.

496
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Bye.

497
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Bye.

498
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Bye.

499
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Bye.

500
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Bye.

501
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Bye.

502
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Bye.

503
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Bye.

504
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Bye.

505
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Bye.

506
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Bye.

507
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Bye.

508
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Bye.

509
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Bye.

510
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Bye.

511
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Bye.

512
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Bye.

513
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Bye.

514
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Bye.

515
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Bye.

516
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Bye.

517
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Bye.

518
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Bye.

519
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Bye.

520
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Bye.

521
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Bye.

522
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Bye.

523
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Bye.

524
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Bye.

525
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Bye.

526
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Bye.

527
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Bye.

528
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Bye.

529
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Here.

530
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Here's your ticket.

531
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Thank you.

532
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Why did you change your style?

533
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
This girl looks so sad.

534
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I was just thinking about something.

535
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
If you have any problem,

536
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
just tell me.

537
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
If a friend of yours

538
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
did something really bad,

539
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
would you still treat him as a friend?

540
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It depends on who it is.

541
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Some people in my heart,

542
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
no matter what they do,

543
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
they should always be friends.

544
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Let's go.

545
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Good girl.

546
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You're like a detective.

547
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
You're so good at reading cards.

548
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
But you're so bad at finding out.

549
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I think

550
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
he already knows.

551
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Or he would have answered my question

552
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
so seriously.

553
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
So he deliberately told me.

554
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You mean he knows you?

555
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
What do you think?

556
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Or why did he remember my name

557
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
when he first met me?

558
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Okay, that's enough.

559
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Let's call it a day.

560
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Let's go.

561
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Don't drink too much.

562
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Senior.

563
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Senior.

564
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Senior.

565
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Senior.

566
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Thank you.

567
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
How do you know I like red beans?

568
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Gao Yiyi gave it to you.

569
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Gao Yiyi?

570
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Just a girl.

571
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Then help me thank her.

572
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Don't leave in a hurry.

573
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:54,200
I'll treat you to egg

574
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Captain.

575
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You...

576
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Bei Bing, you too.

577
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Bei Bing, captain.

578
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Jiemu.

579
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Why did Su Kai

580
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
ask me to buy a bag?

581
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I don't know.

582
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Me too.

583
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
At least he likes to talk to me.

584
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
How does it feel to be in love?

585
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
What feeling?

586
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
How can it be nothing?

587
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
When I think of Su Kai

588
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
being in love with me,

589
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
my heart is so happy.

590
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's like seeing flowers.

591
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
The heart is so happy.

592
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You're right.

593
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
A good girl.

594
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Look.

595
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
See?

596
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
SK.

597
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
SK is Su Kai.

598
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It's true.

599
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It's true.

600
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
We're so destined.

601
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
See if there's more.

602
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Help me find it.

603
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I'm here.

604
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Long time no see.

605
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Did you receive the message

606
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I gave you a few days ago?

607
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
What do you want?

608
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
What do you want?

609
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
What are you doing?

610
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
None of your business.

611
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Get out.

612
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Do you hear me?

613
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
What's going on?

614
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Why don't you call for help?

615
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'm fine.

616
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
What's going on?

617
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I don't know.

618
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
If they come to you again,

619
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
just tell me.

620
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
What are you going to do?

621
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Who bullied you?

622
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You can't kill them.

623
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Don't do this.

624
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
If you do this,

625
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
we won't be together.

626
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
What's going on?

627
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Can you stop asking?

628
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
This has nothing to do with you.

629
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
How does it have nothing to do with me?

630
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
You're my girlfriend.

631
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Your business is my business.

632
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I just want to care about you.

633
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I want to know everything about you.

634
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
What's going on now,

635
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
what happened in the past.

636
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I want to know you.

637
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Is the past that important?

638
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I want to know you.

639
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I want to know you.

640
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Please call 52446.

641
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Gao Yiyi.

642
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Liu Yan.

643
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Su Kai.

644
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
520.

645
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Please call me three times.

646
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Thank you.

647
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Who is Gao Yiyi?

648
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Gao Yiyi is me.

649
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Gao Yiyi.

650
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Do you understand?

651
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I'm a friend.

652
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Pretend to be a friend.

653
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It's magic.

654
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I'm sweating.

655
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Next one.

656
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Next one.

657
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Childhood chase.

658
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I want to know the past and my parents.

659
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Come on.

660
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Come on.

661
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Who do you want to pick up?

662
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I want to ask you two a question.

663
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
You said

664
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
if the relationship between the two of them is good,

665
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
do you have the right to know the past of each other?

666
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
What kind of question is this?

667
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
No, you just answer me.

668
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I think the present is more important.

669
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
What do you think?

670
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I think what is the past now?

671
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I think the person is the most important.

672
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I asked Ye to come here.

673
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
It's the same.

674
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
It's the same.

675
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
It's the same.

676
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
What do you think?

677
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I think if these two people trust each other,

678
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
they should tell each other everything.

679
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I think

680
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
if the relationship between the two of them is good,

681
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
do you have the right to know the past of each other?

682
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I think

683
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
if the relationship between the two of them is good,

684
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
do you have the right to know the past of each other?

685
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I think

686
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
if the relationship between the two of them is good,

687
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
do you have the right to know the past of each other?

688
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I think

689
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
if the relationship between the two of them is good,

690
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
do you have the right to know the past of each other?

691
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I think

692
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
if the relationship between the two of them is good,

693
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
do you have the right to know the past of each other?

694
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I think

695
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
if the relationship between the two of them is good,

696
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
back straight back all right

697
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Do you hear me?

698
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Back street boy's everybody.

699
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
It's so good.

700
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Do you have to be so retro?

701
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Zhang Guo has passed the test.

702
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I just like him.

703
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Listen to the back street.

704
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
You must like him.

705
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I don't like my own boy.

706
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
How about this?

707
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Look, who is handsome?

708
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Zhang GuoLong.

709
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Zhang GuoLong,

710
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
it's good that you like the back street.

711
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
We don't have to be the same.

712
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Of course we are the same.

713
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
We are good friends.

714
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Good friends should listen to the same song,

715
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
wear the same clothes, eat the same things,

716
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
and read the same books.

717
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Zhang GuoLong is so handsome.

718
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I think

719
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
everyone can have their own choice.

720
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
How about this?

721
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I will buy this purple belt

722
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
and give it to you.

723
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Okay?

724
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
No, I really don't need it.

725
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
It's okay, don't buy it.

726
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Zhang Guo, don't buy it.

727
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I bought it for you.

728
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
You can listen to it at home.

729
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Listen to it carefully.

730
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Why is this so?

731
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
You don't take me as a friend.

732
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Zhang Guo.

733
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I'm sorry.

734
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I'm sorry.

735
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I'm sorry.

736
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I'm sorry.

737
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I'm sorry.

738
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I'm sorry.

739
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I'm sorry.

740
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I'm sorry.

741
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I'm sorry.

742
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I'm sorry.

743
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I'm sorry.

744
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I'm sorry.

745
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I'm sorry.

746
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I'm sorry.

747
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I'm sorry.

748
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I'm sorry.

749
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I'm sorry.

750
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I'm sorry.

751
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I'm sorry.

752
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I'm sorry.

753
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I'm sorry.

754
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I'm sorry.

755
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I'm sorry.

756
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I'm sorry.

757
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I'm sorry.

758
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I'm sorry.

759
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I'm sorry.

760
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I'm sorry.

761
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I'm sorry.

762
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Did you quarrel with Jia Mo?

763
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Do you think I'm a particularly difficult person to get along with?

764
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
No.

765
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Jia Mo is so cheerful.

766
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I can't get along with him.

767
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I must have a problem.

768
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Don't talk about everything to yourself.

769
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
There's a little conflict between the girls.

770
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Isn't it normal?

771
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
He said that the things I like are different from what he likes.

772
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
So I'm not friends enough.

773
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
What's the point of saying that?

774
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Zhao Yan likes to play basketball.

775
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Qiao Er likes to read.

776
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I like to listen to music.

777
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Then the three of us are together.

778
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I have nothing to say.

779
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Besides,

780
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
the things we like are not exactly the same.

781
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Aren't we good?

782
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
We are so different.

783
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
What do you like about me?

784
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I like that you're stupid.

785
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
How am I stupid?

786
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
You're still not stupid.

787
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
You suffered and you dare not tell others.

788
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
You were bullied outside the school.

789
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
You dare not resist.

790
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
You can't even faint standing there.

791
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Who's stupid if you're not stupid?

792
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I still have a lot of things I haven't told you.

793
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
If I tell you,

794
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
you won't hate me, right?

795
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I don't hate you.

796
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Because I know

797
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
that one day you will tell me everything.

798
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Maybe.

799
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Enough.

800
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Let's not talk about this unhappy thing.

801
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
In a few days,

802
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I'll take you to see my hair.

803
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Okay.

804
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
But I have to tell you in advance.

805
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
My hair is small.

806
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
My mouth is hard and soft.

807
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I'm a little rough.

808
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
But in fact, people are very righteous.

809
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I know.

810
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Your friend is as good as you.

811
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Little sweet mouth.

812
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Look at you.

813
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Look at these people.

814
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
This is not as handsome as me.

815
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
What do you know?

816
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Look at you.

817
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
You don't want to say a bad word.

818
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
How can you let go of a woman?

819
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
You.

820
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I love gentlemen.

821
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I won't do anything.

822
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Enough.

823
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Calm down.

824
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Actually,

825
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I'm not angry that he doesn't like men in the second class.

826
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I'm angry that he doesn't care about me at all.

827
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I think it's better to be alone.

828
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
You don't have to think so much.

829
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Just think about him.

830
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Really.

831
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
You understand.

832
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Of course.

833
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I'm sorry.

834
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I'm sorry.

835
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I'm sorry.

836
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I'm sorry.

837
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I'm sorry.

838
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I'm sorry.

839
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I'm sorry.

840
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I'm sorry.

841
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I'm sorry.

842
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I'm sorry.

843
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I'm sorry.

844
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I'm sorry.

845
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I'm sorry.

846
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I'm sorry.

847
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I'm sorry.

848
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I'm sorry.

849
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I'm sorry.

850
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I'm sorry.

851
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I'm sorry.

852
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I'm sorry.

853
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I'm sorry.

854
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I'm sorry.

855
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I'm sorry.

856
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I'm sorry.

857
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I'm sorry.

858
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I'm sorry.

859
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I'm sorry.

860
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I'm sorry.

861
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I'm sorry.

862
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I'm sorry.

863
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I'm sorry.

864
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I'm sorry.

865
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I'm sorry.

866
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I'm sorry.

867
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I'm sorry.

868
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I'm sorry.

869
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I'm sorry.

870
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I'm sorry.

871
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I'm sorry.

872
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I'm sorry.

873
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I'm sorry.

874
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I'm sorry.

875
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I'm sorry.

876
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I'm sorry.

877
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I'm sorry.

878
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I'm sorry.

879
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I'm sorry.

880
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I'm sorry.

881
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I'm sorry.

882
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I'm sorry.

883
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I'm sorry.

884
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I'm sorry.

885
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I'm sorry.

886
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I'm sorry.

887
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I'm sorry.

888
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I'm sorry.

889
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I'm sorry.

890
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,040
I'm sorry.

891
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,040
I'm sorry.

892
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,920
I don't care who you are

893
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,320
Where you are from

894
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,560
What you do

895
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,280
As long as you love me

896
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,920
Friends who dare to argue are good friends

897
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,560
The one who can't be separated is the real friend.

898
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,600
We, who are 16 years old,

899
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:35,000
will be seriously and vigorously arguing over a small matter.

900
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,200
We will also be by each other's side when we need each other.

901
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,400
We will never leave.

902
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,000
Oh my god.

903
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,680
This is too expensive.

904
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,160
Yes.

905
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,960
But I want to buy Chen Xun something that he likes.

906
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,640
Boss.

907
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,040
Are you Chen Xun's little girlfriend?

908
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,760
I...

909
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,240
No.

910
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,440
Then why are you so shy? I'm not your teacher.

911
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,080
What do you plan to buy today?

912
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,680
Boss, he wants to pick a gift for Chen Xun.

913
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,120
Don't be too expensive.

914
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,920
Buy this.

915
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:32,200
I think this Chen Xun can be used for a lot of things.

916
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:32,960
It's not too expensive.

917
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,080
What is this?

918
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,000
This is a violin used to play the guitar.

919
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,360
He's learning how to play the guitar.

920
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,320
I think this is a good gift for him.

921
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,600
Let me show you.

922
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,640
How many people in your school?

923
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,880
Which school are they from?

924
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,160
There are four of us.

925
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,040
We grew up in the same school yard.

926
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,520
Their education is not very good.

927
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,000
So some of them are in the school of engineering,

928
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,520
some of them are in the college of finance.

929
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,360
You guys are very close, right?

930
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,680
Not bad.

931
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,480
Anyway, everyone is very caring.

932
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,280
Especially Tang, he's like my big brother.

933
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,880
He's very kind.

934
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,200
Can you move a little bit?

935
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,400
That's right.

936
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,520
It's my turn.

937
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,560
You hit it.

938
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,800
Why are you hitting it?

939
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,400
You're so good.

940
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,160
Tang, look.

941
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,640
Look at who's here.

942
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,040
Look.

943
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,040
Hurry, happy birthday.

944
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,720
Yes, happy birthday.

945
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,320
Can you be a little more sincere?

946
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,360
Your hair is very hot.

947
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,280
Where is it hot?

948
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,400
It's like you're breaking up with Old Yu.

949
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,960
Nonsense.

950
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,080
Your girlfriend is very good.

951
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,160
You're so good.

952
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,280
You're so good.

953
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,480
You're so good.

954
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,440
You're so good.

955
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,440
You're so good.

956
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,520
Your girlfriend?

957
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,240
Why don't you introduce yourself?

958
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,400
Yes.

959
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,840
I'll introduce myself.

960
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,800
This is my girlfriend, Fang Hui.

961
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,440
This is Wei Guang, her husband.

962
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,160
Hello.

963
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,840
You're so young.

964
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,720
Are you a junior?

965
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,280
You're the one who's always eating grass.

966
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,560
You're the one who's always eating grass.

967
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,160
Nonsense.

968
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,080
Don't mind it.

969
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,080
We're just talking.

970
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,360
Where's Tang?

971
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,560
Who cares?

972
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,240
Let's eat first.

973
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,240
Yes, let's eat first.

974
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,360
Well, I...

975
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,280
I want three big ones.

976
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,720
I'm not afraid of being fat.

977
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,320
This isn't enough, let me tell you.

978
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,520
I work out every day.

979
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,800
I have to eat less.

980
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,960
You're so handsome.

981
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,960
Enough, you guys.

982
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,560
You're good students.

983
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,080
I want...

984
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,200
What do I let you eat?

985
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,800
What about you, Fang Hui?

986
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,480
I'm fine with everything.

987
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,400
Come on, sit down.

988
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:48,000
You don't know about Chen Xun's childhood, right?

989
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,320
What is it?

990
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,120
You have to tell me about it.

991
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,480
Don't make a scene.

992
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,400
No.

993
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,520
Let's talk about Chen Xun and his dog first.

994
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,840
What?

995
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:02,000
In the mid-80s,

996
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,760
there were many scenes in the Eastern Courtyard of Xicheng.

997
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,800
Be more simple.

998
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,520
You really can't say anything about them.

999
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,320
Okay, okay.

1000
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,800
That...

1001
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,520
The big wolf dog in Zhang's courtyard.

1002
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,960
Do you remember?

1003
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,840
When he was a kid, he was so funny.

1004
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,560
The wolf dog chased him all the way.

1005
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,240
He almost ran away.

1006
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,240
Chen Xun.

1007
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,320
Boss.

1008
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,360
You're good.

1009
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,840
You have a girlfriend.

1010
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,560
You know her?

1011
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,360
Admit it.

1012
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:26,800
What?

1013
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,400
Introduce yourself.

1014
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,240
This is Tang.

1015
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,800
This is my girlfriend, Fang Hui.

1016
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,560
Why are you here?

1017
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,000
You two know each other?

1018
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,760
Chen Xun.

1019
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,800
She's an old friend.

1020
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,400
What are you talking about?

1021
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,520
Did you hear that?

1022
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,480
I told you to get out.

1023
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,840
Can you be polite?

1024
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,200
Fang Hui.

1025
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,960
Come back.

1026
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,920
Are you crazy?

1027
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,080
Why are you looking for such a woman?

1028
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,040
Why are you crazy?

1029
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,840
What's going on?

1030
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,320
This woman

1031
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,120
killed my brother.

1032
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,720
From now on,

1033
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,120
the street is my woman.

1034
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,960
But now,

1035
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,400
it's meaningless.

1036
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,160
Do you like Fang Hui?

1037
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,520
I really don't have any chance with her.

1038
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,960
You can't be with Chen Xun.

1039
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,640
Chen Xun.

1040
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,320
Don't touch me.

1041
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,400
Let me go.

1042
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,320
You can't

1043
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,600
get away with this.

1044
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,520
I'll be with you till the end.

1045
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,320
I think Qiao Shan likes you.

1046
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,520
Fang Hui

1047
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,720
is actually....

1048
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,880
Do you know if tends to waste another day?

1049
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,240
Eating emotions

1050
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,240
She guard anti-n Stars

Growing up my own journey

1056
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:06,920
I've been through one stop, the next stop

1057
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,920
I can't stop

1058
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,920
I keep looking at the sky

1059
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,920
How many obstacles are there

1060
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:26,920
Suddenly look back, look back

1061
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:32,920
I've been through the journey to the horizon

1062
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,920
