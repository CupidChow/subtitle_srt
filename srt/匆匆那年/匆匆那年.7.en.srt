world's thinnest smartphone, E-Life.

00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,360
Stop!

5
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,360
Who are you?

6
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,360
Stop messing around!

7
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,360
Come on!

8
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,360
Fight!

9
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,660
Son of a bitch!

10
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:11,840
How about I kick your ass?

11
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,120
Come on, shoot

12
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,380
Ent People

13
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,020
Not for the People

14
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,680
I 755

15
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,360
I'll never marry, The Open Space

16
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,480
No good TV

17
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,800
How about watching this

18
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,380
Money candyengf всегда

19
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,480
Looked up a hundred times

20
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,620
I can use it without any sentence

21
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm a Enemy

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,800
Bajie

23
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,620
¡ daar

24
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,560
His son's heart rust

25
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,560
Enough, enough, enough

26
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,560
You don't look, you don't look

27
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,560
The problem with the phone is very serious

28
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,560
For example, on the last day of 1999

29
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,560
23 days and 59 minutes

30
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,560
You called for only 3 minutes

31
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,560
But the phone bill shows

32
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,560
You have been calling for 100 years

33
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,560
Less than 3 minutes

34
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,560
Really?

35
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,560
Maybe, we don't have to worry about this

36
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,560
It's the end of the world

37
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,560
We are all game over

38
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,560
Is this the one you said

39
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,560
No, what single word

40
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,560
Nocha Damas prophecy

41
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,560
What's the problem

42
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,560
He said a lot of prophecies have come true

43
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,560
What's the problem

44
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,560
It's all a mess

45
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,560
If there is really a end of the world, what do you want to do

46
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,560
I have to get the final fantasy bar

47
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,560
To get through

48
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,560
You still have the time to play games

49
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,560
It's the end of the world

50
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,560
The end of the world

51
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,560
I'm still a pig

52
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,560
This is not the end of the world

53
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,560
You have to be a pig too

54
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,560
Yes, so don't believe

55
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,560
At this time

56
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,560
Everyone will go with the person you like

57
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,560
You care about to go through

58
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,560
Because it is a very memorable year

59
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,560
Let me show you

60
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,560
These are for elementary school students

61
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,560
These are for my junior high school students

62
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,560
These

63
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,560
Are for teachers

64
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,560
And these are for current students

65
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,560
How did you buy so much

66
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,560
We are celebrating the 1000th anniversary

67
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,560
Of course we have to buy more

68
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,560
We have to spend all the money

69
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,560
Chunhui

70
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,560
This is for you

71
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,560
You take it and give it to Chen Xun

72
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,560
No, no, no, it's too old-fashioned

73
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,560
I'll give him this

74
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,560
No

75
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,560
This is suitable for Qiao Ran

76
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,560
Of course, Chen Xun gives this

77
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,560
Chen Xun gives this

78
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,560
Where to pass by, how good

79
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,560
Do you want to write on the card

80
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,560
Love you until forever

81
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,560
There is no forever

82
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,560
Maybe there is a end of the world

83
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,560
No, no, no, how beautiful life is

84
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,560
What is this end

85
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,560
You two are good

86
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,560
Share the last victory of this century

87
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,560
Just maybe not getting points

88
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,560
That is Li Nanming's word

89
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,560
Ma Na

90
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,560
What's wrong

91
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,560
Are you worried that you won't see me every day

92
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,560
It's okay

93
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,560
I'll pick you up every day after school

94
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,560
No need

95
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,560
You don't need it

96
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,560
You don't let me take you to sleep

97
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,560
What do you want to see

98
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,560
Come and see

99
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,560
There is a scene here

100
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,560
Don't be so rude

101
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,560
There is no way to get a shot

102
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,560
No wonder you are not afraid of the end of the world

103
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,560
You know

104
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,560
No, you all know

105
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,560
You are too honest

106
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,560
You are too ungrateful

107
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,560
No, wait a minute

108
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,560
What are you doing

109
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,560
Zhou Yihan, open it for me

110
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,560
Zhou Yihan, I dare to stop

111
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,560
Still this classic

112
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,560
How many years have you been playing

113
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,560
Yes, when I first played

114
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,560
It's just a second grade

115
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,560
How many times have you passed

116
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,560
Still so classic

117
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,560
I have a question for you

118
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,560
What

119
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,560
How did you catch Fang Guoyue

120
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,560
Say it

121
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,560
Your brain is also working

122
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,560
You say it

123
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,560
You let me calculate

124
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,560
Lin Jia Mo

125
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,560
You, you, you

126
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,560
You, you, you

127
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,560
You, you, you

128
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,560
You, you, you

129
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,560
You, you, you

130
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,560
How do you know

131
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,560
How do I know

132
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,560
Our school even the head of the delivery room has seen

133
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,560
You think

134
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,560
Then you hurry up and pull a friend

135
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,560
Your biggest problem is

136
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,560
Too much talk

137
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,560
I draw

138
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,560
When did I draw

139
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,560
I always draw a simple one

140
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,560
I'll give you four characters

141
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,560
Chen Mo is gold

142
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,560
What do you mean

143
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,560
Who does Lin Jia Mo like

144
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,560
Lin Jia Mo, who does Lin Jia Mo like

145
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,560
Liu Chuanfeng

146
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,560
What's the characteristic of Liu Chuanfeng

147
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,560
What characteristic

148
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,560
Not much talk, he just speaks

149
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,560
Also one word, one word, one word

150
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,560
Use the eyes to kill you, and very cool

151
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,560
Very cool

152
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,560
But Kangkang is also a flower

153
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,560
So what do I like most

154
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,560
You are not right

155
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,560
What are you doing

156
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,560
You

157
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,560
Are you sick

158
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,560
Ye

159
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,560
Ye, Ye, Ye

160
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,560
Zhao Liye

161
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,560
Finally, I'm going to kill Lin Jia Mo

162
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,560
Is he serious

163
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,560
Of course it's serious

164
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,560
Our Zhao Ye is a pure young man

165
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,560
You see

166
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,560
When he was in the first grade

167
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,560
Likes our class Shanshan

168
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,560
When he was in the second grade

169
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,560
Likes the next class, Xiao Xu

170
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,560
Jia Mo will definitely not agree

171
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,560
Why

172
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,560
You guys

173
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,560
Don't you all particularly value

174
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,560
The first girl you like

175
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,560
Is the first love

176
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,560
First love

177
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,560
He can't count

178
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,560
First love

179
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,560
First love is how two people like each other

180
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,560
He doesn't count

181
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,560
Then

182
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,560
Am I your first love

183
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,560
Of course

184
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,560
I before

185
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,560
Have you ever been in love with others

186
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,560
Have

187
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,560
No, no, no

188
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,560
That doesn't count

189
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,560
Who

190
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,560
Wu Ting Ting

191
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,560
Jealous

192
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,560
Don't think too much

193
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,560
I was just a kid

194
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,560
Don't know anything

195
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,560
Do you still like him now

196
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,560
What do you think

197
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,560
I don't have you

198
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,560
Moreover

199
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,560
Actually, Wu Ting Ting's situation

200
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,560
It's quite complicated

201
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,560
She later liked to let us

202
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,560
A little girl called Bai Feng

203
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,560
Not long after

204
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,560
Bai Feng had a car accident

205
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,560
She's gone

206
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,560
So many years, Ting Ting has no one else

207
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,560
So it's like this

208
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,560
She's pretty pitiful

209
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,560
So I'm particularly worried

210
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,560
I feel quite unaware

211
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,560
Because of a white wind

212
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,560
Changed her own life trajectory

213
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,560
Actually, I understand her

214
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,560
It's the same, it's extreme

215
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,560
Like a person

216
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,560
Either 100%

217
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,560
Or 0%

218
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,560
Why are you all so competitive

219
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,560
You said this person is gone

220
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,560
What's the point of waiting

221
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,560
Some things

222
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,560
Maybe it's meaningless to you

223
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,560
It's not necessarily for others

224
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,560
Go back to your class

225
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,560
To prepare for the next cell division

226
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,560
Class is over

227
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,560
I'm leaving

228
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,560
Bye

229
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,560
I'm leaving

230
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,560
I'm coming

231
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,560
What do you mean

232
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,560
You know it in your heart

233
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,560
What are you doing

234
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,560
You're already in the shot

235
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,560
Can't you see that Fang Hui is like this

236
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,560
What's wrong with me

237
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,560
Did you find someone to hide from us

238
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,560
Keep your voice down

239
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,560
If I did this

240
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,560
I'm Sun Tao's grandson

241
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,560
You're going to get a brain injury

242
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,560
I don't have to be with you

243
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,560
I tell you, I'm afraid of Fang Hui

244
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,560
You two don't worry about me

245
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,560
Enough

246
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,560
White wind's grandpa is still lying

247
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,560
Is the family here

248
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,560
Who are you three

249
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,560
The patient is still stable

250
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,560
Hello

251
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,560
Hello

252
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,560
Is Chen Xun here

253
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,560
I didn't have anything to do last night

254
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,560
I couldn't pick you up

255
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,560
I'm sorry

256
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,560
I'm sorry

257
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,560
I'll call your home

258
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,560
Your dad said you're not here

259
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,560
I that

260
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,560
Chen Xun

261
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,560
You're a loser

262
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,560
I didn't know where the medicine was last night

263
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,560
I said I was looking for it

264
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,560
I put it here

265
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,560
We have to go tonight

266
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,560
The doctor said

267
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,560
Someone has to keep an eye on it for 24 hours

268
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,560
Tang's been sick all night

269
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,560
Let's go to him tonight

270
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,560
Okay, no problem

271
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,560
I'll wait for you

272
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,560
White wind's grandpa is in the hospital

273
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,560
We'll take care of him

274
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,560
Don't think too much

275
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,560
I'll call you when you're done

276
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,560
Okay?

277
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,560
Let's continue with the last class

278
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,560
The reason for the diversification of the protein structure

279
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,560
Fenghui

280
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,560
Fenghui

281
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,560
Fenghui

282
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,560
The long-term malnutrition

283
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,560
Reduces the protein in the blood

284
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,560
What causes the diversification of the protein structure?

285
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,560
I don't know

286
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,560
You don't even know such a simple question

287
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,560
How did you do yesterday's class?

288
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,560
Sit down

289
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,560
Students

290
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,560
You came out on behalf of your own school

291
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,560
Don't disgrace your own school

292
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,560
Let's continue with the class

293
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,560
Let's continue with the class

294
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,560
Don't worry

295
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,560
Old man is in good health

296
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,560
He'll be fine

297
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,560
No matter how good

298
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,560
You're over eighty years old

299
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,560
Do you know

300
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,560
Why I care so much about white wind's grandpa?

301
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,560
Because

302
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,560
He's the one who

303
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,560
Is the last connection between me and white wind in this world
