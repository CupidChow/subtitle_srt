00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
This show is sponsored by the world's thinnest smartphone, E-Life.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,520
The American expert in covering up the problem, Di Qiao.

3
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,600
They're all hiding from you.

4
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,800
You're still so hot-tempered.

5
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,360
Don't meddle in my business.

6
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,600
I don't have time or time to know you.

7
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,600
Goodbye.

8
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,080
Don't look for that person.

9
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm working here.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,520
Your clothes are on fire.

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,160
They say it's a fire from the piano room.

12
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,160
Really?

13
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,800
You're so careless.

14
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
Jia Mu.

15
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,400
I'm afraid I can't go with you to find Zhao Ye these days.

16
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,200
How is he?

17
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,200
Any news?

18
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,000
I know a news.

19
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,400
But I don't have the courage to go find him.

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Why?

21
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,400
I just like to think about it.

22
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,600
Actually, it's nothing.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Oh, right.

24
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,600
Your foot is like this.

25
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,600
Where's Chen Xun?

26
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,000
Ask him to go to the hospital with you.

27
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,000
You two had a fight again, right?

28
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,000
I think...

29
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,400
We're going to be separated.

30
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,400
I am Chen Yi.

31
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Come in.

32
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,600
No, I'm not.

33
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,600
What's wrong?

34
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,400
Can you speak Chinese?

35
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,400
I...

36
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,600
I'm going to wash the dishes.

37
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,400
I'm going to go.

38
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,400
Hello, Jia Mu.

39
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,200
What did you say?

40
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,200
Slow down.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,200
How did you do that?

42
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,800
Why didn't you tell me?

43
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,200
I called you.

44
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,200
I saw you got a call.

45
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,200
No one answered the call.

46
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,800
Then it was turned off.

47
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,200
No power.

48
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,200
The car is here.

49
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,200
I'm leaving.

50
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,000
I'll call you tonight.

51
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,800
Actually, that day,

52
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,200
you can call me in the dorm.

53
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,600
Don't you know that Fang Hui is cheating on you?

54
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,200
Are you her boyfriend?

55
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,000
She didn't tell me.

56
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,800
She didn't tell you? Then why didn't you ask?

57
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,400
What's wrong with you two?

58
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,200
I don't know.

59
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,000
What do you mean you don't know?

60
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,200
Fang Hui told me that you two were going to be separated.

61
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,600
She wouldn't say that without any reason.

62
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,200
I'm telling you,

63
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,600
as long as you dare to bully Fang Hui, you have to be sorry to her.

64
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,200
I'm the first one to break up with you.

65
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:30,000
I agree with this idea.

66
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,400
In my life, I...

67
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,200
Mr. Shen,

68
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,000
I want to talk to you.

69
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You can go to the other room.

70
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Today,

71
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,800
I want to play the guitar like a guitarist.

72
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,200
I'm going to the other room.

74
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,200
The first.

75
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,200
The second.

76
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,200
The third.

77
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,200
The fourth.

78
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,200
The fifth.

79
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,200
The sixth.

80
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,200
The seventh.

81
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,200
The eighth.

82
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,200
The ninth.

83
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,200
The tenth.

84
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,200
The ninth.

85
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,200
Let's go

86
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,200
Let's go

87
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,200
No problem

88
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,200
Thank you

89
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,200
Bye

90
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,200
I want some songs

91
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,200
I'm Nega is from the northeast

92
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,200
I'm Nega is a high-class tourist

93
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,200
Change

94
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,200
I have a little cat green

95
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,200
I never get up

96
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,200
One day I'm so tired

97
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,200
I'm going to the dry chicken

98
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,200
I'm holding a little skin in my hand

99
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,200
I'm so happy

100
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,200
Little cat green

101
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,200
Can you sing

102
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:19,200
I want to take you to fly

103
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:29,200
I want to take you to fly

104
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,200
Walk around the world

105
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,200
Go to the top

106
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,200
Go to the top

107
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,200
No worries

108
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,200
No sadness

109
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,200
Freedom

110
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,200
Freedom

111
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,200
How open-minded

112
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,200
Forget the pain

113
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,200
Forget that one

114
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,200
No worries

115
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,200
Freedom

116
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,200
Let's go

117
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:39,200
Look, this world is not so cold

118
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:45,200
We are going to fly far away

119
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:54,200
Look, this world is still a piece of light

120
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
Zhao Yi

121
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
Zhao Yi

122
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,200
You, you work here?

123
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,200
I've been looking for you everywhere, I finally found you

124
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,200
Why didn't you tell us when you came out?

125
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,200
You don't want to see us?

126
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,200
No, I'm busy

127
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,200
I'm thinking of going to see you later

128
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,200
You are very busy going to college, right?

129
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
Let go

130
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,200
What? Where are you going?

131
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,200
I'm taking you to see everyone

132
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,200
Don't make a fuss, I'm still working

133
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,200
Do you have time?

134
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,200
Zhao Yi

135
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,200
I'm not kidding with you, next time

136
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,200
When is next time?

137
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,200
Let's talk later

138
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,200
Wait a minute

139
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,200
I'll go to the dorm

140
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,200
This is my school address

141
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,200
And my dorm's phone number

142
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,200
Take it

143
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,200
Zhao Yi

144
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,200
Does it still hurt?

145
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,200
It doesn't hurt

146
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,200
Why is he so careless?

147
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,200
Hui Hui

148
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,200
Hui Hui

149
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,200
What's wrong with your foot?

150
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,200
Come, let's take a look

151
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,200
Hui Hui

152
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,200
Fang Hui, who is that?

153
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,200
What are you doing?

154
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,200
Are you stupid?

155
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,200
Are you stupid?

156
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,200
Nothing

157
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,200
Do you know the popular garden in Jinbo?

158
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,200
The closer you get, the more lively it is

159
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,200
How much is the garden?

160
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,200
Our dorm is now a set of VCDs

161
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,200
And everyone must choose one from F4

162
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
Do you know who I like the most?

163
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
Daoming Temple

164
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,200
But Hua Zelei is also very handsome

165
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,200
I went to Ma Zhe's class this morning

166
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,200
Ma Zhe's class

167
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,200
It's that Ma Zhe

168
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,200
He was very funny this morning

169
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,200
He didn't know if he was asleep or what

170
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,200
He wore two different colored socks

171
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,200
Do you know?

172
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,200
And the whole class laughed

173
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,200
He doesn't know why

174
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,200
He was very confused on stage

175
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,200
Eat quickly

176
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,200
Eat

177
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,200
I can go to the sun every day

178
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,200
Put my things on the ground

179
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,200
And sing the old times

180
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,200
At that time, I didn't have long hair

181
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,200
At that time, my eyes were light blue

182
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,200
In my heart, there is a paradise you think of

183
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:51,200
And my most beloved girl

184
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,200
How do you know this song?

185
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,200
I learned it when you sang it by the lake that day

186
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,200
What?

187
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,200
I shook you?

188
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,200
By the way, I don't know a few Chinese songs

189
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,200
Teach me

190
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,200
I hope this song

191
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,200
Are you okay?

192
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,200
I'm fine

193
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,200
Really fine

194
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,200
Zheng Jun

195
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,200
It's late

196
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,200
Let's go back first

197
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,200
Bye

198
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,200
Bye

199
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,200
What?

200
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,200
I just want to ask you

201
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,200
Is our singer contest next Saturday?

202
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,200
Yes

203
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,200
You forgot all this

204
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,200
No, I just

205
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,200
I can't remember

206
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,200
You go back first

207
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,200
Bye

208
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,200
Bye

209
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,200
Chen Xun

210
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,200
Chen Xun

211
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,200
I can't live in the world

212
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,200
I can't live in the world

213
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,200
It's so rare

214
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,200
Is that Shen Xiaotang?

215
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,200
Chen Xun

216
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,200
Chen Xun

217
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,200
Do you like Shen Xiaotang?

218
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,200
What about Fang Hui?

219
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,200
I will talk to her clearly

220
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,200
Have you ever thought about her feelings?

221
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,200
Do you think

222
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,200
I'm a little bit better now?

223
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,200
Chen Xun

224
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,200
Have you forgotten?

225
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,200
Have you forgotten?

226
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,200
The words you engraved on the book

227
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,200
We will never be separated

228
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,200
Have you forgotten?

229
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,200
You promised Fang Hui

230
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,200
You have to take good care of her

231
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,200
You not only sorry to Fang Hui

232
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,200
You also sorry to Qiao Ran

233
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,200
Sorry to Zhao Ye

234
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,200
Sorry to me

235
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,200
You just because of Shen Xiaotang

236
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,200
You abandoned all of us

237
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,200
Sorry

238
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,200
I let you down

239
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,200
Don't tell Fang Hui

240
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,200
I will talk to her clearly

241
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
Chen Xun

242
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,200
You are a

243
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,200
a complete loser

244
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,200
You are a complete loser

245
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,200
A complete loser

246
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,200
This painting

247
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,200
You especially painted for dad

248
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,200
Do you still remember it?

249
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,200
So many years

250
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,200
I have been bringing him around

251
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,200
I haven't seen him for so many years

252
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,200
I have always been bringing him around

253
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,200
You haven't met him

254
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,200
You still remember

255
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,200
You still remember

256
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,200
You still remember

257
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,200
You still remember

258
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,200
You still remember

259
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,200
You've become a big girl.

260
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,600
How was it in school?

261
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,600
Did you get along well with your classmates?

262
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,300
Was the money enough?

263
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,300
It was enough.

264
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,300
A few days later,

265
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I'm going to Australia.

266
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,600
Before I leave,

267
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I really want to see you.

268
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,200
This time,

269
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,200
I don't know how long it will take to see you again.

270
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,200
I want to take you to the park to play for a day.

271
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,200
Just like when you were little,

272
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,200
you liked the horse-drawn tour the most.

273
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,200
Why did you come back after saying you were leaving?

274
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,200
Why didn't you have any news when you left?

275
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,200
Where did you go?

276
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,200
Why didn't you want me?

277
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,200
What about Haolai?

278
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,200
I didn't go.

279
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,200
Why?

280
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,200
Because I don't want those warm scenes

281
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,200
to become sad memories in the future.

282
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,200
Have you forgiven him?

283
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,200
I don't know.

284
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,200
I just feel

285
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,200
that when dad is old,

286
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
he looks so fragile.

287
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,200
Maybe back then,

288
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,200
he was also very anxious.

289
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,200
In the end,

290
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,200
one person leaving another person

291
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,200
is because he doesn't love enough.

292
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,200
If he regrets it in the future,

293
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,200
it's too late.

294
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,200
Hey, the camera!

295
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,200
There's no meat and milk.

296
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,200
Let's go and have a look.

297
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,200
Let's go.

298
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,200
Excuse me,

299
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,200
where is the girl's dorm?

300
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,200
Go to the left turn.

301
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,200
Go to the left turn.

302
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,200
Yes.

303
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,200
Okay, thank you.

304
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,200
You're welcome.

305
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,200
The light is shining!

306
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,200
Good!

307
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,200
Lu Jia Mo,

308
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,200
I want to tell you

309
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,200
that the roses in the area

310
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,200
are all the same in my eyes.

311
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,200
Only this jasmine

312
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,200
can represent my love for you.

313
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,200
I...

314
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,200
I'm really touched.

315
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,200
Thank you.

316
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,200
But...

317
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,200
my heart

318
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,200
can't move anymore.

319
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,200
What's wrong with me?

320
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,200
Nothing wrong with you.

321
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,200
You're just late.

322
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,200
I'm sorry.

323
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,200
No need to apologize.

324
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,200
I understand.

325
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,200
In love,

326
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,200
there are first come, first served.

327
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,200
The late is born with mistakes.

328
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,200
But...

329
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,200
the flowers are still yours.

330
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,200
There's another saying.

331
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,200
It's called,

332
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,200
the king comes later.

333
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,200
Here.

334
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,200
Here.

335
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,200
Boss.

336
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,200
Do you have a crush on someone?

337
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,200
I...

338
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,200
I haven't thought about it.

339
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,200
What if you really like someone?

340
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,200
I do like someone.

341
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,200
But...

342
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,200
I don't think I'll fall in love.

343
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,200
But if you like someone,

344
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,200
you should want to be with her.

345
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,200
I want to,

346
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,200
but I have to do it.

347
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,200
You can't control your heart.

348
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,200
But you can control your brain.

349
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,200
I seem to be a brainless person.

350
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,200
The first question is done.

351
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,200
Don't think about the right or wrong anymore.

352
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,200
Let's do the last question.

353
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,200
I love you.

354
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,200
I love you.

355
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,200
I love you.

356
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,000
Li Jing, please stability.

357
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,640
Chen Xu!

358
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,960
Which song are you going to sing?

359
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,760
Xu, it's time for the next show.

360
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,760
Get ready.

361
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,000
Wait.

362
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,080
That song,

363
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,440
From that day on,

364
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,520
you wrote it for Fang Hui, right?

365
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,440
Can I sing this song with you?

366
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,120
Why?

367
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,720
Shan Xun,

368
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,560
in this matter,

369
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,680
if there must be a bad person,

370
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,160
I hope I can be the bad person.

371
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,760
If there must be any consequence,

372
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,120
I hope I can take the responsibility.

373
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,200
Is that okay?

374
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:12,840
Yes.

375
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,960
Now, please listen to

376
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,560
Chen Xun's guitar playing.

377
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,640
It's called,

378
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,360
Cong Cong Na.

379
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,960
Good.

380
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,160
I hope I can have

381
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,000
a bright landing bed

382
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,680
and sunbathe every day.

383
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:38,280
Put all my things on the ground

384
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:42,080
and sing the old times.

385
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,600
My hair is not long anymore.

386
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,200
My eyes are bright and clear.

387
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,960
I have an ideal heaven in my heart.

388
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:58,280
And the girl I love most.

389
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,680
I hope you and I

390
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:07,280
can be kind to each other.

391
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,120
Give you a pure heart,

392
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,240
give me a pure appearance.

393
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,400
And go back to them.

394
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:21,880
I hope you can sing this song with me.

395
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,560
With your story and beautiful fantasy,

396
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:31,800
go back to the time of Cong Cong Na.

397
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,080
One song.

398
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,880
One more!

399
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,880
Left, right, right, left, turn around, go, go, go.

400
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,880
I asked you a question.

401
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,640
You only need to answer.

402
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,440
Yes or no.

403
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,040
I'm not going to answer.

404
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,040
I'm going to answer.

405
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,040
I'm going to answer.

406
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,040
I'm going to answer.

407
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,040
I'm going to answer.

408
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,040
I'm going to answer.

409
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,040
Say it.

410
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,040
Do you like Shen Xiaotang?

411
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,040
Yes.

412
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,040
Okay.

413
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,040
Chen Xu, you remember.

414
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:33,040
That was the last few minutes you were with me.

415
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,040
From now on,

416
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,040
I'm not your girlfriend.

417
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,040
We...

418
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,040
broke up.

419
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,040
I'm sorry.

420
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,040
The number you have dialed is not available.

421
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,040
Sorry.

422
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,040
Fang Hui,

423
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,040
let us kiss tomorrow.

424
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,040
Fang Hui.

425
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,040
The number you have dialed is not available.

426
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,040
I want to give this song to my favorite

427
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,040
Fang Hui.

428
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:58,040
Would you like to be crazy with me for the rest of your life?

429
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,040
I would.

430
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,040
Fang Hui.

431
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,040
I don't think you're married yet.

432
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,040
You know that.

433
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,040
It must be you.

434
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,040
Yes.

435
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,040
Yes.

436
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,040
I'm Chen Xue.

437
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,040
I'm the best.

438
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,040
I'm the best.

439
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,040
I'm the best.

440
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,040
My love song is lost.

441
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,040
I won't let you lose it.

442
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,040
Zhang Hui.

443
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,040
Fang Hui.

444
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:00,040
This class is called Blue Sky.

445
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,040
I want to know who went home yesterday.

446
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,040
I saw it.

447
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,040
I saw it.

448
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,040
I saw it.

449
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,040
Yes.

450
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,040
It's not fake.

451
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,040
It's just a problem.

452
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:24,040
I hope we can be as kind as children.

453
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,040
Give you a pure heart.

454
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,040
Give me a pure look.

455
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:32,040
And return to their deep hole.

456
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:39,040
I hope you can sing this song with me.

457
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,040
With the story of life and the beautiful fantasy.

458
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:48,040
Back to the time when we were young.

459
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:04,040
I hope we can walk to the end of the road for you.

460
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:08,040
We can go to the sun and rain every day.

461
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:12,040
We can go to the end of the road to see the sun.

462
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:16,040
And remember the old times.

463
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:20,040
The beautiful face in the breeze.

464
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,040
The beauty is your smile.

465
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,040
There are many things to tell me.

466
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:32,040
I hope time can stop here.

467
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,040
I finally found you.

468
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,040
Why are you here?

469
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,040
Sit on the ground.

470
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,040
Get up.

471
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,040
Get up, okay?

472
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,040
Get up.

473
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,040
Hello.

474
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,040
I still love him.

475
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:54,040
But why doesn't he love me?

476
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,040
Get up.

477
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,040
I still love him.

478
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:04,040
But why doesn't he love me?

479
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,040
Get up.

480
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,040
Get up.

481
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,040
He has changed.

482
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,040
People change.

483
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:24,040
I haven't changed.

484
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:28,040
Why did he change?

485
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:35,040
Let me show you the short message he sent me.

486
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:41,040
He said he would never say sorry to me.

487
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,040
Why did he say so much?

488
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,040
He is not Chen Xun.

489
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,040
He won't do that.

490
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,040
Where did he go?

491
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,040
Tell me where he went.

492
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,040
Fang Hui.

493
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:59,040
Don't you know?

494
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:04,040
Chen Xun is not the same as he is now.

495
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,040
You are you from now on.

496
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,040
Chen Xun is Chen Xun.

497
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:12,040
You are no longer related.

498
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,040
We are not related.

499
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,040
So good.

500
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,040
So clean.

501
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:40,040
When a boy made a vow,

502
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:45,040
he felt he wouldn't betray his promise.

503
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,040
When he regretted it,

504
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:52,040
he felt he couldn't do it.

505
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:56,040
So the vow

506
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,040
could not be measured.

507
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,040
A vow

508
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,040
can't be measured.

509
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,040
It can't be judged.

510
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,040
It can only prove

511
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,040
that they were true

512
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:17,040
when they made a vow.

513
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,040
When did they make a vow?

514
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,040
So strange.

515
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,040
It's been a long time.

516
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,040
I've seen them more than once.

517
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,040
They are together.

518
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,040
Fang Hui is so poor.

519
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,040
I think

520
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,040
a slap can't hurt.

521
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,040
It can't be all because of one side.

522
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,040
Women can't be too sensitive to men.

523
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,040
Fang Hui is so stupid.

524
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,040
You are right.

525
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,040
I really don't know...

526
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,040
Fang Hui, you are back.

527
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,040
Are you okay?

528
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,040
Don't mind.

529
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,040
We didn't mean anything else.

530
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:59,040
I broke up

531
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,040
with Cheng Xun.

532
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,040
Fang Hui.

533
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,040
Fang Hui.

534
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,040
I want to dedicate this song

535
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,040
to my favorite

536
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,040
Fang Hui.

537
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,040
I like you.

538
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,040
I like you.

539
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,040
I like you.

540
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,040
I like you.

541
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,040
I like you.

542
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,040
I like you.

543
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,040
I like you.

544
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,040
I like you.

545
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,040
I like you.

546
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,040
I hope I can have

547
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,040
a bright bed

548
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,040
to sunbathe every day

549
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,040
and put my things on the floor

550
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:38,040
to remember the old times

551
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:42,040
I didn't have long hair back then

552
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,040
I had a bright look back then

553
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,040
I want to be like you

554
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,040
in the paradise of dreams

555
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:54,040
and have my favorite girl

556
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,040
I hope you and I

557
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:03,040
can be kind like children

558
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,040
I hope you can give me a pure heart

559
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,040
and a pure look

560
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:11,040
and run back to them

561
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:18,040
I hope you can sing this song with me

562
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:22,040
and bring your story and dream back

563
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:28,040
to the old times

564
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,040
I hope you and I

565
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,040
can be kind like children

566
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,040
I hope you can have a bright bed

567
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,040
to sunbathe every day

568
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,040
and put my things on the floor

569
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:56,040
to remember the old times

570
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:00,040
I didn't have long hair back then

571
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:04,040
I had a bright look back then

572
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,040
I want to be like you

573
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,040
in the paradise of dreams

574
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:12,040
and have my favorite girl

575
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,040
I hope you and I

576
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:21,040
can be kind like children

577
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,040
I hope you can give me a pure heart

578
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,040
and a pure look

579
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:29,040
and run back to them

580
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:36,040
I hope you can sing this song with me

581
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:40,040
and bring your story and dream back

582
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:46,040
to the old times

583
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,040
I hope you and I

584
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,040
can be kind like children

585
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,040
I hope you can have a bright bed

586
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,040
to sunbathe every day

587
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,040
and put my things on the floor

588
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,040
to see the sun

589
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:13,040
and remember the old times

590
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,040
I want to be like you

591
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,040
in the paradise of dreams

592
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:21,040
and have a bright look back then

593
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,040
I want to be like you

594
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,040
in the paradise of dreams

595
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:30,040
and bring my things to the old times

596
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:43,040
I hope you can have a bright bed

597
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,040
to sunbathe every day

598
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:50,040
and put my things on the floor

599
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:56,040
to remember the old times
