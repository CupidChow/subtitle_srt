=Episode 19=

7
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:42,280
Dongfang Yan,

8
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:43,920
do you think

9
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,840
I'll always win?

10
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,159
You've never lost.

11
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,280
Ms. Xi.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,480
Mr...

13
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,000
Mr. Yan?

14
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:11,799
I... I didn't see that at all.

15
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,640
Just what's going on
between both of them?

16
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:24,680
What are we?

17
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:30,159
Xi.

18
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,840
All this time,

19
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:35,159
I've always been

20
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,280
a composed person.

21
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,599
You're just aloof.

22
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:41,920
What?

23
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,400
Nothing. Go on.

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,680
The only time I got worked up

25
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,040
was three years ago.

26
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,680
Your sudden disappearance
three years ago

27
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:59,560
made me realize

28
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,760
that your absence

29
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,959
slowed down time.

30
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,640
That was the very moment I realized it.

31
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,280
Well, do you...

32
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,800
Take your time to think about it.

33
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,159
You'll decide

34
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,360
what we are.

35
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,599
Lie down.

36
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,199
Get some good rest.

37
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,000
I'll wait for your answer.

38
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,360
Goodnight.

39
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,560
You're acting

40
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,199
like a jerk.

41
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,479
If so,

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,240
I'll leave after you fall asleep.

43
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,199
(I fell asleep in
Dongfang Yan's arms last night?)

44
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,279
(Although I'm without a human heart,)

45
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,959
(I've always been by your side.)

46
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,439
(Let me hear his heartbeat.)

47
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,120
Xi.

48
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,600
Morning.

49
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,839
Are all domineering CEOs early risers?

50
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:48,279
Morning.

51
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,240
(Dongfang Yan...)

52
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,759
What's the matter?

53
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,240
Did I press on your wound?

54
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,720
Yeah.

55
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,160
Does it hurt?

56
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:04,480
It does.

57
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,040
I'll apply some ointment on it.

58
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,160
You've had the ointment on your face.

59
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,000
What are you doing?

60
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,399
You've been acting strange
since you woke up.

61
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,680
A B cup is said
to be a man's best asset.

62
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:06,000
I was wondering if you have one.

63
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,839
Get changed
and head down for breakfast.

64
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,120
(Though I failed
to hear his heartbeat,)

65
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,680
(that was indeed a B cup.)

66
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,000
Here.

67
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,160
Dongfang Yan.

68
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,759
A good-looking man
who cooks well like you

69
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,560
is husband material.

70
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:43,079
But I'm a nobody to you.

71
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,660
Considering
how discreet our relationship is,

72
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,920
I should be

73
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,000

Dongfang Xi.

94
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:15,199
Please have mercy on Ye Yunzhou.

95
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,079
At least spare his life.

96
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,360
Ye Yunzhou has been jailed.

97
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,439
You want me to spare him?

98
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:29,000
But did he even have mercy on me?

99
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,360
But you're alright now.

100
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,440
Can't you be kind for once?

101
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,799
Yunzhou is now...

102
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,840
Bai Zhitao.

103
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,720
Your kindness
is nothing but terrifying.

104
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,039
I can give up on my identity
as the adopted daughter.

105
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,440
As long as I can save Yunzhou.

106
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:51,960
Is that worth it?

107
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,440
Your hands were meant

108
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:56,840
for signing Dongfang Group's documents.

109
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,399
But now you do house chores
for a man like that.

110
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,240
Is that worth it?

111
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,679
As long as it's him, it's all worth it.

112
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:06,000
We've known each other
since we were young.

113
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,830
We went from breaking up
to getting back together.

114
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,960
It hasn't been easy for us.

115
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:12,240
Since you met when you were young,

116
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,960
he has always lingered in your heart.

117
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,960
And you kept idealizing him.

118
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,320
But in truth, he is no longer

119
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,759
the one you once had in your heart.

120
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:32,399
Anyway, Ye Yunzhou
poses no threat to me.

121
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:34,919
However,

122
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,159
if you get on the wrong bus,

123
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,960
you can't just stay on it

124
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,360
just because you've already paid.

125
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:44,519
Sometimes,

126
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:47,240
getting off is the best choice.

127
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:54,679
Thank you.

128
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,600
But I believe Yunzhou is the right one.

129
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,399
Why haven't you finished cooking yet?

130
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,600
Are you trying to starve me?

131
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,639
Our family really must have

132
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:30,480
run out of luck.

133
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,000
The women your brother found

134
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,399
keep getting worse one after another.

135
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:35,679
Even that Dongfang Xi was better.

136
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,279
I pleaded with the Dongfangs.

137
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,080
They will release him.

138
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,559
Yunzhou.

139
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,360
Yunzhou.

140
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,159
Yunzhou.

141
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:49,600
Yunzhou.

142
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:50,879
You've suffered.

143
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:51,639
Let me take a look at you.

144
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,080
Zhitao.

145
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:55,840
This time, I really owe it to you.

146
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,960
With you here,

147
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,559
I'll definitely make a comeback.

148
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,159
What?

149
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,000
Aren't you the Dongfang family's
adopted daughter?

150
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,360
You can surely help me.

151
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:06,879
I gave up that status.

152
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,279
What?

153
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,759
Can't we just live a simple, happy life?

154
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,759
You really are kind.

155
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:23,440
Can't you tell

156
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,679
I'm insulting you?

157
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:27,960
Yunzhou...

158
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,960
You actually turned down
such a golden opportunity!

159
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:32,840
Dongfang Xi was right after all.

160
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,279
Your kindness is just stupidity.

161
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:43,960
Scram!

162
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,000
Zhan.

163
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,000
You're here, Xi.

164
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,879
So, are you feeling better?

165
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:04,600
Much better.

166
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,559
Look, I can even

167
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:07,679
swim freestyle now.

168
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,679
Why aren't you pretending
to be badly hurt to win sympathy?

169
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,960
Wasn't that your specialty
when you were little?

170
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,360
On the contrary...

171
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:17,000
Did I press on your wound?

172
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,360
Yeah.

173
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,759
Does it hurt?

174
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:19,919
It does.

175
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,639
What's it?

176
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:29,720
Nothing.

177
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,120
That day,

178
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:35,559
you left this at the swimming pool.

179
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,039
You found Cinderella's glass slipper.
