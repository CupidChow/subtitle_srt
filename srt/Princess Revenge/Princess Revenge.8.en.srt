=Episode 8=

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,280
"Addicted to Toxic Love".

8
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:43,920
What a trashy cliche novel.

9
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:48,560
I never thought Yan would read this too.

10
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,640
The heroine, Bai Zhitao,

11
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,200
and hero

12
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:58,880
Dongfang Yan?

13
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:01,960
The two of them accidentally kiss.

14
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,000
One kiss seals their fate
and begins a painful romance.

15
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,400
The story...

16
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:11,000
You are wearing too little.

17
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:12,159
Do not catch a cold.

18
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,680
Dongfang Yan.

19
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:25,400
What's the matter?

20
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:38,799
What was that for?

21
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,280
You belong to the Dongfang family.

22
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,799
That means you're mine.

23
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:45,920
Bai Zhitao,

24
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:49,159
don't you know that Dongfang Yan
is my family's adopted son?

25
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,519
Let me give you some advice.

26
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:52,959
You shouldn't be fantasizing

27
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,050
about getting together with anyone
from the Dongfang family.

28
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:57,439
Know your place.

29
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:00,959
Well?

30
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,959
Are you going to stay and watch?

31
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,000
What kind of soap opera is this?

32
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:09,919
Bai Zhitao with Yan?

33
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,960
Me with Yan?

34
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:14,520
That's impossible…

35
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,439
I refuse to believe this.

36
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,719
What, trying to run me over?

37
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,560
Dongfang Yan, get in the car.

38
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,290
You've got ruthless driving skills.

39
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,439
You taught me that.

40
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,479
Got to be ruthless to survive.

41
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:46,080
Read this.

42
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,520
It's empty.

43
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,039
Why would you want me to read blank pages?

44
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,319
Blank pages?

45
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,800
How could they be blank pages?

46
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,719
It says right here,

47
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:01,400
Bai Zhitao becomes your secretary.

48
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:03,960
And there's more.

49
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,840
And here.

50
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,280
My homecoming banquet.

51
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:13,280
Everything that happened to us

52
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,280
is written in it.

53
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:15,680
It's like…

54
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,879
like this novel is the world

55
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,879
we're living in.

56
00:03:21,575 --> 00:03:25,350
(Dongfang Yan, CEO of Dongfang Group,
Xi's eldest brother)

57
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:30,262
(Dongfang Yan, Bai Zhitao's lover,
the domineering male lead)

58
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,337
(Dongfang Zhan, Dongfang Xi's brother,
swimming champion)

59
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:37,937
(Dongfang Zhan, Zhitao's childhood friend,
the devoted second male lead)

60
00:03:41,075 --> 00:03:43,662
(Dongfang Chen,
Dongfang Xi's third brother, top idol)

61
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,325
(Dongfang Chen, Bai Zhitao's brother,
the throwaway character)

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,275
(Dongfang Yan: Fine, I'll help.
Remember, I'll always be by your side.)

63
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,840
Check again!

64
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,879
You've had a lot on your plate lately.

65
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,919
Have you not been getting enough rest?

66
00:04:13,112 --> 00:04:17,650

67
00:04:31,462 --> 00:04:32,525

("Addicted to Toxic Love")

69

("Addicted to Toxic Love")

70
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,360
(No matter how much I try,)

71
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,639
(I just can't get rid of this book.)

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,160
"Addicted to Toxic Love".

73
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,839
The kindhearted Bai Zhitao

74
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:07,759
climbs into domineering
CEO Dongfang Yan's bed

75
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,279
to save her childhood sweetheart
Ye Yunzhou.

76
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,360
Under his forceful control,

77
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,759
the two get caught up in a messy,

78
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,839
toxic love of heartbreak and desire…

79
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:25,160
Don't think
just because you've got power

80
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,639
you can do whatever you want.

81
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,240
I'm Mr. Yan's secretary.

82
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,279
Not anymore.

83
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,600
What do you have to bargain with me?

84
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:43,959
My heart belongs to Yunzhou.

85
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,079
But right now, you belong to me.

86
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,759
A challenge. If you lose,

87
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:53,959
never show yourself again.

88
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,959
Will you accept the challenge?

89
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,600
Yes.

90
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,079
Oh my goodness!

91
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:11,439
Bai Zhitao actually beat Ms. Dongfang!

92
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,160
Interesting.

93
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,560
Xi,

94
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,279
you're the reason

95
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:40,240
Mom and Dad are now criminals.

96
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:42,920
And now you want to hurt Bai Zhitao too?

97
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,959
Yan,

98
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:44,360
I…

99
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,199
Dongfang Xi.

100
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,439
If you keep this up,

101
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,600
and we won't even be siblings anymore.

102
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,279
I just realized

103
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,560
the one I truly love

104
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,160
is Bai Zhitao.

105
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,400
("Addicted to Toxic Love")

106
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,240
Turns out I,

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,319
Dongfang Xi,

108
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,720
was only ever the villainess set up

109
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,560
to make the heroine shine.

110
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,439
All my upbringing,

111
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,279
all my hard work,

112
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,639
none of it matters compared
to her halo of kindness.

113
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,480
From being Dongfang Group's secretary

114
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,839
to becoming the Dongfang family's
adopted daughter,

115
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:52,040
the heroine's always been Bai Zhitao.

116
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,160
It's you.

117
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,639
The loyal second male lead.

118
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,560
What are you talking about?

119
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,439
You reek of alcohol.

120
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,759
Some people look like proper heiresses
on the outside,

121
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,380
but behind closed doors,
they drink and smoke too.

122
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,160
Dongfang Zhan!

123
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:23,480
All right, all right.

124
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:24,839
Let's hear it.

125
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,600
What's bothering you?

126
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:29,839
You wouldn't understand.

127
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,039
Fine, I don't.

128
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,799
But I do know

129
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,279
how to take your worries away.

130
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,720
Come with me.

131
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:54,919
What is it?

132
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,919
I'm afraid the water
will make me lovesick.

133
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,720
You're afraid of water?

134
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,039
When you were little,

135
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,600
you begged me to teach you to swim.

136
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:08,240
Look at me.

137
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:19,840
Zhan!

138
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,080
You actually jumped.

139
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,519
I'm a swimming champion, remember?
What's there to be afraid of?

140
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:27,480
I don't want to.

141
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,559
Don't walk away.

142
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,919
Xi.

143
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,360
Let's see
if your brain's waterlogged with love.

144
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:48,000
It is.

145
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,159
Right now, I'm so lovesick

146
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,159
I could marry the next man

147
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,679
I see.

148
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,879
What man?

149
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,799
No man out there's
more reliable than me.

150
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,440
So…

151
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,559
That day at the orphanage,
you picked me.

152
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:24,919
That's how I became your family,
as Dongfang Zhan.

153
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,360
Mommy, I want him to be my brother.

154
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:41,480
That day

155
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,360
was the happiest surprise of my life.

156
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,440
But people

157
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,960
get greedy.

158
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:51,000
The more I had, the more I wanted.

159
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,039
Every time I saw you

160
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:55,440
put your full trust in Yan,

161
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,360
I wished…

162
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,039
I wished you could lean on me instead.

163
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:04,559
Xi?

164
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,399
I don't just want to be your brother.

165
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,200
That'll never be enough.

166
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,159
Ms. Xi,

167
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,159
what are we

168
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,320
doing here today?

169
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,639
We're here to watch a cheesy soap opera

170
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:37,720
play out in real life.

171
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,279
Why…

172
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,279
Why is your second brother with her?

173
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,759
Dongfang Zhan!

174
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:56,720
Mr. Zhan!

175
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,720
Who's that woman next to him?

176
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:03,480
Bai Zhitao, how do you keep
showing up everywhere I turn?

177
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:04,559
Xi, you've been…

178
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:05,320
Don't blame Zhan.

179
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,279
Mom made him bring me along.

180
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,720
So this is what they call
the heroine's halo, huh?

181
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,840
Enough. Get in the car.

182
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,600
Zhan, I didn't mean to…

183
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,639
Seatbelt.

184
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,039
Listen carefully.

185
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:28,279
It was my mother who adopted you, not me.

186
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:29,290
So stop calling me your brother.

187
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,720
It's disgusting.

188
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,279
Ms. Xi,

189
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,480
your second brother
keeps looking at you.

190
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,720
That's exactly how the novel goes.

191
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,200
He starts out hating Bai Zhitao,

192
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,879
treating her like an outlet
for his sister's anger.

193
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,320
Then slowly he realizes

194
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,480
she's the same girl he knew
at the orphanage.

195
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,480
Eventually, he falls for her

196
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,679
and becomes the devoted second lead.

197
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,320
What… what are you talking about?

198
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,519
Some mindless novel.

199
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:57,519
Why is Dongfang Zhan so out of it?

200
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,360
It's the final lap.

201
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,440
He's about to lose.

202
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,759
Why weren't you watching my race?

203
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:18,159
Shouldn't you be sticking close
to the heroine?

204
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,519
Are you still drunk?

205
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:23,879
(This didn't happen in the novel…)

206
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,879
Congratulations, Mr. Zhan.

207
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,519
Ms. Dongfang,

208
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:32,519
do you race too?

209
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,159
What? Want to go against me?

210
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:36,240
No, no.

211
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,159
I can't race.

212
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,000
That's an act.

213
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,480
Of course you can.

214
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,200
Before you became
Dongfang Group's secretary,

215
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,759
you used to work here.

216
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:46,039
You were really good on the track.

217
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,360
And that's not all.

218
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,559
You've got 13 other hidden identities.

219
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,080
You investigated me?

220
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:54,039
Do I need to?

221
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,960
It's all written
into your character sheet.

222
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,759
Character sheet?

223
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,519
What character sheet?

224
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,240
Stop wasting my time.

225
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:03,240
Are we racing or not?

226
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,159
Are you racing or not?

227
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:10,080
Do you even dare?

228
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,279
I'll race.
