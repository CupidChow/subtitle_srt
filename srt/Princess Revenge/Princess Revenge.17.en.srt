=Episode 17=

7
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:42,079
(I thought stopping my parents tonight
would change the whole story.)

8
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,759
(Turns out I was too naive.)

9
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,790
So, for the male and female leads
to suffer through a tragic love story,

10
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,640
Ye Yunzhou has to die
at the hands of the Dongfang family?

11
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,200
(The heroine's first love gets killed)

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,180
(by the male lead's family,)

13
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,000
(so they can fall into
a series of misunderstandings.)

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,079
(The key plot points can't be changed.)

15
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,000
And this piece of trash is supposed

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,560
to be her great first love?

17
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:01,399
What part of him is "great"?

18
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:03,240
(It's because Ye Yunzhou is garbage)

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,359
(that the leads get their happy ending.)

20
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:05,780
Ridiculous.

21
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,200
So stereotypical!

22
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,560
So shallow!

23
00:01:08,637 --> 00:01:11,662
(Dongfang Yan)

24
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,359
Xi!

25
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,159
Xi, are you all right?

26
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,959
And how about
the cooperation I proposed?

27
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:09,439
- We agreed.
- We agreed.

28
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:11,520
Win win.

29
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,062
(Xi)

30
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,599
I'm fine.

31
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,439
What are you doing here?

32
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,879
Dongfang Zhan, are you an idiot?

33
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,840
Ye Yunzhou has

34
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,680
some videos of you.

35
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,400
I'm not afraid of that kind of thing.

36
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,199
But I am.

37
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,360
We're afraid of losing you too.

38
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,639
But what about your reputation?

39
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,800
Of course, my reputation matters.

40
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:15,000
But anyone who uses videos like that
to blackmail a woman

41
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:16,240
is scum.

42
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,199
Look at the male celebrities who cheat,
sleep with fans, or hire escorts.

43
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,599
They still get work.
They still have fans.

44
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:23,680
Why?

45
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,000
No matter how bad a man's reputation is,

46
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,039
as long as he's successful,

47
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,479
people call him talented.

48
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,560
Why?

49
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:34,960
Why is it that no matter

50
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:38,240
how capable a woman is,

51
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,159
everyone only cares

52
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,840
about her reputation?

53
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,560
That's exactly why

54
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,400
I want to protect you.

55
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,080
Zhan,

56
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,080
I'm grateful

57
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,400
to have a brother like you

58
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:54,400
backing me up right now.

59
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,000
But if even I don't have

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,560
the courage to stand up for myself,

61
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,680
then who will?

62
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:05,560
Dongfang Xi,

63
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,199
this is all your fault!

64
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:10,000
It's just Ye Yunzhou.

65
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,319
Go!

66
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:17,780
Are you mad?

67
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:18,639
Go!

68
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,439
Go…

69
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,079
Go!

70
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,399
Get out of here!

71
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,199
Dongfang Zhan!

72
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:28,800
Trust me! Get away from here!

73
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,439
Run!

74
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,000
Dongfang Zhan!

75
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:40,839
Go!

76
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:49,879
Stop pretending you're so devoted.

77
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,439
Dongfang Xi!

78
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:18,759
Now that it's come to this,

79
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,839
nobody's leaving here today.

80
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:33,360
Dongfang Xi.

81
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:37,240
I really don't get it.

82
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:41,600
Why must you make my life so miserable?

83
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,879
(How am I making your life miserable?)

84
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,639
(You're the one using women
as stepping stones.)

85
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,160
(I'm just fighting back.)

86
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,399
I graduated from a top school.

87
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,600
I'm talented.

88
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,319
I could have any woman I want.

89
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,800
And now you've ruined me!

90
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,079
One more rich guy in this world

91
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:09,560
doesn't change a thing!

92
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,380
It's too bad.

93
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,160
Found you.

94
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,199
Dongfang Yan!

95
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:57,759
Go find Zhan.

96
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,790
There are bodyguards with him.

97
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,600
No, I'm staying with you.

98
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,040
Here we go again.

99
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:09,079
If you guys catch me,
I'm done for anyway.

100
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,480
Might as well

101
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,959
go down together.

102
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,240
Dongfang Yan!

103
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,800
What's happening?

104
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,279
(Dongfang Xi,)

105
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:57,360
(you're just the villainess.)

106
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,480
(Why are you resisting?)

107
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:02,519
System, it's you again.

108
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:05,439
(Dongfang Xi,
Ye Yunzhou's death is inevitable.)

109
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:07,560
(But if you insist
on changing the story,)

110
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,000
(as it stands,)

111
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,519
(Ye Yunzhou will grab the knife)

112
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,800
(and kill Dongfang Yan.)

113
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,680
(However, if you go with the story)

114
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:16,160
(and let Ye Yunzhou die,)

115
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:18,040
(then Dongfang Yan will survive.)

116
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,199
(Ye Yunzhou was never
a good guy anyway.)

117
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,839
(So what if he dies?)

118
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,279
"So what if he dies?"

119
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,959
If Ye Yunzhou dies,

120
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,839
then Dongfang Yan
becomes a murderer, right?

121
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,200
The story's already set.

122
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,360
You can't change it.

123
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,399
(The story's set?)

124
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,639
(The ending
where Ye Yunzhou dies is set.)

125
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,840
(But who kills him can be changed.)

126
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,480
(From my parents, to Zhan,)

127
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:52,240
(and now to Dongfang Yan.)

128
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,399
The plot might be fixed,

129
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,159
but cause and effect can change.

130
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,240
Then let me be that cause.

131
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,200
(Dongfang Xi,
that means you'll become a murderer.)

132
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,960
I'd do anything

133
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,639
