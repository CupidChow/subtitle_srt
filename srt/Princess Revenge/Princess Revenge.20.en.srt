7
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:40,600
That day,

8
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:42,560
you left this at the swimming pool.

9
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,439
You found Cinderella's glass slipper.

10
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:56,759
Now you have to marry me.

11
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,479
Dongfang Zhan.

12
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,079
We are family.

13
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:07,400
Always.

14
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:12,599
People often mix up

15
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:15,000
liking and being suitable.

16
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:18,000
Why? Do you have a grudge against me?

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,959
Trying to insult me

18
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:20,599
in this condition?

19
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,760
I just think there are things

20
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,079
I should make clear to you.

21
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,159
I don't want
any misunderstanding between us.

22
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,879
Actually, I never mixed up

23
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,633
liking and being suitable.

24
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,290
It's just that
the one you fell for first

25
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:47,400
wasn't me.

26
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:54,040
You should go.

27
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,000
Go on.

28
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:56,959
Go.

29
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,639
It's rare for Xi to treat us.

30
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,599
Too bad Zhan isn't here

31
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,759
for this seafood meal.

32
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:57,879
Yan.

33
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,879
Why don't I get this kind of treatment?

34
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,400
Even food won't shut you up.

35
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,439
I heard you've hired
four acting coaches.

36
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,280
Do you really want to be an actor?

37
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,520
He just wants to take love seriously.

38
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,360
Thanks.

39
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,199
Can't I do so?

40
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:21,280
You're having
a secret romance with Zhan,

41
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,000
but I can't think about having one?

42
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,039
Who said
I had a secret romance with him?

43
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,400
Tell me about it.

44
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,560
Dongfang Xi and Zhan

45
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,000
have met several times
at the swimming pool.

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,560
That's where
you made your pledge, right?

47
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,680
You even made a pledge?

48
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,199
Xi.

49
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,759
I even saw you two
going out at midnight.

50
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,039
You were out together at midnight?

51
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,960
At this rate,

52
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,240
you should get engaged soon.

53
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,120
Dongfang Chen!

54
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,080
Are you getting engaged
to Dongfang Zhan?

55
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,840
Absolutely not.

56
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,439
Well...

57
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,879
Why did you kick me?

58
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,759
Come with me, I need a word with you.

59
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,159
Quick...

60
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,240
What's it?

61
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:10,560
Don't hit my face.

62
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,439
Can't you see

63
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,639
Xi and Mr. Yan are a thing now?

64
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,079
Xi?

65
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,439
Go on.

66
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,279
Your love life sure is exciting.

67
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,079
Have some shrimp,

68
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,439
Mr. Yan.

69
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,360
Come on.

70
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,120
Have you played this before?

71
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,839
It's a lie detector.

72
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
(What a perfect chance
to test how this thing works.)

73
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,480
(After all, the rules about humans)

74
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,959
(apply to him (me), too.)

75
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,279
It's just some fun game.

76
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:01,399
Here, don't be nervous.

77
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,160
How could I not be nervous?

78
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,560
If I lie, I'll get shocked.

79
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:05,680
Yang Xiaoxin.

80
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,399
Okay.

81
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:09,920
Here we go.

82
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,720
Come on.

83
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:12,879
Shoot.

84
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,959
Dongfang Chen.

85
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,360
Do you have someone you like?

86
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:20,920
No.

87
00:05:22,387 --> 00:05:23,025

88
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,079

89
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,399
No way.

90
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,480
Of course not.

91
00:05:39,337 --> 00:05:39,992
(TRUE)

92
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,800
Here you go.

93
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,480
Do you have someone you like?

94
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,399
I don't think so.

95
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,560
She's telling the truth!

96
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,079
I...

97
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,079
I want to...

98
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,560
Well, let's head out first.

99
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,600
Where to?

100
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,000
Come on.

101
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,800
What? Is it my turn?

102
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,199
Were you being jealous

103
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,439
during the dinner?

104
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:52,959
Yes.

105
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:59,040
Did you do so as an older brother?

106
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:01,240
I did so as Dongfang Yan.

107
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,160
It's just a game.

108
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,480
Don't be so nervous.

109
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,879
Here, your turn.

110
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,959
It's your turn,

111
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:15,639
Yan.

112
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,639
Sure, Ms. Xi.

113
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,279
Fire away.

114
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,959
I'll tell you whatever you want to know.

115
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:24,720
Do you know

116
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,680
what question I just asked them?

117
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,600
Are you the System?

118
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,240
What?

119
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:37,639
Are you?

120
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,199
No.
