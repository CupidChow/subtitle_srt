♪I want to take control

=Princess Revenge=

6
00:00:37,475 --> 00:00:39,200
=Episode 12=

7
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:42,280
I've thwarted
the whole damsel-in-distress scene.

8
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,280
Where's the thrill?

9
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:45,880
(You don't understand
the power of the plot.)

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,262
(System: You don't understand
the power of the plot.)

11
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,359
(Only the hero and heroine matter.)

12
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,640
(Everyone else exists
just to sacrifice for their love.)

13
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:00,479
My life

14
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:04,760
is trapped in some
over-the-top CEO romance novel.

15
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,640
The heroine

16
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,920
is a fragile blossom
waiting to be nourished by love.

17
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:10,879
For love,

18
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:12,359
she'll throw away all self-respect.

19
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,879
She clings to her first love,

20
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:17,280
while selling herself
to a domineering CEO.

21
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,400
(From years of market experience,)

22
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,840
(and hits like "Sealed With Kiss",
"Dream Chains", "It Began With A Kiss",)

23
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,680
(the plot of an ugly duckling
forced into loving a domineering CEO)

24
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,519
(is always the crowd favorite.)

25
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,439
Can't we give
the audience something better?

26
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:32,040
Stop blindly chasing hype.

27
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:39,920
So the System can even take form.

28
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:42,359
You can actually show up in person.

29
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:45,519
(In any case,)

30
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,519
(a sweet, innocent heroine)

31
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,799
(and...)

32
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,560
A CEO who by law

33
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,280
should get three to ten years in prison

34
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,079
will never end well.

35
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,280
I grew up watching these dramas.

36
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,719
They fried my brain.

37
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,280
As a kid, I dreamed I was a princess,

38
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,719
waiting for a prince to rescue me.

39
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:11,080
When I grew up, I realized

40
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:13,520
if men were reliable,

41
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:15,159
pigs would be climbing trees.

42
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,879
In the end, I can only count on myself.

43
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:19,560
(But the more the villain fights back,)

44
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:21,080
(the worse their ending will be.)

45
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:22,759
(Talking won't change that.)

46
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,960
(The future is already decided.)

47
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,319
Whatever ending I get,

48
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:33,639
at least it's one
I chose and fought for.

49
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:37,439
I refuse to live by a script.

50
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:38,960
(Just like this time.)

51
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,080
(The plot could've)

52
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,879
(spared you the suffering.)

53
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,080
(You're smart,)

54
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,680
(so you know giving in
is the easiest way out.)

55
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,919
But giving in

56
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:49,280
means watching Dongfang Yan
end up with Bai Zhitao.

57
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:52,639
I'll lose myself

58
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,560
and become the villainess.

59
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,479
I'll even lose...

60
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,639
(I don't want to lose him.)

61
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,479
Why are you here by yourself?

62
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,319
I...

63
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:18,680
It's alright.

64
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,560
All that matters now

65
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,479
is taking you home.

66
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,719
I swear,

67
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:35,280
I'll treat Yang Xiaoxin right.

68
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,159
I'll protect her, keep her safe.

69
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:40,000
As long as I'm here,
no one can hurt her.

70
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,080
No way.

71
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,879
Xi.

72
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,759
You can trust me with Yang Xiaoxin.

73
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:51,439
Our production team needs her
as our costume consultant.

74
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,280
Zhan, say something.

75
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,840
Whatever it is,

76
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,159
our chief designer has to agree first.

77
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,680
I've never been on a film crew before.

78
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,080
What if I just mess things up?

79
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:13,879
That's easy.

80
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,560
Xi can go with you.

81
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,879
Problem solved.

82
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:30,079
Wow.

83
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,759
As expected of our chief designer.

84
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,680
It looks stunning.

85
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,279
It's such a gorgeous design.

86
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,839
It'd be a waste not to show it off.

87
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:53,959
Hey, Dongfang Yan.

88
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,360
We're short one player.

89
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,079
Get over here.

90
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,720
Since you're here,

91
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:22,120
why not model for our chief designer?

92
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:24,680
Thanks, everyone.

93
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,240
I was going to change anyway.

94
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,480
Let me make this clear.

95
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,279
I'm charging extra for this.

96
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,079
Come on, we're family.

97
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:36,160
I have another meeting to run to.

98
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,560
Family should always stick together.

99
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:53,160
Dongfang Chen really is a face genius.

100
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,800
So handsome.

101
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,000
Mr. Yan looks
even cooler with that stern face.

102
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,399
Mr. Zhan looks amazing in a suit.

103
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,839
This family is way too good-looking.

104
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,759
Vita's sales are
about to skyrocket again.

105
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,279
Beautiful.

106
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,480
Aren't you going to change?

107
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,240
I still have work to do.

108
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,759
Alright then.

109
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,519
I thought I'd get to see you in a qipao.

110
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,839
Take a break.

111
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,240
I'll go say hi.

112
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,319
Be careful during the shoot later.

113
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:32,560
Sir.

114
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,519
Over here.

115
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:34,560
Go on.

116
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,360
Good luck.

117
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,279
This way.

118
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,079
This is Director Guan.

119
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,040
Hello, Director.

120
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:46,639
Hello.

121
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,240
Chen! Chen!

122
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,079
Dongfang Chen!

123
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:53,759
Make some room.

124
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,279
Don't push, don't push!

125
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:55,959
Be careful!

126
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:58,560
Slow down!

127
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,079
Ting, are you okay?

128
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,720
You're useless.

129
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:05,040
I wanted to see Dongfang Chen.

130
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,480
Instead, we're just stuck
in this crowd outside the set.

131
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,360
I might as well
just check the fan pages.

132
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,319
Why would I even come here?

133
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,480
Aren't you the Dongfang family's
adopted daughter?

134
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,519
Sister-in-law.

135
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,800
Please help me out.

136
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:25,079
Didn't you just fight with my brother?

137
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,120
If you help me, I'll help you too.

138
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,240
So I'll take that as a yes.

139
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,120
Go get me his autograph and a photo.

140
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,639
Then, I'll head home

141
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,519
and wait with my brother for you.

142
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:41,680
Go on.

143
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,319
You go.

144
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:42,839
