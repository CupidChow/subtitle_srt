Ye Yunzhou killed Qiao Xi by mistake,

8
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:10,760
so I came back.

9
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:13,799
Unless I die,

10
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:16,480
you'll never return.

11
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,719
Seems like we shouldn't jinx ourselves.

12
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,120
But...

13
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,359
Ye Yunzhou,

14
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:26,120
trying to climb over me
to get to the top

15
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:30,079
isn't that easy.

Yunzhou.

(Girlfriend Only)

20
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,280
I know you dislike
public display of affection,

21
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,159
so

22
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,840
I just stick a sticker here.

23
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,680
Is that okay?

24
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,560
Since you claimed me as yours,

25
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,800
can you promise me

26
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,280
to sell fish at the stall?

27
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,080
As expected,

28
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,479
pitying men will ruin women.

29
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,919
Congratulations to Mr. Ye Yunzhou

Today, that person
from the Dongfang family is here.

49
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:59,319
He actually showed up?

50
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:01,479

You're just a simp.

62
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,079
I dumped you,

63
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,839
and you snapped?

00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:40,720

Sorry, everyone.

This woman

69
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,120
keeps clinging to me.

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,240
If I won't marry her,

71
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,600
she causes a scene.

72
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,279

76
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,079
Slander me again,

77
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,120
and I'll hit again.

78
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,360
One cold fact.

79
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,959
High heels

80
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:18,839
are the sharpest weapon on earth.

81
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,600
Stop her!

82
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:29,000
How could you leave
after assaulting someone?

83
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,000
Who are you?

84
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,560
I'm Bai Zhitao,

85
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,399

86
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,279

to Mr. Yan of Dongfang Group.

87
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,800
Mr. Yan's secretary?

88
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,199
Assault has consequences,

89
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,439
especially since

90
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:47,519
the one you hit is a vice president

91
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,800
of a Dongfang Group subsidiary.

92
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:52,120
I hit the vice president

93
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,360
of a Dongfang Group subsidiary?

94
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,160
Let Mr. Yan punish me then.

95
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,560
Catch her!

96
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:56,040
I dare you!

97
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,920
Stop!

98
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,759
It's Mr. Han.

99
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:00,879
He's the head
of the 12 Chambers of Commerce.

100

Mr. Yan is here too?

104
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,279
Mr. Yan is also here?

The head of Dongfang Group,

106
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:16,319
Dongfang Yan.

107
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,040
Three years ago,

108
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,480
the only daughter of the Dongfang family

109
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,120
vanished from the public eye.

110
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,839
Since then, the three heirs

111
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:25,600
no longer joined private banquets.

112
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,920
Mr. Yan actually appeared today.

113
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,360
What is going on?

114
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,279
Mr. Yan is...

115
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:38,980
Why is Mr. Yan picking up the heels?

116
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,399
What is Mr. Yan doing?

117
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:42,920
What is he doing?

118
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:43,920
Gosh.

119
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:46,560
Who is she?

120
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,240
Mr. Yan is helping her put her heels on.

121
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,360
I dare not ask.

122
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:49,839
Who is she?

123
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:50,600
What is happening?

124
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:56,279
Yan...

125
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:57,839
Know your place

126
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:58,720
before you greet me.

127
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,279
Mr. Yan.

128
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,279
This is Vita Design's vice president.

129
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:06,759
Mr. Yan.

130
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,120
I ruined the appointment party
you held for me,

131
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,879
letting down your kindness.

132
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,399
I'm really...

133
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,680
I don't recall telling you to meddle.

134
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,319
I'm sorry.

135
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,720
I acted on my own.

136
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,639
On your own?

137
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,600
So it wasn't Mr. Yan's idea.

138
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,040
I knew it.

139
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,959
He's just a small vice president,

140
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:30,040
yet using some rebirth theme.

141
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:32,560
Mr. Yan.

142
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,240
I failed to control my staff

143
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:36,439
and let such losers enter.

144
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,079
What do you mean?

145
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,959
Throw him out.

146
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,160
How are you?

147
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,639
Are you okay?

148
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:02,120
Mom.

149
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,680
Qiao Xi knows Mr. Yan?

150
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,079
I've only worked
for Mr. Yan for a month.

151
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,480
I've never seen her.

152
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:12,079
Well, well, Qiao Xi.

153
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:15,399
I knew you were faking it.

154
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,639
Luckily, I have other tricks.

155
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,879
Let's wait and see.

156
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:29,399
Fine.

157
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,240
Let's wait and see.

158
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,240
Mr. Yan.

159
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:55,559
Let's go in.

160
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:56,039
Yes.

161
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,159
(For three years, Qiao Xi used my name)

162
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,600
(to do outrageous things.)

163
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:24,320
(I don't know if Yan will forgive me)

164
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,200
(and let me come home.)

165
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,080
(This was three years ago.)

166
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,360
We'll braise this one.

167
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,919
Xi has grown into a beauty now.

168
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:55,879
We'll steam this one.

169
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:57,399
She's indeed my twin.

170
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:58,240
She owes it to me.

171
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,080
Look, don't touch.

172
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,200
Let's go.

173
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,559
What a pity.

174
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,759
This koi tastes bad.

175
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:41,200
Hey.

176
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:42,720
Wake up.

177
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,960
Great.

178
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,720
I feared saving me would...

179
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,720
Hey.

180
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:58,240
Wait.

181
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:02,279
He just saved me.

182
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,320
I fell for him at first sight.

183
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:06,200
I want to marry him.

184
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:13,360
(It's been three years.)

185
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,559
(I actually came back.)

186
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,320
(Now comes the classic line.)

187
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:22,320
(I'll reclaim all that's mine.)

188
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,080
You're only deceiving yourself.

189
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,799
Why are you naked?

190
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,039
My towel was stolen after my shower.

191
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:04,840
Put something on.

192
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,440
Why are you so severely hurt?

193
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,879
What's wrong?

194
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:28,200
I feel nothing anymore.

195
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,320
Check for me.

196
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:33,919
No wounds.

197
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,440
Just a scar.

198
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:38,639
How were you hurt?

199
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,279
This seems

200
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,799
like a wound from a past life.

201
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,399
Check it again for me.

202
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,799
Don't suddenly undress
in front of the opposite sex.

203
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:53,360
We're siblings.

204
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:57,840
If not for Ye Yunzhou,

205
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,120
you should have married me
three years ago.

206
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,240
Now that you're back,

207
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:05,360
will you still marry me?

208
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:10,200
We're not related by blood anyway.
