=Episode 22=

7
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,079
Dongfang Xi.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,280
Have you found me?

9
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,759
Of course.

10
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,480
Are you going to point me out
as Dongfang Yan?

11
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:08,000
Before I do that,

12
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,680
I want to make sure of something.

13
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,439
There are only two outcomes
to this bet.

14
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,959
Either you disappear

15
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,200
or I die.

16
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:15,799
Am I right?

17
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,159
Yes.

18
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,239
There's no third outcome.

19
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,200
This is

20
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,959
my first time seeing you here.

21
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,680
It really is you.

22
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:47,079
I was being selfish
to have made the bet with you.

23
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,400
When I was the novel's male lead,
Dongfang Yan,

24
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,200
everything I did

25
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,000
was the outcome
of precise calculations.

26
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:56,760
Yet facing you,

27
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:58,200
I always wanted

28
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,400
to approach you as my true self.

29
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,159
I used the bet
to trick you into being with me.

31
00:02:20,287 --> 00:02:22,687
(Nobody can boss you around.)

32
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,360
(You've always been
like this since young.)

33
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,800
From now on,
you're not allowed to show up

34
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,080
wherever Xi is.

35
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,400
Do you know who I am?

36
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,560
(The villainess, Dongfang Xi.)

37
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,680
(Back in school, she bullied classmates
in the name of her family.)

38
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,479
I was wrong, Ms. Dongfang.

39
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,560
I won't do that again!

40
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:47,280
This isn't the first time
you've been caught

41
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,879
secretly filming
in the girls' locker room, no?

42
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:51,800
Since you can't control yourself...

43
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,960
I'll send someone over
to teach you a lesson.

44
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,319
By the way,

45
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,199
your family's cooperation
with Dongfang Group

46
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:04,080
is over.

47
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,879
I was wrong, Ms. Dongfang!

48
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:09,439
Please spare my family!

49
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,159
(That was when I realized)

50
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:15,400
(the novel only showed the surface,)

51
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:17,199
(not the whole truth.)

52
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,159
As for the photo scandal,

53
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,199
you, who leaked the pictures,

54
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,000
should be ashamed.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,800
System.

56
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,759
You can't kill me.

57
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,639
What say you, Yan?

58
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,240
Tell me.

59
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,879
Did you do that out of responsibility?

60
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,879
Or, do you truly like me?

61
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,199
(I)

62
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,639
(love)

63
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,919
(you.)

64
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,000
I am the guardian of the rules.

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,560
And you are my variable.

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You made me realize

67
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,560
the plot isn't everything.

68
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,040
Dongfang Yan.

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,279
I'm happy

70
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:35,839
to see the real you.

71
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,000
As for the bet with the System...

72
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,560
I lost it.

73
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,399
I lost it.

74
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,000
I feel accomplished for having made
the always composed Mr. Yan

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,680
do that face.

76
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,040
Dongfang Yan.

77
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:05,560
The bet was about me pointing you out.

78
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,879
So,

79
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,120
naturally, I got to decide the ending.

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,800
Well, I lost.

81
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,639
Why did you deliberately give up?

82
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,399
Because...

83
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:23,800
I wanted to share my feelings with you.

84
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,800
To let you see

85
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,519
how passionate the world I see is.

86
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,199
I'm sorry, Xi.

87
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,720
This time,

88
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:39,480
I have to force my script on you again.

89
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,160
What do you mean?

90
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,879
When I made the bet with you,

91
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:50,160
I had already decided on the ending.

92
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:54,319
Disappearance is the only ending

93
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:56,000
for a system.

94
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,759
I won't allow it.

95
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,800
I'll do all I can

96
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:10,000
to return this real world to you.

97
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,279
I haven't done loving you,

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,160
but I have to leave you now.

99
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,160
No!

100
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:20,079
I said, I lost.

101
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,600
You can't go back on your word.

102
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,920
From now on,

103
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,560
you'll no longer be bound by the plot.

104
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,839
And there's one more thing

105
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,639
I haven't said to you.

106
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,279
What is it?

107
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,839
I love you.

108
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:27,879
Don't go!

109
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,959
Liar!

110
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,399
The bet doesn't count!

111
00:08:02,587 --> 00:08:05,125
(Ten years later)

112
00:08:06,275 --> 00:08:07,025
(Dongfang Chen)

113
00:08:10,812 --> 00:08:12,550
(Music Dimension)

114
00:08:14,137 --> 00:08:15,050
(No Restraint, No Rules,
A Revolution of Sound)

115
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,759
Have you watched
Dongfang Chen's new drama?

116
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,480
Looks like he might win
Best Actor this year.

117
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:22,040
The Dongfang family
is really something.

118
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:24,759
