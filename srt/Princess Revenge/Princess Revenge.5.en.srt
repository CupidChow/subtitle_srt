00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You've just recovered from a fever
and now you're standing in the wind.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,580
Do you want to give
the hospital more business?

9
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,640
This is supposed
to be a proper homecoming banquet.

10
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,679
How could Ye Yunzhou show up?

11
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:55,990
We should just throw a sack over him
and dump him in Africa.

12
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:56,840
Well, that's rare.

13
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:58,700
Something useful
actually came out of your mouth.

14
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,960
No matter how he got that invitation,

15
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,640
as long as he dares to make a move,

16
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:04,879
I'll return it to him double.

17
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,959
Tell me,

18
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:09,439
if Ye Yunzhou were to find out

19
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,159
that the Qiao Xi he despises

20
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,560
is actually Ms. Dongfang,

21
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,760
Dongfang Xi.

22
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,879
Wouldn't that be interesting?

23
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,560
Enjoy yourself.

24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,680
I heard

25
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,879
that the guests
at this homecoming banquet

26
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,640
are all candidates
for your future husband,

27
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,040
carefully chosen by your parents.

28
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,850
If you like them,
you do the talking yourself.

29
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,680
Xi,

30
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,640
that won't do.

31
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,439
I'm an idol who plays by the rules..

32
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,599
Yunzhou,

33
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,400
what's wrong?

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,560
This matter...

35
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,359
I'd better not tell you.

36
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:48,760
You're so pure and innocent,

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,040
you shouldn't know.

38
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,079
Are you treating me like an outsider?

39
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,760
Qiao Xi is entangled with Mr. Yan

40
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,319
and Mr. Zhan at the same time.

41
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,400
She knows I'm about to expose her,

42
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,519
so these past two days,

43
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,319
she's been setting traps for me.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,520
She's now the President of Vita.

45
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,759
Tonight,

46
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:14,240
who knows how she'll come after us.

47
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,319
Don't worry.

48
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,080
With me here,

49
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,879
I'll never let her hurt you again.

51
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,360
Who's there?

52
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,560
Open the door.

53
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:39,919
Open up!

56

(unable to tell right from wrong.)

57
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,680
(But once your two-timing is exposed,)

58
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,319
(and Ms. Dongfang finds out,)

59
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,439

(This time the one to bring you down)

62
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,919
(is Ms. Dongfang.)

63
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:57,639
Is anyone there?

64
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,840
Ye Yunzhou,

65
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,639
is that you?

66
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,439
Open the door!

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,639
Open up!

68
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,919

(will be endless wealth and glory.)

(what Qiao Xi has done,)

77
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,159
(she might even thank me.)

78
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,199
(It could also help Yunzhou's career)

79
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,039

80
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,319
Please welcome

Cheers.

98
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,759
Welcome back, Miss.

99
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,399
Miss.

100
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,000
Your gown looks stunning.

101
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,399
Is it a new release from a brand?

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It is from our Dongfang Group's
new company,

103
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,800
Vita.

104
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,959
The designer is right here.

105
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,720
He is a graduate
from an Ivy League school,

106
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,160
Vice President of Vita Design,

107
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,160
and the chief designer of your gown,

108
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,240
Ye Yunzhou.

109
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,199
I think

110
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,480
you must get to know him.

111
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:40,439
I must get to know him?

112
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,319
Are you telling me what to do?

113
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,560
Ms. Dongfang,

114
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,639
since you like this gown so much

115
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,480
and Yunzhou

116
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,959
is its chief designer,

117
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,800
I think you two
will have much to talk about.

118
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,439
Zhitao flatters me.

119
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,199
I only helped Miss

120
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:56,199
choose an excellent designer.

121
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,199
Indeed.

122
00:05:58,759 --> 00:05:59,920
Sometimes,

123
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,519
choice truly matters.

124
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,199
Miss seems to have taken
a liking to Ye Yunzhou.

125
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,680
I think he looks quite decent.

126
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,360
Young ladies would all fancy him.

127
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
Looking good

128
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,839
does not mean he is a good match.

129
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,279
Miss,

130
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:13,279
I heard you will be choosing
your fiance tonight.

131
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,600
May I ask what your standards are?

132
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,319
As for my standards,

133
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,800
just three.

134
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:20,959
First,

135
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,240
family background.

136
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,160
But Miss, you come from a noble family.

137
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,600
Surely you would not mind
the other side's family background?

138
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,720
It must be on par with mine.

139
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,439
So, the wealthy

140
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:31,759
only want to choose the wealthy.

141
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:32,959
Second,

142
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,199
he must not look
worse than my three brothers.

143
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,040
As expected of Miss.

144
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,040
Adults do not choose.

145
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,920
They want both looks and wealth.

146
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,519
Goodness.

147
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:44,720
The first two requirements
are already so demanding.

148
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,319
I wonder what the third one is.

149
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,720
Third,

150
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:50,480
he must marry into the Dongfang family

151
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,800
and change his surname to Dongfang.

152
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:57,040
I believe everyone here
heard me clearly.

153
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,439
When I, Dongfang Xi, choose a man,

154
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,410
these are my three standards.

155
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:00,240
Wealth,

156
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,480
good looks,

157
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,319
and devotion.

158
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,079
Everyone present here

159
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,079
is not someone who would act foolishly

160
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,120
for love.

161
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,800
I think

162
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,759
Miss would prefer

163
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:14,639
a mature and steady man.

164
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,839
Indeed, in this world

165
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:18,199
there is no shortage of stubborn
and overly confident men.

166
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,319
You are so different.

167
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:23,720
Not like the men I have known.

168
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,399
Do you want me to put it this way?

169
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,360
Calling someone who takes love seriously

170
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,639
a love-struck fool,

171
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,319
while enjoying the good
a woman brings you

172
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,199
yet despising her loyalty,

173
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,879
that is the guilty accusing the victim.

174
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,560
Miss,

175
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,720
that was not my intention.

176
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,199
Miss.

177
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,040
What I mean is,

178
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,800
love is like clothing.

179
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,930
What matters most is the right fit.

180
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:53,439
(I want to see
what you are trying to say.)

181
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:55,560
Miss,

182
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,959
for the gown you are wearing now,

183
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,600
I have gone without sleep for days.

184
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,000
I even endured
my superior's harsh demands

185
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,160
just to perfect this gown

186
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,879
and make it truly fitting for you.

187
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,959
(My superior's harsh demands.)

188
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:09,560
(Aren't you just trying)

189
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,800
(to shift the topic to Qiao Xi?)

190
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,600
(Then I shall grant your wish.)

191
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,560
(Let's see
whose face gets slapped in the end.)

192
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,160
Who is your superior?

193
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,700
Why did she make things hard for you?

194
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:19,759
Miss,

195
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:21,879
for the sake of the Dongfang Group,

196
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:23,279
for the sake of Vita Design,

197
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,360
I

198
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,720
had no choice
but to play the villain once.

199
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,399
Allow me to show you

200
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:30,720
my superior,

201
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,519
Qiao Xi.

202
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,080
She used despicable means

203
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,639
to obtain this position.

204
00:08:37,325 --> 00:08:38,487
(Message sent successfully. Confirm.)

205
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,480
I just received a text.

206
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,440
Me too.

207
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,919
(What's wrong with Qiao Xi?)
What is this?

208
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,362
(Promiscuous with many men.)

209
00:08:44,366 --> 00:08:45,639
This message was sent to everyone.

210
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,840
My goodness.

211
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,159
She really has no shame.

212
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,559
To use such vile tricks to rise in rank.

213
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:51,240
Unbelievable.

214
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:51,759
Qiao Xi.

215
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,639
My ex-girlfriend.

216
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:57,039
She set her eyes on the wealth
and glory of the Dongfang family.

217
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,120
While seducing Mr. Yan,

218
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,279
she also climbed into the bed

219
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,120
of the second young master,
Dongfang Zhan.

220
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,679
What is wrong with Qiao Xi?

221
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,960
She sleeps around.

222
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,639
She is two-timing.

223
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:08,000
Both young masters of the Dongfang family
are involved with her.

224
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:11,799
Miss,

225
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:14,080
I have even caught the culprit,

226
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,600
Qiao Xi, for you.

227
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,960
Today itself,

228
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,080
she tried to sneak
into your homecoming banquet.

229
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,519
Fortunately,

230
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,200
I discovered her.

231
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:25,360
Qiao Xi,

232
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,639
after you left me,

233
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,240
you quickly latched onto the Dongfangs.

234
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,639
And to two men at that.

235
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:31,919
Miss,

236
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,200
Qiao Xi is nothing but a vile woman.

237
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,799
I was with her for three years,

238
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:38,679
yet I never loved her.

239
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,720
Because she was vile.

240
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,080
She really thought
she was the true Miss.

241
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,320
The one whose parents died early.

242
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:48,600
Ye Yunzhou.

243
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,799
