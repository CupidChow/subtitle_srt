83
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:10,423

91
00:03:43,742 --> 00:03:44,543
You're a fool.

92
00:03:44,863 --> 00:03:46,543
Did you think the Dongfang family
was as foolish as you,

93
00:03:46,543 --> 00:03:47,342
unable to tell truth from lies?

94
00:03:47,502 --> 00:03:48,583
You've been playing me all along.

95
00:03:49,423 --> 00:03:51,143
Qiao Xi is Dongfang Xi.

96
00:03:51,742 --> 00:03:52,942
Why did you lie to me?

97
00:03:53,182 --> 00:03:54,502
Why didn't you tell me?

98
00:03:54,942 --> 00:03:55,983
Just

99
00:03:57,423 --> 00:03:59,023
to protect what little male ego

100
00:03:59,023 --> 00:04:00,742
you've got.

101
00:04:07,103 --> 00:04:08,583
Ms. Dongfang of the Dongfang family.

102
00:04:09,823 --> 00:04:11,222
Now all your indecent photos

103
00:04:11,222 --> 00:04:12,182

Do you still have
the face to meet people?

105
00:04:15,502 --> 00:04:16,303
Is that so?

106
00:04:17,263 --> 00:04:17,862
What is it?

107
00:04:19,743 --> 00:04:21,063
Do you want to quickly clear your name

108
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:22,703
by saying those photos were edited?

109
00:04:23,782 --> 00:04:25,222
I will not deny my past.

110
00:04:26,063 --> 00:04:26,743
However,

111
00:04:29,063 --> 00:04:30,662
a woman's reputation

112
00:04:31,422 --> 00:04:33,023
why should it be judged by men?

113
00:04:34,462 --> 00:04:35,623
As for this so-called photo scandal,

114
00:04:35,623 --> 00:04:36,662
the one who should feel ashamed

115
00:04:36,662 --> 00:04:37,782
was never me.

116
00:04:37,862 --> 00:04:39,263
It was you, who spread those photos.

117
00:04:43,662 --> 00:04:44,462
No.

118
00:04:44,462 --> 00:04:45,183
This...

119
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,982
This is all your fault.

120
00:04:46,782 --> 00:04:47,743
You were the one lying to me all along.

121
00:04:48,063 --> 00:04:49,302
If you had told me earlier

122
00:04:49,302 --> 00:04:49,943
that you were Dongfang Xi,

123
00:04:49,943 --> 00:04:51,383
how could I have taken those photos?

124
00:04:51,383 --> 00:04:52,703
If I were not Dongfang Xi,

125
00:04:52,703 --> 00:04:53,902
just an orphan, a fish seller girl,

126
00:04:54,982 --> 00:04:56,383
would I deserve to be humiliated by you?

127
00:04:57,782 --> 00:04:59,263
If Xi had not hidden her identity,

128
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:01,662
you would never
have become vice president.

129
00:05:03,383 --> 00:05:04,222
Impossible.

130
00:05:04,862 --> 00:05:05,902
I graduated
from a prestigious university.

131
00:05:06,623 --> 00:05:07,943
It was clearly about ability.

132
00:05:16,342 --> 00:05:17,102
Ye Yunzhou.

133
00:05:17,542 --> 00:05:18,662
As vice president of Vita,

134
00:05:18,982 --> 00:05:20,383
you harmed the interests of the Group.

135
00:05:20,743 --> 00:05:22,263
According to the contract,

136
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:24,703
all losses are to be borne by you.

137
00:05:24,703 --> 00:05:25,222
Therefore,

138
00:05:25,503 --> 00:05:27,583
you now
owe the Dongfang family fifty million.

139
00:05:28,102 --> 00:05:28,662
In addition,

140
00:05:29,102 --> 00:05:30,302
didn't you want to use
the Dongfang family

141
00:05:30,302 --> 00:05:31,462
to climb above everyone else?

142
00:05:32,743 --> 00:05:33,342
Sorry.

143
00:05:34,023 --> 00:05:34,782
You're fired.

144
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:36,102
But the debt

145
00:05:36,623 --> 00:05:37,342
still has to be repaid.

146
00:05:39,143 --> 00:05:40,342
I will donate

147
00:05:40,342 --> 00:05:42,143
your debt
to the Women's Protection Foundation,

148
00:05:43,222 --> 00:05:45,662
so that every powerless
and voiceless Qiao Xi

149
00:05:45,662 --> 00:05:47,023
will have the courage to resist.

150
00:05:49,063 --> 00:05:50,143
I really want to see.

151
00:05:50,703 --> 00:05:52,102
After today, Ye Yunzhou,

152
00:05:52,862 --> 00:05:53,623
without me,

153
00:05:55,023 --> 00:05:56,703
how you can rely on your own ability.

154
00:05:59,063 --> 00:05:59,782
Qiao Xi.

155
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:01,422
Dongfang Xi!

156
00:06:03,422 --> 00:06:04,222
Ms. Xi.

157
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:06,943
Yunzhou was indeed wrong,

158
00:06:07,703 --> 00:06:09,902
but you don't have
to push him to the edge.

159
00:06:10,302 --> 00:06:11,943
When he hurt me back then,

160
00:06:12,782 --> 00:06:14,102
why didn't you say that?

161
00:06:14,902 --> 00:06:16,503
Back then, all you lost was love,

162
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:18,623
but Yunzhou lost

163
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,862
his career and his entire dream.

164
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,102
Can't you show some compassion?

165
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,063
Since you're so saintly,

166
00:06:25,063 --> 00:06:26,583
why be generous at others' expense?

167
00:06:27,063 --> 00:06:28,183
If you want to help, help yourself.

168
00:06:28,743 --> 00:06:29,662
No need to remind me.

169
00:06:30,183 --> 00:06:31,143
I will definitely help Yunzhou

170
00:06:31,143 --> 00:06:32,383
stand up again.

171
00:06:32,823 --> 00:06:34,023
Don't think that just because
you have money and power

172
00:06:34,023 --> 00:06:35,102
you can do whatever you want.

173
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,222
Send them back on a small boat.

174
00:06:38,222 --> 00:06:39,542
Don't let these two dirty our eyes.

175
00:06:39,782 --> 00:06:40,222
Yes.

176
00:06:42,222 --> 00:06:42,823
Young Master Zhan.

177
00:06:43,422 --> 00:06:45,263
I am still Mr. Yan's secretary.

178
00:06:45,703 --> 00:06:46,743
Not anymore.

179
00:06:48,422 --> 00:06:49,183
Did you hear that?

180
00:06:49,982 --> 00:06:50,823
Say one more word,

181
00:06:50,823 --> 00:06:51,503
and you can swim back yourself.

182
00:07:56,183 --> 00:07:56,743
Where's the money?

183
00:08:06,102 --> 00:08:06,782
Yunzhou.

184
00:08:07,342 --> 00:08:08,823
As long as I can be with you,

185
00:08:08,823 --> 00:08:10,063
I don't feel any hardship.

186
00:08:21,437 --> 00:08:23,550
(Ye's Fish Stall)

187
00:08:27,302 --> 00:08:29,302
(This is the life
that truly belongs to me, Dongfang Xi.)

188
00:08:37,743 --> 00:08:38,302
Yan.

189
00:08:38,702 --> 00:08:39,263
Zhan.

190
00:08:41,623 --> 00:08:42,422
Where is Dongfang Chen?

191
00:08:42,782 --> 00:08:43,782
He's on tour.

192
00:08:44,582 --> 00:08:45,422
Mom is back.

193
00:08:46,263 --> 00:08:47,383
Mom is back?

194
00:08:47,942 --> 00:08:49,302
I missed her so much.

195
00:08:49,902 --> 00:08:50,662
Mom.

196
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:55,623
You're back.

197
00:08:56,182 --> 00:08:57,103
Let me have a look at you.

198
00:08:58,702 --> 00:08:59,582
Ms. Dongfang.

199
00:09:03,182 --> 00:09:03,983
Xi.

200
00:09:03,983 --> 00:09:05,983
This is my newly
acknowledged goddaughter,

201
00:09:06,143 --> 00:09:07,503
my lifesaver.

202
00:09:07,503 --> 00:09:08,902
From now on, she will be your sister.

203
00:09:12,902 --> 00:09:13,743
So melodramatic.

204
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,725
(Addicted to Toxic Love)
(And so, the heroine Bai Zhitao)

205
00:09:17,887 --> 00:09:20,300
(became the foster daughter
of the Dongfang family,)

206
00:09:20,725 --> 00:09:23,600
(destined for a painful yet passionate
entanglement with the male lead, Dongfang Yan.)

207
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,025
(But the vicious rival, Dongfang Xi,)

208
00:09:26,237 --> 00:09:28,725
(will never
let Bai Zhitao go so easily.)
