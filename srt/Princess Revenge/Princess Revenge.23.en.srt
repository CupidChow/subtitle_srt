=Episode 23=

7
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:44,079
Sounds great.

8
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:48,359
It's a win-win.

9
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,280
(For the past ten years,)

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,759
(I told everyone)

11
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:04,359
(that Dongfang Yan went abroad.)

12
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,040
(And I sent letters home in his voice
every month.)

13
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,079
Tangible letters like these

14
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,359
could reassure the family more.

15
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,439
Still working at this late hour?

16
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:28,920
It's like you're possessed by Yan.

17
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:32,799
I'm used to it.

18
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:34,959
This is all what I should do.

19
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:36,640
Back then,

20
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,359
there was always someone
carrying the weight for me.

21
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,760
Dongfang Group has so many employees,

22
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,040
and they're not freeloaders.

23
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:46,680
Now

24
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,359
I shall exercise the power
of an elder brother.

25
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:50,920
Go to sleep.

26
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:51,879
Okay,

27
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,040
I'll go to sleep.

28
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,120
But

29
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,280
I'm staying over there tonight.

30
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,719
Fine.

31
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,959
I'll send you

32
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:00,640
there.

33
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,719
You're here, Ms. Xi.

34
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,680
The former chairman
was reassigned a few days ago.

35
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,879
If you need anything...

36
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:18,879
Got it.

37
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:19,840
If you need anything,

38
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,680
the new chairman
will personally attend to you.

39
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,312
(Addicted to Toxic Love)

40
00:03:09,612 --> 00:03:11,112
(Dongfang Xi: Dongfang Yan.)

41
00:03:11,113 --> 00:03:13,062
(Dongfang Yan steps back
from Bai Zhitao at once.)

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,837
(Identity? But my life and choices
are mine to decide.)

43
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:19,240
Dongfang Yan...

44
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,759
So it's here

45
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:28,120
that you've run through
the plot countless times?

46
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,960
Xi.

47
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,639
We tried,

48
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:40,479
but we couldn't destroy this novel.

49
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:43,599
So I must deduce an ending

50
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,319
that allows the villainess to survive.

51
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,000
When I realized the plot
couldn't be overturned,

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,240
as the System, I could only

53
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,800
make you follow the plot,

54
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,919
stopping you at every turn,

55
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,000
so that you could live.

56
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,159
Ms. Xi.

57
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,479
Ms. Xi.

58
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:15,360
Did you ask for me?

59
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,399
It's you.

60
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:21,680
It's been a while.

61
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm the newly appointed chairman here.

62
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,680
What do you need?

63
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:28,480
Empty it.

64
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,319
Clear out all the books here.

65
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,959
Sure.

66
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:38,680
One person per book.

67
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,399
Find the red-marked plot holes
in the novel.

68
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,800
Here's your pay for tonight.

69
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:57,240
(Even if hope is slim,)

70
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:59,279
(I still want to try)

71
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,680
(to find a way to bring him back.)

72
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,079
I heard you often came here

73
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,360
over these ten years, Ms. Xi.

74
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,439
What took you so long to discover

75
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:11,480
this secret room and these books?

76
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:17,319
Perhaps fate guided me.

77
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,959
Today,

78
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,839
the necklace that person gave me fell

79
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:23,000
and it led me here.

80
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,879
Mr. Yan left behind all these.

81
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,839
Drop the act.

82
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:39,920
When you saw yourself
as the heroine of these books,

83
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,360
you showed no surprise or doubt.

84
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,560
Besides,

85
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,680
this isn't your first time
seeing them, no?

86
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,600
Yes.

87
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,920
When I first saw this book,

88
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,120
I thought it was a prank.

89
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,639
It wasn't until I realized
my experiences

90
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:10,720
mirrored the plot

91
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,360
that I knew

92
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,759
all the foolish things I did

93
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,519
were the result
of the novel's manipulation.

94
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,759
But now I'm different.

95
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,120
I broke free from the character setting

96
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:28,959
and became myself again.

97
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,079
I've had wealth and a career.

98
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,480
I can see that.

99
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,519
This?

100
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,040
You too know
the one who gave me this necklace.

101
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,120
You're still with Ye Yunzhou?

102
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,199
Yeah.

103
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,839
Diamonds

104
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,480
symbolize the most steadfast love

105
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,800
that lasts until death.

106
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,839
Do you know about diamond burials?

107
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,160
After cremation, 2% carbon remains

108
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,199
in human ashes,

109
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,000
which can be refined into diamonds.

110
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,600
It's true that I'm with Yunzhou.

111
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,160
