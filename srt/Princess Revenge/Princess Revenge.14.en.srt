00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,560
Dongfang Chen!

8
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,000
Chen!

9
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:52,960
- Chen!
- Chen!

10
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:54,240
Somebody!

11
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,000
Help!

12
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,039
Chen! Chen!

13
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:00,840
Dongfang Chen!

14
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:02,280
Are you alright?

15
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:04,239
You okay?

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,840
I'm fine, Zhan.

17
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,560
Why did you have to play the hero?

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,799
Chen!

19
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,920
Your face is fine.

20
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,079
Thank God, no scars.

21
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,200
Shouldn't you ask how I am

22
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,760
instead of checking my face?

23
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,599
Well, you are the face of our family.

24
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:24,920
Blood.

25
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:26,760
There's so much blood!

26
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,560
Get the first aid kit!

27
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,799
Bring the first aid kit!

28
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:37,040
No, wait.

29
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,280
Don't wrap it up yet.

30
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,359
It could get infected.

31
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:40,840
Clean it with alcohol.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,799
Alcohol.

33
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,239
No!

34
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,200
Bear with it.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,799
It's fine.

36
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:50,879
- Just hold on.
- Hang on.

37
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:51,599
Yang Xiaoxin!

38
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:53,799
Are you taking your revenge on me?

39
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,840
Didn't I say just hold on?

40
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,239
It hurts!

41
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,040
Alright.

42
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,480
You…

43
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,680
What's wrong with the blasting team?

44
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,960
Director, I'm so sorry!

45
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,319
She messed with the charge point.

46
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,000
I didn't know that was the charge point!

47
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,800
I didn't mean it!

48
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,400
Who let her in here?

49
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,439
(It turns out Chen
was injured in the novel)

50
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:27,240
(partly because of Bai Zhitao.)

51
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,840
(In the novel,
even with his dying breath,)

52
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,879
(he was still grateful to Bai Zhitao.)

53
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,039
(Ridiculous.)

54
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:36,120
I just came to see Chen.

55
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,719
And who is Chen to you?

56
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,479
I'm the Dongfangs' foster daughter.

57
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,919
I just wanted an autograph.

58
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,879
I've never met a sister
who wanted to blow up her brother.

59
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,199
Get her out of here!

60
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,039
Get it done!

61
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:48,840
Take her away!

62
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:51,479
Stage crew!

63
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:54,199
If anyone drags
another fool on set again,

64
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,199
you're fired!

65
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:58,560
Director.

66
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,800
Get ready for the next scene.

67
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,560
Dongfang Chen,
get someone to mark your position.

68
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,879
Guan Jiahui is terrifying.

69
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,919
She disses everyone equally.

70
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,240
Get this wound checked at the hospital.

71
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:15,319
Help him up.

72
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:15,960
Come on.

73
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,960
Yan, Xi.

74
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,360
Give me a hand, will you?

75
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,599
How?

76
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,479
It's simple.

77
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,759
Just act with me for a bit.

78
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:32,199
Have the lighting
and camera team capture the mark.

79
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,439
But I don't know how to act.

80
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,960
Please, Xi.

81
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:39,080
I'm begging you.

82
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,199
Fine.

83
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,039
Seeing you still respect me.

84
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:42,960
Someone!

85
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,280
Get the actor to the hospital.

86
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,560
Careful.

87
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,000
Help me out.

88
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,879
His hand!

89
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:47,479
Don't worry.

90
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,479
Easy, easy, hold him steady.

91
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:52,960
Stop standing there!

92
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,000
Come, let's run the scene.

93
00:03:59,159 --> 00:03:59,840
The leads

94
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,919
were childhood sweethearts.

95
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:03,240
This scene is their reunion years later.

96
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,479
It's their wedding night.

97
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,400
Male lead, enter.

98
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:33,920
Xi.

99
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,439
Fu Xiao.

100
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,199
I heard tonight...

101
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,759
I heard you lost your voice.

102
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,639
Then, do we still...

103
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:46,079
Cut!

104
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:49,639
Is this your wedding night
or a prison visit?

105
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,639
How can you feel anything
sitting that far apart?

106
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:52,399
Closer!

107
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:00,639
(Manman.)

108
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,399
(It's been)

109
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,319
(too long.)

110
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:05,079
Yes.

111
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,199
That's it.

112
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,519
At first, Manwei wanted

113
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:09,680
to turn down this arranged marriage.

114
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,040
But on this night,

115
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,879
she couldn't resist her own heart.

116
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,079
She longed to know his feelings too.

117
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,759
But since Fu Xiao lost his voice...

118
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,240
It's your line.

119
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,240
Fu Xiao.

120
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,480
I want to know

121
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,680
if you are with me out of duty.

122
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:42,959
Or perhaps

123
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,759
you actually love me?

124
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:56,000
The male lead admits his feelings.

125
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,399
(I...)

126
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:10,879
(Love...)

127
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,079
(You...)

128
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,160
Cut, cut, cut!

129
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,160
Director.

130
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,680
I think that's good enough.

131
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,759
Alright then.

132
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:51,279
How's lighting and camera prep?

133
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,160
At least the face is safe.

134
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,839
How was it?

135
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,240
When I stepped in back then,

136
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,079
didn't I look pretty heroic?

137
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,600
When you saved me,

138
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,560
you probably didn't think
about your own face, right?

139
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,279
That's because the whole situation

140
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:22,000
was already under my control.

141
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,519
Dongfang Chen.

142
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,680
You're more than just a face.

143
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,639
You're also

144
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:32,439
brave and genuine.

145
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,160
Of course,

146
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,959
your face is perfect too.

147
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,040
Xiaoxin.

148
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,160
You're the first person to say that.

149
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,040
Really?

150
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,160
You mean it?

151
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,639
Director, the male lead is
still in the hospital.

152
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,600
He can't come back yet?

153
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,160
Alright, let's wrap it up for today.

154
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,759
That's a wrap.

155
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:17,759
