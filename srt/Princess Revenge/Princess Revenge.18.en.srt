7
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,799
System, you must be pleased with yourself.

8
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:51,200
Toying with living people
like they're just pawns in your hand.

9
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:56,159
(You're all just characters.)

10
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,759
(You're not alive.)

11
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,159
I don't believe the world

12
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:02,159
I've lived in for over 20 years is fake.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,319
(I can't deny myself,)

14
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,959
(or the people around me.)

15
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,000
(Whether they love me or hate me,)

16
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:16,680
(they're real.)

17
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,799
A few drops of ink on your script

18
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:24,359
won't define flesh and blood.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,719
If I kill Ye Yunzhou,

20
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:31,400
then I'm following the plot,

21
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,159
which means
I'm doing exactly what you want.

22
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,439
(You don't have a choice.)

23
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:36,159
I don't.

24
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,400
So I won't choose.

25
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,599
(What do you plan to do?)

26
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,879
The story is fixed.

27
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,040
But what if I die here
even though I wasn't supposed to?

28
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:48,400
Would you save me?

29
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:51,640
After all,

30
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,280
the villainess is still
an important character.

31
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,560
(If I choose not to save you,)

32
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,799
(you'll die.)

33
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,200
(If a character exits early,)

34
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,959
(it breaks the storyline.)

35
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,599
(If I choose to save you,)

36
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,400
(then Ye Yunzhou survives.)

37
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,350
(Either way, the story
won't follow the predetermined script.)

38
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:09,159
System,

39
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:10,199
no matter

40
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,639
what you do this time,

41
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,639
you lose.

42
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,240
Dongfang Yan?

43
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,520
I'm fine.

44
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,080
Go find Zhan.

(but now it's all been broken.)

51
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:56,199
(System, I bet you've taken a heavy hit.)

52
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,639
It certainly was a heavy blow…

53
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,080
You made the System choose.

54
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,759
This time, I made the choice.

55
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:15,240
I chose you.

56
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,759
What just happened?

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,400
He's the one who saved me.

58
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,240
I've fallen for him at first sight.

59
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,199
I'm going to marry him.

60
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,400
Yan,

61
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,240
will you drift further
and further away from me?

62
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,560
As long as you don't change,

63
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,479
I'll never change either.

64
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,960
How did I end up here?

65
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:15,560
Mr. Yan already arranged things
with Mr. Zhan.

66
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,000
The doctor said
his injuries aren't serious.

67
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,399
Mr. Yan has asked that you get some rest

68
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:20,600
and not stress about it.

69
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,680
I'll wait for him to come back.

70
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:25,680
Get me a bottle of wine.

71
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:27,560
All right.

72
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,480
At last,

73
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,839
I've broken free
from the System's control.

74
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,000
(Dongfang Xi.)

75
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,199
(The past events are still there.)

76
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,480
(But everything beyond this point
has turned into gibberish.)

77
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,480
The story is no longer fixed.

78
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,759
The novel's collapsing, isn't it?

79
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,759
Even if you trap me here,

80
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:05,439
you can't fix it.

81
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,399
System,

82
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,439
admit you lost.

83
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:12,439
What's wrong? Cat got your tongue?

84
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:17,399
Back then, when I broke free,

85
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,399
you replaced me with someone else.

86
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:22,879
Now the whole plot has fallen apart.

87
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:25,680
Oh, dear.

88
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,240
Don't tell me another System is going
to replace you too?

89
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,600
(There is no other System.)

90
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,000
(Whether it's replacing you)

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,560
(or moving the novel's plot forward,)

92
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,800
(it's all to provide energy
for the world to keep running.)

93
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,959
Wow.

94
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:43,199
So there's such
a noble reason behind it all.

95
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,040
(It's true I've paid a price
for losing control of the plot.)

96
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:48,439
(By the calculations,)

97
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:50,839
(Dongfang Zhan and Dongfang Yan
shouldn't have helped you.)

98
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:51,800
(I don't understand.)

99
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,839
Because

100
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:56,040
you only steer the story to its ending.

101
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,600
You can't control people's hearts.

102
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,759
(I can't feel human emotions,)

103
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,759
(so I'm allowing you
to make a bet with me.)

104
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:05,199
You're "allowing" me?

105
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:08,439
(I can feel neither warmth)

106
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,759
(nor cold.)

107
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,639
(Making a bet with you is an exception.)

108
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,560
(In fact,)

109
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,639
(the ensure the plot's progression,)

110
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,480
(I've always had a human form.)

111
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,240
What do you mean?

112
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:20,759
(It means)

113
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,439
(I've been
by your side this whole time.)

114
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,959
You're someone I know?

115
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,800
(Three months.)

116
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,399
(Within three months,)

117
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,079
(if you figure out who I am,)

118
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,839
(I'll never interfere
in your life again.)

119
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:35,759
And if I can't?

120
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,160
(Then you'll have)

121
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,160
to accept death as your fate,

122
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,959
(become part of this tragic romance,)

123
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,800
(continue the story,)

124
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:47,000
(and give me your emotions.)

125
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,959
(This wager is high risk for me,)

126
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:52,079
(but also high reward.)

127
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,000
All right.

128
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,879
From now on,

129
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:58,279
only one of us can live.

130
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,519
But I need a way to find you.

131
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:04,000
You ought to give me a limit.

132
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,959
I have no human heart,

133
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:09,759
but the rules that govern people
apply to me too.

134
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,399
All right. I accept.

135
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:14,000
Three months.

136
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,439
I'll find you

137
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:17,399
and make you disappear for good.

138
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:18,680
Why are you dozing off here?

139
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:25,600
What's on your mind?

140
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:35,759
I asked Assistant He
to get me some wine.

141
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:38,040
Don't drink
while you're standing in the cold.

142
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:53,000
Dongfang Yan,

143
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:56,079

I'll always win?

145
