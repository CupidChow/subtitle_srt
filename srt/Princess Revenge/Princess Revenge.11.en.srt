=Episode 11=

7
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:44,359
As long as I can save you.

8
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:54,600
His body is fine now,

9
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,880
rest well for a few days.

10
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,479
Don't take any supplements.

11
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,200
Will there be any aftereffects?

12
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:01,159
This…

13
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:02,799
There are some leftover medicines
in his body.

14
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:04,000
This is normal.

15
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,560
Just wait for his body
to metabolize the remaining medicine.

16
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:08,560
Let me take a call.

17
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:14,760
Yan, how are you feeling?

18
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:16,959
Much better.

19
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:18,120
Don't worry.

20
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:21,000
Your body will be fine after this,

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,840
but you should check
if your heart is hurt.

22
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,680
My heart is fine too.

23
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,400
Then today,

24
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,519
let's just pretend nothing happened.

25
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:35,319
No, you are siblings.

26
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,280
You can't just pretend it didn't happen.

27
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:41,959
If

28
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:43,719
there were no blood relation,

29
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:45,239
then being together
wouldn't be impossible.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,040
We'd know each other well
since we're family.

31
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,319
You could get a marriage certificate
and take a family photo,

32
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,680
double happiness.

33
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,079
Yan, I…

34
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,439
After all this,
still calling him brother?

35
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:58,920
You should rest first.

36
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,000
Let the housekeeper improve
your bedroom's soundproofing.

37
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,319
Didn't hurt you just now, right?

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,800
It's fine.

39
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:15,960
I wish you weren't my big brother.

40
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,639
Just kidding.

41
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,400
I'm going to find Dongfang Chen now.

42
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,080
This…

43
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,319
Wow.

44
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:15,960
What's wrong?

45
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,520
Xin.

46
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,520
From now on, you're my idol.

47
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,039
I've trained in karate for a few years.

48
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,240
Sister.

49
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,719
Sister, go easy on me.

50
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,800
Reliable.

51
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,840
As expected of Xin.

52
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,639
Spill it.

53
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,919
The woman you're looking for isn't here.

54
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:34,240
But she will attend
an art exhibition tomorrow.

55
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,319
You can catch her there.

56
00:03:39,675 --> 00:03:40,900
(Ep Elysee Paradise)

57
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,240
Xi, why are you looking for that woman?

58
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,360
She came out of Yan's office.

59
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:49,080
Could it be Yan was ruined by her?

60
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,840
Who ruined him?

61
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,400
Mr. Yan probably didn't, right?

62
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:57,479
Am I going to have a sister-in-law?

63
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:59,120
You dare say that, risking your life.

64
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,400
Oh.

65
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,280
Hurry up.

66
00:04:00,662 --> 00:04:03,850
(Ep Elysee Paradise)

67
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:11,000
Elysee Paradise.

68
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:15,759
In Greek mythology,
a blissful place in the underworld.

69
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,759
(A new map has been revealed)

70
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,512
(Chapter 3:
Misunderstanding and Clarification)

71
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,839
(In the novel, the culprit who
drugged the hero is briefly mentioned.)

72
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:27,759
(Instead, it takes three chapters.)

73
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,079
(The heroine uses her body
to cure the hero.)

74
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,839
(However,)

75
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,519
(because of my intervention...)

76
00:04:33,737 --> 00:04:34,787
(Addicted to Toxic Love)

77
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,519
(The original one-night stand
between the leads is gone.)

78
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:55,759
(The evil supporting female
won't kidnap the heroine out of anger.)

79
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,000
(Then next…)

80
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,839
(Is unknown plot.)

81
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,399
The heroine really
has a lot of screen time.

82
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,240
Miss Xi.

83
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:16,759
What a coincidence

84
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:17,839
to meet you here.

85
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:18,720
Not a coincidence.

86
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,720
I came here specifically
looking for someone.

87
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,639
So you're still targeting me.

88
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,399
Yunzhou has already been forced
to stay home by Mr. Yan.

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,040
Are you trying to take away
my job opportunity too?

90
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,120
Aren't you still working eight jobs?

91
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,360
Don't know why,

92
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:39,240
you seem to know everything about me.

93
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,959
Because you're dangerous.

94
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,839
You overestimate me.

95
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,800
You underestimate yourself.

96
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,560
Anyway,

97
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,879
you're not welcome here.

98
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,879
Introduce this painting.

99
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,040
This painting is
an Impressionist work from 1952.

100
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,319
See the brushstrokes here.

101
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,680
(These paintings)

102
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,319
(all look like copies.)

103
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,079
I've ordered this one.

104
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,199
It's a gift for my wife.

105
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,120
Okay.

106
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,439
After you pay the deposit,
you can go upstairs to inspect it.

107
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,519
This way, please.

108
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,399
There are bodyguards here.

109
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,240
They won't let you up easily.

110
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,160
Do we really have to go in?

111
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,120
We must.

112
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,160
I've already bought a painting.

113
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,279
Can we go in now?

114
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,800
Sir, please.

115
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:59,560
He is the chairman
of Haosheng Venture Capital.

116
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,120
He would never give a painting
to his wife.

117
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,319
Why not?

118
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:05,079
Mr. Xu has a bad relationship
with his wife.

119
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,480
It was once very embarrassing.

120
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,160
For what reason?

121
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:10,680
Unknown reason.

122
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:18,680
Looks like the reason is here.

123
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,199
He came here

124
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,560
probably to satisfy certain

125
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,360
indescribable personal preferences.

126
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:44,199
"Girl with a Pearl Earring".

127
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,480
She actually got it for you.

128
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,079
The art exhibition is fake.

129
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,240
Using it

130
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,399
as a cover for shady deals
is the real purpose.

131
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,399
I don't understand what you're saying.

132
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,279
I sell paintings here.

133
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:00,279
All transactions are consensual
and fair.

134
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,839
The paintings in the corridor

135
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,879
correspond to the characteristics
of goods in each room.

136
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,079
Am I right?

137
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,160
Pearl.

138
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,959
Girl with a Pearl Earring.

139
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,720
If all are consensual transactions,

140
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,959
then why are all the room doors locked?

141
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,399
Afraid the paintings might escape?

142
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,800
Extreme measures
are necessary sometimes.

143
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,120
It's not easy for me either.

144
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:31,199
Then what's your purpose
in dealing with Dongfang Yan?

145
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:37,120
Anyway, I didn't succeed last time.

146
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,360
Don't be so petty.

147
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,080
What purpose could there be
between a man and a woman?

148
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,000
I want to benefit
from my child's status.

149
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,039
It's a pity.

150
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,759
I don't know which woman benefited.

151
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:53,679
Who helped you sneak
into the CEO's office?

152
00:08:59,362 --> 00:09:00,112
(CEO Assistant, Bai Zhitao)

153
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,600
Her accomplice has arrived.

154
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,000
Don't go.

155
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:23,960
You go first.

156
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:27,360
Dongfang Yan!

157
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,120
System!

158
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:31,759
Say something!

159
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:33,120
Your male lead is about
to be beaten to death.

160
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,279
(Without your intervention,)

161
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:36,879
(Dongfang Yan has already started
a romance plot with Bai Zhitao)

162
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:38,799
Where did Bai Zhitao get
a romance plot if she's not here?

163
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,240
Don't just eat candy
while pressing heads.

164
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,559
Don't just enjoy yourself.

165
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:43,000
You don't care
about the audience at all.

166
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,039
Who said Bai Zhitao is not here?

167
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,639
Save me!

168
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:47,679
Is anyone there?

169
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:49,120
Help!

170
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,440
(Watch closely.)

171
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,200
(Evil female supporting roles
should enter like this.)

172
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,519
What's going on?

173
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,360
All...

174
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:27,879
Bring them all back to me!

175
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,080
What's happening?

176
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,320
Why are these people all disheveled?

177
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:52,120
Bai Zhitao's access card.

178
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,240
But the one who helped
Pearl sneak into the office isn't her.

179
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,039
If it really was her,

180
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,360
she wouldn't have been undressing
in the office that day.

181
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,879
Looks like it was Ye Yunzhou.

182
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,080
Mr. CEO.

183
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,919
Next time, hire a better secretary.

184
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,159
(Being the male and female lead
isn't easy either.)

185
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:16,919
(Daily facing these coincidental,
ridiculous plots.)

186
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,679
(For love,)

187
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,960
(you could even lose your life.)

188
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,960
(Of course.)

189
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,759
(The romance of the leads
is the core of the novel.)

190
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:24,919
Is it?

191
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:26,559
Your leads so far

192
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:28,360
haven't sparked at all.

193
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,200
The more the leads miss each other,

194
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,399
the deeper it is
when they finally unite.

195
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,600
Your current efforts

196
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,679
are just fuel for the romance plot.

197
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,000
The hero-saving-beauty plot
has already been disrupted by me.

198
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,120
Where's the fire?

199
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,159
(You have no idea
of the power of the plot.)

200
00:11:42,212 --> 00:11:43,374

of the power of the plot.)
