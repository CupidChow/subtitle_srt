7
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,759
Dongfang Yan!

8
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,079
Xi?

9
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,240
What's wrong with you?

10
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,439
You look as if
you're here to get back at me.

11
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:58,000
Mr. Yan.

12
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,159
I'll tell you a bedtime story.

13
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,239
It's getting late.

14
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,319
You should head upstairs
and get some rest.

15
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:08,000
It's just a story.

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,359
What are you afraid of?

17
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,560
Come.

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,930
Are you going to walk yourself?

19
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,200
Or, do you want me to carry you there?

20
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,079
I'll just tell you a story.

21
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:22,799
I'll go when I'm done.

22
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,480
Once upon a time, there was a novel.

23
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,439
It was equipped with a System
that controlled the plot.

24
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,400
Stop reading those novels
Yang Xiaoxin sends you.

25
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,400
Don't interrupt.

26
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,959
The System was authoritarian.

27
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,560
No matter how lousy the plot was,
it had to continue.

28
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,560
It didn't care
about the characters' lives.

29
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,400
It even enjoyed forcing things
that could never work out.

30
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,599
It was utterly unreasonable,

31
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,000
showing no regard for human rights.

32
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,400
On top of that,

33
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,879
it two-timed.

34
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,280
No way.

35
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,199
His match was the heroine,

36
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,400
yet he said he liked me.

37
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:15,400
He likes

38
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,000
a charming and lovely villainess.

39
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,680
Well...

40
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,879
Is the System

41
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,080
just toying

42
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,199
with the villainess?

43
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:37,199
Is he using the villainess

44
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,080
to finish his storyline?

45
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,120
Xi.

46
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:51,159
Just like you said,

47
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,960
you believe this world is real.

48
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,560
So do I.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,400
The System likes everything
the villainess believes in.

50
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,560
Due to her existence,

51
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,080
this world is now more interesting.

52
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,000
In fact, the villainess

53
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,360
is considered an unexpected glitch

54
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,280
in this whole setup?

55
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,400
An unexpected glitch?

56
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,800
Not even my parents dare call me that.

57
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,240
But she's also the only color
in this world

58
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,759
the System can ever touch.

59
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,900
And the System can
no longer stay calm and objective

60
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,759
because of her.

61
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,080
So,

62
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,400
from the very beginning,

63
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,360
the System already had designs
on the villainess.

64
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,439
Yes.

65
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,919
From the very beginning,

66
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:46,639
the System had gone soft
on the villainess.

67
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,199
No matter how the ending turns out.

68
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,159
Even if there's no ending,

69
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,680
we still have time.

70
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,639
Let's just live in the moment.

71
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,680
(Three months to go.)

72
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,360
(I won't waste a single second.)

73
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,240
You're here.

74
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,199
What's this?

75
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,546
(Countdown: 086)
This is the countdown for the bet

76
00:04:30,547 --> 00:04:32,439
(Countdown: 086)
between the villainess and the System.

77
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:38,120
(Countdown: 085 days)
When this countdown reaches zero,

78
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,720
that's when I'll expose the System.

79
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,879
Just like you said,

80
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,240
let's just live in the moment.

81
00:05:25,587 --> 00:05:27,825
(Countdown: 001 day)

82
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,480
Mr. Yan.

83
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,399
What are you doing?

84
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:40,160
Time is tight and the task is heavy.

85
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:42,639
What task do you have here?

86
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:47,160
To burn off all the dopamine
I've been flooding with

87
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,480
because of love.

88
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,199
What's wrong?

89
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:01,560
Mr. Yan.

90
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,920
What is it?

91
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,199
Mr. Yan...

92
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:06,040
Mr. Yan isn't around.

93
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,759
Ms. Xi.

94
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,759
Am I that shameful to be seen with?

95
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,759
You're my secret lover after all.

96
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:26,160
You've got a sharp tongue.

97
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,240
As long as I can kiss you.

98
00:06:40,725 --> 00:06:46,482
(Dongfang Group)

99
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,399
The rain has stopped.

100
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,439
The ground is all wet, Mr. Yan.

101
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,399
Didn't Bai Zhitao wrap up filming?

102
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,040
Why is she still here?

103
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:18,160
Holding an umbrella for a snail?

104
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,680
Have you seen a doctor?

105
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,439
I don't get it.

106
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,720
Is it wrong to be kind?

107
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,000
As Yunzhou's girlfriend,

108
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,439
is it wrong for me

109
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,240
to care about him and think for him?

110
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:37,240
When will you

111
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,759
start thinking for yourself?

112
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,759
The fish

113
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:54,360
would've jumped into the pot on its own

114
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,480
before you finish dealing with it.

115
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:56,519
Tell me,

116
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:58,040
what can you possibly accomplish?

117
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,000
Your kindness is just stupidity.

118
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,959
The women your brother found

119
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,399
keep getting worse one after another.

120
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,519
Even that Dongfang Xi was better.

121
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,319
Why are you throwing a tantrum?

122
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,240
I should stay as a pushover

123
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,959
just because I'm kind?

124
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,600
All my life,

125
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:27,160
I had to smile

126
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,560
at everyone I came across,

127
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,399
including fools like you.

128
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,000
I've put up with it for so many years.

129
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,960
Being kind to you

130
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,799
is being cruel to myself.

131
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,879
I've had enough of all this!

132
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:49,799
What are you doing?

133
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,360
Tell Ye Yunzhou

134
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,360
that I've dumped him.

135
00:09:07,962 --> 00:09:11,602
(Addicted to Toxic Love)

136
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,399
This green tea tastes good.

137
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:14,720
Try it.

138
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,318
Let me smell it.

139
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,240
I'll get you one.

140
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:19,960
Xi?

141
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,279
What are you...

142
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,240
Come on in.

143
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,679
Mom.

144
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:32,559
How long have you been together?

145
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,039
Well,

146
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:35,960
it's been three months.

147
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,360
Here.

148
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,399
Thanks, Dad.

149
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,399
Actually, I knew

150
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:45,000
something was going on between you two.

151
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,480
When are you getting married?

152
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,559
No, an engagement should come first.

153
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,879
Why?

154
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,159
Are you leaving him?

155
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:04,200
It's no good to be unfaithful.

156
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,120
Well...

157
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:08,399
You'll still see each other
all the time.

158
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,720
Who should your dad
and I side with, huh?

159
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,039
Mom.

160
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:16,200
Well...

161
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,440
Nothing can happen between us.

162
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:39,320
