=Episode 16=

7
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:41,159
You dare talk?

8
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:43,840
You disappeared three years
without a word,

9
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,439
only to bring back this trash.

10
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:47,320
And now you stop me?

11
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:47,799
You…

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,200
Oh, you…

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,200
Mom.

14
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,039
Dad.

15
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:58,640
I was only worried Ye Yunzhou
might hurt you.

16
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:00,039
I was never protecting him.

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,959
You always taught me to repay kindness.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,519
Bai Zhitao saved you.

19
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:11,599
I have to pay her back.

20
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,159
And I didn't want you to know.

21
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:16,799
I didn't want you to worry about me.

22
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,400
Silly girl.

23
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:21,439
Not telling us wasn't going

24
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,959
to stop us from worrying.

25
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:24,079
You were gone for three years.

26
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:25,159
We nearly lost our minds!

27
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,200
Look at you.

28
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,879
Your three brothers are all amazing,

29
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:30,200
and you went and picked this…

30
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,400
I want to know that too.

31
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:32,400
What?

32
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,840
Mom,

33
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:37,799
I'm done with Ye Yunzhou.

34
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:39,480
There's no reason
to go after him anymore.

35
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,959
Of course there is!

36
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,959
No one in this world
messes with my daughter!

37
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:45,640
Fine, then let's do it.

38
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,280
We'll dig up his ancestors
and scatter their ashes.

39
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,239
Xi,

40
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,040
remember this.

41
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,959
You deserve the very best
this world has to offer.

42
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,159
That Ye-whatever-his-name-is
means nothing.

43
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,519
Dad, Mom,

44
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:07,200
from now on,

45
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,960
I'll handle my own problems.

46
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,800
All right.

47
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,840
But if you ever get into trouble,
tell me.

48
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,400
I'll always have your back.

49
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,560
I know, Mom.

50
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,879
Oh, and your oldest
and second brothers…

51
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,159
Dongfang Zhan?

52
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,520
Where are you going?

53
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,439
Dad, Mom, get some rest!

54
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,400
I'm going to find Zhan!

55
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,280
Mommy, I want him to be my brother.

56
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,360
It's okay.

57
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,759
I'll teach you how to swim.

58
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:01,599
In the water,
all your worries wash away.

59
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,000
I gave you my jade pendant,

60
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,639
now you belong to me.

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,360
Come home with me.

62
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,240
It's time to change the string
on your pendant.

63
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,960
I don't want to change it.

64
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,919
I'll see you later.

65
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:31,800
You know where to find me.

66
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,199
I must've kept you waiting.

67
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,759
It's enough that you showed up.

68
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:39,439
Let's go home then.

69
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:45,479
That's exactly what you said
the first time we met.

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,199
Remember?

71
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,840
You want to know
what I wanted to tell you.

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'll tell you now.

73
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,000
20 years ago,

74
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:08,039
because you chose me,

75
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:10,680
I became who I am today.

76
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,879
So I want to tell you,

77
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,079
I want to be your only choice.

78
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,160
Zhan…

79
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,600
Not as your second brother.

80
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:24,680
As Dongfang Zhan.

81
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,759
(Zhan has already left.)

82
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:41,639
Zhan.

83
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,399
Sorry.

84
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:49,079
Something came up today.

85
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:51,079
By the time I got to the pool,
it was too late.

86
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,240
I missed you.

87
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,720
What did you want to tell me?

88
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,000
I wanted to say…

89
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
I wanted to say…

90
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,399
You missed me,

91
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,800
but it's okay now.

92
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,560
It's late. Where are you headed?

93
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,759
I have something to take care of.

94
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,000
I'll be back soon.

95
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,279
I didn't expect you to show up.

96
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,439
Ye Yunzhou.

97
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,360
Your tricks are getting
more childish by the day.

98
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,480
Listen up.

99
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,319
That video you have
won't intimidate anyone.

100
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:52,240
Really?

101
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,959
Then why are you here?

102
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,600
Dongfang Zhan,

103
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:01,000
the Dongfang Group belongs
to Dongfang Yan now.

104
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:03,199
Your woman belongs to him too.

105
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,879
You lost it all.

106
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,959
All those championships you won,

107
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,639
what do they matter now?

108
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,439
You know why you keep failing?

109
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,279
Why?

110
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,399
Because you stick your nose
where it doesn't belong.

111
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:19,879
I'm going to make

112
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:21,720
the whole world see

113
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,759
Dongfang Xi getting close
to her brother.

114
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,759
If only I'd noticed sooner…

115
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,160
Dongfang Zhan, please be safe.

116
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,079
A woman's reputation is more fragile
than anything.

117
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,959
It's so easy to destroy.

118
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,839
No matter how powerful her family is,

119
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,759
one dirty rumor can ruin her.

120
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:57,519
This world's cruel to women

121
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,759
because of people like you!

122
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,399
You're playing with fire!

123
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,079
I…

124
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,759
I'm going to post that video right now!

125
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,920
I'll ruin Dongfang Xi!

126
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:39,080
