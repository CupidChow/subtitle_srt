7
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:42,320
Do you know about diamond burials?

8
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:47,560
After cremation, 2% carbon remains

9
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,679
in human ashes,

10
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,479
which can be refined into diamonds.

11
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:59,840
It's true that I'm with Yunzhou.

12
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,200
And this is Yunzhou.

13
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,799
(I'm the female lead in this novel.)

14
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,120
(Why is my story)

15
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,239
(all garbled now?)

16
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,200
Yunzhou!

17
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:27,560
I'm so scared.

18
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,519
I think this world is all fake.

19
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,079
But my love for you is true.

20
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,079
Since you love me so deeply,

21
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:45,760
could you do me this one last favor?

22
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:46,799
Sure.

23
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:48,840
I'll do anything for you.

24
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:36,000
Ye Yunzhou was the beloved

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,319
you were with all this time.

26
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,319
How could you kill him?

27
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,520
He was nothing but mere words.

28
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,240
I'm the female lead in the novel.

29
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:47,879
Career.

30
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:48,919
Wealth.

31
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,199
They all should be mine.

32
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,199
He had himself to blame

33
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:54,560
for not dying as set by the plot.

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,360
That was why the novel got destroyed.

35
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,319
I'm going to restart the plot.

36
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,319
I want everyone

37
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,159
to be good and get back on track!

38
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,360
Dongfang Xi.

39
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:13,159
You should feel lucky

40
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,759
that you've had
the Dongfangs' protection.

41
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,840
It took me ten years

42
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,159
just to approach you.

43
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,000
Bai Zhitao.

44
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,400
Open your eyes
and look around this world.

45
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,080
This is the real world,

46
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,199
not the novel.

47
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:31,840
What do you mean?

48
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,759
If this were the real world,

49
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,159
would Dongfang Yan have just vanished
for no reason over the past ten years?

50
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:46,680
I'll destroy the only thought
of Dongfang Yan

51
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,280
that you've been holding on to

52
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,479
completely.

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,039
Just like how you ruined my plot.

54
00:03:58,599 --> 00:03:59,400
Stop it!

55
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,759
Though you're Dongfang Group's

56
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,240
heiress...

57
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:07,000
Oh, no.

58
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,800
You're its CEO now.

59
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,080
This building

60
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,159
belongs to me now.

61
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:18,480
I'm the chairman here.

62
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:21,079
If you don't want to get fired,

63
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,319
do as I say.

64
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,160
Take everything away.

65
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,360
I'm from the Dongfang family.

66
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,879
Are you sure

67
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,680
you want to side with her?

68
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,720
Supporting characters

69
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,920
only exist to help the leads.

70
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,759
Nothing else matters.

71
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,879
In your story,

72
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:39,680
they're not the leads.

73
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,160
But they're the leads

74
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,720
in their own stories.

75
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,079
Well,

76
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:48,480
these people

77
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,680
are just referred to as "them"

78
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,040
in the novel.

79
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,160
And you

80
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:58,319
will be the key piece
that revives the novel.

81
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,079
Just like Ye Yunzhou,
you'll sacrifice yourself for me

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,600
to restart my story.

83
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:05,920
No!

84
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,040
I'm still

85
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,199
that kind and innocent female lead.

86
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,800
And you

87
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:20,680
that villainess

88
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,160
doomed to a tragic end.

89
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:24,199
But in someone else's story,

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,720
you're just another "her".

91
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,800
Dongfang Xi.

92
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,839
Have you heard of this?

93
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:32,959
Villains

94
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,560
die from talking too much!

95
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:37,319
But heroes die from arrogance!

96
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:47,425
(Addicted to Toxic Love)

97
00:05:52,025 --> 00:05:55,050
(Addicted to Toxic Love)

98
00:05:58,475 --> 00:06:00,787
(Addicted to Toxic Love)

99
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,439
(I can't get rid of this book.)

100
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:04,759
(And it doesn't burn.)

101
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,120
Xi.

102
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,160
We tried,

103
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,279
but we couldn't destroy this novel.

104
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,759
No matter what Dongfang Yan and I did,

105
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:14,279
we just couldn't get rid of this novel.

106
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,920
Who would've thought you,
the heroine, could do it?

107
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:20,000
What did you say?

108
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:24,439
My kind heroine,

109
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,920
how does it feel to ruin your own story?

110
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:06,720
Dongfang Yan!

111
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:12,360
Thank you for destroying the book

112
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,319
and bringing me back.

113
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:16,759
No way.

114
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:18,600
No way.

115
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,040
I'm the heroine...

116
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,639
I'm the heroine...

117
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,560
I'm the heroine...

118
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,600
Dongfang Yan.

119
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,680
I'm returning this world

120
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,800
and myself

121
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,720
to you.

122
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,360
You're done for.

123
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,560
You vanished for ten years,

124
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,639
without a single explanation.

125
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:10,680
Now you're suddenly home.

126
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,160
Mom and Dad will probably kick you out.

127
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,360
No matter what happens,

128
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,000
I'll take responsibility.

129
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:23,720
What a day it's been.

130
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,360
You're back, Yan.

131
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:29,279
Mom.

132
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,399
Here, let's have some tea.

133
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,799
Dongfang Chen.

134
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,600
Dongfang Chen!

135
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,000
Don't run!

136
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,440
Yan.

137
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,519
You're back.

138
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,399
You're back, Yan.

139
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,360
Yeah, I'm back.

140
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:50,840
I'm not leaving again.

141
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,440
It's rare to have
the whole family together.

142
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:57,679
Forget about

143
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:58,600
the tea.

144
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,159
Get me that bottle of wine
I've been keeping.

145
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:01,159
That one.

146
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:01,600
Hurry.

147
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,120
Yes.

148
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:02,720
We've got to drink tonight.

149
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,960
Talk some sense into your dad, Xi.

150
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,200
I've been reluctant to drink it.

151
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,890
But I'm happy tonight.

152
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:07,480
Coming.

153
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,120
Is it the one, Mom?

154
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,480
That's the one.

155
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:10,480
It's my precious one.

156
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,240
Come on.

157
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:12,799
We'll have it today.

158
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:13,559
Let's just do as Dad says.

159
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,240
One, two.

160
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,600
