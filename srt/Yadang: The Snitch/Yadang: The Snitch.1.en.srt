00:01:10,735 --> 00:01:11,986
I knew that addict was trouble.

3
00:01:12,069 --> 00:01:14,652
Det. Cha, grab him!
He put his mouth on it!

4
00:01:14,735 --> 00:01:16,985
Jerk! Why can't you just stay still!

5
00:01:17,985 --> 00:01:20,611
Let me drink some water!

6
00:01:20,694 --> 00:01:21,569
What a show.

7
00:01:21,652 --> 00:01:22,920
Dammit, why won't you let me drink?

8
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,277
Okay, fine, you'll slip!

9
00:01:30,485 --> 00:01:31,944
Who's the client?

10
00:01:32,027 --> 00:01:34,444
Oh Jae-chul, the son of
Dongin Milling's chairman.

11
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:36,902
<i>This prick asked for you
as soon as he got here.</i>

12
00:01:36,985 --> 00:01:37,902

13
00:01:37,985 --> 00:01:39,194
Congrats.

14
00:01:39,277 --> 00:01:40,194
Nice!

15
00:01:40,277 --> 00:01:43,069
I'm better than some random lawyer.

16
00:01:43,152 --> 00:01:44,486
Any priors?

17
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:45,777
<i>Three for the same crime,</i>

18

<i>one year of probation left.</i>

19
00:01:47,235 --> 00:01:49,902
<i>We got him spooked
with possession for sale,</i>

20
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:50,986
so, put a bow on it.

21
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,527
Putting a bow on him is hardly enough!

22
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,361
We got a VIP on the hook.

23
00:01:56,444 --> 00:01:57,902
We need to dream big.

24
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:08,235
You don't look like a dealer.

25
00:02:09,194 --> 00:02:11,694
How'd you end up carrying 500g around?

26
00:02:11,777 --> 00:02:13,944
Captain! How much is 500g worth?

27
00:02:14,027 --> 00:02:15,360
About five years.

28
00:02:16,777 --> 00:02:17,777
That's long...

29
00:02:18,902 --> 00:02:20,152
Shut the hell up!

30
00:02:22,402 --> 00:02:23,610
Can you get me out?

31
00:02:25,402 --> 00:02:27,861
That depends on whether you, me,

32
00:02:27,944 --> 00:02:29,402
and those guys,

33
00:02:29,485 --> 00:02:31,735

34
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,777

35
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:37,569
Go big or go home!

36
00:02:39,735 --> 00:02:41,111
Okay!

37
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,444
Three dealers, $20K each!

38
00:02:43,527 --> 00:02:44,694
Amount in kilos!

39
00:02:44,777 --> 00:02:45,944
How many kilos?

40
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,652
Two kilos.

41
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:48,819
$50K per kilo.

42
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:49,777
So, $100K,

43
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,861
$160K in total with the three heads.

44
00:02:51,944 --> 00:02:53,235
In Bitcoins.

45
00:02:56,402 --> 00:02:59,027
Buddy, got that?

46
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:01,027
In Bitcoins.

47
00:03:03,444 --> 00:03:05,111
I'll leave the amount to you.

48
00:03:05,194 --> 00:03:07,152
Okay, okay!

49
00:03:07,985 --> 00:03:09,986
Enough drugs for 66,000 users,

50
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:11,569
a major drug ring busted!

51
00:03:12,902 --> 00:03:14,069
You get the media coverage,

52
00:03:15,235 --> 00:03:17,485
and you get to go home.

53
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:28,069
Okay.

54
00:03:32,194 --> 00:03:34,902
- Dammit!
- What the heck, man?

55
00:03:34,985 --> 00:03:36,611
Yo!

56
00:03:36,694 --> 00:03:37,777
Back up!

57
00:03:40,152 --> 00:03:41,194
Move your car, buddy!

58
00:03:41,277 --> 00:03:42,444
Goddammit...

59
00:03:44,027 --> 00:03:45,652
Move your damn truck!

60
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:51,152
You sure lack some manners, right?

61
00:03:51,235 --> 00:03:54,902
You could've given me
a call after your release,

62
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,110
but I guess that's not so easy.

63
00:03:58,485 --> 00:04:01,152
Even while doing business as usual.

64
00:04:02,902 --> 00:04:04,277
No, not this, dude!

65
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,610
How much came in?

66
00:04:06,777 --> 00:04:08,111
Three kilos?

67
00:04:08,193 --> 00:04:09,277
Lose two, alright?

68
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,652
If I lose 2/3 of it, how
can I afford to eat?

69
00:04:14,735 --> 00:04:18,193
The world's longest-living addicts

70
00:04:18,277 --> 00:04:19,693
are Korean addicts.

71
00:04:19,777 --> 00:04:20,652
How could that be?

72
00:04:20,735 --> 00:04:23,943
Because the cops lock you up

73
00:04:24,027 --> 00:04:26,486
before you overdose.

74
00:04:26,568 --> 00:04:28,652
Wanna go detox for a bit?

75
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,693
Chang-rak, stop cutting it!

76
00:04:33,777 --> 00:04:35,610
How can you reach the top like this?

77
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,777
Fine, what do you want?

78
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,611
Get me three scapegoats.

79
00:04:40,693 --> 00:04:45,611
Not just possession,
but dealers and mules.

80
00:04:45,693 --> 00:04:47,818
Wrap them up nicely.

83
00:04:54,693 --> 00:04:55,943

84
00:04:57,985 --> 00:05:01,485
Here, check the merch.

85
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:03,735

86
00:05:05,068 --> 00:05:06,068
Thank you.

87
00:05:08,277 --> 00:05:10,777
Okay, that's 2kg.

88

- Go, go, go.
- Let's go, baby!

89
00:05:17,652 --> 00:05:19,361

90
00:05:19,443 --> 00:05:20,693
I'm sorry!

91
00:05:21,902 --> 00:05:25,235
Could you step out and
check the damage?

92
00:05:25,985 --> 00:05:27,110
Hold up a sec!

93
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,235
- What?
- Wait, don't get out.

94
00:05:30,318 --> 00:05:31,652
Why? What's up?

95
00:05:31,735 --> 00:05:32,902
Stay focused.

96
00:05:32,985 --> 00:05:34,902
Something feels off.

97
00:05:38,402 --> 00:05:40,235

98

Dude, let's get the heck out of here!

99
00:05:43,568 --> 00:05:45,027

00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,110

- Block him!

101
00:05:50,902 --> 00:05:53,236

- Open the door, you pricks!

102

This is advice from your new brother.

361
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,110

a needle in your arm,

00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:29,069

00:20:29,527 --> 00:20:30,694
Dammit, it's raining...

365
00:20:30,777 --> 00:20:31,694
<i>3 years later, present day</i>

366
00:20:31,777 --> 00:20:33,485
how far up are we going?

367
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:36,319
Evening, Captain!

368
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:39,402
They've been like this for hours,

369
00:20:39,485 --> 00:20:41,527
they won't respond
no matter what I say!

370
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,236
- Get in here!
- Yes, sir!

371
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:45,902
- You're getting all wet!
- Sorry, sir.

372
00:20:45,985 --> 00:20:47,069
- Hold it!
- Yes, sir!

373
00:20:48,027 --> 00:20:49,777
They won't listen!

374
00:20:51,902 --> 00:20:53,652
Miss, open up!

375
00:20:54,985 --> 00:20:57,736
You have the right to retain a lawyer

376
00:20:57,819 --> 00:20:59,694
and remain silent!

377
00:21:00,277 --> 00:21:04,235
No response, I'll handle it my way!

378
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,361
You have to do something.

379
00:21:07,444 --> 00:21:08,777
Boss, the tow truck is here.

380
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,735
Please take care of it right away!

381
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:19,777
Get going!

382
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,069
Wait, please wait...

383
00:21:23,152 --> 00:21:25,736
What do I do?

384
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:27,110
It's positive.

385
00:21:28,194 --> 00:21:29,902
I was just told...

386
00:21:31,902 --> 00:21:34,985
it was a diet pill...

387
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:38,860
I'm preparing for a movie,

388
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,944
I didn't know it was bad.

389
00:21:41,027 --> 00:21:44,319
Here we go again, the same old excuse.

390
00:21:44,402 --> 00:21:46,985
I've heard all that already.

391
00:21:50,235 --> 00:21:51,735
Who gave you the diet pills?

392
00:21:53,194 --> 00:21:56,610
If you stay silent, I won't
be able to help you.

393
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:01,027
Wait, I know that guy.

394
00:22:01,694 --> 00:22:04,194
He was charged for drug use
two years ago and got probation.

395
00:22:04,277 --> 00:22:05,777
- Yeah, him...
- His name is...

396
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,486
Yoo-something, Yoo...

397
00:22:07,569 --> 00:22:09,027
Yeah, something like that.

398
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,319
What's his name?

399
00:22:16,277 --> 00:22:19,069
Yoo Min-gu... Yoo Se-young...

400
00:22:19,694 --> 00:22:20,569
Got it.

401
00:22:20,652 --> 00:22:22,027
Yoo Ji-sung.

402
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,402
Yoo Ji-sung?

403
00:22:23,485 --> 00:22:25,527
The son of Ilmoon Construction
chairman, right?

404
00:22:26,152 --> 00:22:27,944
Yes, you're right!

405
00:22:29,694 --> 00:22:33,152
You don't know my name, huh?

406
00:22:35,152 --> 00:22:37,611
Capt. Oh Sang-jae, Narcotics Unit 2.

407
00:22:37,694 --> 00:22:39,819
But the addicts call me "Jade Emperor."

408
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:42,027
If I catch you, I'll
bury you in charges

409
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,402
and lock you up for life.

410
00:22:45,527 --> 00:22:46,569
Should I make the call?

411
00:22:46,652 --> 00:22:49,152
One call, and the reporters
will swarm in like vultures.

412
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:52,069
How about we walk
the photo line together?

413
00:22:57,069 --> 00:22:58,694
- Uncuff her.
- Sure.

414
00:23:04,152 --> 00:23:05,402
Your head must be spinning.

415
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:07,944
Wondering who you can talk
about and who you can't.

416
00:23:08,027 --> 00:23:09,236
Don't overthink it.

417
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:10,527
If we catch someone,

418
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:12,444
they'll rat you out.

419
00:23:12,527 --> 00:23:14,611
"Uhm Su-jin! The actress!"

420
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:16,319
If it gets to that point,

421
00:23:16,402 --> 00:23:19,444
I absolutely can't help you!

422
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,235
People like you, Su-jin,

423
00:23:25,944 --> 00:23:27,652
if you just tell the truth,

424
00:23:27,735 --> 00:23:29,277
I'll let you go home.

425
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,736
Instead, I catch the dealer.

426
00:23:31,819 --> 00:23:35,069
Catch 100 users, and there'll
be 100 more the next day.

427
00:23:35,152 --> 00:23:37,861
Then 100 becomes 200, then 400.

428
00:23:37,944 --> 00:23:40,069
Where did it all start from?

429
00:23:40,569 --> 00:23:43,027
The dealer who supplied the drugs.

430
00:23:44,485 --> 00:23:48,360
Who gave you the drugs?

431
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,610
<i>Seoul Eastern Prosecutors' Office</i>

432
00:24:14,027 --> 00:24:15,361
Prosecutor.

433
00:24:15,444 --> 00:24:16,569
Prosecutor.

434
00:24:17,485 --> 00:24:19,611
Chief Prosecutor!

435
00:24:19,694 --> 00:24:21,235
Kang-su! Come here.

436
00:24:23,027 --> 00:24:24,277
Isn't it here?

437
00:24:27,069 --> 00:24:32,194
<i>For next year's
presidential election...</i>

438
00:24:32,277 --> 00:24:34,236
Bro, what is this place?

439
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:35,944
It's called an attached office.

440
00:24:36,027 --> 00:24:38,194
Not just anyone can enter here.

441
00:24:39,027 --> 00:24:42,194
This is where we investigate
VIPs like conglomerate chairmen,

442
00:24:42,277 --> 00:24:43,111
and former presidents.

443
00:24:43,194 --> 00:24:45,111
We grill them in the interrogation room

444
00:24:45,194 --> 00:24:47,694
and then baby them here unofficially.

445
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:50,194
This place is not for regular folks,

446
00:24:50,277 --> 00:24:51,694
you're in the VIP room.

447
00:24:52,902 --> 00:24:56,319
I'm a VIP, right? Unofficial VIP.

448
00:24:58,027 --> 00:24:59,610
Nice!

449
00:25:01,694 --> 00:25:05,194
You have to climb high.

450
00:25:07,819 --> 00:25:10,236
And look down at the entire view.

451
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:12,402
It feels empowering.

452
00:25:12,485 --> 00:25:13,527
It feels good?

453
00:25:16,902 --> 00:25:18,027
Kang-su.

454
00:25:18,735 --> 00:25:20,485
Sometimes, when I look out,

455
00:25:21,735 --> 00:25:24,444
I feel like I'm dangling off
the edge of this railing,

456
00:25:24,527 --> 00:25:26,194
about to drop.

457
00:25:26,277 --> 00:25:28,694
It's very anxiety-inducing.

458
00:25:29,735 --> 00:25:31,194
Christ!

459
00:25:31,277 --> 00:25:33,027
If you fall from here, you're doomed.

460
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:37,736
That's why I hold on for my dear life!

461
00:25:37,819 --> 00:25:40,319
So, you have to do well, you punk.

462
00:25:45,235 --> 00:25:47,902
You know what I mean?
We all need to do well.

463
00:25:51,402 --> 00:25:53,736
Come on, man.

464
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:55,819
Why worry about stuff like that?

465
00:25:55,902 --> 00:25:57,986
Bro, just keep looking up.

466
00:25:58,069 --> 00:25:59,819
I'll give you my full support.

467
00:26:01,152 --> 00:26:03,652
Alright, I'm counting on you.

468
00:26:04,569 --> 00:26:07,152
Let's aim for the Special
Investigation Unit.

469
00:26:07,235 --> 00:26:09,902
Oh damn, dude!

470
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,902
Now that's confidence!

471
00:26:14,152 --> 00:26:15,444
One sec.

472
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:25,319
This isn't anything special...

473
00:26:25,402 --> 00:26:27,027
Open it.

474
00:26:29,985 --> 00:26:30,985
A lighter?

475
00:26:31,027 --> 00:26:35,194
If you're going all the way
to the Central District SIU,

476
00:26:35,277 --> 00:26:38,027
you need to smoke even
your cigarettes in style!

477
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:42,277
Use this until retirement.

478
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,777
Look good doing it.

479
00:26:45,735 --> 00:26:46,986
Okay, thanks.

480
00:26:47,069 --> 00:26:49,985
And this one's mine.

481
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:54,569
It's a matching set?

482
00:26:59,194 --> 00:27:00,236
What's that?

483
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:02,152
This stuff is called "Blue."

484
00:27:02,235 --> 00:27:04,361
It's only available
to the real big shots.

485
00:27:04,444 --> 00:27:06,944
100% pure North Korean meth.

486
00:27:07,027 --> 00:27:10,694
Low-level addicts can't
even dream of this stuff.

487
00:27:10,777 --> 00:27:12,819
The price is insane, oh man...

488
00:27:13,944 --> 00:27:15,736
Come on, tell me, what's the deal?

489
00:27:15,819 --> 00:27:17,319
- The thing is,
- Yeah?

490
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:22,319
a guy was caught with 500g
of this stuff last week.

491
00:27:22,985 --> 00:27:26,402
I brokered a deal with
the police on his behalf,

492
00:27:27,235 --> 00:27:28,610
his name is Oh Jae-chul.

493
00:27:29,485 --> 00:27:30,860
<i>The Dongin Milling heir.</i>

494
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:34,569
Hm?

495
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:36,861
I smell a hint of something baking.

496
00:27:36,944 --> 00:27:40,444
Bro, this isn't baking,

497
00:27:40,527 --> 00:27:43,610
it's gasoline leaking
everywhere at the gas stop!

498
00:27:44,277 --> 00:27:45,569
If you just...

499
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,069
light it...

500
00:27:48,152 --> 00:27:49,611
Kaboom!

501
00:27:49,694 --> 00:27:51,777
Central District SIU for you,

502
00:27:52,652 --> 00:27:54,860
and I go national.

503
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,277
So who's the guy
spilling all this gasoline?

504
00:27:59,652 --> 00:28:00,319
Yeom...

505
00:28:00,402 --> 00:28:06,152
Mr. Yeom, but I don't
know his full name.

506
00:28:06,235 --> 00:28:08,319
Daegu gangster Yeom Tae-su.

507
00:28:09,819 --> 00:28:11,111
Got Gyeongsang-do dialect.

508
00:28:11,194 --> 00:28:12,194
Yes.

509
00:28:20,527 --> 00:28:22,402
Exactly 4.5 kilos.

510
00:28:22,902 --> 00:28:24,944
500g melted in her stomach.

511
00:28:27,027 --> 00:28:28,610
- Madam.
- What is it?

512
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,152
Let's go bigger.

513
00:28:31,235 --> 00:28:33,235
Stop messing with the goods.

514
00:28:34,027 --> 00:28:35,944
Now you're being picky about your food.

515
00:28:38,735 --> 00:28:40,652
- Then you can do it yourself.
- Huh?

516
00:28:40,735 --> 00:28:42,902
Put it in your damn stomach.

517
00:28:42,985 --> 00:28:44,652
You prick!

518
00:28:46,277 --> 00:28:47,485
Boss!

519
00:28:49,902 --> 00:28:51,027
Sons of guns!

520
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,152
Put that down!

521
00:28:54,527 --> 00:28:55,402
Fat jerk.

522
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:57,902
Should I continue?

523
00:29:00,194 --> 00:29:01,360
Sons of guns.

524
00:29:03,194 --> 00:29:04,902
Call that even for the missing 500g

525
00:29:04,985 --> 00:29:07,110
with his medical bills.

526
00:29:15,985 --> 00:29:20,486
Did you see Kim Hak-nam flinch,
trying to keep a straight face?

527
00:29:20,569 --> 00:29:22,485
Should we dip her one of these days?

528
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:25,319
You think her boys will stay quietly?

529
00:29:25,402 --> 00:29:27,527
We need to ship her off
to prison like her brothers,

530
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:30,152
so that we can deal Yamamoto's goods.

531
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,861
<i>Boss, we'll block him up front.</i>

532
00:29:34,944 --> 00:29:36,110
<i>Just hit him.</i>

533
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:38,986
We hit him when they reach Namdong.

534
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:40,235
Stay on his tail.

535
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:50,777
<i>Mr. Yeom Tae-su! Seems
like you've lost your edge!</i>

536
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,819
<i>You got pigs lined up behind you.</i>

537
00:29:54,194 --> 00:29:55,610
Isn't that Jade Emperor?

538
00:29:57,944 --> 00:29:58,861
Who the hell?

539
00:29:58,944 --> 00:30:00,444
There's no time to look back!

540
00:30:00,527 --> 00:30:03,319
<i>Get out of here, I'll cover you!</i>

541
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:05,735
- Turn the car around!
- Dammit!

542
00:30:11,569 --> 00:30:12,735
What the hell?!

543
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,027
Get out of the way!

544
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:15,986
Who are you?

545
00:30:16,069 --> 00:30:17,861
I'm Yamamoto's family!

546
00:30:17,944 --> 00:30:20,235
- Yamamoto?
- That son of a gun!

547
00:30:25,402 --> 00:30:26,569
You punk!

548
00:30:27,235 --> 00:30:29,361
No time for chitchat,
get to Namdong Station!

549
00:30:29,444 --> 00:30:30,694
Hurry!

550
00:30:30,777 --> 00:30:32,610
- Go to Namdong Station!
- Dammit!

551
00:30:36,735 --> 00:30:38,527
Look up 15RU8649!

552
00:30:41,235 --> 00:30:42,777
You son of a gun!

553
00:30:50,777 --> 00:30:52,069
<i>Yeom is pulling over!</i>

554
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,444
He's stopping at Namdong Station!

555
00:30:54,527 --> 00:30:56,194
- Don't get caught.
- Yes, sir!

556
00:30:56,277 --> 00:30:57,652
Get going!

557
00:30:58,277 --> 00:30:59,485
Out of my way!

558
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:05,610
- Which way?
- Inside the station!

559
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:08,152
What's your deal?

560
00:31:08,235 --> 00:31:09,777
We can intro in person later,

561
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,569
<i>head to platform 3, gate 4-2,</i>

562
00:31:12,652 --> 00:31:14,652
your guardian angel is there.

563
00:31:14,735 --> 00:31:16,277
I'll see you there.

564
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,236
Are you running?

565
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:18,569
Run, run!

566
00:31:18,652 --> 00:31:20,194
<i>One, two, one, two!</i>

567
00:31:20,277 --> 00:31:22,819
- Request support!
- You guys take the other side!

568
00:31:25,235 --> 00:31:26,902
4-2, 4-2...

569
00:31:30,735 --> 00:31:32,027
Move!

572
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,361
Police! Police!

573
00:31:38,444 --> 00:31:39,736
Make way! Make way!

574
00:31:39,819 --> 00:31:41,777
We're the police!

575
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:49,819
Put it down!

576
00:31:49,902 --> 00:31:52,444
Come at me!

577
00:32:00,694 --> 00:32:02,319
Don't be cheeky, and put that down!

578
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,110
Out of the way! Now!

579
00:32:15,402 --> 00:32:16,902
Yeom, put it down!

580
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,360
Mr. Yeom Tae-su?

581
00:32:20,944 --> 00:32:21,944
Yeah, you're him.

582
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:26,902
- What the hell?
- Get him!

583
00:32:30,944 --> 00:32:33,069
We're from the Prosecutors' Office!

584
00:32:34,069 --> 00:32:35,444
Prosecutors' Office!

585
00:32:36,402 --> 00:32:37,152
You're a prosecutor?

586
00:32:37,235 --> 00:32:38,235
Yes.

587
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,527
That gives you the right
to snatch away suspects?

588
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:45,944
There seems to be some
misunderstanding.

589
00:32:46,027 --> 00:32:49,861
We've been staking
this guy out for days!

590
00:32:49,944 --> 00:32:51,652
Thank you for your hard work.

591
00:32:52,194 --> 00:32:53,527
We have a warrant, see?

592
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:54,652
Let's go.

593
00:32:54,735 --> 00:32:58,944
Is this some kind of
joke? What's going on?

594
00:32:59,902 --> 00:33:00,819
Bro!

595
00:33:00,902 --> 00:33:03,527
Hey, isn't that the guy
we saw in the car?

596
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:04,652
Yes, that's him!

597
00:33:04,735 --> 00:33:06,236
His name is Lee Kang-su,

598
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:08,110
he's on the rise as a snitch lately.

599
00:33:08,985 --> 00:33:11,860
These guys are trying
to cherry pick my case.

600
00:33:18,194 --> 00:33:19,236
Hi.

601
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:20,819
I told you we'd intro in person.

602
00:33:20,902 --> 00:33:23,027
Are you the one who snitched on me?

603
00:33:23,694 --> 00:33:25,319
You already know the answer.

604
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:29,694
You've been keeping busy outside.

605
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:33,277
You should head inside
and get some rest.

606
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,944
- Think of it as vacation.
- Sir.

607
00:33:35,027 --> 00:33:38,236
How many years will you ask for? Five?

608
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:39,902
No.

609
00:33:39,985 --> 00:33:43,819
Smuggling, illegal trade,
usage, and possession.

610
00:33:43,902 --> 00:33:45,485
Those are at least seven years.

611
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:50,319
If I feel like it, I could
push for up to 15 years.

612
00:33:53,277 --> 00:33:54,485
That's long.

613
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:58,819
So, how about we wrap
this up officially here?

614
00:33:59,735 --> 00:34:03,111
Or should we have a
private conversation?

615
00:34:03,194 --> 00:34:04,111
<i>Investigation Cooperation Agreement</i>

616
00:34:04,194 --> 00:34:06,735

<i>Oh Sang-jae</i>

618
00:34:32,069 --> 00:34:33,402
Here's an idea.

619
00:34:33,485 --> 00:34:35,569
Why don't you take the lead?

620
00:34:36,527 --> 00:34:38,069
Take the lead?

621
00:34:38,152 --> 00:34:41,444
When you meet anyone
here, just give me a call.

622
00:34:41,527 --> 00:34:42,736
They'll never know.

623
00:34:42,819 --> 00:34:45,027
You won't get into any trouble.

624
00:34:45,777 --> 00:34:47,319
You can trust me on that.

625
00:34:55,277 --> 00:34:56,111
Where are you?

626
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:58,027
<i>I'll really be safe, right?</i>

627
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:00,444
<i>Just tell me the
location, and slip out.</i>

00:35:00,527 --> 00:35:01,861
Laura Hill Hotel.

629
00:35:01,944 --> 00:35:04,277
Laura Hill Hotel! Move!

630
00:35:05,235 --> 00:35:06,944
Stay sharp and stay focused!

631
00:35:22,902 --> 00:35:25,027
Where are you going? Let's head inside.

632
00:35:27,485 --> 00:35:30,986
I'm suddenly not feeling well,

633
00:35:31,069 --> 00:35:32,444
I think I'll go home and rest.

634
00:35:32,527 --> 00:35:33,527
Hey.

635
00:35:34,527 --> 00:35:36,152
See that geezer in blue?

636
00:35:36,235 --> 00:35:39,486
That guy helped our father a lot.

637
00:35:39,569 --> 00:35:42,277
And he really wants to meet you.

638
00:35:46,485 --> 00:35:50,319
Baby, today's really not
good, next time, please?

639
00:35:50,402 --> 00:35:53,486
Hey, Su-jin, Uhm Su-jin.

640
00:35:53,569 --> 00:35:56,569
You can't get sick
when you feel like it.

641
00:36:02,069 --> 00:36:04,361
So cute, great acting.

642
00:36:04,444 --> 00:36:06,277
You could be the headliner now.

643
00:36:13,069 --> 00:36:14,527
So pretty.

644
00:36:15,819 --> 00:36:19,027
You suddenly want to come along, right?

645
00:36:25,944 --> 00:36:28,902
Alright, Laura Hill Hotel.

646
00:36:28,985 --> 00:36:31,527
We're here, get out.

647
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:33,361
If I see you again,
you're as good as dead.

648
00:36:33,444 --> 00:36:34,486
Got that?

649
00:36:34,569 --> 00:36:37,152
You'll need to take a number for that.

650
00:36:37,235 --> 00:36:40,194
But I'm not sure if your
turn will come in time.

651
00:36:43,944 --> 00:36:45,902
You're #236.

652
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:49,777
Safety first, be careful out there.

653
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,736
- Let's get ready.
- Yes, sir!

654
00:36:51,819 --> 00:36:53,485
- Let's move!
- Hurry!

655
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,360
Sir.

656
00:36:55,902 --> 00:36:57,235
I'll take my leave now.

657
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:00,319
Alright, good work, let's meet often.

658
00:37:11,444 --> 00:37:13,444
- Hey!
- Yeah, bro!

659
00:37:13,527 --> 00:37:15,194
If you're ready, let's head in!

660
00:37:16,194 --> 00:37:17,652
Okay, let's go!

661
00:37:42,819 --> 00:37:45,277
These people are just partying here!

662
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,569
We can just have fun on our own.

663
00:37:47,652 --> 00:37:48,777
How much?

664
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,694
- A ton!
- Dope!

665
00:38:05,902 --> 00:38:07,902
So beautiful!

666
00:38:09,027 --> 00:38:09,944
Yo!

667
00:38:10,027 --> 00:38:10,861
You again.

668
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:13,694
I was about to call you.

669
00:38:13,777 --> 00:38:15,360
Care for any?

670
00:38:43,485 --> 00:38:46,069
It's a show.

671
00:38:52,277 --> 00:38:55,111
- What's up?
- Call an ambulance for her!

672
00:38:55,194 --> 00:38:57,434
- Call an ambulance for her!
- Call an ambulance for her!

673
00:39:04,277 --> 00:39:05,485

674
00:39:06,152 --> 00:39:07,902
Let's get a move on.

675
00:39:07,985 --> 00:39:10,110
- Move!
- What the hell, man!

676
00:39:11,402 --> 00:39:12,777
Hey, dad.

677
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:15,694
How do I know which
agency they're from?

678
00:39:17,069 --> 00:39:19,694
But can they really barge in like this?

679
00:39:21,694 --> 00:39:22,777
Who are you guys?

680
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,694
So, you're the boss around here, huh?

681
00:39:24,777 --> 00:39:26,361
A handsome fellow.

682
00:39:26,444 --> 00:39:29,194
How about we get you on TV?

683
00:39:41,152 --> 00:39:43,027
They're already bringing them out!

684
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:45,319

685
00:39:45,402 --> 00:39:46,628
It's those Eastern District guys again.

686
00:39:46,652 --> 00:39:48,652
We've got to make a living too!

687
00:39:48,735 --> 00:39:50,069
What's going on?

688
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,694
You got a warrant?

689
00:39:53,277 --> 00:39:55,902

00:40:00,735 --> 00:40:02,736
- Captain, please don't.
- Get your hands off me!

693
00:40:02,819 --> 00:40:04,985
Sir, you'll get in trouble,
please calm down!

694

695
00:40:08,694 --> 00:40:09,777

696
00:40:20,694 --> 00:40:23,277

697
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,486
These boars have such sharp instincts.

698
00:40:26,569 --> 00:40:28,402
Give me a call so we can grab a drink.

699
00:40:28,485 --> 00:40:30,944
- Sure thing.
- Make sure to call me this time.

00:40:31,569 --> 00:40:33,152

conduct an investigation?

702

704

- It's dangerous! Get back!

of this really matters.

708
00:40:59,694 --> 00:41:01,111
Stop the car!

709
00:41:01,194 --> 00:41:02,486
Let go of me!

our candidate won't just
sit idly by, I guarantee it.

726
00:42:00,902 --> 00:42:05,610
Build this connection,
help him out a bit, and...

727
00:42:08,027 --> 00:42:09,860
things will turn out
even better for you.

728
00:42:29,402 --> 00:42:30,527
Sir.

729
00:42:36,402 --> 00:42:40,569
<i>Nothing happened at Laura Hill Hotel.</i>

730
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:45,110
Then, should I kill him?

731
00:42:47,444 --> 00:42:50,110
Your words could
get you in big trouble.

732
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,830
<i>The number you are
dialing is unavailable...</i>

733
00:42:52,902 --> 00:42:56,069
Bro, why aren't you picking
up? I'm on my way to the bar.

734
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:58,902
Just wrap things up
and come over, okay?

735
00:42:58,985 --> 00:43:00,861
I know you got nothing to do.

736
00:43:00,944 --> 00:43:02,694
Don't your underlings do all the work?

737
00:43:04,652 --> 00:43:06,485
That was easier than hitting a deer.

738
00:43:11,402 --> 00:43:12,961
We're from the Eastern
Prosecutors' Office.

739
00:43:12,985 --> 00:43:14,465
- Why are you here?
- Please sit down.

740
00:43:14,527 --> 00:43:15,986
Captain, why are these people here?

741
00:43:16,069 --> 00:43:17,527
We have a search warrant.

742
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:18,711
What's up? Why are you here?

743
00:43:18,735 --> 00:43:19,736
Hands off.

744
00:43:19,819 --> 00:43:21,486
In the course of our
drug investigation,

745
00:43:21,569 --> 00:43:25,152
Yeom Tae-su testified
that you took bribes.

746
00:43:31,944 --> 00:43:33,485
Kang-su!

747
00:43:34,152 --> 00:43:35,569
Hey man!

748
00:43:36,235 --> 00:43:38,194
I came to give you a drink.

749
00:43:38,277 --> 00:43:39,444
Don't touch me, prick!

750
00:43:39,527 --> 00:43:41,736
The veins pop out better
when you tense up.

751
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:45,277
Don't! Don't! No!

752
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,902
No! Don't!

753
00:43:46,985 --> 00:43:49,110

Sure.

Oh dear.

764
00:44:13,069 --> 00:44:14,902
My turn came up fast.

765
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:17,990
I told you I'd kill you
if I ever see you again.

766
00:44:18,485 --> 00:44:20,694

Get up, man!

00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:25,110
Please, don't...

I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

772
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:50,152
Almost done, hold up.

773
00:44:56,569 --> 00:44:57,985
That gasoline stinks.

774
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:15,069
No food, keep him on drugs
for a month, then toss him.

00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:23,003

00:45:29,569 --> 00:45:33,944
Enough, your attitude is all wrong!

780
00:45:34,027 --> 00:45:36,444
You think an addict even
realizes he's addicted?

00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:37,986
Chang-rak!

00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:40,402

- Dammit...
- Check it out.

784
00:45:43,902 --> 00:45:45,569
Quitting drugs is harder than

785
00:45:45,652 --> 00:45:47,402
getting it in the first place, idiot.

786
00:45:48,569 --> 00:45:50,069

You thought quitting drugs was easy?

You wanted to quit!

799
00:46:41,319 --> 00:46:44,485

800
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:48,694

<i>who's kept me here for a year.</i>

00:49:05,527 --> 00:49:10,360
Can I investigate and arrest
you based solely on a claim,

813
00:49:11,027 --> 00:49:15,694
by a criminal with
eight drug convictions?

814
00:49:15,777 --> 00:49:17,057
I will now announce the verdict.

815
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:20,360
The defendant, Oh
Sang-jae, is acquitted.

00:49:22,777 --> 00:49:24,527
See you at the Supreme Court.

822
00:49:43,527 --> 00:49:44,527
One moment.

823
00:49:45,527 --> 00:49:47,110
- You go on ahead.
- You're so pretty.

824
00:49:50,069 --> 00:49:51,069
Yes?

825
00:49:51,694 --> 00:49:53,777
You've read the letter
I sent, haven't you?

826
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:55,777
I understand that you were at

827
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,860
the Laura Hill Hotel
incident last year,

828
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,569
let's talk about that day.

829
00:49:59,652 --> 00:50:00,985
My apologies.

830
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:05,527
I heard there's a video
recorded from that day.

831
00:50:09,444 --> 00:50:11,361
Cho Sang-taek's son
was also there, right?

832
00:50:11,444 --> 00:50:12,361
What exactly do you want to know?

833
00:50:12,444 --> 00:50:13,694
What's with you?

834
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:17,819
Believing baseless claims made
by a drug dealer is what led to this,

835
00:50:17,902 --> 00:50:19,422
shouldn't you be uncovering the truth?

836
00:50:19,485 --> 00:50:20,319
Stop it.

837
00:50:20,402 --> 00:50:21,444

Prosecutor Ku, come in!

848
00:50:56,985 --> 00:51:00,110
Yeah, I know Park Hyun-sook,
the spokesperson.

00:51:00,652 --> 00:51:02,902
No need to respond,
just stay out of sight...

850
00:51:04,902 --> 00:51:07,902
No! I'll take care of it,

851
00:51:07,985 --> 00:51:10,735
just leave for a month and lay low!

852
00:51:13,027 --> 00:51:14,111
Yeah.

853
00:51:14,194 --> 00:51:17,402
Let's meet at Eclipse before you leave.

854
00:51:18,944 --> 00:51:22,944
This jerk just won't listen,
and just yaps away.

855
00:51:23,027 --> 00:51:26,236
I heard you asked for me,
my apologies for being late.

856
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:27,319
You're not late at all.

857
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:30,277
You're allowed to be, you're
a famous prosecutor.

858
00:51:34,069 --> 00:51:35,902
Late or not,

859
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:40,402
this Park Hyun-sook!

860
00:51:40,485 --> 00:51:43,194
The election is less than a month away,

861
00:51:43,277 --> 00:51:47,402
and she's poking around my
friends' work and homes.

862
00:51:48,027 --> 00:51:49,944
Yapping about the Laura
Hill from a year ago...

863
00:51:50,027 --> 00:51:50,819
<i>Arrest Warrant Denied for Cho Hoon</i>

864
00:51:50,902 --> 00:51:52,985
Can't you do something?

865
00:51:55,902 --> 00:51:59,569
Park was a journalist,
so she can be tenacious.

866
00:51:59,652 --> 00:52:01,920
She fixates on a few facts and
spins them into a narrative.

867
00:52:01,944 --> 00:52:03,069
Hey!

868
00:52:05,069 --> 00:52:07,027
Stop beating around the bush.

869
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:10,652
Just tell me what you're
going to do about it, old man!

870
00:52:12,985 --> 00:52:15,610
You shouldn't shout
as soon as I arrive.

871
00:52:16,819 --> 00:52:18,235
Give me time to think.

872
00:52:20,152 --> 00:52:21,652
One minute.

873
00:52:31,319 --> 00:52:32,902

876
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:44,569
The total election fund delivered
to Yoon's side is $10 million.

877
00:52:44,652 --> 00:52:47,777
Initially, it was $3 million
in cash, including dollars.

878
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:50,236
A week later, $5 million in yen,

879
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:54,819
and finally, $3 million
in cash and gift cards.

880
00:52:54,902 --> 00:52:56,402
<i>Mr. Kang Myung-chul!</i>

881

3, 5, and 2!

883
00:53:01,152 --> 00:53:02,861
He's mixing up 2 and 3.

00:53:02,944 --> 00:53:04,736
Chairman, please sit over here.

885
00:53:04,819 --> 00:53:06,652
I'm trying to help you return to

886
00:53:06,735 --> 00:53:08,236
managing your company,

887
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:11,111
so, get your story straight.

888
00:53:11,194 --> 00:53:12,860
This is your lifeline.

889
00:53:13,944 --> 00:53:18,902
He'll say the mule was
Park, would that do?

890
00:53:20,694 --> 00:53:22,610
He really is a killer!

891
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,152
What a genius!

892
00:53:28,027 --> 00:53:30,444
Damn, that's why I love you.

893
00:53:32,152 --> 00:53:34,694
Okay, I'll talk to dad about it.

894
00:53:35,319 --> 00:53:38,277
Take good care of your
friends, keep them on leash.

895
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:41,402
- Don't ruin everything.
- Take it easy.

896
00:53:41,485 --> 00:53:42,902
Everyone's leaving by Saturday,

897
00:53:42,985 --> 00:53:44,025
so just keep that in mind.

898
00:53:44,069 --> 00:53:45,527
Also,

899
00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:48,194
don't bring in dealers
like Yeom anymore.

900
00:53:49,777 --> 00:53:51,694
Trusting dealers will only backfire.

901
00:53:55,235 --> 00:53:56,694
Don't worry about it.

902
00:53:57,694 --> 00:53:59,944
I'm Superman, so it's okay.

903
00:54:00,027 --> 00:54:03,611
<i>Join me and let's do this!</i>

904
00:54:03,694 --> 00:54:06,860
<i>Come on, everyone!</i>

905
00:54:09,485 --> 00:54:12,527
Don't they all look like
members of a cult?

906
00:54:13,402 --> 00:54:15,027
Like they're all addicted...

907
00:54:16,819 --> 00:54:19,985
Cho Sang-taek! Cho Sang-taek!

908
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:47,569
<i>Check the black tape under the AC.</i>

909
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,444
<i>Do you help with the injection?</i>

910
00:54:51,527 --> 00:54:55,902
<i>Not in-person, send deposit,
and you get a drop.</i>

911
00:54:56,777 --> 00:54:59,986
<i>Should I look elsewhere?
Others even hang out with you...</i>

912
00:55:00,069 --> 00:55:02,985
<i>Many of them report you to the cops.</i>

913
00:55:04,402 --> 00:55:08,194
<i>This is my arm, I'll pay extra.</i>

914
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:23,902
Come in!

915
00:55:25,569 --> 00:55:26,652
Erica?

916
00:55:30,402 --> 00:55:31,694
Not bad.

917
00:55:35,485 --> 00:55:36,986
Relax.

918
00:55:37,069 --> 00:55:38,694
Go easy.

919
00:55:48,152 --> 00:55:49,360
You got clean veins.

920
00:55:50,819 --> 00:55:52,652
My veins are good,
so just poke anywhere.

921
00:55:55,735 --> 00:55:57,235
- Sweetie.
- Yeah?

922
00:55:57,735 --> 00:55:59,444
- What's your dosage?
- Two.

923
00:56:00,444 --> 00:56:01,444
Two?

924
00:56:02,152 --> 00:56:03,277
That's a lot.

925
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,360
It ain't big dea...

926
00:56:14,819 --> 00:56:15,860
Dammit!

927
00:56:22,777 --> 00:56:24,444
First time in this room, Mr. Song?

928
00:56:24,527 --> 00:56:25,527
Yes, sir.

929
00:56:26,527 --> 00:56:29,944
Sensitive cases are pushed back

930
00:56:30,027 --> 00:56:32,611
during the election season,

931
00:56:32,694 --> 00:56:36,069
but this one is tied to
a potentially hot case.

932
00:56:36,652 --> 00:56:38,944
Look at me, forgetting
to offer you a drink.

933
00:56:39,027 --> 00:56:40,694
I'm so distracted these days.

934
00:56:40,777 --> 00:56:43,486
You should cool those
hot cases outside.

935
00:56:43,569 --> 00:56:44,736
What?

936
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:47,819
Is this about Haeshin's
Chairman Kang Myung-chul?

937
00:56:47,902 --> 00:56:51,277
I heard he's practically
commuting here from prison.

938
00:56:53,819 --> 00:56:55,485
You're sharp, you really are!

939
00:57:00,277 --> 00:57:02,986
The thing about Chairman Kang is,

940
00:57:03,069 --> 00:57:04,860
he embezzled $10 million.

941
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:10,361
And it was funneled to
Candidate Yoon's campaign.

942
00:57:10,444 --> 00:57:12,611
Park Hyun-sook made the delivery.

943
00:57:12,694 --> 00:57:15,152
We have the ledger detailing

944
00:57:15,235 --> 00:57:17,610
the transactions and even a confession.

945
00:57:18,235 --> 00:57:21,486
But pulling the players out of the game

946
00:57:21,569 --> 00:57:25,527
this close to the election
is very strange, am I right?

947
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:31,194
Give me the source,
and I'll start the buzz.

948
00:57:31,277 --> 00:57:33,277
This case will spiral out of control.

949
00:57:35,027 --> 00:57:36,610
Can you keep the rhythm?

950
00:57:39,819 --> 00:57:42,277
I'm great with tambourines.

951
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:45,319
This isn't tambourine work, my friend.

952
00:57:49,069 --> 00:57:50,319
Mr. Song.

953
00:57:50,402 --> 00:57:52,322
How many years have you
been reporting from here?

954
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:55,944
Four years now, Prosecutor.

955
00:57:58,027 --> 00:57:59,527
You keep calling me 'Prosecutor,'

956
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:01,652
four years in, you're
practically family.

957
00:58:01,735 --> 00:58:04,152
Just call me 'bro.'

958
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:09,069
<i>The 21st presidential election is
now less than two weeks away.</i>

959
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,486
<i>SBC's latest poll shows...</i>

960
00:58:10,569 --> 00:58:12,319
- Eat up.
- Come in, boss.

961
00:58:12,402 --> 00:58:16,777
<i>The gap between candidates
Cho and Yoon has narrowed.</i>

962
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:20,611
<i>Compared to the poll
conducted ten days ago...</i>

963
00:58:20,694 --> 00:58:23,777
Why aren't you coming
in? Want a cigarette?

964
00:58:24,569 --> 00:58:26,652
I quit, dammit, behind bars.

965
00:58:27,985 --> 00:58:29,944
Did you look into Yeom?

966
00:58:30,027 --> 00:58:33,819
Either he's gone into
hiding or fled overseas,

967
00:58:33,902 --> 00:58:35,902
he went dark for over a year.

968
00:58:35,985 --> 00:58:38,652
I need to find that prick
and put him on trial.

969
00:58:39,277 --> 00:58:42,569
I sold my house to pay the
lawyer $100,000 retainer.

970
00:58:42,652 --> 00:58:44,152
If I lose at the third trial,

971
00:58:45,735 --> 00:58:47,902
I'll have to raise Hye-in in a rental.

972
00:58:47,985 --> 00:58:52,194
Give me Jong-su and one capable guy.

973
00:58:54,277 --> 00:58:56,069
Who's good among the rookies?

974
00:58:56,152 --> 00:59:00,027
You'll likely win the trial anyway.

975
00:59:00,110 --> 00:59:06,402
If you keep poking around,
the prosecutors will lose it.

976
00:59:06,485 --> 00:59:10,360
Why do we always have to
tiptoe around the prosecutors?

977
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:15,027
How could we not after
what they did to you?

978
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:22,277
Back us up on paperwork
until the trial's over.

979
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:24,361
I'm a captain now,

980
00:59:24,444 --> 00:59:26,027
and if you come out to the field,

981
00:59:26,777 --> 00:59:28,777
it'll look bad.

982
00:59:29,735 --> 00:59:32,360
I'm sorry, boss.

983
00:59:34,944 --> 00:59:38,027
Sons of guns. You guys full?

984
00:59:43,819 --> 00:59:44,902
Yo!

985
01:00:00,027 --> 01:00:01,069
Lee Kang-su!

986
01:00:01,152 --> 01:00:02,402
Long time no see!

987
01:00:02,485 --> 01:00:05,694
You've got balls showing up here!

988
01:00:05,777 --> 01:00:09,444
Good to see you, we
got a lot to catch up on!

989
01:00:09,527 --> 01:00:13,652
Do you want to cuff
yourself or should I do it?

990
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:16,902
If you start with handcuffs,

991
01:00:17,527 --> 01:00:19,194
we can't have a civil chat.

992
01:00:20,110 --> 01:00:22,944
I came to help you.

993
01:00:24,485 --> 01:00:26,277
Who are you trying to swindle?

994
01:00:41,402 --> 01:00:43,069
Listen to me!

995
01:00:43,152 --> 01:00:44,485
Just listen! Listen!

996
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:49,444
Where is Yeom Tae-su?

997
01:00:49,527 --> 01:00:52,152
You set me up, didn't you?
Did Yeom order you?

998
01:00:52,235 --> 01:00:53,986
Listen to me!

999
01:00:54,069 --> 01:00:57,319
We both got set up together...

1000
01:00:57,402 --> 01:01:01,069
I didn't order Yeom
to set you up, prick!

1001
01:01:01,152 --> 01:01:02,902
Then who did?

1002
01:01:02,985 --> 01:01:04,444
Det. Oh.

1003
01:01:18,444 --> 01:01:20,444
I didn't expect it,

1004
01:01:21,652 --> 01:01:23,569
but not a single apology?

1005
01:01:23,652 --> 01:01:24,694
I'm disappointed.

1006
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:29,152
You've become a full-on addict.

1007
01:01:30,277 --> 01:01:32,569
Yes, all thanks to you.

1008
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:34,361
When I was released,

1009
01:01:34,444 --> 01:01:36,735
only addicts reached out to me.

1010
01:01:38,235 --> 01:01:39,944
Damn, that stings!

1011
01:01:49,194 --> 01:01:51,611
Yeom lit my legs on fire

1012
01:01:51,694 --> 01:01:53,027
and injected drugs in me.

1013
01:01:53,777 --> 01:01:55,819
<i>Both of my legs were melting,</i>

1014
01:01:55,902 --> 01:01:57,402
<i>but I was so high after a hit,</i>

1015
01:01:57,485 --> 01:01:59,736
<i>I didn't feel the pain.</i>

1016
01:01:59,819 --> 01:02:01,902
<i>He kept me drugged up for a month.</i>

1017
01:02:06,485 --> 01:02:08,861
Detective, you want that prick, right?

1018
01:02:08,944 --> 01:02:09,985
I'm...

1019
01:02:14,569 --> 01:02:17,652
goddamn dying to see him.

1020
01:02:17,735 --> 01:02:19,569
At least the motive's solid.

1021
01:02:22,027 --> 01:02:24,027
You asked me who it was.

1022
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:25,569
Cho Hoon.

1023
01:02:25,652 --> 01:02:28,694
The guy looking at his phone.

1024
01:02:29,402 --> 01:02:31,069
<i>Cho Sang-taek's son.</i>

1025
01:02:32,944 --> 01:02:34,527
<i>He made me an addict.</i>

1026
01:02:41,777 --> 01:02:45,402
I bet even Prosecutor
Ku freaked out over this.

1027
01:02:45,485 --> 01:02:46,902
Of all people,

1028
01:02:47,569 --> 01:02:48,819
he happens to be the son

1029
01:02:48,902 --> 01:02:50,342
of a leading presidential candidate.

1030
01:02:51,235 --> 01:02:53,360
A snitch who fetched a sensitive case,

1031
01:02:54,069 --> 01:02:56,527
an actress who was at the scene,

1032
01:02:57,027 --> 01:02:59,277
and a narco who investigated the case.

1033
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:01,280
He cleared out the three
troublemakers in one go.

1034
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:02,319
So,

1035
01:03:02,944 --> 01:03:05,694
take down a chief prosecutor

1036
01:03:05,777 --> 01:03:08,569
and the presidential candidate's son?

1037
01:03:09,902 --> 01:03:10,986
How?

1038
01:03:11,069 --> 01:03:13,486
I had a nuclear bomb.

1039
01:03:13,569 --> 01:03:14,569
<i>Okay, let's go!</i>

1040
01:03:15,652 --> 01:03:18,069
<i>The video I shot at Laura Hill Hotel</i>

1041
01:03:18,152 --> 01:03:19,569
<i>of Cho Hoon's arrest.</i>

1042
01:03:20,902 --> 01:03:22,402
Where is it now?

1043
01:03:23,485 --> 01:03:27,277
It's... in Yeom's possession.

1044
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:31,610
And where is he now?

1045
01:03:34,152 --> 01:03:37,152
<i>He's exporting top-quality
North Korean drugs to Japan.</i>

1046
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:40,694
<i>Kim Hak-nam in Incheon
had the exclusive right to it,</i>

1047
01:03:40,777 --> 01:03:43,944
<i>but Yeom snatched it away.</i>

1048
01:03:44,027 --> 01:03:45,277
<i>A reward for getting rid of us.</i>

1049
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:49,277
<i>There's a way to
lure him out of hiding.</i>

1050
01:03:49,985 --> 01:03:52,402
If we intercept his
drugs during transport...

1051
01:03:52,485 --> 01:03:53,736
he'll come crawling.

1052
01:03:53,819 --> 01:03:57,111
There's a party Cho Hoon
is hosting this Friday.

1053
01:03:57,194 --> 01:03:59,819
The guest list includes the
usual suspects, including me.

1054
01:03:59,902 --> 01:04:02,777
It's a one-time opportunity,
by Saturday, they'll all fly out.

1055
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:05,777
I'll film Cho there.

1056
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:08,861
That'll be the irrefutable
evidence to send him away.

1057
01:04:08,944 --> 01:04:11,902
It's three on three, we
can each cover our target.

1058
01:04:13,069 --> 01:04:14,777
Yeom Tae-su.

1059
01:04:15,569 --> 01:04:16,944
Prosecutor Ku.

1060
01:04:17,027 --> 01:04:18,694
Cho Hoon for her.

1061
01:04:23,819 --> 01:04:24,819
Alright.

1062
01:04:26,985 --> 01:04:28,569
I'll stick around until Yeom's arrest,

1063
01:04:29,402 --> 01:04:31,235
you two handle the cleanup, got it?

1064
01:04:31,735 --> 01:04:35,360
Quitting drugs is tough,
you think it was easy for me?

1065
01:04:37,819 --> 01:04:39,402
Why are you asking me? I don't know!

1066
01:04:39,485 --> 01:04:42,902
What the heck am I
doing with drug addicts?

1067
01:04:45,569 --> 01:04:46,569
Okay!

1068
01:04:47,569 --> 01:04:49,235
Damn you.

1069
01:04:50,944 --> 01:04:53,027
You got that fighting spirit.

1070
01:05:00,694 --> 01:05:02,694
3kg of eel for table 7!

1071
01:05:02,777 --> 01:05:04,485
3kg!

1072
01:05:05,319 --> 01:05:09,360
In meth, that's $700,000
per, totaling $2.1 million.

1073
01:05:09,944 --> 01:05:11,527
- Am I right?
- Buddy.

1074
01:05:12,444 --> 01:05:14,110
- That knife...
- Who are you?

1075
01:05:15,152 --> 01:05:17,152
- Hak-nam!
- Holy crap!

1076
01:05:17,235 --> 01:05:18,402
We came to re-energize!

1077
01:05:18,485 --> 01:05:19,777
You piece of crap...

1078
01:05:26,735 --> 01:05:27,860
My leg! Ow!

1079
01:05:36,027 --> 01:05:40,361
Why'd a snitching punk do me a favor?

1080
01:05:40,444 --> 01:05:44,486
Captain, we're in the
distribution business!

1081
01:05:44,569 --> 01:05:46,527
If we reveal the whole chain,

1082
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:48,194
what will they live on?

1083
01:05:48,777 --> 01:05:50,819
They're all my people too.

1084
01:05:52,277 --> 01:05:54,485
Eat up and be on your way.

1085
01:05:58,735 --> 01:06:00,360
- Hak-nam!
- Yes?

1086
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:04,027
Yeom really got you spooked, huh?

1087
01:06:04,527 --> 01:06:07,569
Drug trafficking, smuggling,
head of a drug ring...

1088
01:06:10,944 --> 01:06:13,361
Should I cuff you, or Yeom Tae-su?

1089
01:06:13,444 --> 01:06:15,069
Yeom Tae-su?

1090
01:06:15,152 --> 01:06:17,027
Yeah, Yeom Tae-su!

1091
01:06:18,069 --> 01:06:19,152
Sit back down.

1092
01:06:19,235 --> 01:06:22,777
The guy who forced you into exile.

1093
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:24,902
I'm talking about that prick.

1094
01:06:25,735 --> 01:06:27,652
How can I help you?

1095
01:06:29,569 --> 01:06:31,944
<i>Tell me about how the
North Korean blue drug</i>

1096
01:06:32,027 --> 01:06:34,819
<i>reaches Yeom through China.</i>

1097
01:06:35,319 --> 01:06:36,527
So?

01:06:43,069 --> 01:06:47,319
<i>they're transported to the
factory and packaged nicely.</i>

1101
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:50,527
<i>Then, Yamamoto's live fish truck comes</i>

1102
01:06:50,610 --> 01:06:53,652
<i>from Japan to our factory.</i>

1103
01:06:53,735 --> 01:06:56,319
<i>The truck is driven by one Yamamoto,</i>

1104
01:06:56,944 --> 01:06:59,235
<i>and one Yeom's man,</i>

1105
01:07:00,444 --> 01:07:03,152
<i>they load the truck
with eels and drugs,</i>

1106
01:07:03,235 --> 01:07:06,111
and drive straight to Busan
to meet with Yeom.

1107
01:07:06,194 --> 01:07:11,486
It's a direct route, but
they make just one stop.

1108
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:14,861
<i>At Youngshin Fish Restaurant
near Sujeong-dong, Incheon.</i>

1109

<i>The Japanese driver can't
resist their fish cake stew.</i>

1110

Delicious!

1111
01:07:21,235 --> 01:07:22,319
When?

1112
01:07:23,194 --> 01:07:26,569
They're coming on an
early Friday morning ferry.

Chairman Kang Myung-chul

1115
01:07:35,944 --> 01:07:37,319

1116
01:07:37,402 --> 01:07:38,802

<i>Yoon Sung-hyup's campaign.</i>

1121
01:07:51,319 --> 01:07:53,944
All signals have been
blocked on this camera.

1122
01:07:57,527 --> 01:08:00,152
With this cover, it'll be undetectable.

1123
01:08:02,777 --> 01:08:03,860
How is it?

1124
01:08:05,235 --> 01:08:06,235
Looks convincing.

1125
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:10,361
If it feels too dangerous, bail out,

1126
01:08:10,444 --> 01:08:12,402
and call me if anything happens.

1127
01:08:12,485 --> 01:08:15,111
I think you said something
similar a year ago...

1128
01:08:15,194 --> 01:08:16,194
Hey!

1129
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:19,194
Back then, I...

1130
01:08:19,277 --> 01:08:20,527
Don't apologize,

1131
01:08:21,569 --> 01:08:23,069
I'm not ready yet.

1132
01:08:24,235 --> 01:08:26,735
And let me make one thing clear,

1133
01:08:27,819 --> 01:08:29,902
I'm doing this because I want to.

1134
01:08:46,277 --> 01:08:48,736
Are you ready? All set?

1135
01:08:48,819 --> 01:08:50,610
Once you get the footage, text me.

1136
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:54,319
Just focus on your own tasks, okay?

1137
01:08:54,402 --> 01:08:56,027
- Yeah!
- Bye!

1138
01:08:56,569 --> 01:08:57,569
- Hey!
- What?

1139
01:08:57,610 --> 01:08:58,694
You scared?

1140
01:08:59,402 --> 01:09:01,027
Scared? Hell no.

1141
01:09:01,110 --> 01:09:02,110
Let's go!

1142
01:09:12,610 --> 01:09:14,569
You think this plan will work?

1143
01:09:14,652 --> 01:09:17,777
Depends on how well
you follow Su-jin's lead.

1144
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:20,611
A washed-up snitch is
preaching to me now?

1145
01:09:20,694 --> 01:09:23,902
Addicts have no manners
or respect for hierarchy.

1146
01:09:23,985 --> 01:09:25,527
Geez, I told you, I quit!

1147
01:09:25,610 --> 01:09:27,486
Stop calling me an addict, alright?

1148
01:09:27,569 --> 01:09:29,777
If you can just quit,
is it really a drug?

1149
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:31,486
You drug addict.

1150
01:09:31,569 --> 01:09:33,777
There's a way to quit...

1151
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:35,277
Forget it, dammit!

1152
01:09:36,152 --> 01:09:37,819
Just put on your seatbelt!

1153
01:09:40,444 --> 01:09:42,735
Dammit, where the hell is the seatbelt?

1154
01:09:43,985 --> 01:09:46,610
We're so doomed.

1155
01:09:47,402 --> 01:09:49,819

01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:53,110
<i>Friday</i>

1157
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:58,527
Wouldn't it be easier to just grab
those jerks and mess them up?

1158
01:09:59,027 --> 01:10:00,360
What is it?

1159
01:10:01,902 --> 01:10:04,902
First, we need to get the goods, okay?

1160
01:10:05,485 --> 01:10:08,486
After that, catching Yeom
will be a piece of cake.

1161
01:10:08,569 --> 01:10:11,111
Once he realizes his stash is gone,

1162
01:10:11,194 --> 01:10:12,111
he'll go berserk and come running.

1163
01:10:12,194 --> 01:10:13,069
Alright, I hear you!

1164
01:10:13,152 --> 01:10:14,694
Just keep a lookout.

1165
01:10:15,569 --> 01:10:16,736

1166
01:10:16,819 --> 01:10:18,360
Keep it down!

1167
01:10:20,485 --> 01:10:21,819
Goddamn...

1168
01:10:25,777 --> 01:10:27,027
Hey, Su-jin.

1169
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:30,319
You know how there are
lots of rehab centers abroad?

1170
01:10:30,402 --> 01:10:34,194
But we don't have that here.

1171
01:10:34,277 --> 01:10:35,986
We should start one.

1172
01:10:36,069 --> 01:10:37,902
Find a scenic spot overseas,

1173
01:10:37,985 --> 01:10:40,027
lock them up tight...

1174
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:43,777
Charge $10,000 per head
and boom, a goldmine!

1175
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:45,944
Where'd an addict get
the money to pay for that?

1176
01:10:46,735 --> 01:10:49,110
Hey, I'd take you in for free!

1177
01:10:50,735 --> 01:10:54,319
You need someone by your
side to quit, you know that?

1178
01:10:54,402 --> 01:10:57,402
Bring you proper food, cheer you on...

1179
01:10:57,485 --> 01:10:58,985
There's so much to do.

1180
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:23,110

1181
01:11:30,069 --> 01:11:31,485

- Let's head inside, sir.
- Sure.

1186
01:11:42,944 --> 01:11:44,819

You need to tell me where you're going.

1190
01:12:11,027 --> 01:12:12,194
One moment, please.

1191
01:12:15,152 --> 01:12:17,902
- I'll need to check your bag.
- Just let her in!

1192

01:13:32,069 --> 01:13:33,944

01:16:11,485 --> 01:16:13,319
That's all for the teaser.

1228

01:17:11,735 --> 01:17:12,486
Okay!

1232
01:17:12,569 --> 01:17:13,694
Let's begin.

1233
01:17:13,777 --> 01:17:14,777
Okay!

1234
01:17:18,902 --> 01:17:21,527
Is this the prosecution?
I'd like to report a drug deal.

1235
01:17:39,485 --> 01:17:41,694
Let me ask you one thing.

1236
01:17:42,610 --> 01:17:43,777
Was it Ku?

1237
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:45,360
The one who made me an addict.

1238
01:17:47,110 --> 01:17:48,235
<i>Should I kill him?</i>

1239
01:17:48,985 --> 01:17:51,569
Your words could
get you in big trouble.

1240
01:17:56,569 --> 01:18:00,027
You're a dealer, you must
have some leftovers!

1241
01:18:01,735 --> 01:18:02,777
No?

1242
01:18:04,069 --> 01:18:08,652
Because a snitch was
colluding with a prosecutor.

1243
01:18:18,069 --> 01:18:20,485
Stay right here, okay?

1244
01:18:23,652 --> 01:18:26,694

delivered it to Candidate Yoon?</i>

1248
01:18:35,235 --> 01:18:36,235
Yes?

1249
01:18:36,985 --> 01:18:37,861
Sir.

1250
01:18:37,944 --> 01:18:40,444
We've received a drug-related tip-off.

1251
01:18:40,527 --> 01:18:43,985
The location is a yacht named
Eclipse at Seoul Marina.

1252
01:18:44,527 --> 01:18:46,569
- Eclipse?
- Yes.

1253
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:56,194
That's part of our operation,

1254
01:18:56,277 --> 01:18:57,902
so don't send the Coast Guard.

1255
01:18:57,985 --> 01:18:59,569
It could mess everything up.

1256
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:01,694
Sit!

1257
01:19:01,777 --> 01:19:02,902
Sir, what's all that?

1258
01:19:04,277 --> 01:19:06,986
I arrested him red-handed
for drug dealing, 5kg in total!

1259
01:19:07,069 --> 01:19:09,485
I'll personally take the
statement later, understood?

1260
01:19:10,444 --> 01:19:11,319
Where're you going?

1261
01:19:11,402 --> 01:19:14,027
He's stirring up trouble again...

1262
01:19:20,777 --> 01:19:21,694
Really?

1263
01:19:21,777 --> 01:19:23,819
I thought your role ended
after Yeom's arrest.

1264
01:19:23,902 --> 01:19:27,235
I need to make sure
Su-jin gets out safely.

1265
01:19:27,735 --> 01:19:28,860
Start the car.

1266
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:31,486
Quiet!

1267
01:19:31,569 --> 01:19:34,152
Be quiet! I said be quiet!

1268
01:19:34,819 --> 01:19:36,319
You're all so happy...

1269
01:19:37,069 --> 01:19:37,777
What did you say?

1270
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:40,444
Someone may be trapping
you, get out of there now.

1271
01:19:40,527 --> 01:19:41,527
Right now!

1272
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:43,861
Didn't you say you
blocked the Coast Guard?

1273
01:19:43,944 --> 01:19:46,319
<i>They know the yacht's
name and exact location,</i>

1274
01:19:46,402 --> 01:19:47,985
<i>so hurry up!</i>

1275
01:20:00,194 --> 01:20:02,527
<i>Narco Catfish</i>

1276
01:20:08,652 --> 01:20:09,527
Yes?

1277
01:20:09,610 --> 01:20:16,027
Sir, Det. Oh brought in Yeom Tae-su.

1278
01:20:16,110 --> 01:20:17,986
<i>Oh brought in Yeom?</i>

1279
01:20:18,069 --> 01:20:23,110
Yes, it seems like he was
working with Lee Kang-su.

1280
01:20:23,985 --> 01:20:25,194
Lee Kang-su?

1281
01:20:26,860 --> 01:20:29,402
You sure it was Lee Kang-su?

1282
01:20:29,485 --> 01:20:30,485
<i>Of course not.</i>

1283
01:20:30,777 --> 01:20:32,819
I looked into it just to make sure,

1284
01:20:32,902 --> 01:20:35,861
<i>and it seems Uhm Su-jin
is also on Lee's side.</i>

1285
01:20:35,944 --> 01:20:39,152
<i>That actress who was
caught at Laura Hill.</i>

1286
01:20:39,235 --> 01:20:40,694
<i>The three of them are together.</i>

1287
01:20:42,402 --> 01:20:45,069
Lee Kang-su, Uhm
Su-jin and Oh Sang-jae.

1288
01:20:46,944 --> 01:20:49,485
<i>So, Uhm is on the yacht.</i>

1289
01:20:50,777 --> 01:20:54,485
Don't make calls like a fool
when you fly out, use Telegram.

1290
01:20:55,069 --> 01:20:56,069
Hey, Su-jin.

1291
01:20:59,610 --> 01:21:02,111
Don't contact anyone
until the election is over.

1292
01:21:02,194 --> 01:21:04,194
Got it.

1293
01:21:05,735 --> 01:21:07,611
Are you kidding me?

1294
01:21:07,694 --> 01:21:10,235
Don't give me that answer.

1295
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:15,444
Answer me.

1296
01:21:18,735 --> 01:21:20,235
<i>Prosecutor Ku Gwan-hee</i>

1297
01:21:29,277 --> 01:21:30,277
Goddammit...

1298
01:21:36,152 --> 01:21:39,319
Don't go around acting like crazy,

1299
01:21:40,819 --> 01:21:42,694
causing unnecessary trouble.

1300
01:21:42,777 --> 01:21:44,235
That won't happen.

1301
01:21:57,194 --> 01:21:58,236
Let's go, quick.

1302
01:21:58,319 --> 01:22:00,735
<i>Are you with Uhm Su-jin?</i>

1303
01:22:08,319 --> 01:22:10,402
- I did it!
- Good job! Dammit!

1304
01:22:10,485 --> 01:22:13,027
Kang-su, we're on the way back!

1305
01:22:13,110 --> 01:22:14,736
We're leaving Yeouido now!

1306
01:22:14,819 --> 01:22:16,194
- Keep the video safe.
<i>- Okay!</i>

1307
01:22:16,277 --> 01:22:17,319
Put Su-jin on.

1308
01:22:18,485 --> 01:22:19,777
What's going on?

1309
01:22:20,319 --> 01:22:22,694
<i>Put your face away!</i>

1310
01:22:22,777 --> 01:22:24,152
<i>Just talk on the phone!</i>

1311
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:26,236
Come on, let's talk face-to-face.

1312
01:22:26,319 --> 01:22:27,111
<i>You did good.</i>

1313
01:22:27,194 --> 01:22:30,027
<i>You said you'd mess Cho Hoon up.</i>

1314
01:22:30,110 --> 01:22:31,110
<i>Keep your promise.</i>

1315
01:22:32,152 --> 01:22:33,861
I'll exact revenge for you.

1316
01:22:33,944 --> 01:22:34,944
Okay.

1317
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:37,652
Put Jade Emperor on.

1318
01:22:37,735 --> 01:22:38,944
What now?

1319
01:22:39,694 --> 01:22:41,069
<i>Look at me.</i>

1320
01:22:41,152 --> 01:22:44,236
<i>The job's done, no
need for face-to-face.</i>

1321
01:22:44,319 --> 01:22:45,985
I'm driving, hold the phone!

1322
01:22:47,527 --> 01:22:49,860
<i>Happy now? Here.</i>

1323
01:22:51,069 --> 01:22:52,610
Got nothing to say to me?

1324
01:22:53,235 --> 01:22:56,110
Let's hear a formal apology
in front of everyone.

1325
01:22:58,152 --> 01:22:59,736
Just do it already!

1326
01:22:59,819 --> 01:23:01,902
<i>Crying and begging wouldn't
be a bad touch, either.</i>

1327
01:23:01,985 --> 01:23:05,736
Just say it, what's the big deal?

1328
01:23:05,819 --> 01:23:07,152
Jesus Christ...

1329
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:12,110
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1330
01:23:14,819 --> 01:23:18,110
<i>I did a terrible thing to you.</i>

1331
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:21,610
<i>Forget it, that's what...</i>

1332
01:23:30,402 --> 01:23:31,485
Hello?!

1333
01:23:32,485 --> 01:23:33,569
Why did it cut off?

1334
01:23:34,610 --> 01:23:35,777
Su-jin!

1335
01:23:36,902 --> 01:23:37,944
Hello?

1336
01:23:40,485 --> 01:23:41,694
Hello?

1337
01:23:43,110 --> 01:23:44,319
Call again.

1338
01:23:53,569 --> 01:23:54,819
Chang-rak...

1339
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:58,652
Chang-rak...

1340
01:23:59,985 --> 01:24:01,485
Someone call 911!

1341
01:24:02,277 --> 01:24:04,069
Chang-rak...

1342
01:24:05,569 --> 01:24:07,277
Help me...

1343
01:24:09,985 --> 01:24:11,235
Are you okay?

1344
01:24:12,694 --> 01:24:14,360
Please help...

1345
01:24:19,735 --> 01:24:21,111
Help me...

1346
01:24:21,194 --> 01:24:22,652
Can you hear me?

1347
01:25:01,819 --> 01:25:03,819
Wait, you can't go in there!

1348
01:25:03,902 --> 01:25:05,611
Stop! It's dangerous!

1349
01:25:05,694 --> 01:25:07,694
- No, please don't!
- What's with you?

1350
01:25:10,610 --> 01:25:11,236
Let go!

1351
01:25:11,319 --> 01:25:12,360
It's dangerous!

1352
01:25:12,944 --> 01:25:13,736
Piss off!

1353
01:25:13,819 --> 01:25:15,777
Calm the hell down!

1354
01:25:48,819 --> 01:25:49,902
Let's quit!

1355
01:25:50,819 --> 01:25:53,860
Nothing good comes from
working with a cop too long.

1356
01:25:56,235 --> 01:26:00,485
You got Yeom Tae-su like you wanted.

1357
01:26:02,610 --> 01:26:03,610
Walk away.

1358
01:26:05,694 --> 01:26:06,694
And you?

1359
01:26:08,027 --> 01:26:09,777
What will you do?

1360
01:26:11,277 --> 01:26:14,235
I'll post the footage online,

1361
01:26:15,152 --> 01:26:16,860
and fly out of this country.

1362
01:26:25,319 --> 01:26:26,402
So, it's over?

1363
01:26:30,235 --> 01:26:31,235
This is it?

1364
01:26:33,694 --> 01:26:36,319
Not before I apologize to Su-jin.

1365
01:26:36,402 --> 01:26:37,694
Your friend as well!

1366
01:26:48,027 --> 01:26:51,902
Let's end Cho Hoon
just like Su-jin wanted.

1367
01:26:51,985 --> 01:26:53,402
And tie Ku into it, too.

1368
01:26:58,527 --> 01:27:00,235
How can we do that
without anything solid?

1369
01:27:01,652 --> 01:27:05,860
Let's do some real snitching.

1370
01:27:14,152 --> 01:27:15,194
Gwan-hee!

1371
01:27:16,902 --> 01:27:18,069
Have you eaten?

1372
01:27:22,569 --> 01:27:23,777
I've lost my appetite.

1373
01:27:38,902 --> 01:27:42,735
Lee Kang-su and Oh Sang-jae
are listed on the call log.

1374
01:27:43,985 --> 01:27:47,360
They're the headaches, right?

1375
01:27:50,985 --> 01:27:52,069
Looks like it.

1376
01:27:55,110 --> 01:27:58,777
You bragged that everything
was under control!

1377
01:27:59,319 --> 01:28:00,694
Dammit...

1378
01:28:01,777 --> 01:28:06,194
Is it so hard to clean things
up without any traces?

1379
01:28:09,444 --> 01:28:11,319
It's not hard...

1380
01:28:13,402 --> 01:28:15,194
It's not hard at all,

1381
01:28:18,485 --> 01:28:22,944
can't you just stay quiet?

1382
01:28:23,027 --> 01:28:25,110
Is that so damn hard?

1383
01:28:26,860 --> 01:28:30,027
Gwan-hee, have you gone mad?

1384
01:28:31,735 --> 01:28:33,527
Who's mad, huh?

1385
01:28:33,610 --> 01:28:35,444
There's news and gossip

1386
01:28:35,527 --> 01:28:37,402
stirring things up every single day,

1387
01:28:37,485 --> 01:28:39,485
you had to cause another trouble?

1388
01:28:41,652 --> 01:28:43,069
Mr. Cho, look at me.

1389
01:28:43,944 --> 01:28:45,360
A Korean prosecutor...

1390
01:28:46,902 --> 01:28:49,485
can make or break a president.

1391
01:28:54,819 --> 01:28:56,402
Jerk.

1392
01:29:00,069 --> 01:29:01,694
Anyway, I'll handle this.

1393
01:29:02,194 --> 01:29:04,152
Very cleanly, no traces.

1394
01:29:15,277 --> 01:29:16,735
What the hell's wrong with him?

1395
01:29:27,110 --> 01:29:28,569
<i>You're the boss around here, huh?</i>

1396
01:29:28,652 --> 01:29:30,152
<i>A handsome fellow.</i>

1397
01:29:30,235 --> 01:29:31,736
<i>Let's get you on TV.</i>

1398
01:29:31,819 --> 01:29:34,235
<i>No Caller ID</i>

1399
01:30:08,402 --> 01:30:09,902
It's been a while.

1400
01:30:11,819 --> 01:30:13,485
Have you been well?

1401
01:30:15,027 --> 01:30:16,194
You look great.

1402
01:30:18,110 --> 01:30:19,110
Yeah?

1403
01:30:19,735 --> 01:30:22,319
You too, has it been a year?

1404
01:30:24,110 --> 01:30:27,569
Seeing that video brought
back memories, you had it?

1405
01:30:30,569 --> 01:30:32,819
Let me have it if it's
in your possession.

1406
01:30:32,902 --> 01:30:33,777
Damn you.

1407
01:30:33,860 --> 01:30:35,610
What did you say?

1408
01:30:36,485 --> 01:30:37,860
You son of a gun.

1409
01:30:39,527 --> 01:30:41,111
Why'd I give it to you?

1410
01:30:41,194 --> 01:30:42,569
If you'd asked nicely,

1411
01:30:44,027 --> 01:30:45,486
I might've given it to you.

1412
01:30:45,569 --> 01:30:46,985
Kang-su, buddy.

1413
01:30:47,777 --> 01:30:50,819
I think you're seriously
misunderstanding something.

1414
01:30:50,902 --> 01:30:52,986
If this is about what
happened a year ago,

1415
01:30:53,069 --> 01:30:55,861
let's clear it up.

1416
01:30:55,944 --> 01:30:57,277
It wasn't me,

1417
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:59,444
would I have ordered
something like that?

1418
01:30:59,527 --> 01:31:02,194
Ordered? Ordered what?

1419
01:31:04,610 --> 01:31:06,652
It's as if you know what was ordered.

1420
01:31:09,694 --> 01:31:11,319
You told me not to do drugs.

1421
01:31:14,110 --> 01:31:15,110
You said you were my bro!

1422
01:31:16,694 --> 01:31:18,444
You stick a needle in your brother?

1423
01:31:18,527 --> 01:31:21,319
You think I studied my butt off,

1424
01:31:22,319 --> 01:31:28,152
just to spend my life
chasing addicts like you?

1425
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:30,319
You punk.

1426
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:34,152
I don't know what kind of crap

1427
01:31:34,694 --> 01:31:36,444
you're pulling right now, but stop it.

1428
01:31:36,527 --> 01:31:39,610
Or else, you'll kill me too?

1429
01:31:40,235 --> 01:31:41,735
It's not entirely impossible.

1430
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:45,235
You've seen how I operate.

1431
01:31:51,527 --> 01:31:52,527
Okay,

1432
01:31:54,569 --> 01:31:58,069
then look forward to what
I'm going to do next,

1433
01:32:00,027 --> 01:32:05,069
and what I'll unleash very soon.

1434
01:32:07,277 --> 01:32:09,735
The next time we
meet, it'll be in hell.

1435
01:32:17,819 --> 01:32:19,402
Damn idiot.

1436
01:32:32,527 --> 01:32:33,736
Oh boy.

1437
01:32:33,819 --> 01:32:35,569
First time in Seoul in so long.

1438
01:32:36,110 --> 01:32:38,277
You should have killed Yeom,

1439
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:40,860
why hand him over to Jade Emperor?

1440
01:32:44,277 --> 01:32:47,694
Yeom's drug shipment
meant for Yamamoto.

1441
01:32:47,777 --> 01:32:48,985
I intercepted it.

1442
01:32:50,402 --> 01:32:52,319
- How many?
- 25.

1443
01:32:55,610 --> 01:32:58,611
Yamamoto's going to kill him for sure.

1444
01:32:58,694 --> 01:33:00,486
That guy has a terrible temper.

1445
01:33:00,569 --> 01:33:03,069
$100,000 per kilo,
$2.5 million in total,

1446
01:33:03,152 --> 01:33:04,152
it's a bargain.

1447
01:33:06,610 --> 01:33:08,027
So what do you want me to do?

1448
01:33:09,485 --> 01:33:12,111
Get me a boat to China, two passengers.

1449
01:33:12,194 --> 01:33:14,277
The other is for Jade Emperor?

1450
01:33:15,985 --> 01:33:19,402
What are you two up to?

1451
01:33:23,527 --> 01:33:25,819
We're going to pull a job on
Prosecutor Ku and take off.

1452
01:33:28,819 --> 01:33:30,985
Prosecutor Ku? Ku Gwan-hee?

1453
01:33:32,985 --> 01:33:34,152
Are you mad?

1454
01:33:35,110 --> 01:33:37,360
Keep those for yourself.

1455
01:33:37,944 --> 01:33:39,777
Get the money and boat ready.

1456
01:33:40,444 --> 01:33:41,819
And I'm totally sober.

1457
01:33:44,735 --> 01:33:46,027
How's the kid?

1458
01:33:49,444 --> 01:33:51,277
It's going to take some time.

1459
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:52,777
Don't worry...

1460
01:33:54,319 --> 01:33:55,319
I'm sorry.

1461
01:34:01,319 --> 01:34:02,569
Let's move.

1462
01:34:04,985 --> 01:34:06,111
Should I prep the money?

1463
01:34:06,194 --> 01:34:09,402
Hold on, can't you hear
my gears spinning?

1464
01:34:13,027 --> 01:34:16,027
<i>This is where Ko Chang-rak
lived with Kang-su.</i>

1465
01:34:17,194 --> 01:34:20,110
<i>We just need to find
Lee Kang-su's video.</i>

1466
01:34:23,235 --> 01:34:26,027
He hasn't been here for
a while. I'm telling you.

1467
01:34:27,985 --> 01:34:29,860
This feels off, dammit...

1468
01:34:31,610 --> 01:34:33,277
I should've locked him up that night.

1469
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:34,652
Sir!

1470
01:34:34,735 --> 01:34:35,860
Yes?

1471
01:34:38,569 --> 01:34:39,402
Please take this call.

1472
01:34:39,485 --> 01:34:40,361
Who is it?

1473
01:34:40,444 --> 01:34:43,944
I'm right on Lee Kang-su's tail,

1474
01:34:44,027 --> 01:34:47,361
<i>I want to help you and
leave a good impression, sir.</i>

1475
01:34:47,444 --> 01:34:50,152
Sounds like you want something from me.

1476
01:34:50,235 --> 01:34:51,611
<i>Yeom Tae-su, sir.</i>

1477
01:34:51,694 --> 01:34:54,569
You know that he took my spot, right?

1478
01:34:54,652 --> 01:34:56,569
Give me Lee's location.

1479
01:34:56,652 --> 01:34:58,902
<i>He's headed to Rep. Park Hyun-sook</i>

1480
01:34:58,985 --> 01:35:00,986
<i>to hand over a video and a recording</i>

1481
01:35:01,069 --> 01:35:03,152
<i>containing your voice.</i>

1482
01:35:08,485 --> 01:35:09,902
I'm off.

1483
01:35:12,110 --> 01:35:14,360
Give it up, there's no time.

1484
01:35:15,860 --> 01:35:17,420
I'll go ahead and get everything ready.

1485
01:35:20,110 --> 01:35:22,735
This is our only chance,
don't mess it up.

1486
01:35:23,527 --> 01:35:25,569
Everything will work
out, don't be a chicken.

1487
01:35:28,569 --> 01:35:29,569
Hey!

1488
01:35:55,569 --> 01:35:56,444
Where are you going?

1489
01:35:56,527 --> 01:35:58,402
You can't go any further.

1490
01:35:58,485 --> 01:36:00,986
I'm Det. Oh Sang-jae
from the Narcotics Unit!

1491
01:36:01,069 --> 01:36:02,986
I have something to
deliver to Rep. Park.

1492
01:36:03,069 --> 01:36:04,402
We'll pass it along for you.

1493
01:36:05,527 --> 01:36:07,861
No, I must give it to her myself.

1494
01:36:07,944 --> 01:36:09,003
Please, you can't go any further.

1495
01:36:09,027 --> 01:36:09,569
Representative!

1496
01:36:09,652 --> 01:36:10,986
Rep. Park! Ma'am!

1497
01:36:11,069 --> 01:36:12,069
Ma'am!

1498
01:36:12,777 --> 01:36:14,027
It's me, Oh Sang-jae!

1499
01:36:15,235 --> 01:36:16,277
Grab him!

1500
01:36:17,027 --> 01:36:18,069
Rep. Park Hyun-sook!

1501
01:36:18,152 --> 01:36:19,632
Mr. Oh Sang-jae, you are under arrest

1502
01:36:19,694 --> 01:36:21,211
for violating the
Narcotics Control Act.

1503
01:36:21,235 --> 01:36:23,360
Ma'am, it's me, Oh Sang-jae!

1504
01:36:26,777 --> 01:36:27,777
Prosecutors' Office!

1505
01:36:28,694 --> 01:36:30,194
Lee Kang-su wasn't present.

1506
01:36:34,069 --> 01:36:37,027
You sure made a lot of copies, Det. Oh.

1507
01:36:38,110 --> 01:36:41,736
Yes, sir, I made so many.

1508
01:36:41,819 --> 01:36:45,277
I'm going to spread
it all over the country.

1509
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:46,902
Where's Lee Kang-su?

1510
01:36:47,610 --> 01:36:51,860
He's already skipped town,
it's over between us.

1511
01:36:57,777 --> 01:37:00,902
<i>Tonight's third presidential
debate hosted</i>

1512
01:37:00,985 --> 01:37:02,694
<i>by the Central Election Commission,</i>

1513
01:37:02,777 --> 01:37:05,444
<i>is expected to focus on Candidate</i>

1514
01:37:05,527 --> 01:37:08,277
<i>Cho Sang-taek's son's drug allegations.</i>

1515
01:37:22,527 --> 01:37:23,694
You'll release this?

1516
01:37:23,777 --> 01:37:25,027
You said so yourself,

1517
01:37:25,110 --> 01:37:28,527
"Hot cases should be
cooled off outside."

1518
01:37:29,027 --> 01:37:32,277
Even so, this is way too hot.

1519
01:37:33,402 --> 01:37:34,610
Why? Scared?

1520
01:37:37,277 --> 01:37:39,402
Bro, are you switching sides?

1521
01:37:40,652 --> 01:37:43,610
A prosecutor investigates
when there's a crime, no?

1522
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:47,444
Same goes for reporters,
you're on the side of truth.

1523
01:37:48,319 --> 01:37:49,527
You don't take sides.

1524
01:37:53,319 --> 01:37:55,402
Sir, you need to step inside.

1525
01:37:55,485 --> 01:37:56,319
Why?

1526
01:37:56,402 --> 01:37:59,110
Something urgent has come
up, please go inside for now.

1527
01:37:59,819 --> 01:38:03,277
<i>The face of Cho Hoon has
now been identified clearly.</i>

1528
01:38:03,777 --> 01:38:06,319
<i>If his drug use is confirmed,
it's only a matter of time...</i>

1529
01:38:06,402 --> 01:38:10,444
Prosecutor Ku, a prosecutorial summons?

1530
01:38:10,527 --> 01:38:12,110
Is he out of his mind?

1531
01:38:12,860 --> 01:38:15,527
Think of it as a grand gesture.

1532
01:38:15,610 --> 01:38:19,361
<i>Gwan-hee, bro. What
the heck are you doing?</i>

1533
01:38:19,444 --> 01:38:22,194
Mr. Cho, come in willingly.

1534
01:38:22,277 --> 01:38:24,444
Otherwise, I'll come
with an arrest warrant.

1535
01:38:24,527 --> 01:38:25,527
What?

1536
01:38:28,402 --> 01:38:31,152
You damn prick...

1537
01:38:31,235 --> 01:38:32,235
Mr. Song.

1538
01:38:33,069 --> 01:38:37,652
Cho Hoon is coming in
himself, let the press know.

1539
01:38:40,027 --> 01:38:42,611
<i>The case has been assigned to</i>

1540
01:38:42,694 --> 01:38:45,277
<i>Ku Gwan-hee's
Anti-Corruption Division 3.</i>

1541
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:46,069
Dammit...

1542
01:38:46,152 --> 01:38:48,111
<i>Cho Hoon will appear at</i>

1543
01:38:48,194 --> 01:38:50,211
<i>the Central District Prosecutors'
Office by 9 PM tonight.</i>

1544
01:38:50,235 --> 01:38:52,694
Prosecutor Ku...

1545
01:38:54,944 --> 01:38:56,485
That's so like you.

1546
01:39:02,819 --> 01:39:04,194
Between investigative agencies,

1547
01:39:05,152 --> 01:39:08,944
misunderstandings can
be resolved with words.

1548
01:39:09,027 --> 01:39:11,652
Must we go this far?

1549
01:39:11,735 --> 01:39:15,736
Here's the form for dropping your case.

1550
01:39:15,819 --> 01:39:17,777
Once I fax this to the court,

1551
01:39:17,860 --> 01:39:20,486
the acquittal from the
second trial will be upheld.

1552
01:39:20,569 --> 01:39:25,361
Then you'll be able to continue
your police career, right?

1553
01:39:25,444 --> 01:39:26,860
What are you doing?

1554
01:39:27,610 --> 01:39:30,611
You already know what this is about.

1555
01:39:30,694 --> 01:39:33,152
Kang-su has both the
original and the copies, right?

1556
01:39:33,235 --> 01:39:34,819
Where's that jerk now?

1557
01:39:36,194 --> 01:39:39,527
You're relaxed enough to smile?

1558
01:39:39,610 --> 01:39:43,985
Is your daughter about
six? She's quite cute.

1559
01:39:44,485 --> 01:39:46,694
Let's handle this like humans
before things get cruel.

1560
01:39:46,777 --> 01:39:49,360
You should protect your family, no?

1561
01:40:02,319 --> 01:40:04,444
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1562
01:40:08,569 --> 01:40:11,152
<i>Could you look up over there?</i>

1563
01:40:11,860 --> 01:40:13,902
<i>We're in the front of
the Prosecutors' Office.</i>

1564
01:40:13,985 --> 01:40:16,986
<i>The final presidential debate
will take place tonight.</i>

1565
01:40:17,069 --> 01:40:19,486
<i>Cho Hoon, the son
of Future Unity Party's</i>

1566
01:40:19,569 --> 01:40:21,986
<i>Cho Sang-taek has arrived here</i>

1567
01:40:22,069 --> 01:40:23,986
<i>for a voluntary drug test.</i>

1568
01:40:24,069 --> 01:40:25,253
You're called the
"Korea's Drug Addict,"

1569
01:40:25,277 --> 01:40:26,652
how do you feel?

1570
01:40:28,777 --> 01:40:30,652
Do you acknowledge the charges?

1571
01:40:31,402 --> 01:40:33,069
Mr. Cho Hoon, one comment!

1572
01:40:34,277 --> 01:40:35,860
Do you acknowledge the charges?

1573
01:40:48,569 --> 01:40:50,902
I could have come through
the underground parking lot.

1574
01:40:50,985 --> 01:40:52,652
It's a total circus.

1575
01:40:53,944 --> 01:40:55,152
Where's Ku?

1576
01:40:56,860 --> 01:40:58,735
Mind your manners.

1577
01:41:00,110 --> 01:41:01,694
You're quite unpleasant.

1578
01:41:10,652 --> 01:41:12,012
Are you going to just stay there?

1579
01:41:18,694 --> 01:41:20,194
Have you thought about it?

1580
01:41:23,610 --> 01:41:24,819
Let me have a cigarette.

1581
01:41:24,902 --> 01:41:26,360
Yes, of course.

1582
01:41:35,694 --> 01:41:37,111
Send the fax first.

1583
01:41:37,194 --> 01:41:38,527
Shall I?

1584
01:41:40,277 --> 01:41:42,111
Here, send this fax over.

1585
01:41:42,194 --> 01:41:43,444
Yes, sir.

1586
01:41:46,652 --> 01:41:49,569
Here you go.

1587
01:42:07,319 --> 01:42:09,444
Is this certain?

1588
01:42:10,610 --> 01:42:11,610
Good work.

1589
01:42:26,735 --> 01:42:29,735
Find Lee Kang-su here,
no need to bring him in.

1590
01:42:30,860 --> 01:42:32,235
Do you understand?

1591
01:42:46,235 --> 01:42:48,194
Could you hurry up?

1592
01:42:55,944 --> 01:42:57,319
The attorney can stay here.

1593
01:42:57,402 --> 01:42:58,860
Why, why?

1594
01:43:00,402 --> 01:43:03,319
He can still see you inside!

1595
01:43:04,360 --> 01:43:06,640
It's not like your lawyer will
go to the bathroom for you!

1596
01:43:14,485 --> 01:43:16,610
Come on.

1597
01:43:17,319 --> 01:43:20,485
Use the toilet where I can see you.

1598
01:43:32,485 --> 01:43:33,485
Dammit!

1599
01:43:47,194 --> 01:43:51,694
Ku Gwan-hee, you prick!

1600
01:44:10,902 --> 01:44:12,777
Holy crap!

1601
01:44:15,277 --> 01:44:16,735
What a plot twist.

1602
01:44:21,069 --> 01:44:22,611
Mr. Oh Sang-jae!

1603
01:44:22,694 --> 01:44:25,235
Try to live quietly once you're out.

1604
01:44:26,527 --> 01:44:28,319
Even if I live quietly,

1605
01:44:31,527 --> 01:44:33,152
I'm not sure the world
will settle down.

1606
01:44:33,235 --> 01:44:34,402
There you go again,

1607
01:44:34,485 --> 01:44:36,485
acting like you don't know any better.

1608
01:45:12,652 --> 01:45:14,486
Mr. Park and I'll handle the report,

1609
01:45:14,569 --> 01:45:17,319
so, stay here and get some rest.

1610
01:45:18,694 --> 01:45:20,610
Thank you for your hard work.

1611
01:45:22,735 --> 01:45:23,860
Yes!

1612
01:45:46,069 --> 01:45:47,360
Thank you.

1613
01:45:48,610 --> 01:45:51,819
By the way, whose was that?

1614
01:45:53,902 --> 01:45:57,110
It's from my deputy's
middle-school son.

1615
01:45:58,110 --> 01:46:00,819
It will be very clean.

1616
01:46:01,444 --> 01:46:04,319
The test will come back
negative, no evidence of use.

1617
01:46:04,402 --> 01:46:06,902
We'll release this as breaking news

1618
01:46:06,985 --> 01:46:09,444
right after the debate.

1619
01:46:09,527 --> 01:46:11,861
We'll issue a warrant for
Park Hyun-sook tomorrow.

1620
01:46:11,944 --> 01:46:14,402
A week from now is the election day.

1621
01:46:14,485 --> 01:46:19,069
By then, it'll be impossible
for Yoon's camp to react.

1622
01:46:20,485 --> 01:46:23,444
You're really incredible, sir.

1623
01:46:24,652 --> 01:46:27,486
Wait, about that Song guy...

1624
01:46:27,569 --> 01:46:30,069
- Reporter Song?
- Yes, him.

1625
01:46:30,152 --> 01:46:34,402
I really want to tear him
apart, what should I do?

1626
01:46:34,485 --> 01:46:36,569
No need for that.

1627
01:46:36,652 --> 01:46:38,332
He won't be able to
continue as a reporter.

1628
01:46:38,944 --> 01:46:41,819
Distributing footage against
someone's will violates Article 14

1629
01:46:41,902 --> 01:46:43,736
under the Sexual Violence

1630
01:46:43,819 --> 01:46:45,611
Punishment Act and is punishable by

1631
01:46:45,694 --> 01:46:47,670
with up to 7 years in prison
or a fine of up to $50,000.

1632
01:46:47,694 --> 01:46:49,652
The law will handle him for you.

1633
01:46:50,235 --> 01:46:53,819
He thinks being a reporter
makes him a prosecutor.

1634
01:46:57,485 --> 01:46:58,611
Good evening!

1635
01:46:58,694 --> 01:46:59,986
Prosecutor General!

1636
01:47:00,069 --> 01:47:01,569
- Hey, Gwan-hee.
- Evening, sir.

1637
01:47:01,652 --> 01:47:03,611
I apologize for the trouble.

1638
01:47:03,694 --> 01:47:05,819
It's not like anyone died,

1639
01:47:05,902 --> 01:47:08,819
you were summoned over some drugs?

1640
01:47:08,902 --> 01:47:10,670
Sorry for causing such
a fuss after so long, sir.

1641
01:47:10,694 --> 01:47:13,902
I just spoke with your
father, and reassured him.

1642
01:47:13,985 --> 01:47:15,569
We're all family here.

1643
01:47:15,652 --> 01:47:16,986
This was a major win.

1644
01:47:17,069 --> 01:47:18,569
Not at all, sir.

1645
01:47:18,652 --> 01:47:20,152
Thank you, sir.

1646
01:47:20,235 --> 01:47:22,902
When he was leading the SIU,

1647
01:47:22,985 --> 01:47:24,385
I learned a lot under his guidance.

1648
01:47:24,819 --> 01:47:27,652
I got scolded a lot for
being bad at investigations!

1649
01:47:31,194 --> 01:47:32,569
We're almost there.

1650
01:47:37,152 --> 01:47:38,819
There's the prick.

1651
01:47:43,027 --> 01:47:46,569
I'm sorry, sir, my father is on TV now,

1652
01:47:46,652 --> 01:47:47,985
could we turn it on?

1653
01:47:48,735 --> 01:47:50,277
May I turn on the TV?

1654
01:47:50,360 --> 01:47:51,944
Go on, let's all watch.

1655
01:47:52,027 --> 01:47:53,319

<i>Next up is Candidate Yoon Sung-hyup.</i>

1657
01:47:56,069 --> 01:47:58,569

must direct questions</i>

1658
01:47:58,652 --> 01:48:00,194
<i>to at least two candidates.</i>

1659
01:48:00,694 --> 01:48:03,069
<i>My question is to
Candidate Cho Sang-taek.</i>

1660
01:48:03,152 --> 01:48:06,444
Gwan-hee, when will you
announce the investigation results?

1661
01:48:06,527 --> 01:48:08,361
I plan to do it after the debate.

1662
01:48:08,444 --> 01:48:10,819
Timing is always crucial.

1663
01:48:10,902 --> 01:48:12,277
I'll keep that in mind, sir.

1664
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:16,110
Oh my, his future looks bright.

1665
01:48:17,069 --> 01:48:20,902
If it's confirmed that
my son used drugs,

1666
01:48:21,527 --> 01:48:23,569
I, Cho Sang-taek,

1667
01:48:25,110 --> 01:48:27,277
will immediately withdraw
from the presidential race.

Sir?

01:59:14,152 --> 01:59:16,319
You think I'd eat and run on my own?

01:59:16,402 --> 01:59:17,402
No way!

1819
01:59:17,860 --> 01:59:19,610
Put the gun down.
