169
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,332
Yi Chan is definitely a good student...

170
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,727
that we at HSC want.

171
00:14:59,703 --> 00:15:02,702
We'll do our best to protect him and make sure...

172
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:06,641
what you wished for him when you chose our school comes true.

173
00:15:06,642 --> 00:15:07,841
Please have faith.

174
00:15:07,842 --> 00:15:10,437
I swear on my position as chairman.

175
00:15:11,612 --> 00:15:13,107
Thank you.

176
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:28,128
Hello?

177
00:15:29,002 --> 00:15:30,727
Yes, speaking.

178
00:15:31,372 --> 00:15:33,368
Yes. I'll be right there.

179
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:38,412
We tested the children...

180
00:15:38,413 --> 00:15:41,107
on their English skills during the evaluation.

181
00:15:41,342 --> 00:15:43,381
For class 1-B,

182
00:15:43,382 --> 00:15:46,611
the overall average is AR 1.8.

183
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:50,178
And Yi Chan's was 1.0.

184
00:15:50,523 --> 00:15:52,192
Then...

185
00:15:52,193 --> 00:15:54,957
He's below the class average.

186
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:59,631
He is adapting well to the classes,

187
00:15:59,632 --> 00:16:02,961
but he'll probably need supplemental help.

188
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:06,028
I see. I understand what you mean.

189
00:16:06,403 --> 00:16:08,871
I'll think about what we should do.

190
00:16:08,872 --> 00:16:10,942
Why don't you discuss it with the other mothers...

191
00:16:10,943 --> 00:16:13,611
in the group chatroom to see what they do?

192
00:16:13,612 --> 00:16:16,241
A group chatroom? Is there a group chatroom?

193
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:18,682
I believe the mothers shared their contact information...

194
00:16:18,683 --> 00:16:21,552
after the event yesterday. Didn't you get it?

195
00:16:21,553 --> 00:16:23,447
No, not yet.

196
00:16:23,453 --> 00:16:24,918
In that case.

197
00:16:25,323 --> 00:16:28,662
You should be able to get help from your buddy mom.

198
00:16:28,663 --> 00:16:30,891
New children are matched with someone...

199
00:16:30,892 --> 00:16:34,697
who attended kindergarten here to help them adapt.

200
00:16:34,903 --> 00:16:38,327
Yi Chan's buddy is...

201
00:16:38,703 --> 00:16:41,072
- Hwang Jae In. - I see.

202
00:16:41,073 --> 00:16:44,038
- You'll hear from them soon. - Thank you.

203
00:17:05,132 --> 00:17:06,227
Oh no.

204
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,128
Oh no.

205
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:28,178
Are you all right?

206
00:17:28,652 --> 00:17:30,118
Yes, I am.

207
00:17:30,753 --> 00:17:32,148
You want this?

208
00:17:32,692 --> 00:17:35,118
- I'm fine. - You're wet.

209
00:17:36,763 --> 00:17:38,858
It's breezy, so it'll dry soon.

210
00:17:39,162 --> 00:17:41,227
You'll catch a cold for sure.

211
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:45,197
Use it or not, it's your call.

212
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,497
But don't treat me like some weirdo.

213
00:19:23,402 --> 00:19:25,128
I wanted to return this.

214
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:27,797
Thank you. I appreciate it.

215
00:19:28,202 --> 00:19:31,838
I see. I found it on my way here.

216
00:19:43,122 --> 00:19:45,247
What? Do you ride?

217
00:19:45,922 --> 00:19:49,262
No. It looks dangerous.

218
00:19:49,263 --> 00:19:51,287
And a bit reckless.

219
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:54,532
You're so prejudiced.

220
00:19:54,533 --> 00:19:56,858
You don't know until you try it.

221
00:19:57,033 --> 00:19:58,997
And aren't people...

222
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:03,098
usually drawn to things that are slightly dangerous and reckless?

223
00:20:03,172 --> 00:20:07,207
I'm not sure. I'm not the type to be drawn to such things.

224
00:20:08,842 --> 00:20:11,138
- Okay, then. - Sure.

225
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:33,232
Hello, Yi Chan's mom. I'm Jae In's mom.

226
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:34,898
Finally.

227

Hello. It's nice to meet you.

228

There was so much that I wanted to ask you.

I'm utterly shocked and speechless.

237
00:21:30,023 --> 00:21:32,328
This is wrong, don't you think?

238
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,997
How could our kids and someone like that...

Hello. Sorry for the late introduction.

241
00:21:44,942 --> 00:21:46,171
I'm Yi Chan's mom.

242
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:48,308
I must have not gotten the invite to the chatroom.

243
00:21:49,013 --> 00:21:51,808
Oh my gosh. How did she get into the chatroom?

244
00:21:53,213 --> 00:21:55,878
Don't be so sensitive.

245
00:21:55,952 --> 00:21:58,547
Because of this woman, my Si Woo...

246
00:21:59,723 --> 00:22:02,022
I hated this woman from the get-go.

247
00:22:02,023 --> 00:22:05,257
You know me. Once I hate someone, I always hate them.

248
00:22:07,233 --> 00:22:09,861
She won't last very long here.

249
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:11,868
She'll realize that too.

250
00:22:15,402 --> 00:22:17,138
Welcome, Yi Chan's mom.

251
00:22:17,543 --> 00:22:19,611
I guess you didn't get the invitation yesterday.

(I guess you didn't get the invitation yesterday.)

253
00:22:22,612 --> 00:22:26,207
That's right. Was Si Woo's dad at our hotel on Monday?

254
00:22:27,852 --> 00:22:30,277
- What? - I thought I saw him...

255
00:22:30,523 --> 00:22:33,187
at the front desk and then going up.

256
00:22:33,723 --> 00:22:36,191
What? You must've been mistaken.

257
00:22:36,192 --> 00:22:38,832
He was on a business trip in Europe and got here yesterday.

258
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:40,787
He has a common face.

259
00:22:42,303 --> 00:22:44,668
I know you're apart a lot because of work and whatnot,

260
00:22:45,102 --> 00:22:46,802
but don't leave him alone for too long.

261
00:22:46,803 --> 00:22:48,441
You don't want any headaches.

262
00:22:48,442 --> 00:22:50,767
Gosh. Whatever.

263
00:22:50,842 --> 00:22:53,868
He travels for work more than half the year.

264
00:22:54,142 --> 00:22:56,082
If he were going to cheat,

265
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,848
he'll find a way to cheat regardless. That's men.

266
00:23:00,452 --> 00:23:03,148
Still, don't give him a chance.

267
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:05,717
Let him cheat if he wants to.

268
00:23:06,092 --> 00:23:07,618
Don't forget who I am.

269

270

What are you doing, Yi Chan?

275
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:16,422
My Korean teacher told us to draw a family portrait,

276
00:25:16,422 --> 00:25:18,517
so we can introduce our family to our class.

277

Is that so?

278
00:25:22,263 --> 00:25:25,187
By the way, Mom, can I draw Dad?

279
00:25:25,862 --> 00:25:29,128
Of course, as long as you want to.

280
00:25:29,132 --> 00:25:31,098
I remember what you told me before.

281
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:34,267
Just because we don't see him, it doesn't mean he's gone.

282
00:25:34,702 --> 00:25:37,868
Right. As long as we remember him,

283
00:25:37,872 --> 00:25:39,138
he'll never be gone.

284
00:25:39,172 --> 00:25:41,608
Then is Dad with us too?

285
00:25:44,813 --> 00:25:46,648
I'd like to think so.

286
00:25:57,392 --> 00:25:59,733
- Right here. - Yi Chan.

287
00:25:59,733 --> 00:26:01,158
Did you make a lot of friends?

288
00:26:02,533 --> 00:26:03,928
What should we do tomorrow?

289
00:26:05,073 --> 00:26:09,237
Mom. Can I play with the kids after school?

290
00:26:09,973 --> 00:26:12,638
Do you want to play with them? Is that what you want?

What do you want to do with them?

292
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:18,947
I want to play Catch the Tail and play with water guns too.

293
00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:21,747
And I want to go fishing with them.

294
00:26:23,283 --> 00:26:26,492
Then should we ask them to play with you after school tomorrow?

295
00:26:26,493 --> 00:26:28,918
Really? I love it.

Oh, no. We have a prior engagement.

330
00:28:27,813 --> 00:28:30,237
- Did you drink? - Yes.

331
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:33,947
I had a drink at the tented bar in front of the hospital...

332
00:28:33,983 --> 00:28:35,517
with my employees.

333
00:28:35,553 --> 00:28:37,447
A tented bar? That's random.

334
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:43,487
Well, I was feeling pretty nostalgic today.

335
00:28:44,092 --> 00:28:47,262
Honey, do you remember the first day we met?

336
00:28:47,263 --> 00:28:48,727
We had tteokbokki at a tented bar.

337
00:28:49,702 --> 00:28:52,727
You said it was your first time having sundae too.

338
00:28:54,273 --> 00:28:57,037
It reminded me of our first date, so I bought some.

339
00:28:59,912 --> 00:29:01,878
You were so beautiful then.

340
00:29:06,382 --> 00:29:07,678
You're drunk.

341
00:29:07,882 --> 00:29:09,378
Go upstairs and rest.

342
00:29:09,723 --> 00:29:12,047
You're going to Seoul on a morning flight tomorrow.

343
00:29:12,253 --> 00:29:13,487
Okay.

344
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:28,838
Ma'am, ventilate the fans in the kitchen and living room.

345
00:29:37,543 --> 00:29:38,707
We're late. Let's go.

346
00:29:45,753 --> 00:29:47,047
Hello.

347
00:29:47,053 --> 00:29:49,118
- I guess you're golfing today. - Yes.

348
00:29:49,523 --> 00:29:51,358
I have a tee time in the afternoon.

349
00:29:51,622 --> 00:29:53,257
We should play together sometime.

350
00:29:53,692 --> 00:29:55,803
My hotel has a decent golf course.

351
00:29:55,803 --> 00:29:57,858
I don't play golf.

352
00:29:57,862 --> 00:30:00,197
- I'm not interested in it either. - Is that so?

353
00:30:02,142 --> 00:30:05,207
You'll really have nothing to do here if you don't play golf.

354
00:30:06,942 --> 00:30:09,237
- See you around. - Bye.

355
00:30:13,852 --> 00:30:15,977
Mom, you haven't made friends yet?

356
00:30:16,652 --> 00:30:19,452
I'm not sure. But I think I'll make friends soon just like you.

357
00:30:19,452 --> 00:30:21,348
You should make an effort too.

358
00:30:21,692 --> 00:30:23,418
You'll be bored by yourself.

359
00:30:23,993 --> 00:30:26,328
Okay. I'll make an effort too.

360
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,027
You have your house key.

361
00:30:31,202 --> 00:30:33,527
This is the card key for the on-site facilities.

362
00:30:33,733 --> 00:30:35,997
And these are the documents for your house.

363
00:30:36,573 --> 00:30:38,237
Please give them a read.

364
00:30:38,543 --> 00:30:41,767
Our employees will clean...

365
00:30:41,842 --> 00:30:44,313
the terrace and the shared facilities.

366
00:30:44,313 --> 00:30:45,412
Okay.

367
00:30:45,412 --> 00:30:48,182
By the way, haven't you been here before?

368
00:30:48,182 --> 00:30:51,578
No. My husband probably came alone to sign the contract.

369
00:30:51,952 --> 00:30:54,487
Can I get the key for Complex F?

370
00:30:54,723 --> 00:30:55,993
I heard they moved out.

371
00:30:55,993 --> 00:30:57,787
Sure. I'll get you the key.

372
00:30:58,092 --> 00:31:02,027
Why do people bring their kids to this remote island?

373
00:31:02,702 --> 00:31:05,697
- Pardon? - It's nice to redevelop our island.

374
00:31:05,702 --> 00:31:09,568
Haven't you heard? People come here, and the horses go back to Seoul.

375
00:31:09,642 --> 00:31:11,838
- Isn't that true? - Sure.

376
00:31:11,942 --> 00:31:13,342
I'll get going now.

377
00:31:13,342 --> 00:31:15,977
- Thank you. - Sure. Bye.

378
00:31:20,313 --> 00:31:21,808
Why would you say that?

379
00:31:22,053 --> 00:31:23,578
Do you remember the house I talked about before?

380
00:31:23,652 --> 00:31:26,418
- She moved in there. - What about that?

381
00:31:27,122 --> 00:31:29,358
Is she the one who came with the dead guy?

382
00:31:30,793 --> 00:31:32,628
Gosh. I'm not sure.

383
00:31:34,563 --> 00:31:37,957
Gosh. The emergency contact hasn't been set in case the phone got lost.

384
00:31:38,733 --> 00:31:41,842
Then is there any other way to find out the phone number?

385
00:31:41,842 --> 00:31:43,842
Someone either has to call this number...

386
00:31:43,842 --> 00:31:45,868
or we have to unlock the phone.

387
00:31:45,973 --> 00:31:48,408
So you have no way of reaching the owner of the cell phone?

388
00:31:48,442 --> 00:31:49,608
No.

389
00:31:59,952 --> 00:32:02,257
Let's go and play at the beach.

390
00:32:06,463 --> 00:32:08,732
- Will there be fish? - You bet.

391
00:32:08,733 --> 00:32:12,027
We'll catch fish, pick clams, and get everything you want!

392
00:32:46,702 --> 00:32:50,437
Sir. I want to play with my child at the beach.

393
00:32:52,412 --> 00:32:53,537
Gosh.

394
00:32:53,813 --> 00:32:54,967
Funny seeing you here.

395
00:32:56,442 --> 00:32:57,808
I didn't know you ran a shop here.

396
00:32:59,952 --> 00:33:02,447
You want to play at the beach.

397
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:08,522
- Are you strong? - Pardon?

398
00:33:08,523 --> 00:33:11,292
If you're strong, canoeing is fun.

399
00:33:11,293 --> 00:33:13,787
Snorkeling's the best thing to do with a kid.

400
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:16,797
This is for children.

401
00:33:19,202 --> 00:33:20,467
It'll fit you.

402
00:33:23,842 --> 00:33:25,037
Here you go.

403
00:33:27,912 --> 00:33:31,037
You don't care for surfing but you'll give that a go?

404
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:32,678
Well, yes.

405
00:33:33,182 --> 00:33:35,421
Sir, did you pick out everything you need?

406
00:33:35,422 --> 00:33:37,977
Forget about me. You have another customer.

407
00:33:39,553 --> 00:33:42,658
- You're not the owner? - I'm a customer too.

408
00:33:42,763 --> 00:33:45,121
He's an employee and the boss...

409
00:33:45,122 --> 00:33:47,558
There was a cat. I guess it left.

410
00:33:50,632 --> 00:33:53,128
- Call me when you're stocked. - Sure. Bye.

411
00:33:56,642 --> 00:33:58,368
Who is that guy?

412
00:33:59,743 --> 00:34:01,012
Thank you.

413
00:34:01,013 --> 00:34:02,838
- Take care. - I will. Bye.

414
00:34:08,412 --> 00:34:09,618
My goodness.

415
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:11,447
Get out of the way.

416
00:34:11,653 --> 00:34:13,987
- Will you just... - Gosh.

417
00:34:14,153 --> 00:34:15,487
Darn it.

418
00:34:22,762 --> 00:34:24,627
(- I have other plans. - I'm not free either.)

419
00:34:25,872 --> 00:34:29,197
What should I do? No one's free.

420
00:34:36,012 --> 00:34:37,777
Hello, Yi Chan.

421
00:34:39,113 --> 00:34:40,507
Yi Chan.

422
00:34:42,822 --> 00:34:44,317
Did you have fun?

423
00:34:44,552 --> 00:34:47,688
Yi Chan. I'm so sorry.

424
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:50,121
None of the kids are free today.

425
00:34:50,122 --> 00:34:51,862
How about we go to the sea instead?

426
00:34:51,863 --> 00:34:53,828
Look at this. Mom got...

427
00:34:54,662 --> 00:34:56,828
No. I want to go home.

428
00:34:59,372 --> 00:35:01,797
Why? Is something wrong?

429
00:35:02,903 --> 00:35:03,998
What is it?

430
00:35:06,273 --> 00:35:09,737
Jun Hee, can we get mango bingsu at your hotel today too?

431
00:35:09,813 --> 00:35:12,951
The food at her hotel's the best.

432
00:35:12,952 --> 00:35:15,082
I'll eat two. No, three bowls.

433
00:35:15,083 --> 00:35:17,748
Okay. Eat all you want, pigs.

434
00:35:18,122 --> 00:35:21,018
But we have to play Catch the Tail by the pool.

435
00:35:21,122 --> 00:35:24,917
I won't play any other game. Okay?

436
00:35:24,992 --> 00:35:26,761
- Okay. - Let's go already.

437
00:35:26,762 --> 00:35:29,232
- No. - Guys. Where are you going?

438
00:35:29,233 --> 00:35:31,857
Jun Hee invited us to play at her hotel.

439
00:35:32,673 --> 00:35:34,701
Kids, come along. Let's go.

440
00:35:34,702 --> 00:35:37,598
- Mom! - Mom!

441
00:35:39,213 --> 00:35:42,011
- Mom! - Mom!

442
00:35:42,012 --> 00:35:43,678
- Mom! - Mom!

443
00:35:43,943 --> 00:35:46,308
What were you doing over there?

444
00:35:51,923 --> 00:35:55,817
My gosh. They're so mean.

445
00:35:56,162 --> 00:35:59,431
Yi Chan, we can have more fun without them.

446
00:35:59,432 --> 00:36:02,031
We'll go snorkeling, canoeing...

447
00:36:02,032 --> 00:36:05,498
No. I want to play with friends, not just you all the time.

448
00:36:09,102 --> 00:36:10,837
Okay.

449
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:13,241
(Jae In's Mom)

450
00:36:13,242 --> 00:36:15,071
I'm Jae In's mom from yesterday.

451
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:17,011
We'd like to play with Yi Chan.

452
00:36:17,012 --> 00:36:19,582
Yi Chan, it worked out.

453
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:21,351
Jae In can play with you.

454
00:36:21,352 --> 00:36:24,277
- Jae In? - Yes. Isn't that great?

455
00:36:24,452 --> 00:36:25,788
Are you close to her?

456
00:36:26,753 --> 00:36:28,547
An Yi Chan!

457
00:36:31,423 --> 00:36:33,757
- Hello. - Hello.

458
00:36:34,532 --> 00:36:37,127
My gosh. Hello.

459
00:36:38,532 --> 00:36:41,098
Thank you so much for your help that night.

460
00:36:41,133 --> 00:36:44,538
I'd been bothered that I didn't get your name.

461
00:36:44,742 --> 00:36:47,808
It's fine. You were out of sorts.

462
00:36:48,843 --> 00:36:51,208
Is Yi Chan okay?

463
00:36:51,813 --> 00:36:53,411
Yes, fortunately.

464
00:36:53,412 --> 00:36:55,748
I was worried that he was shaken.

465
00:36:57,423 --> 00:37:00,221
- Hello, Yi Chan. - Hello.

466
00:37:00,222 --> 00:37:02,217
Mom, she's Jae In.

467
00:37:03,293 --> 00:37:04,518
Jae In?

468
00:37:05,392 --> 00:37:06,757
Jae In is...

469
00:37:07,193 --> 00:37:08,998
Are you my buddy mom?

470
00:37:09,463 --> 00:37:11,127
My goodness.

471
00:37:11,733 --> 00:37:14,728
This is great. I'm so pleased to see you again.

472
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:17,297
- I hope we get along. - So do I.

473
00:37:22,213 --> 00:37:26,152
Anyway, she'll be busy, trying to play catch up.

474
00:37:26,153 --> 00:37:28,451
I'm sure she'll manage on her own.

475
00:37:28,452 --> 00:37:31,717
She's a lawyer. She must be organized.

476
00:37:32,492 --> 00:37:35,087
We know for sure she isn't a pushover.

477
00:37:35,093 --> 00:37:36,761
She was hot online,

478
00:37:36,762 --> 00:37:39,257
and her face was in the news.

479
00:37:40,563 --> 00:37:42,228
Oh, no. They're coming this way.

480
00:37:44,463 --> 00:37:45,797
Hello.

481
00:37:47,472 --> 00:37:49,167
Hello, Yi Chan's mom.

482
00:37:49,602 --> 00:37:51,201
There must be a class gathering today.

483
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:53,237
It looks like I got left out.

484
00:37:57,182 --> 00:37:59,578
My Jun Hee's very shy.

485
00:37:59,753 --> 00:38:02,717
I don't think she's that close to Yi Chan yet.

486
00:38:03,423 --> 00:38:05,478
Do you understand? They're just kids.

487
00:38:05,952 --> 00:38:07,991
Of course I do. It's not like...

488
00:38:07,992 --> 00:38:10,217
you'd leave me out of a kids' gathering.

489
00:38:10,492 --> 00:38:12,888
We had other plans anyway.

490
00:38:14,293 --> 00:38:18,428
In that case, you can go on your way.

491
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:27,808
Thank you for inviting me as well, but I'm sorry.

492
00:38:28,273 --> 00:38:30,938
Jae In had made prior plans with Yi Chan.

493
00:38:32,383 --> 00:38:33,647
That's fine.

494
00:38:39,552 --> 00:38:43,388
I hope you have fun. Do invite us next time.

495
00:38:46,293 --> 00:38:48,757
- Let's go, Yi Chan. - Jae In.

497
00:39:19,693 --> 00:39:22,357
Did you see that? She's no pushover.

498
00:39:22,432 --> 00:39:25,257
She made her point without blushing.

499
00:39:25,733 --> 00:39:27,071
Didn't she?

500
00:39:27,072 --> 00:39:30,768
Don't mind her. It's not like we'll hang out with them.

501
00:39:31,142 --> 00:39:33,812
Why did Jae In's mom join her?

502
00:39:33,813 --> 00:39:37,011
Who is Jae In's mom? I haven't heard of her.

503
00:39:37,012 --> 00:39:40,047
She moved back from Hong Kong about six months ago.

504
00:39:40,383 --> 00:39:43,817
From what I heard, she was pretty well-off over there.

505
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:46,491
I don't know what she does,

506
00:39:46,492 --> 00:39:49,121
but she has a gallery somewhere over there.

507
00:39:49,122 --> 00:39:50,721
I don't know what her husband does,

508
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:53,491
but she's pretty young and she goes to and fro.

509
00:39:53,492 --> 00:39:55,998
Oh, that's right. It's her.

510
00:39:56,162 --> 00:39:58,301
I heard something at the gym.

511
00:39:58,302 --> 00:40:01,301
They talked about a pretty woman living alone with her kid.

512
00:40:01,302 --> 00:40:02,938
They said she's divorced or something.

513
00:40:03,273 --> 00:40:06,837
Why did she pick that side when we invited her too?

514
00:40:06,843 --> 00:40:09,411
Let's stop gossiping and concentrate...

515
00:40:09,412 --> 00:40:11,178
on our own activities.

516
00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:22,391
- Well done! - Nice shot!

517
00:40:22,392 --> 00:40:25,317
You played every day and now you're good enough to go pro.

518
00:40:26,032 --> 00:40:27,832
You need to practice hard...

519
00:40:27,833 --> 00:40:29,598
or I won't include you anymore.

520
00:40:30,003 --> 00:40:32,632
I'm not good any anything physical.

521
00:40:32,633 --> 00:40:35,467
I came over today to take photos.

522
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,138
It's not just physical activities you're bad at.

523
00:40:38,273 --> 00:40:40,938
Are you wearing nets they sell oranges in?

524
00:40:41,043 --> 00:40:42,737
Oh, sorry.

525
00:40:43,083 --> 00:40:45,978
If you come dressed like this again, you won't be allowed in.

526
00:40:46,813 --> 00:40:50,547
You moms know nothing about fashion.

527
00:40:50,852 --> 00:40:52,792
Take a photo for me.

528
00:40:52,793 --> 00:40:55,817
You go too far. That's never good.

529
00:41:02,162 --> 00:41:03,697
You're good at this, Yi Chan!

530
00:41:04,032 --> 00:41:06,297
Will you wait for me?

531
00:41:06,532 --> 00:41:09,438
- Keep up. - I'm trying.

532
00:41:12,043 --> 00:41:14,268
The kids are going so fast.

533
00:41:15,642 --> 00:41:17,708
- They're so cute. - This is great fun.

534
00:41:17,883 --> 00:41:19,447
Let's go!

535
00:41:20,412 --> 00:41:23,181
Yi Chan, look at the lake to your left!

536
00:41:23,182 --> 00:41:25,482
- There really is a lake. - Isn't it pretty?

537
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,717
It is!

538
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:29,022
- Is it pretty? - Yes.

539
00:41:29,023 --> 00:41:31,357
- I'm having fun too. - Are you?

540
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,388
Keep up!

541
00:41:33,593 --> 00:41:35,058
I'm coming!

542
00:41:38,202 --> 00:41:39,598
I'm exhausted.

543
00:41:39,802 --> 00:41:42,567
Are you? Kids, come back around!

544
00:41:42,642 --> 00:41:43,868
Take care.

545
00:41:46,843 --> 00:41:48,038
It's hard work.

546
00:41:53,213 --> 00:41:55,507
It's been a while since he's enjoyed himself.

547
00:41:57,182 --> 00:41:59,221
Thanks for bringing us to a lovely place.

548
00:41:59,222 --> 00:42:01,188
You can speak casually.

549
00:42:02,122 --> 00:42:04,018
I can't do that.

550
00:42:05,793 --> 00:42:09,232
It's nicer to be outdoors than stuck in a hotel.

551
00:42:09,233 --> 00:42:10,357
It is.

552
00:42:10,702 --> 00:42:12,098
The truth is,

553
00:42:12,262 --> 00:42:15,228
I'm not cut out for what the moms here do.

554
00:42:15,972 --> 00:42:18,042
They gossip too much,

555
00:42:18,043 --> 00:42:20,408
and they hang out together every day.

556
00:42:20,742 --> 00:42:22,578
I just couldn't do it.

557
00:42:23,613 --> 00:42:24,938
Neither can I.

558
00:42:26,012 --> 00:42:29,011
And now they'll hate me too.

559
00:42:29,012 --> 00:42:32,078
They did go too far. We just want the kids to hang out.

560
00:42:33,322 --> 00:42:36,857
Still, thanks to you, we got to have much more fun.

561
00:42:38,392 --> 00:42:40,462
Something even better's waiting.

562
00:42:40,463 --> 00:42:42,027
There's something better?

563
00:42:47,032 --> 00:42:48,928
- Do you want to have a go? - Yes.

564
00:42:52,003 --> 00:42:53,638
My gosh.

565
00:42:54,343 --> 00:42:56,011
I could've caught it.

566
00:42:56,012 --> 00:42:57,538
They're so excited.

567
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:01,951
When did you prepare all this?

568
00:43:01,952 --> 00:43:03,178
Doesn't it look good?

569
00:43:04,182 --> 00:43:05,523
My gosh.

570
00:43:05,523 --> 00:43:06,992
I'll do it.

571
00:43:06,992 --> 00:43:08,452
You should rest.

572
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:10,757
Still. I feel bad. I'll do it.

573
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:12,518
Let me try.

574
00:43:12,863 --> 00:43:14,228
This here?

575
00:43:14,293 --> 00:43:15,558
Like this?

576
00:43:17,432 --> 00:43:19,667
- Hey! - I'll just do it.

577
00:43:19,733 --> 00:43:21,027
Give me that.

578
00:43:29,682 --> 00:43:30,908
This is nice.

579
00:43:32,782 --> 00:43:35,078
I've never gone camping before.

580
00:43:36,753 --> 00:43:39,317
I should stick to you from now on.

581
00:43:41,753 --> 00:43:46,357
So, what did you decide to do about Yi Chan's English lessons?

582
00:43:47,463 --> 00:43:49,598
That... I don't know.

583
00:43:50,003 --> 00:43:52,197
Should we do joint lessons with Jae In?

584
00:43:52,432 --> 00:43:55,173
She's pretty good because she was in Hong Kong.

585
00:43:55,173 --> 00:43:57,242
It would probably help Yi Chan to put them together.

586
00:43:57,242 --> 00:44:00,043
Do you mean it? I'd love that.

587
00:44:00,043 --> 00:44:01,567
But Jae In would be losing out.

588
00:44:01,943 --> 00:44:04,938
Not at all. It's good for her too.

589
00:44:05,583 --> 00:44:06,908
She made a friend.

590
00:44:12,153 --> 00:44:16,087
That's true. Kids need friends more than anything right now.

591
00:44:20,233 --> 00:44:23,498
I completely lost track of time.

592
00:44:24,563 --> 00:44:25,897
Yi Chan.

593
00:44:26,532 --> 00:44:28,297
Let's go.

594
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:30,098
What time is it?

595
00:44:43,883 --> 00:44:46,917
- You dropped this. - Thank you.

596
00:44:48,023 --> 00:44:50,063
Look at the time.

597
00:44:50,063 --> 00:44:51,122
We should get going.

598
00:44:51,122 --> 00:44:53,857
Let's go somewhere nicer next time without the kids.

599
00:44:53,892 --> 00:44:55,627
Yes, let's.

600
00:44:58,662 --> 00:44:59,868
Yi Chan.

601
00:45:07,555 --> 00:45:10,391
My mom is the celebrity Cha Do Young,

602
00:45:10,456 --> 00:45:13,560
and my dad is the president of Next Gate, a gaming company.

603
00:45:13,726 --> 00:45:16,861
My dad is super busy developing games,

604
00:45:16,896 --> 00:45:19,060
so he's always on business trips.

605
00:45:19,336 --> 00:45:21,661
He's leaving for another business trip today.

606
00:45:22,206 --> 00:45:25,201
He's never home, so it feels the same here...

607
00:45:25,476 --> 00:45:26,841
or in Seoul.

608
00:45:27,876 --> 00:45:29,370
Where are you going this time?

609
00:45:29,775 --> 00:45:32,111
- For how long? - What?

610
00:45:33,186 --> 00:45:36,611
Well... I'll be stopping by Shanghai...

611
00:45:36,956 --> 00:45:40,586
then briefly in Singapore and then Hong Kong...

612
00:45:40,586 --> 00:45:42,181
I'll be back after at least a week.

613
00:45:43,626 --> 00:45:45,920
It's like a tour of Southeast Asia.

614
00:45:46,996 --> 00:45:48,161
Is it really a business trip?

615
00:45:49,836 --> 00:45:52,330
What do you mean? That's so random.

616
00:45:53,606 --> 00:45:54,801
Well...

617
00:45:55,566 --> 00:45:57,931
Someone thought they saw you here...

618
00:45:58,106 --> 00:46:00,440
at the hotel a few days ago,

619
00:46:00,746 --> 00:46:02,500
not in Europe.

620
00:46:10,055 --> 00:46:13,126
Why would I have been there? Don't be ridiculous.

621
00:46:13,126 --> 00:46:14,821
Do you want to see my boarding pass?

622
00:46:15,186 --> 00:46:18,190
Should I show you my pictures?

623
00:46:22,965 --> 00:46:24,491
That's not necessary.

624
00:46:24,936 --> 00:46:28,060
You're not that dumb.

625
00:46:28,465 --> 00:46:31,201
Whatever you do is your prerogative.

626
00:46:31,275 --> 00:46:34,270
We agreed to respect each other's freedom before we got married.

627
00:46:35,675 --> 00:46:38,611
However, do not get caught.

628
00:46:39,075 --> 00:46:41,881
You know I hate being humiliated more than anything else.

629
00:46:45,155 --> 00:46:47,721
Think what you wish.

630
00:46:49,755 --> 00:46:53,361
What a great way to send off your husband.

631
00:46:54,496 --> 00:46:55,661
Seriously.

632
00:46:56,296 --> 00:46:59,261
He brings me the latest game whenever he comes back,

633
00:46:59,606 --> 00:47:01,161
so I love it.

634
00:47:01,305 --> 00:47:03,730
I wish he'll always go on business trips.

635
00:47:03,836 --> 00:47:06,670
My mom says she prefers it when my dad is away too.

636
00:47:06,805 --> 00:47:09,511
Variety shows that heal the soul are trending now.

637
00:47:09,516 --> 00:47:12,911
Devoted mom Cha Do Young and her son's life on Jeju Island.

638
00:47:12,945 --> 00:47:15,741
That will totally sell.

639
00:47:15,746 --> 00:47:19,425
Your son attends an international school, so it's perfect.

640
00:47:19,425 --> 00:47:21,051
That's true, but...

641
00:47:21,485 --> 00:47:25,221
Anyway, I really won't do it unless I'm the main celebrity.

642
00:47:25,226 --> 00:47:27,920
It's not just about me. It'll be Si Woo's debut.

643
00:47:28,796 --> 00:47:31,195
Okay, fine. Let's talk later.

644
00:47:31,195 --> 00:47:32,805
My mom has been taking time off,

645
00:47:32,805 --> 00:47:35,560
but she plans to shoot dramas and variety shows soon.

646
00:47:36,036 --> 00:47:39,031
So she has been busy talking with her agency...

647
00:47:39,135 --> 00:47:41,206
and meeting people recently.

648
00:47:41,206 --> 00:47:43,471

No.

Your dad died.

Why are you drawing in a dead person?

667
00:48:53,885 --> 00:48:56,185
That's not true. You don't know anything.

668

Ma'am. He's lying.

669

He's a liar who can't even speak English.

You stupid liar.

671

That's enough. Quiet.

Both of you will get in trouble if you don't stop.

Yes. It's good. Why?

I'll take yours if you don't want it.

Give me your egg.

Okay, very good. Let's go.

It's on me.

706
00:51:12,215 --> 00:51:14,381
I can treat.

What?

708

Hey, An Yi Chan. Did you break that?

709
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:03,181
An Yi Chan! You'd better get me a new drone!

710
00:52:06,385 --> 00:52:08,380
Yi Chan did this?

711
00:52:08,885 --> 00:52:12,455
I saw it when I came back to the classroom after lunch.

712
00:52:12,456 --> 00:52:15,820
He was in the classroom after breaking Si Woo's drone.

713
00:52:16,296 --> 00:52:18,960
Jun Hee, don't interrupt this meeting.

714
00:52:20,506 --> 00:52:23,034
How will you fix this? I want my drone back!

715
00:52:23,035 --> 00:52:24,601
My Power Drone!

716
00:52:24,606 --> 00:52:27,270
Si Woo, we heard you. Be quiet.

717
00:52:29,245 --> 00:52:33,411
Si Woo's father gave him for getting accepted to this school.

718
00:52:33,615 --> 00:52:36,451
I don't need you to pay for it. A sincere apology will do.

719
00:52:37,615 --> 00:52:41,324
Yi Chan. Is this true? It's okay. You can tell me the truth.

720
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:42,924
I'm not trying to scold you.

721
00:52:42,925 --> 00:52:45,054
When you make mistakes, you can apologize.

722
00:52:45,055 --> 00:52:46,724
Mom, I didn't do it.

723
00:52:46,725 --> 00:52:48,491
Stop lying.

724
00:52:48,595 --> 00:52:50,565
All you ever do is lie. You liar.

725
00:52:50,566 --> 00:52:52,431
No. I didn't do it.

726
00:52:55,336 --> 00:52:57,205
Yi Chan said he didn't do it.

727
00:52:57,206 --> 00:52:59,570
The kids must have been mistaken.

728
00:52:59,945 --> 00:53:01,070
Mistaken?

729
00:53:01,245 --> 00:53:04,045
Then tell him to explain what happened.

730
00:53:04,046 --> 00:53:06,074
He was standing in front of the broken drone.

731
00:53:06,075 --> 00:53:08,215
He must know what happened to it.

732
00:53:08,216 --> 00:53:10,485
All right, ladies.

733
00:53:10,486 --> 00:53:13,621
We didn't bring you here, so you could fight.

734
00:53:13,725 --> 00:53:15,520
The kids are watching.

735
00:53:15,856 --> 00:53:17,451
Please calm down.

736
00:53:17,725 --> 00:53:19,690
Yi Chan, look at me.

737
00:53:20,765 --> 00:53:22,621
See? He can't explain what happened.

738
00:53:22,626 --> 00:53:23,960
Calm down.

739
00:53:24,896 --> 00:53:26,290
Gosh.

740
00:53:26,405 --> 00:53:29,735
When there's smoke, there's fire.

741
00:53:29,736 --> 00:53:31,174
I heard that your son...

742
00:53:31,175 --> 00:53:33,340
attacked another student at his previous school.

743
00:53:35,175 --> 00:53:37,811
Ms. Cha. Please.

744
00:53:38,745 --> 00:53:40,645
Don't cross the line.

745
00:53:40,646 --> 00:53:43,110
- That has nothing to do with this. - Enough with that.

746
00:53:43,716 --> 00:53:46,355
Sir, how will you handle this?

747
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:48,585
We have a huge problem on our hands at the beginning of a new semester.

748
00:53:48,586 --> 00:53:50,895
How can I let a kid like him be in the same class with my son?

749
00:53:50,896 --> 00:53:53,165
I agree with her.

750
00:53:53,166 --> 00:53:55,920
I don't think this is right.

751
00:54:06,106 --> 00:54:08,971
Hello, ma'am. What brings you here?

752
00:54:09,345 --> 00:54:12,215
We're in the middle of an important conversation.

753
00:54:12,216 --> 00:54:15,911
We're here because there's something you must know about that matter.

754
00:54:16,856 --> 00:54:18,081
Yi Chan...

755
00:54:19,385 --> 00:54:21,420
didn't break the drone.

756
00:55:02,626 --> 00:55:05,290
Oh, no. What do I do?

757
00:55:05,365 --> 00:55:07,360
What am I going to do?

758
00:55:25,515 --> 00:55:26,681
What?

759
00:55:28,526 --> 00:55:30,121
Hey, An Yi Chan.

760
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:41,460
What... How...

761
00:55:41,736 --> 00:55:43,000
I'm sorry.

762
00:55:43,436 --> 00:55:47,201
Jae In must have really liked Si Woo's drone.

763
00:55:48,106 --> 00:55:51,911
Please allow me to compensate you for the broken drone.

764
00:55:52,945 --> 00:55:55,610
Compensation isn't the issue here.

765
00:55:55,615 --> 00:55:59,811
Bringing an expensive drone to school was the problem.

766
00:55:59,986 --> 00:56:02,681
This could have happened at any school.

767
00:56:04,356 --> 00:56:07,520
So it's his fault for bringing this to school?

768
00:56:07,896 --> 00:56:10,061
What nonsense is that?

769
00:56:10,436 --> 00:56:14,701
Ms. Cha, you must follow the school regulations.

770
00:56:14,736 --> 00:56:18,174
And you must also establish some ground rules at home.

771
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:20,275
What are you saying right now?

772
00:56:20,276 --> 00:56:23,040
My son is a victim in all this.

773
00:56:23,475 --> 00:56:27,610
Anyway, it is true that your son broke the school regulation.

774
00:56:27,785 --> 00:56:31,011
And as for this matter, we will give a warning...

775
00:56:31,416 --> 00:56:34,121
to Si Woo and Jae In. Let's end it there.

776
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:39,965
All right. Why don't we conclude our meeting here?

777
00:56:39,966 --> 00:56:41,561
What on earth?

778
00:56:41,796 --> 00:56:43,531
Do you think this makes any sense?

779
00:56:44,166 --> 00:56:47,134
That's enough. Don't cause a scene now.

780
00:56:47,135 --> 00:56:49,801
- Why must I... - Do Young.

781
00:56:52,836 --> 00:56:56,201
Fine. I should be the bigger person. I have nothing but my fame to blame.

782
00:56:59,216 --> 00:57:00,380
Let's go.

783
00:57:17,666 --> 00:57:19,534
What took you so long?

784
00:57:19,535 --> 00:57:22,465
Because I'm a woman. Men need to be considerate.

785
00:57:22,466 --> 00:57:24,270
You're just like your father.

786
00:57:24,635 --> 00:57:26,070
Hold on.

787
00:57:28,706 --> 00:57:31,014
What? Is there more we need to talk about?

788
00:57:31,015 --> 00:57:32,340
Apologize.

789
00:57:32,716 --> 00:57:35,014
You accused my son of breaking the drone and were rude to him.

790
00:57:35,015 --> 00:57:37,411
And you even brought up what happened in the past.

791
00:57:37,515 --> 00:57:39,051
A sincere apology will do.

792
00:57:48,066 --> 00:57:51,065
Yi Chan. I'm so sorry.

793
00:57:51,066 --> 00:57:54,230
What I did today was wrong. Okay?

794
00:57:56,305 --> 00:57:57,500
Happy now?

795
00:57:57,876 --> 00:58:00,170
It's not like I did that on purpose.

796
00:58:03,305 --> 00:58:04,411
Let's go.

797
00:58:08,816 --> 00:58:09,980
Yi Chan.

798
00:58:10,385 --> 00:58:13,181
You didn't tell me anything earlier because of Jae In?

799
00:58:13,486 --> 00:58:15,324
- Yes. - You must have been upset.

800
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:18,290
I didn't know how you were feeling. I'm sorry.

801
00:58:21,126 --> 00:58:22,391
Good job.

802
00:58:27,506 --> 00:58:30,375
Thank you for telling the truth.

803
00:58:30,376 --> 00:58:31,804
I know it wasn't easy.

804
00:58:31,805 --> 00:58:34,400
No. Of course we should.

805
00:58:35,506 --> 00:58:38,311
I'm glad that things worked out well.

806
00:58:39,546 --> 00:58:42,811
Yi Chan. I'm sorry.

807
00:58:43,146 --> 00:58:44,480
It's okay.

808
00:58:53,126 --> 00:58:54,261
All right.

809
00:58:55,166 --> 00:58:56,320
Oh, no.

810
00:59:03,736 --> 00:59:07,701
When I moved here, I thought everything was going to be fine.

811
00:59:08,475 --> 00:59:10,770
And I was going to focus only on Yi Chan.

812
00:59:12,515 --> 00:59:14,880
Perhaps, I must have been too naive.

813
00:59:17,756 --> 00:59:19,451
This is your first time.

814
00:59:19,785 --> 00:59:22,250
Everyone makes mistakes during their first times.

815
00:59:23,325 --> 00:59:25,654
So from now on, don't burden yourself...

816
00:59:25,655 --> 00:59:27,494
or bottle it up alone.

817
00:59:27,495 --> 00:59:30,891
When things are tough, tell people that and ask for help.

818
00:59:31,336 --> 00:59:33,190
You should rely on other people too.

819
00:59:35,035 --> 00:59:37,301
Now, it's not just you and Yi Chan anymore.

820
00:59:37,606 --> 00:59:38,900
You have me too.

821
00:59:41,146 --> 00:59:44,070
Right. I have you now.

822
00:59:44,916 --> 00:59:47,411
You should do that, so I can do the same with you, Yeo Wool.

823
00:59:47,845 --> 00:59:50,141
Two is much better than one.

824
00:59:56,026 --> 00:59:58,194
- They are having fun. - Let's go over there.

825
00:59:58,195 --> 00:59:59,895
She's his first friend he made here.

826
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:01,420
It's the same with her.

827
01:00:06,236 --> 01:00:07,860
Should we be friends too?

828
01:00:09,666 --> 01:00:10,931
Should we?

829
01:00:12,506 --> 01:00:14,301
Come on, drop the honorifics now.

830
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:16,706
Can I keep calling you by your name?

831
01:00:16,706 --> 01:00:17,971
Of course.

832
01:00:18,416 --> 01:00:20,610
I mean, yes.

833
01:00:26,716 --> 01:00:30,855
As you know, the foundation has a great interest in the student.

834
01:00:30,856 --> 01:00:34,621
I want you to be aware of that, so there aren't any more mishaps.

835
01:00:35,396 --> 01:00:38,895
Right. And it's about the new teacher...

836
01:00:38,896 --> 01:00:41,531
we discussed the other day. How is that going?

837
01:00:42,966 --> 01:00:44,400
Starting today?

838
01:00:44,876 --> 01:00:48,601
Then set up an interview with me in a couple of days.

843
01:02:10,256 --> 01:02:11,621
Why bother sending this?

844
01:02:20,195 --> 01:02:22,066
Did you get back home safely?

845
01:02:22,066 --> 01:02:23,201
Yes.

846
01:02:24,006 --> 01:02:26,730
You're pretty good at being sweet.

847
01:02:26,776 --> 01:02:29,000
When did you send this?

848
01:02:29,175 --> 01:02:31,210
Pardon? Send what?

849
01:02:31,216 --> 01:02:34,440
The flowers. Thank you.

850
01:02:34,845 --> 01:02:37,210
My husband was the last person to get me any.

851
01:02:37,285 --> 01:02:38,451
Flowers?

852
01:02:38,986 --> 01:02:40,621
They weren't from me.

853
01:02:40,756 --> 01:02:42,181
What do you mean?

854
01:02:42,186 --> 01:02:44,920
Did someone send you flowers?

855
01:02:45,026 --> 01:02:47,391
Who is it? A guy?

856
01:02:47,966 --> 01:02:50,630
I thought it was you.

You reached Woori Logistics.

Did you see my son, Yi Chan?

You know the moms have high hopes, don't you?

To a very exceptionally special school.

Someone who can't be here is here.

874
01:07:02,145 --> 01:07:05,416
If the mom's clumsy and ignorant, the child pays the price.

875
01:07:05,416 --> 01:07:07,821
- Are you trying to be a nuisance? - It's a time bomb.

This mom was wearing this that day.

But I never lost mine.

Tell the truth exactly as it happened.

How can you blackmail me with this?

It's not blackmailing. It's a negotiation.
