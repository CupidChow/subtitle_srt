She's pretty.

Oh, my gosh.

67
00:09:26,246 --> 00:09:27,917
What lovely skin.

68
00:09:34,817 --> 00:09:36,986
What, am I the first one here?

69
00:09:46,736 --> 00:09:48,596
Isn't that Daesang Group's Nam Ji Sun?

70

(- Are you ready, June? - Of course. Don't worry.)

(- Escort her. - Okay. Shall we?)

74
00:10:08,087 --> 00:10:10,386
Hey, Ji Sun. You're here.

75
00:10:15,526 --> 00:10:18,366
Your outfit... Are you making a statement?

76
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:21,096
I just wanted to make a point.

77
00:10:21,967 --> 00:10:23,807
It's a piece from this year's Spring-Summer season.

78
00:10:24,067 --> 00:10:28,177
I got it first by special free order from the Cheongdam main branch.

79
00:10:29,106 --> 00:10:31,677
It's the kids' interview, not your audition.

80
00:10:31,677 --> 00:10:33,346
Why do you want to gain attention?

81
00:10:33,846 --> 00:10:35,016
I know that.

82
00:10:35,346 --> 00:10:38,846
But the interview is as good as over in the first ten seconds.

83
00:10:39,187 --> 00:10:42,256
I need a different edge...

84
00:10:43,026 --> 00:10:45,026
to get noticed.

85
00:10:45,756 --> 00:10:48,197
Your first kid studies here, so you can pretty much relax.

86
00:10:48,197 --> 00:10:49,866
You wouldn't know the pressure.

87
00:10:52,327 --> 00:10:53,766
I can't relax.

88
00:10:54,467 --> 00:10:57,067
The sibling advantage doesn't guarantee a place.

89
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:59,537
It's just a few extra points.

90
00:10:59,907 --> 00:11:02,177
Let's not cause too big a fuss about the kids' schools.

91
00:11:02,177 --> 00:11:05,447
Oh, sure. I'm sure that's what you think, Ms. Nam Ji Sun.

92
00:11:07,177 --> 00:11:10,346
That darn sib-something advantage.

93
00:11:10,346 --> 00:11:11,746
I'm so jealous you have it.

94
00:11:11,817 --> 00:11:13,957
Si Woo has a US passport, so that's a plus too.

95
00:11:13,957 --> 00:11:15,016
Don't even mention it.

96
00:11:15,057 --> 00:11:19,157
If you see what he's like, he'll lose all his extra points.

97
00:11:21,157 --> 00:11:23,896
Oh, my. Jun Hee's mom?

98
00:11:25,827 --> 00:11:27,366
Fancy meeting you here.

99
00:11:28,567 --> 00:11:29,766
Did your kids...

100
00:11:29,967 --> 00:11:32,437
apply for a spot too? I didn't know.

101
00:11:32,537 --> 00:11:35,876
I heard your husband opened another hospital here. Was this why?

102
00:11:35,976 --> 00:11:37,407
Your second kid will go here too?

103
00:11:37,407 --> 00:11:38,407
Yes.

104
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:41,547
As you must all agree, there's no better option.

105
00:11:41,776 --> 00:11:43,817
We can't send the kids abroad already.

106
00:11:43,817 --> 00:11:45,386
- You're right. - Yeah, that's right.

107
00:11:45,986 --> 00:11:47,116
By the way...

108
00:11:48,657 --> 00:11:51,457
Say hello. I mentioned them before.

109
00:11:51,726 --> 00:11:55,026
Her husband is KA Media's chairman, and hers is Assemblyman...

110
00:11:58,667 --> 00:11:59,736
My gosh.

111
00:12:00,096 --> 00:12:02,567
Hello. I heard a lot about you.

112
00:12:02,736 --> 00:12:05,537
I'm Cha Do Young, Kwak Si Woo's mom.

113
00:12:05,937 --> 00:12:08,407
- Oh, I see. - Nice to meet you.

114
00:12:24,356 --> 00:12:25,526
Hello.

115
00:12:26,026 --> 00:12:27,496
Oh, hello.

116
00:12:27,856 --> 00:12:29,557
Did your kid attend Gyeongnam Elementary?

117
00:12:29,827 --> 00:12:31,766
No, Jeongmyeong Elementary School.

118
00:12:32,026 --> 00:12:35,037
Oh, my mistake. I thought you looked familiar.

119
00:12:35,037 --> 00:12:36,037
I see.

120
00:12:36,037 --> 00:12:38,567
Isn't Jeongmyeong the public school in Daechi-dong?

121
00:12:38,567 --> 00:12:39,677
Yes, it is.

122
00:12:40,307 --> 00:12:42,736
I heard the moms there are hardcore.

123
00:12:42,937 --> 00:12:45,006
Ji Sun, make me a black coffee.

124
00:12:47,317 --> 00:12:51,486
So, did you live abroad as well?

125
00:12:51,616 --> 00:12:52,746
The US?

126
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:56,157
No. We lived in Korea all our lives.

127
00:12:57,457 --> 00:12:59,087
I wish you good luck.

128
00:12:59,157 --> 00:13:00,427
Thank you.

129
00:13:02,126 --> 00:13:03,327

Because I'm an actress,

143

I'm pretty well-known.

144

I just couldn't send my kid...

145

to an ordinary public school.

146
00:13:47,677 --> 00:13:49,947
They talk nonsense and way too much.

147
00:13:50,407 --> 00:13:52,677
But here, everyone is on a pretty similar level,

148

You're done?

I don't want to force my kid to study.

151
00:14:21,177 --> 00:14:23,746
It's not like he can be forced.

152
00:14:24,807 --> 00:14:27,646
Anyway, I hope he finds his interest here,

153

and gets along well with friends.

154

He can go abroad later.

00:15:04,717 --> 00:15:07,917
I'm the mother of G9 student president Lee Jun Mo.

166
00:15:08,087 --> 00:15:10,457
I'm also parents' representative of the PTA.

167
00:15:13,657 --> 00:15:15,427
who is the president of student council.

168
00:15:15,496 --> 00:15:17,827
I'm also the parents' representative for the PTA.

169
00:15:17,896 --> 00:15:20,297
Your child is really exceptionally bright and clever.

170
00:15:20,366 --> 00:15:21,636
Truly outstanding.

171
00:15:22,697 --> 00:15:25,307
She just tries a little harder, that's all.

172
00:15:25,366 --> 00:15:27,376
Why are you applying for this school?

173
00:15:28,476 --> 00:15:29,577
Well...

174
00:15:29,876 --> 00:15:32,346
Since her big brother goes here,

175
00:15:32,407 --> 00:15:35,547
it was only natural that she thought of going here as well.

176
00:15:36,047 --> 00:15:39,187
Above all else, I thought it would be good...

177
00:15:39,486 --> 00:15:42,317
for both my children and myself if they attend the same school.

178
00:15:43,827 --> 00:15:46,596
It's always the best to do what comes naturally.

179
00:15:57,807 --> 00:16:01,776
(No. It's good to go with the flow. That's what I meant.)

180
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:06,947
(It's okay. I understand.)

181
00:16:07,016 --> 00:16:12,447
(When my husband went to Stanford University for his MBA...)

182
00:16:15,217 --> 00:16:17,226
Never mind. I'll just speak in Korean.

183
00:16:17,327 --> 00:16:21,427
We lived in Palo Alto until he finished kindergarten.

184
00:16:21,596 --> 00:16:23,726
Just as I majored in music,

185
00:16:23,797 --> 00:16:27,967
my son Noah is especially talented in music,

186
00:16:28,037 --> 00:16:30,266
more specifically in classical music.

187
00:16:30,337 --> 00:16:32,537
So I plan to create a portfolio for him.

188
00:16:32,606 --> 00:16:34,636
Although the election is coming up,

189
00:16:34,707 --> 00:16:39,077
he is very involved when it comes to our child's education.

190
00:16:40,246 --> 00:16:42,677
They don't have to be a diamond among stones.

191
00:16:42,746 --> 00:16:47,116
But what parent wants their child to be rubble?

192
00:16:47,187 --> 00:16:49,557
All parents feel the same.

193
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:54,396
Also, since everyone at the school is from the upper class,

194
00:16:54,557 --> 00:16:58,697
all of the friends will be from similar backgrounds.

195
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:02,996
(So I see here you're a lawyer?)

196
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:04,307
(Yes, I am.)

197
00:17:04,467 --> 00:17:08,437
(But I'm between jobs for personal reasons at the moment.)

198
00:17:08,606 --> 00:17:10,547
(Why are you applying for this school?)

199
00:17:17,717 --> 00:17:20,856
I really didn't want to say this.

200
00:17:21,256 --> 00:17:23,217
Given what happened with your family...

201
00:17:23,287 --> 00:17:25,457
And I know things have been tough,

202
00:17:25,526 --> 00:17:28,756
but Yi Chan is causing many problems at the school.

203
00:17:29,496 --> 00:17:30,626
I'm very sorry.

204
00:17:30,697 --> 00:17:32,766
We are exceptionally passionate about education,

205
00:17:32,827 --> 00:17:35,537
even among schools in Gangnam. You know that.

206
00:17:36,037 --> 00:17:38,106
Even with this incident with Se Jun...

207
00:17:39,366 --> 00:17:40,876
This is his medical report.

208
00:17:41,106 --> 00:17:43,746
I sent you an itemized bill, so you should look through it.

209
00:17:43,807 --> 00:17:46,776
We're going to sue, just so you know.

210
00:17:47,476 --> 00:17:51,546
I'm sure you know that my husband is a prosecutor.

211
00:17:51,717 --> 00:17:54,417
And you're in law yourself.

212
00:17:55,286 --> 00:17:57,026
So we should take it to court.

213
00:17:57,086 --> 00:18:00,197
Please don't do this. They're still kids.

214
00:18:00,256 --> 00:18:01,256
Please be...

215
00:18:01,326 --> 00:18:03,967
If a child does something wrong, the parent should pay for it.

216
00:18:04,526 --> 00:18:08,437
Se Jun got a cast this big on this tiny arm.

217
00:18:09,437 --> 00:18:12,836
When I think about the psychological stress your kid put him through...

218
00:18:12,907 --> 00:18:13,976
Ma'am.

219
00:18:17,546 --> 00:18:21,016
What must I do to lessen your anger?

220
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,617
Make your child...

221
00:18:24,217 --> 00:18:27,256
officially apologize to Se Jun.

222
00:18:28,957 --> 00:18:30,657
- Apologize? - No?

223
00:18:30,726 --> 00:18:33,826
Then transfer him out or have him drop out. Your call.

224
00:18:46,506 --> 00:18:48,907
Yi Chan, Se Jun's mom is here.

225
00:18:49,937 --> 00:18:53,417
If you did something wrong, you should apologize and make up.

226
00:18:54,347 --> 00:18:55,947
Do you want to apologize to Se Jun?

227
00:18:59,447 --> 00:19:01,816
No. I did nothing wrong.

228
00:19:04,387 --> 00:19:06,726
Okay. Got it.

229
00:19:14,937 --> 00:19:16,967
He won't apologize.

230
00:19:17,637 --> 00:19:19,766
It's not right that only my child should apologize.

231
00:19:21,637 --> 00:19:23,276
He did nothing wrong?

232
00:19:23,776 --> 00:19:25,647
How could you say that? My son was hurt!

233
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:27,617
Se Jun started it.

234
00:19:28,076 --> 00:19:31,086
He fell while pushing a desk to hit Yi Chan.

235
00:19:31,246 --> 00:19:34,816
Yi Chan may not have been as hurt, but he hurt his face too.

236
00:19:35,187 --> 00:19:38,457
If you want an apology, have Se Jun apologize too.

237
00:19:39,486 --> 00:19:42,127
Yi Chan was stressed because of him too.

238
00:19:42,427 --> 00:19:43,427
Of all the...

239
00:19:43,496 --> 00:19:47,967
I apologize for all the stress Yi Chan caused.

240
00:19:48,566 --> 00:19:49,897
As you say, it would be nice if only kids...

241
00:19:49,967 --> 00:19:53,976
who are perfectly prepared came to the school.

242
00:19:54,076 --> 00:19:56,437
But why do we need schools then?

243
00:19:56,536 --> 00:19:59,506
And why do we need you? Am I wrong?

244
00:19:59,607 --> 00:20:01,677
Ma'am. That's a bit...

245
00:20:01,746 --> 00:20:04,387
Yi Chan made it difficult the manage the class.

246
00:20:04,986 --> 00:20:07,957
Is that why you ignored it while Se Jun and the other kids...

247
00:20:08,187 --> 00:20:09,516
bullied Yi Chan all this time?

248
00:20:09,586 --> 00:20:11,457
Oh my gosh. Bully?

249
00:20:12,056 --> 00:20:13,756
You seem to be mistaken.

250
00:20:13,826 --> 00:20:16,996
Ma'am. That was because the kids are still young...

251
00:20:17,066 --> 00:20:19,726
They may be young, but they know what they're doing.

252
00:20:20,296 --> 00:20:23,736
Yi Chan does not harass and hit other kids for no reason.

253
00:20:24,536 --> 00:20:27,177
Are you trying to start a fight?

254
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:30,246
I won't...

255
00:20:31,006 --> 00:20:33,746
send my child to a school like this anymore.

256
00:20:34,246 --> 00:20:36,917
A person who treats a child like he's abnormal and takes sides...

257
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,546
is not a teacher in my eyes.

258
00:20:38,617 --> 00:20:41,217
- Ma'am. - Sue, press charges...

259
00:20:41,286 --> 00:20:42,556
Do whatever you want.

260
00:20:43,016 --> 00:20:45,157
Thanks for everything.

261
00:20:47,627 --> 00:20:49,697
Oh my gosh.

262
00:20:49,996 --> 00:20:51,927
I am speechless.

263
00:20:52,367 --> 00:20:53,637
Look at that.

264
00:20:53,697 --> 00:20:55,836
What could he have learned from a mom like that?

265
00:20:56,266 --> 00:20:58,937
Why did we get involved with a criminal family?

266
00:20:59,006 --> 00:21:00,236
Seriously!

267
00:21:04,947 --> 00:21:07,976
Mom. I'm sorry.

268
00:21:10,746 --> 00:21:13,246
It's okay. I believe you.

269
00:21:13,617 --> 00:21:15,556
I know you didn't start it.

270
00:21:16,457 --> 00:21:18,457
I'm sure you had a reason.

271
00:21:18,726 --> 00:21:20,086
The kids...

272
00:21:20,556 --> 00:21:23,766
Se Jun said Dad died because of you.

273
00:21:25,697 --> 00:21:27,637
They kept saying that, so...

274
00:21:29,066 --> 00:21:32,707
No, right? I know it's not true.

275
00:21:35,937 --> 00:21:38,546
Gosh. I see.

276
00:21:43,276 --> 00:21:44,447
Let's go home.

277
00:21:47,417 --> 00:21:48,486
Give me that.

278
00:22:27,226 --> 00:22:28,397
Jeju Island?

279
00:22:36,566 --> 00:22:38,437
An international school on Jeju Island?

280
00:22:38,506 --> 00:22:41,377
They're in a league of their own. And paradise for the kids.

281
00:22:43,076 --> 00:22:45,447
People are hesitant about sending kids to study abroad at a young age,

282
00:22:45,506 --> 00:22:48,117
and a top foreign school built a campus on Jeju Island.

283
00:22:48,177 --> 00:22:50,687
Everyone is dying to send their kids there.

284
00:22:50,746 --> 00:22:53,387
English is a given. They also have golf, horseback riding,

285
00:22:53,447 --> 00:22:55,617
and an orchestra lesson.

286
00:22:56,657 --> 00:23:00,457
To be honest, domestic schools can't compare.

287
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:02,296
Right.

288
00:23:02,357 --> 00:23:05,326
Remember that drama recently called "Sky Castle"?

289
00:23:05,397 --> 00:23:06,526
Yes.

290
00:23:06,597 --> 00:23:07,796
That was...

291
00:23:08,197 --> 00:23:11,137
about the upper-middle class in Daechi-dong.

292
00:23:11,506 --> 00:23:12,867
What do you mean...

293
00:23:12,937 --> 00:23:16,506
People in the upper class don't care so much about going to med school.

294
00:23:16,576 --> 00:23:19,607
Even if you become a doctor, you work for a paycheck.

295
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:22,947
Doctors and lawyers don't make that much money anymore.

296
00:23:24,617 --> 00:23:26,617
What do you do...

297
00:23:26,687 --> 00:23:27,857
I'm a lawyer.

298
00:23:28,957 --> 00:23:29,957
I see.

299
00:23:33,556 --> 00:23:34,726
Anyway,

300
00:23:35,326 --> 00:23:38,967
the kids enjoy going to school and go to good schools afterward.

301
00:23:39,367 --> 00:23:42,036
That is why you came to us, isn't it?

302
00:23:42,097 --> 00:23:43,467
Actually,

303
00:23:43,536 --> 00:23:46,836
we don't have the resources or a reason like that.

304
00:23:47,076 --> 00:23:48,276
Then...

305
00:23:51,006 --> 00:23:53,976
Anyway, is it difficult to get in?

306
00:23:54,076 --> 00:23:57,746
They keep their application process and acceptance rate confidential.

307
00:23:58,117 --> 00:23:59,917
It's not so much the exam...

308
00:23:59,986 --> 00:24:02,187
but the student profile that's tougher to get accepted.

309
00:24:03,887 --> 00:24:07,197
It's a bit late to start preparing now.

310
00:24:07,256 --> 00:24:08,296
Most kids prepare for exams...

311
00:24:08,357 --> 00:24:10,927
for six months after they finish English kindergarten...

312
00:24:10,996 --> 00:24:13,836
with some get Ivy-grad tutors and coordinators.

313
00:24:13,897 --> 00:24:16,066
They get a tutor and a coordinator for the exam?

314
00:24:16,137 --> 00:24:18,607
Since your son is in the junior program,

315
00:24:18,637 --> 00:24:20,336
there isn't a separate exam.

316
00:24:20,407 --> 00:24:21,976
Round one is the written application.

317
00:24:22,036 --> 00:24:24,046
Round two, class participation evaluation.

318
00:24:24,107 --> 00:24:25,607
Finally, round three is...

319
00:24:25,677 --> 00:24:29,046
a one-on-one interview and a parent interview.

320
00:24:29,147 --> 00:24:31,516
This is the toughest to pass.

321
00:24:31,586 --> 00:24:34,786
That's quite a lot.

322
00:24:36,457 --> 00:24:40,397
Do you have any connections with the school or foundation?

323
00:24:41,056 --> 00:24:42,127
No.

324
00:24:43,226 --> 00:24:45,167
Then, with any current students?

325
00:24:45,226 --> 00:24:48,597
No. Is that very important?

326
00:24:49,937 --> 00:24:51,336
Then...

327
00:24:52,766 --> 00:24:54,107
I don't know.

328
00:24:54,407 --> 00:24:56,976
I feel bad saying this,

329
00:24:57,377 --> 00:25:00,476
but this isn't a school that a child can get into...

330
00:25:00,546 --> 00:25:02,576
just because they are smart and get good grades.

331
00:25:10,957 --> 00:25:15,526
(We help build portfolio starting with elementary and middle school.)

332
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:26,150
(At that time, we received an invitation.)

333
00:25:26,849 --> 00:25:29,480
(My child wasn't happy with his school life.)

334
00:25:29,579 --> 00:25:32,519
(I hope to see him go to school with big smiles.)

335
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:36,589
(I don't want him to spend too much time in the academics.)

336
00:25:37,589 --> 00:25:41,500
(I want him to make friends and spend more time with me.)

337
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,029
(I don't think it's too much to ask.)

338
00:25:45,029 --> 00:25:46,799
(So you received an invitation.)

339
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,539
(Do you have any friends or relatives at this school?)

340
00:25:49,539 --> 00:25:51,210
(No, I don't have any.)

341
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:54,279
(- Any siblings enrolled? - No.)

342
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:57,379
(But I see here that your husband is...)

343
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:00,920
(My husband...)

344
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,990
(He passed away last year.)

345
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:11,990
(Then is there any way to find out who sent it?)

346
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:15,029
(Well, usually, we're the ones who send them, but...)

347
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,930
(nothing was sent out from our office recently.)

348
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:19,000
(Really?)

349
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,769
(Then who did it?)

350
00:26:21,769 --> 00:26:24,140
(Maybe, someone else from the school might have sent it.)

351
00:26:25,769 --> 00:26:26,869
(I see.)

352
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,510
(Sorry, Mrs. Song. I wish I could help.)

353
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,980
(It's okay. Thank you.)

354
00:26:35,379 --> 00:26:37,920
We have some time until the kids are done with their interview.

355
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:40,789
Why don't we all go and have a cup of tea?

356
00:26:40,789 --> 00:26:41,859
Sounds good. As a matter of fact,

357
00:26:41,859 --> 00:26:44,160
my restaurant happens to be pretty close from here.

358
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,230
Why don't I invite you there? You can check out my restaurant too.

359
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,260
Sure.

360
00:26:47,859 --> 00:26:50,500
Really? That's good. Let's go.

361
00:27:07,349 --> 00:27:10,279
(Looks fancy.)

362
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:12,250
(How did you find this place?)

363
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,359
(It's like Carmel-by-the-Sea.)

364
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:16,460
This reminds me of a place I went with my husband.

365
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,660
This is a very fancy place. I love the atmosphere here.

366
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,900
We opened this restaurant last month.

367
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,900
I discovered an amazing chef I couldn't afford to lose.

368
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,829
I hope you dine here often.

369
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,640
Gosh. Really?

370
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,410
Do Young, you're so impressive.

371
00:27:31,539 --> 00:27:33,740
You look after your son and have your own career.

372
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,039
Now, you run a restaurant?

373
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,349
Gosh. Please.

374
00:27:37,849 --> 00:27:39,510
I have a long way ahead of me.

375
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:42,480
I just hope Si Woo will follow my lead like a good boy.

376
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,690
But it looks like he prefers to keep me on my toes.

377
00:27:47,589 --> 00:27:49,460
Anyway, it was nice to see you all here.

378
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:51,460
Well done to all of you for making this far.

379
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:55,099
- Well done. Cheers. - Cheers.

380
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,839
By the way, who was that lady? The number 35? She looked...

381
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:05,740
Didn't she look unique?

382
00:28:05,869 --> 00:28:07,640
I don't think she's one of us.

383
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,210
And she's not from abroad either.

384
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:10,379
Don't worry about her.

385
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:12,210
It's just between us here.

386
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:14,450
But you know this isn't just about the kids.

387
00:28:15,619 --> 00:28:19,190
(Okay, then. Shall we share your thoughts on...)

388
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,859
(why you want to come to this school?)

389

(My brother is studying in this school at the moment.)

393
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,710
(And my mom is also the parent representative for this school.)

394
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:42,309
(So of course, I think I should get an education...)

395
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:45,150

(and make it the best in the world,)

402
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:04,730
(isn't it essential to have global education?)

403
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:06,599
(Also, my mom told me...)

404
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:10,670
("Si Woo Kwak. Your life totally depends on this.")

405
00:29:11,339 --> 00:29:12,440
("Okay?")

406
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:15,079
(Thank you.)

407
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:19,010
Just think about the interview. The kids' attitude and capability...

408
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:21,650
will indicate whether or not they will excel in the school.

409
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:23,619
You can't practice that.

410
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:28,519
Are you mute?

411
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:30,190
Why won't you say anything?

412
00:29:31,089 --> 00:29:32,260
That's true.

413
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:34,859
I'll be honest. Everyone keeps talking about Gangnam...

414
00:29:34,859 --> 00:29:36,660
and Daechi-dong.

415
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,269
So sick. I'm so sick of it.

416
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:41,569
To send your kids to medical or law schools these days,

417
00:29:41,569 --> 00:29:42,640
they need to start studying since kindergarten.

418
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,569
And by Grade Three, you'll know if your kids can make it or not.

419
00:29:45,569 --> 00:29:47,879
Oh, my. 12 years.

420
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,579
Do they really think investing that much money for 12 years...

421
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,180
and making the kids work for it is worth it?

422
00:29:52,849 --> 00:29:55,079
Those kids who majored in medicine at Seoul National University...

423
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,819
work at my hospital. And I'm the one cutting them...

424
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:00,049
their paychecks now.

425
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,359
That's what I mean.

426
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,500
By the way, are there any after-school programs here?

427
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,329
(The school is great. But I'm getting nervous.)

428
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,829
Don't you feel the same way? We must do something, right?

429
00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:16,470
(English is their first language. Right?)

430
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,470
Shouldn't we get them some lessons?

431
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:21,640
The first three months are crucial in getting adjusted to school.

432
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:24,279
The new school year starts in September here.

433
00:30:24,349 --> 00:30:27,420
We can form a group and start coordinating a tutor for them now.

434
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,920
That sounds great. Count me in.

435
00:30:30,019 --> 00:30:32,819
The four of us can form a group, right?

436
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,490
Let's wait.

437
00:30:38,029 --> 00:30:40,260
It will depend on our children's level.

438
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,859
Come on.

439
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,240
You should quit smoking.

440
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:51,470
You mean this? This is a vitamin.

441
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,849
By the way, how many students are they accepting this year?

442
00:30:59,379 --> 00:31:00,980
Did you hear anything?

443
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:04,079
What if Jun Hee gets accepted, but Si Woo doesn't?

444
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:07,490
Gosh. That will be so humiliating. What will I do then?

445
00:31:09,789 --> 00:31:12,990
Don't worry. I'm sure Si Woo will make it.

446
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:16,930
They checked the list of siblings and children from abroad.

447
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:18,930
Really? Awesome!

448
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:23,069
Recommendations play a big role at the interview.

449
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:24,740
The yearly tuition is 100,000 dollars.

450
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,609
Not just anyone can just get in.

451
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,410
Seriously. You're the best.

452
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:31,650
You have good intel and networks. Goodness.

453
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,750
You have my respect.

454
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:35,750
I don't like it when you overreact.

455
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,890
Let's go. The interview must be over by now.

456
00:31:43,859 --> 00:31:44,930
Really?

457
00:31:53,069 --> 00:31:54,339
It was nice meeting you today.

458
00:31:54,339 --> 00:31:55,599
Same here.

459
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,200
I hope I get to see you again.

460
00:31:57,369 --> 00:31:58,440
Sure.

461
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,750
Mom, I don't think he's been to the States.

462
00:32:09,049 --> 00:32:11,819
He doesn't even know what Universal Studios is.

463
00:32:12,089 --> 00:32:14,619
You said the rides there were boring.

464
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,660
Oh, that fool?

465
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,160
His pronunciation was awful too.

466
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,730
- So stupid. - Si Woo.

467
00:32:21,829 --> 00:32:23,700
I told you not to use such language.

468
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,470
Really. It's true.

469
00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:27,569
I did much better than him.

470
00:32:28,769 --> 00:32:30,269
Be ambitious.

471
00:32:30,869 --> 00:32:31,940
Okay.

472
00:32:32,269 --> 00:32:34,510
I'm so proud of you.

473
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:41,720
- How was your day today? - It was okay.

474
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,549
What's "okay"?

475
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,589
It was just okay.

476
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:53,730
Yi Chan, even if you don't get accepted to this school,

477
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:55,430
let's not be so disappointed. Okay?

478
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,769
Why? I really want to go here.

479
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,430
You really like this school?

480
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:02,599
Yes. Don't you?

481
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,240
Well, I would like that very much too.

482
00:33:33,529 --> 00:33:34,900
Mom, these are for you.

483
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,440

00:54:51,378 --> 00:54:53,848
nine, ten.

811
00:54:53,918 --> 00:54:55,118
Here I go!

812
00:54:56,748 --> 00:54:58,418
- Okay. I'll see you around. - Bye.

813
00:54:59,688 --> 00:55:02,987
(Excuse me. Do you know where the chairman is?)

814
00:55:03,427 --> 00:55:05,828
(Oh, she was just here.)

815
00:55:06,728 --> 00:55:08,967
(- You want me to get her for you? - Yes, thank you.)

816
00:55:09,027 --> 00:55:10,268
(Okay. Hold on.)

817
00:55:15,668 --> 00:55:17,808
- Ji Sun. - My gosh.

818
00:55:18,107 --> 00:55:20,007
Congratulations.

819
00:55:21,177 --> 00:55:22,447
This is so you.

820
00:55:22,507 --> 00:55:25,078
You got both of your kids to attend this school.

821
00:55:26,078 --> 00:55:28,717
This is nothing. This is just a school for them.

822
00:55:29,288 --> 00:55:32,188
Anyway, thank you for coming all the way here.

823
00:55:32,257 --> 00:55:35,328
I wanted to congratulate my smart niece for getting accepted here.

824
00:55:35,387 --> 00:55:37,628
And I came down here to see if I can transfer Se Jun here.

825
00:55:37,927 --> 00:55:40,828
Please give me a lot of tips.

826
00:55:45,368 --> 00:55:47,168
Goodness. Is that who I think she is?

827
00:55:48,337 --> 00:55:50,107
She's here?

828
00:55:52,878 --> 00:55:54,737
What is it? Who are you talking about?

829
00:55:54,938 --> 00:55:57,407
Ji Sun, I'm talking about her over there.

830
00:56:00,777 --> 00:56:03,887
What about her? Do you know her?

831
00:56:18,297 --> 00:56:21,237
I thought we'd never see each other. But it's a small world.

832
00:56:22,137 --> 00:56:25,107
- Hello. - Should I say you're resourceful?

833
00:56:25,938 --> 00:56:27,208
What's your secret?

834
00:56:27,277 --> 00:56:28,848
How did your son get in here?

835
00:56:29,878 --> 00:56:32,578
Do the moms here know what happened at his last school?

836
00:56:32,648 --> 00:56:35,788
That has nothing to do with you. Mind your own business.

837
00:56:35,918 --> 00:56:37,788
Our children don't go to the same school now.

838
00:56:39,087 --> 00:56:42,157
Do you really think you can get away with this?

839
00:56:42,228 --> 00:56:43,857
Do you think transferring here...

840
00:56:43,927 --> 00:56:46,927
and pretending to be classy would change what he did to my son?

841
00:56:46,998 --> 00:56:49,868
What do you say? Should I tell everyone what he did?

842
00:56:53,268 --> 00:56:57,067
That's enough. You're not the only one holding cards.

843
00:56:57,868 --> 00:56:58,938
What?

844
00:56:59,007 --> 00:57:00,407
Chief Prosecutor Park Moo Taek.

845
00:57:00,478 --> 00:57:02,478
That proud husband of yours.

846
00:57:02,547 --> 00:57:05,277
He's been interrogated by the IA for sexually harassing his junior.

847
00:57:05,918 --> 00:57:08,447
Should I share that with everyone here?

848
00:57:09,648 --> 00:57:10,688
How should we do this?

849
00:57:10,688 --> 00:57:12,788
Do you want to go first? Or should I?

850
00:57:14,118 --> 00:57:17,257
I was the one who decided not to send my son to that school.

851
00:57:17,828 --> 00:57:19,697
If you're trying to put your nose where it doesn't belong...

852
00:57:19,757 --> 00:57:22,268
and ruin this day for me, you'd better think twice.

853
00:57:22,328 --> 00:57:24,427
I won't be so nice like the last time.

854
00:57:27,797 --> 00:57:30,368
You murdered your own husband. How shameless.

855
00:57:35,177 --> 00:57:36,777
- What's this about? - What?

856
00:57:36,848 --> 00:57:39,277
- She killed him? - How?

857
00:57:40,717 --> 00:57:42,918
- Did you hear that? - She murdered her husband?

858
00:57:42,987 --> 00:57:45,717
- Is that true? - Really?

859
00:57:45,788 --> 00:57:48,587
- She killed him? - How did she get in here?

860
00:57:54,498 --> 00:57:55,697
A murderer.

861
00:58:24,157 --> 00:58:27,398
- My gosh. Did she really kill him? - I can't believe this.

862
00:58:27,458 --> 00:58:29,268
Unbelievable.

863
00:59:02,027 --> 00:59:03,368
You heard about that case, right?

864
00:59:03,427 --> 00:59:05,768
The missing person case where the victim died last year.

865
00:59:06,067 --> 00:59:08,697
The husband was a famous private equity investor.

866
00:59:08,768 --> 00:59:11,668
He died after scamming people for tens of millions of dollars.

867
00:59:14,938 --> 00:59:17,007
The two of them went out on a yacht.

868
00:59:17,078 --> 00:59:19,677
But her husband went missing, but his body was never found.

869
00:59:20,248 --> 00:59:22,317
The wife was a prime suspect.

870
00:59:22,387 --> 00:59:23,547
But she...

871
01:00:02,688 --> 01:00:04,328
Hide somewhere else. Hurry.

872
01:00:51,842 --> 01:00:53,413
- I told you. - No.

873
01:00:54,052 --> 01:00:57,922
Two, four, six, eight...

874
01:00:58,583 --> 01:01:00,822
- Everyone is here, right? - Yes.

875
01:01:01,252 --> 01:01:03,123
No. Yi Chan isn't here yet.

876
01:01:03,192 --> 01:01:04,592
Hey, let's go!

877
01:01:04,663 --> 01:01:06,263
- Let's go. - Let's go.

878
01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:08,533
Hey. Move. Out of my way!

879
01:01:08,592 --> 01:01:11,502
- Let's go. - I saw him go that way!

880
01:01:11,563 --> 01:01:12,703
Me too!

881
01:01:18,502 --> 01:01:19,712
Mom.

882
01:01:20,172 --> 01:01:24,043
Mom. Let me out.

883
01:01:27,013 --> 01:01:28,583
Mom.

884
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:31,322
I'm right here.

885
01:01:31,953 --> 01:01:33,652
Mom.

886
01:01:40,632 --> 01:01:41,692
Yi Chan.

887
01:01:45,362 --> 01:01:46,433
Yi Chan.

888
01:02:01,752 --> 01:02:02,953
Yi Chan.

889
01:02:06,893 --> 01:02:07,993
Yi Chan.

890
01:02:08,893 --> 01:02:10,092
An Yi Chan.

891
01:02:14,933 --> 01:02:16,063
Yi Chan.

892
01:02:19,772 --> 01:02:20,873
Yi Chan.

893
01:02:29,243 --> 01:02:30,583
An Yi Chan.

894
01:02:31,083 --> 01:02:33,712
An Yi Chan. Where are you?

895
01:02:36,083 --> 01:02:37,152
Yi Chan.

896
01:02:43,893 --> 01:02:46,092
Did you see my son, Yi Chan?

897
01:02:46,462 --> 01:02:49,533
What in the world? He's a boy. Why are you looking for him here?

898
01:02:51,632 --> 01:02:54,373
Yi Chan.

899
01:02:55,502 --> 01:02:56,572
Yi Chan.

900
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:03,212
Yi Chan.

901
01:03:08,353 --> 01:03:09,482
Yi Chan.

902
01:03:13,522 --> 01:03:14,552
Yi Chan.

903
01:03:15,223 --> 01:03:16,293
Yi Chan.

904
01:03:17,893 --> 01:03:18,993
Yi Chan!

905
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:21,933
An Yi Chan!

906
01:03:23,663 --> 01:03:25,563
Yi Chan...

907
01:03:28,203 --> 01:03:29,342
Yi Chan.

908
01:03:30,342 --> 01:03:31,473
An Yi Chan.

909
01:03:32,643 --> 01:03:33,712
Where are you?

910
01:03:39,283 --> 01:03:40,413
Mom!

911
01:03:45,123 --> 01:03:46,293
Yi Chan!

912
01:03:47,092 --> 01:03:49,293
- Yi Chan. Where are you? - Mom.

913
01:03:49,563 --> 01:03:50,692
An Yi Chan!

914
01:03:51,362 --> 01:03:52,993
- Mom. - Yi Chan.

915
01:03:54,493 --> 01:03:55,563
Yi Chan.

916
01:03:55,563 --> 01:03:57,902
Mom, I'm in here.

917
01:03:58,163 --> 01:03:59,732
Yi Chan.

918
01:03:59,873 --> 01:04:01,933
Yi Chan, Mom is here. Hang in there.

919
01:04:02,033 --> 01:04:04,203
I'll get you out.

920
01:04:04,502 --> 01:04:06,112
Mom.

921
01:04:07,212 --> 01:04:08,743
Let me out.

922
01:04:14,982 --> 01:04:16,623
Hang in there.

923
01:04:17,022 --> 01:04:18,083
Cover your ears.

924
01:04:19,022 --> 01:04:20,152
I'll get you out.

925
01:04:23,592 --> 01:04:24,723
Hang in there, Yi Chan.

926
01:04:29,833 --> 01:04:30,962
I'm almost there.

927
01:04:33,572 --> 01:04:35,033
- Mom. - My gosh.

928
01:04:35,942 --> 01:04:36,973
Yi Chan.

929
01:04:37,873 --> 01:04:39,513
No, baby.

930
01:04:39,973 --> 01:04:42,712
Yi Chan. Wake up.

931
01:04:43,313 --> 01:04:44,543
Breathe like me.

932
01:04:47,382 --> 01:04:48,513
Do this.

933
01:04:51,223 --> 01:04:52,953
That's it. Well done.

934
01:04:52,953 --> 01:04:54,152
Keep doing that.

935
01:04:57,793 --> 01:04:59,192
Mom.

936
01:05:00,362 --> 01:05:02,092
What happened?

937
01:05:03,563 --> 01:05:05,033
Why were you in there?

938
01:05:05,033 --> 01:05:06,103
How did you get inside?

939
01:05:06,103 --> 01:05:08,603
I tried to get out,

940
01:05:08,902 --> 01:05:10,873
but the door was locked.

941
01:05:11,703 --> 01:05:13,913
Where were you?

942
01:05:13,913 --> 01:05:16,143
I was so scared.

943
01:05:18,612 --> 01:05:21,052
I'm sorry. Mom is sorry.

944
01:05:21,552 --> 01:05:22,882
I'm so sorry.

945
01:05:24,152 --> 01:05:27,692
I was afraid something would happen...

946
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:37,533
Look. I'll make sure that you'll never be scared ever again.

947
01:05:37,763 --> 01:05:40,302
Mom will keep you safe.

948
01:05:40,933 --> 01:05:43,873
Okay. Promise.

949
01:05:47,212 --> 01:05:48,243
I promise.

950
01:05:50,783 --> 01:05:51,913
Were you scared?

951
01:05:53,052 --> 01:05:55,183
It's okay now.

952
01:05:55,652 --> 01:05:56,723
Let's go home.

953
01:06:47,841 --> 01:06:50,711
(High Class)

954
01:06:50,982 --> 01:06:54,352
Do you remember seeing anyone before you went into the locker?

955
01:06:54,482 --> 01:06:55,551
No.

956
01:06:55,551 --> 01:06:56,651
To the others...

957
01:06:56,722 --> 01:06:57,982
Between ourselves.

958
01:06:57,982 --> 01:06:59,291
My Yi Chan?

959
01:06:59,291 --> 01:07:01,121
- Pay for it! - It wasn't me.

960
01:07:01,192 --> 01:07:03,062
He has a record for bullying.

961
01:07:03,222 --> 01:07:04,692
Don't mind them.

962
01:07:04,761 --> 01:07:06,492
It's not like we'll hang out with them.

963
01:07:06,562 --> 01:07:08,892
- We meet again. - Who is that guy?

964
01:07:09,161 --> 01:07:10,461
Shall we be friends too?

965
01:07:10,732 --> 01:07:12,932
I came here thinking things would get better.

966
01:07:12,932 --> 01:07:15,032
I came here to focus on Yi Chan.

967
01:07:15,602 --> 01:07:17,671
I guess I thought too lightly of it.
