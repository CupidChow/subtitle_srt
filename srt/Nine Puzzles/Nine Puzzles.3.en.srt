00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:57,284
Nine Puzzles

2
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,998
Hangang Police involved in murder,
allegedly received…

3
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,458
…suspicions of sexual bribery…

4
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,876
Owner close to high-ranking…

5
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:20,891
Hello, guys!

6
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,352
I've been assigned
to the Miyoung Lee case as of today.

7
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,937
My name is Lieutenant Ena Yoon.
Nice to meet ya.

8
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,190
Where should I put my stuff?

9
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,531
Hey, Captain, what's going on?

10
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,408
The Chief ordered it.

11
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,456
Captain Jungho Yang.

12
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,125
Great. It's nice to meet ya.

13
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:11,233
Former chief of Hangang Police Station
found stabbed at home

14
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,026
Crime and Punishment

15
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,925
Now where did I put it?

16
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,303
Hmm?

17
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,181
Got something to say?

18
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,559
You know I do.

19
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,394
Follow me out.

20
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,368
What's your reason for being here?

21
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,328
Hmm?

22
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,081
You scared we're gonna find you out?

23
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,834
You're so confident, right?

24
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,336
You've never once doubted yourself,
have ya?

25
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,214
Maybe you should start.

26
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:18,133
That could help you find the answer.

27
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,135
You're here just to talk bullshit?

28
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,012
Hardly.

29
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,641
Why do you think I transferred here?

30
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,604
Here's what I think.

31
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,814
Hogeun, Dongsu, and Miyoung

32
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:35,275
are part of a puzzle
that includes my uncle.

33
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,569
Their deaths are all connected.

34
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,446
You forgot about yourself!

35
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:41,656
I finally remembered.

36
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,741
What?

37
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,035
What did you remember?

38
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:48,622
10 years ago, in that living room,
I was right there with the killer.

39
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,124
Stupid, right?

40
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,794
I was so scared that it might've been me
that murdered him,

41
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,045
but it wasn't me at all!

42
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,380
It took you 10 years to remember that,

43
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,549
or have you just been stringing us along?

44
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:03,094
Or maybe you're feeling a little cornered
'cause of all of this.

45
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,723
Jeez, you're such a nag.

46
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:07,974
A nag?

47
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,726
A nag?

48
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:14,648
You report to me, so you need to watch
your mouth and speak respectfully.

49
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,484
- I don't wanna.
- What do you mean?

50
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,237
I'm much older
and more experienced than you.

51
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,198
God, you're such a boomer.

52
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:44,094
Superintendent Hogeun Hyeun

53
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,889
You wanna know the reason?

54
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:49,349
Yeah.

55
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,101
Have you read the paper?

56
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,396
"What is happening with the police?"

57
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,231
"Bar owner allegedly
provided sexual bribes…"

58
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,691
This is just an ordinary case.

59
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,192
Why would a profiler take on a--

60
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:02,279
If it's so ordinary,
why haven't we caught the killer yet?

61
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,824
Headquarters wants this case
wrapped up as soon as possible.

62
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,659
She's here as your support.

63
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:09,536
Is that clear?

64
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,831
If you have time to barge in here…

65
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,960
at least barge in with a solid lead.

66
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,671
You gotta admit
the timing of her assignment to my unit

67
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,172
is a bit weird.

68
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,425
Especially because she's so close to you.

69
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,762
You stupid little fuck.

70
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:43,361
So, tell me something,
if you're profiling him, is he aware?

71
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,156
Well, he'll know soon.

72
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,824
He is a detective after all.

73
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:51,411
Uh… But why is he working
as your partner then?

74
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:56,249
Firstly, he's very tenacious.

75
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,334
Obsessive.

76
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:01,129
Once he sets his mind on something,
he just can't let it go.

77
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:04,466
When his lid comes off…
he totally changes. Like that!

78
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,550
His "lid"?

79
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,471
Oh. You mean his hat.

80
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,058
So, does this make sense to you?

81
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,477
It's been 10 years.
How'd I suddenly remember it?

82
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,978
Do I even have PTSD?

83
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,649
You finally remember what happened.

84
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,317
Shouldn't you be relieved?

85
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,485
Also…

86
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:25,945
Hmm…

87
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,323
My diagnosis has never been wrong.

88
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,576
Then why haven't I remembered until now?

89
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:34,996
Hmm.

90
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,247
Because of guilt?

91
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,124
Why would…

92
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,753
Perhaps because you couldn't look back.

93
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,139
Because I couldn't look back, huh?

94
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,353
What do you think would've happened

95
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,188
if I had looked back?

96
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,316
Would they have killed me as well?

97
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,487
That probably would've been the case.

98
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,365
But I guess…

99
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,910
I'm glad you'll be able
to sleep more soundly.

100
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,205
I think you're just glad
because I won't call you anymore.

101
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,874
Of course, there's that.

102
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,298
Dr. Lee.

103
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,467
You do believe me, right?

104
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,679
You said you remembered, and so I do.

105
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:38,893
Honestly, I don't think
I can trust my memories… 100%.

106
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:39,978
Ciao.

107
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,242
She asked us to share case info today.

108
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,411
Where'd she go
instead of looking at the files?

109
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,122
Oh, you know,
she probably just went to lunch.

110
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,459
The case isn't exceptional,
but she volunteered to help us out.

111
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,960
She'll do her part.

112
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,254
Then it's business as usual.

113
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,548
We'll continue to share information
on the case.

114
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:09,758
I can't…

115
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:11,843
Do we really have to?

116
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,512
- It's your job.
- Ah, come on.

117
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,222
Just do enough to humor her a little.

118
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,308
It's not a big deal.
Don't be so sensitive.

119
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,185
We'll catch the killer anyway.

120
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:22,771
That's enough of that.

121
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,649
What don't we have the answer to yet?

122
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,360
Why'd the killer
only take the resident card?

123
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,571
Let's focus our energy on that.

124
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,282
I'll request a second forensics analysis.

125
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:37,827
Youngha and Ro, I want you to go
to the house and stake it out.

126
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,413
There must be something
the killer had to take from there.

127
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:43,416
Lieutenant San, learn more
about the string the killer used.

128
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,959
Any questions?

129
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,003
Well, it's not exactly a question.

130
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,755
When I was gathering dash footage,

131
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:52,425
there was this older guy there,
and I overheard him saying that…

132
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,886
he always used to park
where the victim was killed.

133
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,055
Then one day, whenever he parked there,

134
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:00,517
he'd find screws slammed into his tires
and scratches on his car.

135
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,977
And at first, he didn't think much of it.

136
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:06,439
But the car only got messed up
when he parked in that one spot.

137
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,817
It's a CCTV blind spot.

138
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,152
He said he had to park
somewhere else ever since.

139
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,238
He sounded pretty angry.

140
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,073
Yeah, that's weird.

141
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,368
Coincidence?

142
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,079
No.

143
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,250
The killer planned this for a while.

144
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,753
Captain, I'll go check
through the CCTV footage

145
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,255
of the apartment's parking lot.

146
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,132
- We might get lucky.
- Okay.

147
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:40,700
Detective is a job where you save
both the assailant and the victim

148
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:53,922
What are you doing in my seat?

149
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,675
Lieutenant Kim… is a Type T.

150
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,427
What are you talking about?

151
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,637
Personality type?

152
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,680
He's a Type T, right? Has to be.

153
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:05,475
He's got no empathy
and never confides in anyone.

154
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,769
Well, I wouldn't say that, exactly.

155
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,312
He's pretty nice to me.

156
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,397
I think he's got an F side.

157
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,316
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

158
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,194
Do you know that I've been following him
for the last decade?

159
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,987
Why you been following the guy?

160
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,907
When my uncle was killed,
did Kim look into where he'd gone?

161
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,951
- Yeah.
- I knew it!

162
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,035
Thanks a lot.

163
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,874
What the hell was that about?

164
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,086
She's the Type T.

165
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,505
Stop.

166
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,299
Can you zoom in on this part?

167
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,526
Can you make the screen brighter?

168
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,492
Now play it again, frame by frame,
from here, okay?

169
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:08,955
Good.

170
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:44,282
<i>Of the places that Miyoung went,</i>
<i>this is the only one without cameras.</i>

171
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:48,244
<i>This is where the killer got into the car.</i>

172
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,872
<i>But why did they wait?</i>

173
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,416
<i>Why not kill her right then?</i>

174
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,511
Whoa!

175
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,680
You figured out
the killer got in the car first,

176
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,015
then killed her here.

177
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,184
I bet the killer's a perfectionist.

178
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,977
Almost compulsive, like you are.

179
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:16,105
The killer had already decided
on the location of the crime.

180
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,815
Right here in this parking spot.

181
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,444
I've been thinking about where the killer
would've had to have hidden,

182
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,363
in order to threaten Miyoung Lee
and bring her back here.

183
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:27,283
A controllable space,
with short travel distance.

184
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,576
Where would that have been?

185
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,662
I'm not really sure.

186
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:33,873
In the car.

187
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,666
So, the two of them could be alone.

188
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,419
I figure, they got in the car
in a place that had no cameras,

189
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,088
like at the whiskey bar.

190
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,215
<i>The killer must've waited there patiently</i>

191
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,050
<i>until Miyoung got into her car.</i>

192
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,968
<i>Staying silent,</i>

193
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,804
<i>maintaining complete composure.</i>

194
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,055
<i>One minute.</i>

195
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,223
<i>Five minutes.</i>

196
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,557
<i>10 minutes.</i>

197
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,434
<i>Finally, Miyoung got in the car.</i>

198
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,061
<i>Presenting the perfect chance.</i>

199
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,938
<i>All they had to do was kill her.</i>

200
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,649
But… the killer paused again.

201
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,609
They waited until they got here.

202
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,694
35 minutes.

203
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:14,247
<i>There must be a reason</i>
<i>why she wasn't killed until they got here.</i>

204
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,916
<i>The woman on the puzzle piece</i>
<i>is whispering.</i>

205
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,377
<i>Did the killer speak to her?</i>

206
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,589
<i>If so, what did the killer say to Miyoung</i>
<i>as they traveled for 35 minutes?</i>

207
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:27,343
<i>And what did Miyoung say</i>
<i>in response to the killer?</i>

208
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,262
<i>Was the answer important?</i>

209
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,973
Or… was this location important?

210
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,976
Well, which one is it?

211
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:37,645
Hmm.

212
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,981
That's something
we'll have to ask the killer.

213
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,692
What's that?

214
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:45,611
Last time, I didn't get a proper hello.

215
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:46,946
Let's stop by for a meal.

216
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,913
What are you talking about, huh?

217
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,458
<i>Who is it?</i>

218
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,544
Hello, good evening. Do you remember me?

219
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,755
Would you mind if I came up for a meal?
I'm actually here with your son.

220
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,299
- Hey.
- <i>Oh. Okay.</i>

221
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,633
Don't open the door, Mom.

222
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,935
I've been wondering about you.

223
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,437
Happy to see you.

224
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,524
I'm sorry, but I gotta say…
the food is quite bland.

225
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:27,111
I think it needs more seasoning.

226
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:29,322
That's why I've been taking
cooking lessons.

227
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,531
- I'm sorry.
- Mm-hmm.

228
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:33,701
Actually, that's why he always orders out
when he's here.

229
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,162
Is that why you don't eat?

230
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,917
You said I didn't have to worry about her.

231
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,294
Didn't expect you to come here for a meal.

232
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,922
She's just trying to profile me
right now, is all.

233
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,216
Hmm!

234
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:49,592
You noticed that.

235
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:53,012
So, um… has he ever brought
one of his girlfriends home to meet you?

236
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,639
You don't have to answer that.

237
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,434
Hmm… Well, that's a very private question.

238
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,977
Does the profiler need to know?

239
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,273
Yeah.

240
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,817
I'm kind of interested in Lieutenant Kim,
you see…

241
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:09,487
Huh.

242
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,156
I've followed him around for a decade.

243
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,449
Have you really?

244
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:15,952
Oh.

245
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,995
Then I gotta make it a good answer.

246
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:22,124
Uh, he's been on dates with a few women,
but he never brought anyone home before.

247
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,335
Ah. What about friends?

248
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,879
Has he ever brought any friends home?
Am I the first one?

249
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,006
He brought a friend over for dinner once.

250
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,175
- Mm.
- Ena, you're the second.

251
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,427
Who was the friend?

252
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,889
Mom, Mom.
Could you please not answer that?

253
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,684
It was in his first year of high school.

254
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,104
One day,
he suddenly brought a friend home.

255
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,231
And, uh, I found it a little bit weird

256
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,483
because it was someone
I had never heard of.

257
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:50,570
I remember, during dinner,
that boy said one thing.

258
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:52,905
"It really does."

259
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,699
Ah, Mom, I'm leaving now.

260
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:55,950
Come on, Ena. We're going.

261
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,202
- Why did he say that?
- Hansaem had said,

262
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:01,497
"Mom's curry tastes
just like black bean sauce.

263
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,416
But she just won't believe me.

264
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,751
So you have to try
and tell her it's true."

265
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,046
That's why he brought his friend home.

266
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,175
That kid still comes by
every now and then.

267
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,053
Once Hansaem takes your hand,
he'll never let you go.

268
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:21,350
Thank you for the meal.

269
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,769
Ah! Goodness, you didn't finish your food.

270
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:27,690
You just said random things, right?

271
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,609
Why'd you do that? Why'd you say her curry

272
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:32,111
was like black bean sauce?
That's not your style.

273
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,495
You wanted to protect your friend.

274
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:46,083
I guess that's the reason you said
all of that out-of-character nonsense.

275
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,543
To keep your friend nearby.

276
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:55,217
That kid was unwell.

277
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:59,055
In many ways.

278
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,061
Hey, Curry Kim.

279
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,734
I really hope you'll take my hand too.

280
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,700
The puzzle piece came to me
after 10 years,

281
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:23,871
and I finally remembered that the killer
was lurking behind me there in the den.

282
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:27,208
I asked you before,
why did I get the first piece of it?

283
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,877
Why was the puzzle piece sent to me?

284
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:33,172
Haven't you figured that out yet?

285
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,260
I'm known to the killer.

286
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,306
That was why I profiled you.

287
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,850
I'm not the killer,
that much I know for sure.

288
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:47,228
And I know I'm someone the killer knows.

289
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:50,564
So I needed someone I could trust.

290
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,401
It's your turn now.

291
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,736
You can profile me.

292
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,363
Keep your eyes on me…

293
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,490
until you're convinced.

294
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:13,629
<i>It's your turn now.</i>

295
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:15,965
<i>You can profile me.</i>

296
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,675
<i>Keep your eyes on me…</i>

297
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,593
<i>until you're convinced.</i>

298
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:23,764
The One City building A

299
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:27,601
Level 2, parking lot

300
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,733
Miyoung Lee, age 43
A rope that can strangle her

301
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:37,778
<i>The least amount of time,</i>
<i>the least amount of force.</i>

302
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:41,949
<i>Obviously, the killer knew</i>
<i>Miyoung Lee's life inside and out.</i>

303
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,160
"Presumed suspect"

304
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,875
<i>Why did he target her?</i>

305
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:52,585
<i>And also…</i>

306
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,545
<i>why my uncle?</i>

307
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:02,344
Miyoung Lee incident profiling report

308
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:16,776
Ena Yoon: Aren't you going to
keep an eye on me and observe?

309
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:21,489
Personnel file, Ena Yoon.pdf

310
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:37,963
Man… How the hell
did you even find this?

311
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:39,799
It's just incredible, huh?

312
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:42,718
We should give him
a new nickname. "The CCTV Master."

313
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,929
I couldn't've found this,
not in a million years.

314
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,555
What about forensics?

315
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:47,723
They find anything?

316
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,433
They found a fingerprint.

317
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:51,435
Just a partial one though.

318
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,395
That's big news. Where was it found?

319
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,689
Victim's car. Driver's headrest.

320
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,983
Guess we missed it the first time 'round.

321
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,110
It needs analysis.
I've sent it out to the lab.

322
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:02,780
Oh, that's great, Captain.
The case just got easier.

323
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,782
What about her home?
You guys find anything?

324
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,659
Nothing of consequence.

325
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,911
If we didn't find anything at her house,

326
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,413
then the resident card
had nothing to do with it.

327
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:15,709
- So, why'd the killer take it then?
- Yeah.

328
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:18,337
And why did the killer
bring her to The One City

329
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,966
instead of just doing it right away
as soon as she got into the car?

330
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:26,595
Well, I guess…

331
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:29,723
that's the motive for murder.

332
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,858
The Profile Report is all done.

333
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:41,485
Whoa, it's only been a day.
You've got it already?

334
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:51,245
Miyoung Lee incident profiling report

335
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,416
"The crime scene exhibits a high level

336
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,252
of criminal knowledge
and meticulous planning…"

337
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:01,881
"And the killer appears to have
near-perfect self-control."

338
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:05,676
"Similarities have been identified
with the murder of Superintendent Yoon.

339
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,344
Causing these murders to be…"

340
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:09,722
"A premeditated serial killing."

341
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:11,974
Yeah.

342
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:18,772
You've gotta be kidding me.

343
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:21,650
Yeah, tell me about it.

344
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,652
What's all this about serial killing?

345
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:26,530
And, uh, your suspect type is based on…

346
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:27,865
puzzle pieces?

347
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:30,284
We're not playing a kid's game here.

348
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:33,621
So… do these two puzzle pieces
really exist or not?

349
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,590
It doesn't matter if they're real or not.

350
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:47,217
This puzzle piece
wasn't found at the crime scene.

351
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:49,595
No evidence
that this case is related to the other.

352
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,096
Ah, that's what I meant.

353
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,723
But these puzzle pieces are weird.

354
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,975
Why did they end up going to you?

355
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:56,435
Hard to say.

356
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,771
I don't have an answer for that yet.

357
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,357
I do know, that if the puzzle pieces
hadn't come to me,

358
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,193
then I wouldn't have realized
these killings were related.

359
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:08,739
However, when the MO
of seven murders out of ten is the same,

360
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:11,909
is that enough to claim
they were done by the same killer?

361
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:13,869
It is not.

362
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:16,622
But sometimes,
we have to look at a series of traits,

363
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:20,960
a collection of unique characteristics
that, when combined, point to the killer.

364
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:33,722
<i>Both cases occurred</i>
<i>in the victims' personal space</i>

365
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:36,642
<i>during a window of time</i>
<i>when the victims were alone.</i>

366
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:39,812
<i>The victims were selected beforehand.</i>

367
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,982
<i>The killer patiently followed</i>
<i>and observed the targets.</i>

368
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:45,359
<i>Then selected a CCTV blind spot.</i>

369
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,194
<i>After finalizing the plan,</i>

370
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:50,739
<i>the killer calmly waited</i>
<i>for a perfect chance to commit the crime.</i>

371
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:56,036
<i>Then the targets were murdered</i>
<i>in the shortest time with minimal force.</i>

372
00:24:57,246 --> 00:25:01,125
<i>This means that the victims weren't</i>
<i>murdered solely for the killer's pleasure.</i>

373
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,547
All of this… tells me that the killer held

374
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,049
a deeply rooted grudge
against the victims.

375
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,968
What strikes me as odd

376
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:14,013
is that these killings
were carried out logically,

377
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:15,639
like an assassination.

378
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:19,351
These characteristics suggest
a link between the two crimes,

379
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:21,061
revealing a serial killer.

380
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:23,439
The puzzle pieces
were just the cherry on top.

381
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:28,277
So, do you still think
I'm playing a kid's game?

382
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,697
Lieutenant Yoon, I respect your analysis,

383
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,949
but this is unreasonable.

384
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:35,534
Let's consider the puzzle.

385
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,661
The pieces are part of a larger picture.

386
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:39,955
They were made with the same material.

387
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,375
Do you have an opinion, Lieutenant Kim?

388
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:52,134
Do you share the same thoughts
as these other guys here?

389
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:55,971
Well, my opinion doesn't really matter.

390
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:59,016
Your mind's made up it's a serial crime.

391
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,353
Just to be clear…

392
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:06,273
did you sign on to this case
to catch your uncle's killer?

393
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:09,902
Lieutenant Kim,
you don't believe this, do you?

394
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,743
Are you still not convinced?

395
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:26,168
Sir.

396
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:40,182
Did you volunteer to do this?

397
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,893
Well, I don't get to come here
just 'cause I ask to.

398
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:46,355
I wasn't the first of us
to volunteer, but….

399
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:49,149
Anyway… Yeah.

400
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:50,484
So then…

401
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,986
you came to look into your uncle
and Miyoung Lee?

402
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:54,947
Yeah.

403
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:00,369
I understand how you feel.

404
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,163
However,

405
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,541
we're not in America.

406
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:09,002
What kinda lunatic
would send a puzzle piece…

407
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:11,004
after they've killed someone?

408
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:14,049
And not once, but twice? Huh?

409
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:18,470
If you keep doing your job like that,
no one'll like you.

410
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,931
Folks are already complaining about--

411
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:26,186
Hmm.

412
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,064
Then respectfully, leave me alone.

413
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,736
Wait, Ena!

414
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,114
Everyone, forget that report.

415
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,783
Yeah, no problem.
We'll do it our way.

416
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:43,954
I mean, when did we ever listen
to a profiler anyway, right?

417
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:47,457
What kind of a person
do you think Miyoung was?

418
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:51,628
Why don't we forget the killer
for a second and start over

419
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:53,380
by looking into the victim first?

420
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,217
This murder clearly
wasn't accidental or random.

421
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:59,511
There must be a reason,
some kind of reason, right?

422
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,179
Just like Ena said.

423
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:04,558
The killer must've had a reason
to risk getting arrested. A motive.

424
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:05,642
A grudge.

425
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,397
It's hard not to agree with that.

426
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:15,319
We have to find out who Miyoung was
to figure this out.

427
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,497
Oh.

428
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:30,417
I'm sorry for making you wait.
Is this your first visit?

429
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:32,711
Actually, I don't have an appointment.

430
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,463
Can I sneak in a session?

431
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:38,175
Sure. Just fill out your personal
information and this questionnaire.

432
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,259
Okay.

433
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:44,473
Sunshine Mental Health Clinic

434
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,392
Psychiatric assessment questionnaire

435
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:52,272
4. I have recurring involuntary impulses,
thoughts, and/or images

436
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:03,158
True.

437
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,912
I agree with you…
we need to discuss his reaction.

438
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,005
Miyoung Lee, current address,
place of birth, family…

439
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,675
What about her brother in the Philippines?

440
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,009
Is he not back yet?

441
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,761
Well, uh…

442
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:25,180
I informed him of his sister's death,

443
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,849
but it seems
the family cut ties a long time ago.

444
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,267
He didn't mention he'd return.

445
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:31,436
There must be a reason
for their estrangement.

446
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,647
How about her father? Can we reach him?

447
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,315
Well, his cell phone's off,

448
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:37,526
and the phone rings at home
but no one picks up.

449
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,820
Looks like we're gonna
have to go visit him.

450
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:42,864
I'll go.

451
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:44,366
To Tongyeong?

452
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,826
Yes. I'll be back.

453
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,244
Just text me the address.

454
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:50,372
Yeah, there goes Lieutenant Kim,
our department's best detective!

455
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:51,915
Go get them!

456
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,670
So, should I go with him too?

457
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,635
Man, I always draw the short stick.

458
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:07,764
Donghaeng-dong, Tongyeong,
South Gyeongsang Province

459
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:11,685
Don't worry, I'll drive.

460
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:13,979
Take the chance to get some rest.

461
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,605
Sweet!

462
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:18,442
Why do you keep following me?
Get out. Where's Lieutenant San?

463
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,318
I'm more helpful than that guy.

464
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:22,112
You don't even know where I'm going.

465
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:24,573
Aren't you on your way
to meet Miyoung's father?

466
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,575
You didn't listen?

467
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,202
I told you to keep an eye on me, right?
So, why aren't you?

468
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:30,787
Did you read my personnel file?

469
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:35,083
Your specialty
is helping out a friend in need.

470
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,335
Think of me as that curry kid.

471
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,340
Let's go. We're losing time.

472
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,478
No, I want to go camping
more than you do.

473
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:57,981
But we just got a lead on the case,
and I have to work.

474
00:30:58,065 --> 00:30:59,900
It's not like I don't want to go.

475
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:02,569
Why don't you all go
to the campsite first and set up, okay?

476
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,446
- I'll try to resolve the case--
- Hey, San!

477
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,906
- San!
- Hang on.

478
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:06,990
Yes, Hansaem?

479
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:08,575
Go camping, okay?

480
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,285
Hmm.

481
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:11,411
Ciao.

482
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:21,713
Hey, the case just got solved.

483
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:26,259
Tongyeong, South Gyeongsang Province

484
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:30,263
Why are you guys suddenly
looking into the victim?

485
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:34,601
Does Miyoung's father know
that his daughter was killed?

486
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,564
He doesn't know.

487
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:44,027
I'm curious why Miyoung
didn't stay in touch with her father.

488
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:47,364
It looks like she cut ties with him
since middle school.

489
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:50,992
Hmm…

490
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,437
No one has been home for a while.

491
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,826
Excuse me, sir, may I ask you something?

492
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,077
Sure.

493
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:36,079
Does the house above you
belong to Mr. Lee?

494
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:37,372
Yes, it does.

495
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,249
I rang the doorbell but no one answered.

496
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,168
They wouldn't, would they?

497
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:42,419
No one lives there.

498
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,129
Oh, did he move?

499
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,922
Is there a way for me to reach him?

500
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:47,257
Well…

501
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:50,218
His number still works if you wanna call…

502
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,180
but I don't think he'll answer.

503
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:55,515
He's in a nursing home, you see.

504
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,818
I'm not sure if he'll respond,
but you can try.

505
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:08,695
Is his condition that bad?

506
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:10,655
Oh, so you don't know.

507
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:12,991
Mr. Lee suffers from dementia.

508
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,243
That means he'll seem just fine one day,

509
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:18,205
but the next day,
he won't speak a single word to anyone.

510
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,000
This way.

511
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:23,752
Oh.

512
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:26,922
You go on ahead.

513
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,388
Oh, dear, he must be hot.

514
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:37,182
He's wearing that jacket again.

515
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:39,809
Mr. Lee?

516
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:41,895
How are you feeling today?

517
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:45,357
Um, someone came to see you from Seoul.

518
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:50,111
Hello, sir. I came to visit
regarding your daughter, Miyoung.

519
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,576
Sir, may I have a word with you?

520
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,869
Mr. Lee?

521
00:33:58,495 --> 00:33:59,913
Well, bad luck.

522
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:02,415
It looks like he's not gonna talk today.

523
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:10,882
"Ways to communicate
with a dementia patient"

524
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:12,133
Papa?

525
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:25,689
What the hell are you doing?

526
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,196
Papa. I'm here. It's Miyoung.

527
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:36,199
Have you been waiting long?

528
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:41,705
Hey, that won't…

529
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,331
Yes.

530
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:48,586
I wear this jacket you gave me…

531
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:51,798
every single day.

532
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:57,178
Gosh, I'm hungry.

533
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:59,306
- You're hungry? Um…
- Yes.

534
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:01,141
Anything special you'd like to eat?

535
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:03,310
<i> Jjajangmyeon</i>.

536
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,437
- <i>Jjajangmyeon?</i>
- Hmm.

537
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,148
Remember you loved to eat that?

538
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:14,237
You still remember that I used to love
eating <i>jjajangmyeon,</i> that's cute.

539
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:16,573
Uh-huh.

540
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:17,866
- Excuse me.
- Huh?

541
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,492
May I have a word with you outside?

542
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:20,744
- Oh, sure.
- Great.

543
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:31,838
Could you tell me
when did Mr. Lee come here?

544
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:34,674
Oh, honestly,
he hasn't been here too long.

545
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:37,510
Um, I guess, he moved in
about two months ago.

546
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:40,013
- Two months ago?
- Yeah.

547
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:43,475
Well, I'm pretty sure he wouldn't
have been able to check himself in here.

548
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,935
Do you remember if there was anyone
who helped him out?

549
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:47,020
Uh…

550
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,521
Uh, I'll have to go look.

551
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:51,733
I must have kept
the guardian's contact. Um…

552
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,696
This person claimed to be his guardian.

553
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:59,574
He said he was a cousin
who lived in his neighborhood.

554
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,743
- The same neighborhood?
- That's right.

555
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:04,496
- Thank you very much.
- Mm, sure.

556
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:08,583
Have I…

557
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,378
ever told you about Donghoon Yoon?

558
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:15,882
Donghoon Yoon?

559
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,385
Uh… yeah.

560
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:19,678
Do you remember?

561
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:25,475
No, I don't.

562
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:34,192
You…

563
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,654
broke up with that idiot, right?

564
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,868
You did, didn't you?

565
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,708
'Course I did.

566
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,669
You remember all kinds of silly things.

567
00:36:58,883 --> 00:36:59,884
Do you…

568
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,429
remember his name?

569
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:14,441
I…

570
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,446
I don't.

571
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:27,162
Well, then what about him did you hate?

572
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,540
His face.

573
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:31,916
His face?

574
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,752
It gave me a bad feeling…

575
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,466
every time I saw him.

576
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:48,558
It seems to me like she had zero contact
with her family.

577
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,477
Was there a special reason for that?

578
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,187
I guess, uh…

579
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,106
it was in her middle school days.

580
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:57,525
She left home then.

581
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,903
Ever since her mom died,

582
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,113
she couldn't pull herself together,

583
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:04,407
and she ran away.

584
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:08,077
Do you know if Ms. Lee ever visited
her father after she ran away from home?

585
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,872
Seven years later…

586
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,791
she came to visit him once.

587
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,834
It was winter.

588
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:19,464
She got an expensive-looking
padded jacket to give to Doowon.

589
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,508
Why'd she suddenly visit him?

590
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,427
She brought a guy with her.

591
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:26,846
They wanted to get married.
That's what she said.

592
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,932
- A boyfriend?
- Yeah.

593
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:30,975
Uh…

594
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,187
It was clear to me,
Doowon didn't like the guy.

595
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:37,440
He said that Miyoung was gonna
end up dead because of him.

596
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:39,192
Do you remember the guy's name?

597
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,735
Uh…

598
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,320
It's so long ago.

599
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,030
I'm not so sure.

600
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,117
By any chance,
was that man a police officer?

601
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:50,411
He wasn't with the police.

602
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:53,248
He said he graduated
from some fancy high school

603
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,958
and had his own business.

604
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:57,961
Oh, but wait.

605
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:00,004
He told me something else as well.

606
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:04,175
Miyoung came back
a completely different person.

607
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:05,969
He didn't like that.

608
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:50,263
Wishing for luck this spring,
may it bring prosperity and joy

609
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:04,652
Jesus!

610
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,989
Are you kidding me?
What… What're you doing here?

611
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:09,949
You surprised me.

612
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:13,620
Let's get the guy.

613
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:14,704
What guy?

614
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:17,123
The man Miyoung brought home with her.

615
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:19,042
How did you know about that?

616
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:33,723
If she did bring him home,
he would've left some kind of trace.

617
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:36,559
Yeah, but that happened 20 years ago.

618
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:39,854
You think there's anything left?

619
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,066
She only brought him here once.

620
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:44,317
Only one time?

621
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,529
Then why did he say
"every time I saw him"?

622
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:50,531
- Huh?
- "Every time I saw him."

623
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:53,785
"Every time I saw him…
Every time I saw him…"

624
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:58,581
That's the reason.

625
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:17,976
Huh?

626
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:26,609
Isn't this a tattoo on his neck?

627
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:29,779
It looks like
the kind of tattoo the yakuza get.

628
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:32,448
Lots of people get those tattoos
these days.

629
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:33,866
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

630
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:37,453
Anyway, all we have is this photo
of a guy without a name.

631
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:38,871
How are we gonna find him?

632
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:41,666
I mean, we don't know anything about him.
He could be Japanese.

633
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,501
Someone had to have seen him.

634
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,878
- Search the vicinity.
- Yes, sir.

635
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:47,296
Now. Move it!

636
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:07,900
So, what did you talk about
with Miyoung's father today,

637
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:09,360
for him to bring up that guy?

638
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:12,780
Do you think that old man…

639
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,991
will remember today?

640
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:22,665
When do you think he'll find out
that his daughter is dead?

641
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,129
Will finding out now hurt him less?

642
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,799
Or will it hurt less
to find out much later?

643
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,802
It'll hurt the same amount.

644
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:39,807
The time it takes to live through a loss
like that is the same either way.

645
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:44,812
It doesn't matter
if he finds out now or not.

646
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:46,647
His dementia might be a good thing.

647
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:52,487
Curry Kim.

648
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:56,699
Same goes for me too.

649
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,620
How do you think I felt
when my uncle died?

650
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:10,922
Once I'm completely convinced
that you aren't the killer,

651
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:13,174
I'll think about it then.

652
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:18,137
That's good.

653
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:20,389
There's some room for you to consider it.

654
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,227
Anyway, Miyoung's dad asked…

655
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:26,354
why I changed so much.

656
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:29,774
Gee, I wonder why he said that.

657
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:31,567
Maybe he's not that far gone.

658
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,444
Come on. That wasn't it.

659
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:35,655
He told me that after seven years,

660
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:38,866
his daughter returned
as a completely different person.

661
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,829
Yeah, his cousin said the same thing.

662
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:46,415
Miyoung came back
as a completely different person.

663
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:52,713
Why would somebody say that?

664
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:55,776
I ordered you a margarita.

665
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,124
It never occurred to me…

666
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:14,712
that my uncle could be someone different
than who I knew him to be.

667
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:16,797
It's weird to think about.

668
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:22,637
I wonder what kind of person my uncle was.

669
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:28,559
When do we become a different person?

670
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:30,728
Do you think that's a bad thing?

671
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:33,397
Becoming different people
is part of life, isn't it?

672
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:38,361
Hmm.

673
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:41,405
We all become different at some point,

674
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:45,159
just like how you're different now
compared to your 19-year-old self.

675
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:48,829
We all go through certain life events

676
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:51,916
and meet certain people along the way.

677
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,168
What's important…

678
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:57,505
are the choices we make
when we become different.

679
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:01,968
If you want to know more
about that side of your uncle,

680
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:03,469
then maybe you should…

681
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:07,014
consider investigating
the choices he made.

682
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:28,828
<i>Hello?</i>

683
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:32,081
Good morning, this is Lieutenant Kim
from the Hangang Police Station.

684
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:34,750
<i>Oh. Uh, how can I help you, Lieutenant?</i>

685
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:38,212
I texted you a photo. I was wondering
if you'd ever seen the guy in it.

686
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:41,048
Gimme a second.
Let me have a look.

687
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:45,886
Whoa… you called me a lot.

688
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:47,221
Yeah, sorry about that.

689
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:52,184
Imagine that the man in the picture
is about 20 years older than that.

690
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:02,778
<i>Him…</i>

691
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,323
You know this guy?

692
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:06,490
<i>Yeah.</i>

693
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:10,036
I've seen him before.

694
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:15,541
He came to the bar
about a month after we opened.

695
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:19,128
He claimed that he used to know Miyoung
when they were younger.

696
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:21,630
<i>He said that he was happy for her.</i>

697
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:23,049
<i>He wanted to congratulate her.</i>

698
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:27,803
He ordered the most expensive
bottle of whiskey we had.

699
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:29,555
Then, like a month ago,

700
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:32,433
he came back into the bar again.

701
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,060
It had been a long time.

702
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:39,065
<i>But… he seemed completely different.</i>

703
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:43,027
He asked Miyoung to lend him some money.

704
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,738
He said she opened this bar
with the money he gave her,

705
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:48,908
and the apartment was supposed
to be his too, he made a huge scene.

706
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,869
<i>I couldn't deal with him anymore,</i>
<i>I wanted to call the cops,</i>

707
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,746
<i>but Miyoung stopped me.</i>

708
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:56,791
She said he'd lose his shit
if we provoked him.

709
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,336
Do you remember his name?

710
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,504
Yeah.

711
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:06,675
When Miyoung wasn't looking,
he gave me his business card.

712
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,845
Told me to come by for dinner.

713
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:12,640
Here.

714
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,517
You said you were coming, so I dug it up.

715
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,601
"CEO Chimok Kang"

716
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:20,606
Yes, Captain?

717
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:23,567
We got a match on that partial print.
It belongs to Chimok Kang.

718
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:25,569
He's in Seoul. 127 Hannam-dong.

719
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:30,324
We're on our way to his restaurant.

720
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:31,867
Youngha and Ro are at his house.

721
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:41,252
Can I help you?

722
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:43,379
Police.

723
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:50,636
Oh, may I help you, gentlemen?

724
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:52,430
- We need to check something.
- Sir, wait!

725
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:54,432
Police business.
Please cooperate.

726
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:56,934
Is Mr. Chimok Kang here?

727
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,310
Oh, Mr. Kang?

728
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:00,646
He is not here today.

729
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:02,523
I'll confirm that myself.

730
00:49:06,152 --> 00:49:07,987
Maybe he saw us coming and took off.

731
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:09,613
Look around.

732
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,742
Whoa, you're not supposed to open those!

733
00:49:13,826 --> 00:49:15,453
- What are you doing?
- Don't touch me!

734
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:17,163
- Stop opening those!
- Get off me!

735
00:49:17,246 --> 00:49:19,498
You aren't allowed to do this
in a private business.

736
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:21,375
If you keep touching me,

737
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:23,586
I'll arrest you
for obstructing an officer.

738
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,004
Please cooperate.

739
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:29,049
Hello, Captain. He's not here either.

740
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:30,718
He didn't come home last night.

741
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,304
Yes, sir. Yeah.

742
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:35,681
Oh, I see.

743
00:49:37,725 --> 00:49:38,809
I understand.

744
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:41,228
I'm sorry.

745
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:43,189
Uh, this is a little embarrassing,

746
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:45,441
but could I come inside
and use your bathroom?

747
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:34,406
