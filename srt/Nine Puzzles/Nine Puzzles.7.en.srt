1
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:38,080
<i>The One City unit 5802.</i>

2
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:41,959
<i>The only link the three murder victims</i>
<i>had in common.</i>

3
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,431
<i>The last owner of the apartment</i>
<i>was Miyoung Lee.</i>

4
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:10,571
<i>The previous owner was Chimok Kang.</i>

5
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:38,974
<i>And the first owner of the apartment</i>
<i>was Yoonsu Do.</i>

6
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,320
<i>He was allotted 13 units</i>

7
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:54,281
<i>during the preliminary distribution</i>
<i>for The One City.</i>

8
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:57,367
<i>Unit 5802 was one of those units.</i>

9
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,830
<i>Currently, the remaining 12 units</i>
<i>are owned by his family.</i>

10
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,543
<i>So why did he hand this unit over</i>
<i>to Chimok Kang?</i>

11
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:11,465
<i>And also, where in the world</i>
<i>did all of this begin?</i>

12
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:38,718
Nine Puzzles

13
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:42,264
Chimok Kang and Miyoung Lee
were engaged to each other,

14
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,974
so that kinda makes sense.

15
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:48,395
There has to be a reason
why Yoonsu handed the unit over to Chimok.

16
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,231
Is there a secret connection there?

17
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:55,944
Unit 5802 was never involved
in any type of lawsuits or accidents,

18
00:03:56,027 --> 00:04:00,115
but what's strange to me is how quickly
its ownership kept changing hands.

19
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,325
Yoonsu Do was the first owner.

20
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,619
Then it was transferred to Chimok
two months later.

21
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:06,830
One month after that,
Miyoung Lee took ownership.

22
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,790
Almost as if they had agreed to it.

23
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:11,293
What would make them
trade an apartment like that?

24
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,338
You said that Donghoon Yoon,
Miyoung Lee and Chimok Kang

25
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:18,425
could have been the culprits,
not the victims, is that right?

26
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,594
What if the four of them,
including Yoonsu Do,

27
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,053
committed a crime together,

28
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:24,723
and then in exchange,
they were given the apartment?

29
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,601
So then the apartment was used
like some kind of payment.

30
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,400
And why is it that…

31
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,278
my uncle wasn't included in that?

32
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,114
Why aren't they connected to my uncle?

33
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,951
There's gotta be a reason
my uncle was the first to die.

34
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,455
The Hangang Police Station is the link.

35
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,833
The One City is under its jurisdiction,

36
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:54,795
and Donghoon Yoon
was the superintendent there for a year.

37
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,006
Did Superintendent Yoon sweep a case

38
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:01,009
that was somehow related to The One City
under the rug?

39
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:04,262
Was there a crime he helped to hide?

40
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,896
If he did sweep a case under the rug,

41
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:16,441
he would've received something
a lot bigger, wouldn't he?

42
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,572
What do you suppose he got in exchange?

43
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,912
A crime committed by four individuals…

44
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,290
Yoonsu Do

45
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:36,002
was a clown who stepped all over
the sandcastle the children made.

46
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,047
Chimok Kang wore an armband and danced.

47
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,468
And Miyoung Lee whispered to someone.

48
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,388
And Superintendent Yoon

49
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,473
shot a doll shaped like a person.

50
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,981
These puzzle pieces could represent

51
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,066
some kind of wrongdoing, I guess?

52
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,325
You know what I think?

53
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,997
God, my head is killing me.

54
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,207
I need a cup of coffee. You want a coffee?

55
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,794
Sounds good. I'll have a warm latte
with oat milk and a double shot.

56
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,963
I said I have a headache.
Are you kidding me?

57
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,673
I'll order it.

58
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,258
There's a good coffee shop nearby.

59
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,343
Let's stretch our legs
and get some fresh air.

60
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:28,388
I could use a walk.

61
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,858
- Welcome.
- Hello.

62
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,819
One drip coffee, uh…

63
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:46,031
and a latte… a warm latte, and uh…

64
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,534
…oat milk. Thanks a lot.

65
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:52,245
Oh, with two shots in it. Yeah.

66
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:53,455
Okay.

67
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,624
That'll be one hot drip coffee

68
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,876
and one warm double-shot oat milk latte.

69
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,544
Will that be all?

70
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:00,629
That's it, yeah.

71
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,171
Why did ya turn off the lights?

72
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,551
Uh, because Your Highness
was snoring so loud.

73
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,431
Hmm… That's weird, I don't snore.

74
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,396
You're supposed
to drape your jacket on me.

75
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,107
That explains why you've been
single for ten years.

76
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,983
Shame. You don't get women.

77
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,945
That's what I get for going out
and grabbing you a coffee?

78
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:11,783
It's like 80 degrees in here right now.
That's hot enough to make you sweat!

79
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,118
Oh…

80
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,577
The coffee is great!

81
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,832
I'm tired.

82
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,583
Do you wanna go out for a walk?

83
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,343
Ugh, it's too sweet.

84
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:33,471
I'm guessing you didn't come here so early
to buy me a cup of coffee.

85
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:35,014
So why are you here?

86
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,808
Superintendent Yoon.

87
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,520
What kind of person was he, as an officer?

88
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,273
Donghoon? Why are you asking?

89
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,818
Well, I just figured, you and he, um…
were quite close, right?

90
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,823
Seeing how he was murdered and everything,
I was just curious.

91
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,370
What are you insinuating?

92
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,999
You're fishing right now, right?

93
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,126
Ah… Wh--

94
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,046
Why are you making it sound
like he did something wrong?

95
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,427
Ena Yoon

96
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,181
You never know with people.

97
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,016
You never know with people?

98
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:22,812
Ah, Hansaem,
you're still an asshole, aren't you?

99
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,273
Yeah, you're just trying
to corner me again.

100
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,150
- Shit.
- When'd I do that?

101
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,777
Oh, so you deny it?

102
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,200
What kinda guy was he?

103
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:39,204
<i>The man was an exceptional police officer.</i>

104
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,997
<i>He was the youngest superintendent.</i>

105
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,999
I guess the higher-ups liked him?

106
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,918
Oh, yeah, that they did.

107
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,797
He was a great investigator
and a good cop.

108
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,757
Then why did he quit the force?

109
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,093
<i>I wouldn't say that he quit.</i>

110
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,346
<i>More like he was cut loose</i>
<i>to appease the public.</i>

111
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,516
The department
was going through a lot then.

112
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:04,771
Hey, you should remember
the Jungbu serial murder case.

113
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,231
They killed every rainy Monday,

114
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,566
<i>pulling a stocking</i>
<i>over the victims' heads.</i>

115
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,819
Hangang Station
was in charge of that case.

116
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,114
We didn't know there was only one culprit

117
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,282
until three female students died.

118
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,910
There were five deaths in the end.

119
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,789
<i>The chaos surrounding that</i>
<i>swept Donghoon away.</i>

120
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,416
<i>What a bad way to go.</i>

121
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,523
Hmm.

122
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:52,735
Today, why don't we talk about that place
where you can sleep?

123
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,279
Is it still a secret?

124
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:57,407
Honestly, it's really
not much of a secret.

125
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,494
It's just… we talked about it once before,
and nothing's really changed since.

126
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,956
I've spent some time thinking about it.

127
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,626
How strange that you could fall asleep
in a place as cluttered as that.

128
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,255
Um… Have you ever heard of hoarding?

129
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,758
A hoarder is generally someone
who is unable to throw anything away.

130
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,386
It is considered a mental disorder.

131
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,099
What kind of person is he?

132
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:29,731
I'd rather… talk about my uncle.

133
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,442
Huh. Hmm.

134
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:35,153
I've been thinking

135
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,989
a lot about him.

136
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,742
He may not have been the person
that I thought I knew.

137
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,454
You can't be a good person to everyone,
after all.

138
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,708
What's making you think that?

139
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,210
Well, the last time we spoke,

140
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,587
you told me to look into
the choices my uncle made.

141
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,798
Hmm, I'm gonna give that a go.

142
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,927
Honestly,

143
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,387
I kept my eyes closed

144
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,307
'cause I was afraid of what…

145
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:05,975
might jump out.

146
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:08,770
I was scared.

147
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,273
At times,

148
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,902
keeping one's eyes open
can be quite difficult.

149
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,613
Is there anything that, um…

150
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,366
makes you want to close your eyes
like I do?

151
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,117
Yes, of course. I'm only human.

152
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,370
What is it?

153
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:29,207
Like you, my personal life is off limits.

154
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,635
Doctor's office 2

155
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,179
Hello.

156
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,181
Yeah, hello.

157
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,475
I'm just visiting.

158
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,727
My friend works here.

159
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:52,855
And this was the only designated
police hospital in the area.

160
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,651
Mmm… Good talk.

161
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,069
Yeah.

162
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,040
You saw Miyoung's Lee car
on the day that she was killed?

163
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,334
Yeah.

164
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,338
I remember because…

165
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,427
The Porsche Panamera's my dream car,

166
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,305
so they stick in my mind
whenever I see one.

167
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:30,184
The weird thing about that night
is the driver floored it at a red light.

168
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,354
She must have seen us
parked on the side though.

169
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,693
It was almost 10:00 at night,
and the road was empty.

170
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,111
so I didn't go after her.

171
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,994
But I keep thinking if I had stopped her…

172
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,833
then maybe I could've prevented
what happened to her.

173
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,880
It's really hard to let it go.

174
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:02,467
She knew that the police car was there,

175
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,177
so what could have made her do that?

176
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,471
Why'd she step on the gas
and run that light?

177
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,307
Yeah.

178
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,808
You're right.

179
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:12,602
She ran the light on purpose.

180
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,604
That's because running that light

181
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,815
was her best attempt at signaling for help
when she saw your patrol car.

182
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:24,906
So do you, uh… remember anything else
about it or see anything

183
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,741
in the back seat or the trunk?

184
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,953
Uh… No, uh…

185
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,165
The windows were heavily tinted.

186
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,042
Hmm…

187
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,795
Too bad. Thanks, anyway.

188
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:50,014
Even if you had stopped the car,

189
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:52,183
nothing would have changed
what happened to her.

190
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,480
It's probably going to take a while
to overcome that guilt,

191
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,441
so let's not beat ourselves up
too much about it.

192
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,077
I'm here.

193
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,455
Hey, why don't you ever
pick up your phone?

194
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:17,041
Oh, look who's talking.
You didn't pick up either.

195
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,710
Yeah, whatever.

196
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,963
I was talking to Dongsu Tae
when you called.

197
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,716
So, uh…

198
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,302
How well did you know your uncle?

199
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:49,824
I always thought that he quit the force
because of me.

200
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:55,454
My uncle was apparently a model officer
and well-respected.

201
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,625
So what kind of case
could he have swept under the rug?

202
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,377
You never know with people.

203
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:07,133
It's possible that he swept
more than one case under the rug.

204
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,848
Think you can do this?

205
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,476
Do you think you can face those cases?

206
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,522
I'm asking Lieutenant Ena Yoon…

207
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,276
the profiler,
if she can analyze these cases.

208
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:30,656
I have to.

209
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,575
I asked, "Can you?"

210
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:41,709
Mm.

211
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,340
Then let's dig.

212
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:52,803
A case with a shooting,
one with deceptive whispers,

213
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:56,307
one that had armband wearing thugs
and a broken sandcastle.

214
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:57,892
That right?

215
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,700
Yeah, what is it?

216
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,535
Everything okay at the station?

217
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:19,205
Why do you suddenly want to know?

218
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:22,917
You should remember
that I rank higher than you, you dick.

219
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,086
Look, Hansaem stopped by.

220
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,798
He was asking about Donghoon.

221
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,509
<i> Not the first time</i>
<i>that punk did that. Who cares?</i>

222
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,511
So, what's bothering you?

223
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:37,557
You know that report you showed me?
The profile that Ena made?

224
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,103
I was wondering…

225
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,939
what's the real reason you think
that Donghoon died?

226
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,196
I got one.

227
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,073
"Myungsung Daily defamation case"

228
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,157
"No prosecution
"

229
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,159
The victim's family
took the <i>Myungsung Daily</i>

230
00:17:57,243 --> 00:18:00,496
and the journalist who wrote the article
to court for defamation, and look…

231
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,999
The case was thrown out
after three months.

232
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,171
The plaintiff was the younger sibling
of the last victim

233
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,965
in the Jungbu serial murder case.

234
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:15,386
Coincidentally, this case was why
Superintendent Donghoon Yoon

235
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,721
suddenly quit the force.

236
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:22,518
This defamation suit must have been
the last case he helped cover up.

237
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,687
We should dig into this one first.

238
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,522
If our theory is correct, then a victim

239
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,567
whose life was ruined by the case
Superintendent Yoon made disappear

240
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,278
is the one going around
killing people right now.

241
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,655
They're the victim and also the murderer.

242
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,742
- Let's go.
- Hey, hold on.

243
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,662
I've got something to tell you.

244
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,751
A handkerchief?

245
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:50,921
I heard it was an old, plain-looking
handkerchief that old men tend to use.

246
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:55,009
San Choi, who arrived on the scene first,
saw it and then it disappeared.

247
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,429
It's not in any of the photos
of the scene.

248
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:01,140
Me, San and the captain
are the only ones who know.

249
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,018
So the killer…

250
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,854
or an accomplice might be among us.

251
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,650
Why are you telling me this now?

252
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:12,735
Well, that's 'cause you--

253
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,236
Do you trust those guys?

254
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,449
- Huh?
- Do you trust San Choi?

255
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,119
Yeah, I mean…

256
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:24,580
- And the captain?
- As far as I'm concerned,

257
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:28,000
no one in Hangang Police Station
is above suspicion, not even me.

258
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,211
But it's not Jungho Yang.

259
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,631
Do you think you can do it?

260
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,049
Do what?

261
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:38,511
Just tell me,
are you able to look into these guys?

262
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,180
I'm asking whether
you can properly analyze them

263
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,973
as Lieutenant Hansaem Kim?

264
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,143
Think I need a new career?

265
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:47,812
You still don't know me.

266
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,981
Whoa, what? You gonna blow your lid?

267
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:53,859
And just remember,
don't take that lid off in front of me.

268
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,486
Stop screwing around.

269
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,419
Introduction to Law
Criminal Procedure

270
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,921
That's my elder sister,

271
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,631
Miseon An.

272
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:20,553
She was that serial killer's victim.
His last one.

273
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,931
It's been 20 years already.

274
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,392
What took you so long to get here?

275
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,188
We totally understand.

276
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:33,065
You must have felt really angry.

277
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,735
That's why you sued them, isn't it?

278
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:38,446
Wouldn't you have to?

279
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:41,490
If they had caught that son-of-a-bitch
on time, then my…

280
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:43,951
my sister…

281
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,496
wouldn't have died
when she was only 25 years old.

282
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,586
Then, that motherfucker
from <i>Myungsung Daily</i>

283
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:57,047
went around spouting fucking bullshit
about how my sister was a karaoke girl.

284
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,592
She wasn't a karaoke girl.

285
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,303
She went to karaoke

286
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,221
'cause it was her birthday that day.

287
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,432
And she was on her way back home…

288
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,477
I was so fucking angry, you know.

289
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,812
How could they write an article like that

290
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,481
without fact-checking anything?

291
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,693
That's why I sued them for defamation.

292
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,907
Then that dick at the Hangang
Police Station buried the case.

293
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,410
I heard he wound up dead.

294
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:31,415
You're talking about… Superintendent Yoon?

295
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,960
Superintendent Yoon is dead too?

296
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,547
Uh, then did someone else die?

297
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,636
The guy from the paper, he died.

298
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,429
The journalist died?

299
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,182
Yeah. He killed himself.

300
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,100
Ganghyun Lee.

301
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,103
That motherfucker,
I'll never forget his name.

302
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,787
You think that journalist…

303
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:12,623
committed suicide?

304
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,500
We might as well check.

305
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,921
Ganghyun Lee lived in Mok-dong, didn't he?
Give me a sec.

306
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:24,218
Senior Inhwan Son

307
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:28,222
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, Inhwan.

308
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,641
- This is Hansaem. How you been?
- <i>Oh, Hansaem!</i>

309
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,518
- Are you still at Yangseo?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

310
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,187
"Ganghyun Lee death case"

311
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:37,815
What are you after?
This case is like 10 years old.

312
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,068
Don't tell anyone I showed you this.

313
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:43,612
Okay… Thanks, man.

314
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,906
Here, share this with your team.

315
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,450
For real?

316
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:49,743
Thanks.

317
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:50,828
Yeah, see ya.

318
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,007
Ganghyun Lee death case

319
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:08,012
Give it to me.

320
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,106
Cheoljin Oh

321
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,735
Cheoljin Oh?

322
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,905
- Hey, Ena.
- Hmm?

323
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,252
That's from eight months
before your uncle was killed.

324
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,760
So my uncle's death wasn't the first case.

325
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,845
Ganghyun Lee was the first one.

326
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,185
Ugh, why didn't I ever
think of this possibility?

327
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:07,196
Actually, I always thought
it was a little weird.

328
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,490
Even a serial killer who killed 21 people

329
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:13,243
had to return to their first crime scene
because they left their jackknife behind.

330
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:16,121
It's impossible for a killer's first run
to go perfectly.

331
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:18,832
They're bound to make amateur mistakes
and leave some trace.

332
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,250
The scene of my uncle's murder

333
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:22,878
was way too perfect for it
to have been their first one.

334
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:26,924
They left no prints, no DNA,
there was nothing left at the scene. How?

335
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,093
Because they'd done it before.

336
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,261
Because Ganghyun Lee
was their first victim.

337
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:34,139
We might get some clues
if we look back at that case.

338
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,727
I'll find out who was in charge,
you focus on the puzzle piece.

339
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,312
I'll ask Yangseo Station for help.

340
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:43,190
The One City unit 5802.

341
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:45,067
Hangang Police Station…

342
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:47,111
And Ganghyun Lee.

343
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:55,160
Journalist Ganghyun Lee

344
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,332
Redevelopment finally begins in Hangang-gu
Journalist Ganghyun Lee

345
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:04,253
Hangang Police Station

346
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,589
Annual leave application
Applying due to personal affairs

347
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,300
What do you mean
you want to take a year off?

348
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:12,928
What's your progress
in the Yoonsu Do case?

349
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:15,723
You remember that profile
that Lieutenant Yoon put together?

350
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,519
I'm working the puzzle murders
with Lieutenant Yoon.

351
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,444
Miyoung Lee incident profiling report

352
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,907
Analysis of association
with the Donghoon Yoon case

353
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:43,500
It's not just about
Donghoon Yoon and Miyoung Lee.

354
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:46,378
Chimok Kang and Yoonsu Do's deaths
also had to do with this.

355
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,422
And we caught Chimok Kang's killer.

356
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,340
Yes, but then we got a puzzle piece.

357
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,510
Which probably means he was a target.

358
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:02,478
Who else knows this?

359
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,856
You're the first person I've told this to.

360
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,775
There's one piece
we haven't confirmed yet,

361
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:09,902
but we'll go public with everything
once we do.

362
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,445
This case is too big.

363
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:14,823
But…

364
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:18,368
I don't think it's a good idea
to go public without all the evidence.

365
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:20,704
We don't know which one of us
took the handkerchief.

366
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:24,291
And most of all,

367
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,043
there's Lieutenant Yoon.

368
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:29,129
Remember I asked whether
you could trust her or not?

369
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,007
Do you know everything about her?

370
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,176
How much do you know?

371
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,178
What are you talking about?

372
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,597
From that response,
I'll assume that you don't.

373
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:41,517
You should ask her yourself.

374
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:44,311
I won't be approving your leave.

375
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:47,106
You're basically working
the Yoonsu Do case anyway.

376
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,651
Don't come into the office,
but keep digging.

377
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,570
Just… report back to me what you find out.

378
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,669
Chief Hogeun Hyeun

379
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,176
Take a seat.

380
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,637
I'll stand, if you don't mind.

381
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,888
Sure.

382
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,432
You've got no right to sit anyway.

383
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:27,062
I heard you're looking at an old case
at Yangseo Station

384
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,942
when you haven't even managed to catch
the killer in the Yoonsu Do case.

385
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,737
Don't you have better things to do?

386
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:38,448
What the hell are you thinking?

387
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,618
I'd like an explanation.

388
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:46,039
It's a bit too soon to tell you anything.

389
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:47,749
What?

390
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,130
I think there's something
we need to make clear.

391
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,632
Do you report to me or not?

392
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,384
Huh?

393
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:04,641
I believe the Yoonsu Do case is linked to
the Ganghyun Lee case from 10 years ago.

394
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:08,145
Same for the Miyoung Lee, Chimok Kang
and Donghoon Yoon cases.

395
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:13,400
I also have a hunch
that our Hangang Police Station

396
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,569
may be at the center of this whole case.

397
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:16,653
Somehow.

398
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,282
Do you have any evidence?

399
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,659
What makes you think so?

400
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,331
I'll go out there and I'll find some.

401
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:30,876
You fucking guy…

402
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:35,088
Why the hell are you still standing there?
Go find the evidence!

403
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,549
I'll get right on it.

404
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,479
Uh…

405
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:54,107
Ah! Right up there.

406
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:57,194
Those are all the evidence boxes
from the early 2010 cases.

407
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,530
I don't know if you'll find anything,
but take a look.

408
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:01,615
Thanks.

409
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:14,461
- The Ganghyun Lee case?
- Yeah.

410
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:20,842
Yeah…

411
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:25,013
We did conclude that it was a suicide,

412
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:27,182
but to be honest, I had my doubts.

413
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,686
The man died
with a plastic bag over his face,

414
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,021
which I thought was weird.

415
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:35,440
People usually don't
kill themselves like that.

416
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,526
Why didn't you conduct an autopsy?

417
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,237
It's not that we didn't want to,
we weren't allowed.

418
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,406
His family was strongly opposed to it.

419
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:46,076
Ganghyun Lee…

420
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,536
lived with his son.

421
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,788
After his divorce,
he was left with the kid.

422
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:54,042
Apparently, he was depressed
and hooked on booze and sleeping pills.

423
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:57,462
Then the day before his death,

424
00:29:57,546 --> 00:30:00,507
he told a friend of his
he was struggling to raise a kid alone

425
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,759
and that he wanted to die, so…

426
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:05,637
he did have a reason to commit suicide.

427
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,472
Hmm…

428
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,017
Do you remember

429
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,769
anything about a puzzle piece
that was found on the scene?

430
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:18,859
A puzzle piece?

431
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:33,707
I got it.

432
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:36,752
Oh, I remember.

433
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:39,921
Lying next to the corpse
was a single puzzle piece,

434
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:43,300
which I thought was weird 'cause it seemed
like it was put there on purpose.

435
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:46,845
I mean, you always find random shit
at crime scenes, but…

436
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:49,139
the son said the piece wasn't his.

437
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,516
I wonder what it was doing there.

438
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,103
It had this weird…

439
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:56,480
drawing on it.

440
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:59,066
It was disturbing.

441
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,359
Disturbing, how?

442
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:04,946
<i> It was a drawing</i>
<i>of a man holding a camera,</i>

443
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:08,784
<i>but his eyes had been sewn shut</i>
<i>with some kinda thread.</i>

444
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:12,454
<i>Something about it</i>
<i>creeped the hell out of me.</i>

445
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,499
<i>The drawing was kinda simple,</i>

446
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,709
<i>like maybe a kid drew it.</i>

447
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:30,138
Was there anyone who left an impression,
or anything else that you found odd?

448
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,433
Let's see now…

449
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,186
Let me think
who would know this case best.

450
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,942
- You're from Hangang Station, right?
- Yeah.

451
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,777
Then, do you know Jungho Yang?

452
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:45,779
We're in the same unit.

453
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,531
Oh, man, you should just ask him.

454
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,950
Jungho would know this case
better than anyone.

455
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:54,204
Meaning?

456
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:56,998
Well, y'see…

457
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:58,917
originally, he was in charge of the case.

458
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,003
But then he was assigned to
the Investigation Unit at headquarters,

459
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:03,713
and the case was given to me.

460
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:05,966
To be honest, Jungho did most of the work

461
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,845
and all I did was wrap the case up
as the higher-ups wanted.

462
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:13,265
Jeez, those were the good old days.

463
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,642
Think twice before you turn in your badge.

464
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:17,769
It's a rough world out there.

465
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:20,147
Wait.

466
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:23,233
You mean Hangang Station's
Captain Yang of the, uh…

467
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:24,818
…Violent Crimes Unit 2?

468
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:26,611
Mm-hmm.

469
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,172
You find anything?

470
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:46,256
Uh, yeah, I did.

471
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,592
I managed to get ahold
of the security footage

472
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:52,554
that covered the bar connected
to the back entrance of the Canon Tower.

473
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,723
I thought their camera was busted.

474
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,350
Turns out that they were lying
and didn't wanna cooperate.

475
00:32:57,434 --> 00:33:00,687
They handed over this footage
when I threatened to shut them down.

476
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:02,480
And there was nothing?

477
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:04,232
No, nothing out of the ordinary.

478
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:06,651
As you can see,
the video quality isn't great.

479
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:08,945
So I heard you told Hansaem

480
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:11,239
that the handkerchief
went missing from the scene.

481
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,329
Aside from the that,

482
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:19,664
anything else you remember?

483
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,960
Did you see anyone
who was acting a bit strange?

484
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:27,631
Well, uh, the scene was really chaotic,
so, uh…

485
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:30,175
what I told Lieutenant Kim was all I saw.

486
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,470
So, what are we gonna do from here?

487
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,391
I wonder where the handkerchief went.

488
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:50,987
"Hansaem Kim
Captain, I need to report something"

489
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,131
Why do you wanna meet for a drink?
We're on the clock.

490
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:12,676
Cheers.

491
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:24,271
So, what's going on?

492
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,273
<i>Hyung.</i>

493
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:30,277
Do you know when I admired you the most?

494
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,781
Sure, the fact that you volunteer
at the orphanage once a month

495
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,283
is worthy of respect,

496
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:39,286
but that could just be because
you're from an orphanage yourself.

497
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:43,331
You said you had something to report?

498
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,417
So…

499
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,169
back when you first joined our unit
as the captain,

500
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,589
you said that you had
to attend a victim's funeral,

501
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:54,467
so I asked you why you had to go.
Do you remember that day?

502
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,347
And then you said…

503
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,643
that you had to go apologize to them.

504
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:08,398
You said it was a cop's job
to protect people,

505
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,025
and that you had fallen short.

506
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,903
You said you had to tell them
you'd catch the culprit.

507
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,406
And that was when…

508
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,159
I admired you the most.

509
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:23,455
Me? I just enjoy solving cases.

510
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:26,625
I'm a mystery-novel-and-detective-film
nerd turned policeman.

511
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:29,586
But you had a different start.

512
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:34,257
I've never seen a cop
with as strong a sense of duty.

513
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:35,925
You know,

514
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,136
I thought you were born to be a cop.

515
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,014
You're a man with a warm heart.

516
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,726
Jungho Yang, he stands for justice.

517
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,603
I seriously thought that.

518
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:49,731
That's why I call you Batman,
you know?

519
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:53,276
You mind telling me the point of all this?

520
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,528
So why didn't you tell me anything then?

521
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,824
You were the detective in charge
of the Ganghyun Lee case,

522
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:01,993
and a puzzle piece was found on the scene.

523
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:06,498
That was the case where the puzzle murders
first started, yeah?

524
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:10,877
So I really wanna know
why you didn't say anything.

525
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,975
Were you the one who took
the handkerchief, Captain?

526
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:29,938
You know me.

527
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,064
Was it you?

528
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,774
Why would I?

529
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,237
If you didn't,
then why wouldn't you tell me anything?

530
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,743
Why do you think I didn't say anything?

531
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:44,953
Don't know.

532
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:47,831
I asked you

533
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:51,376
whether you knew
everything about Ena Yoon.

534
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,877
How much do you know?

535
00:36:57,424 --> 00:37:00,093
Mok-dong Apartments, unit 212.

536
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,345
That's the unit where Ganghyun died.

537
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,305
That day,

538
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,809
do you know who was in unit 314,
directly above?

539
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,483
Ganghyun Lee's son, Seonuk

540
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:16,943
and three of his friends.

541
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:19,696
Seulgi Cho, Yeonghun Oh…

542
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:23,116
and Ena Yoon.

543
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,329
It was winter break

544
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:32,333
and Ganghyun's son's friend hosted
a math study group at his house.

545
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,462
The study group went
from 9 p.m. until midnight.

546
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:39,799
and camera footage showed
everyone leaving at 12:05 a.m.

547
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:43,470
Everyone, except for Ena Yoon.

548
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:45,597
Why?

549
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,391
She claimed she went home at 11
'cause she wasn't feeling well.

550
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,686
But you see, Ena didn't leave
the apartment at that time.

551
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:54,689
She didn't appear on camera

552
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:58,443
until over an hour later at 12:23.

553
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:06,326
Ganghyun's estimated time of death
was between 10 p.m. and midnight.

554
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:10,246
The day he died,
Ena Yoon's alibi was unclear.

555
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,500
However, I couldn't meet her.

556
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,669
Her uncle wouldn't let me interview her.

557
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:19,214
According to Superintendent Yoon,

558
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:22,926
Ena felt unwell.
She went to the rooftop to get some air.

559
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,679
He said she stayed there
till the study session ended.

560
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:30,141
Do you think that makes any sense?

561
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,520
I wanted to dig deeper
into the Ganghyun case,

562
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:36,022
then I was suddenly
transferred to headquarters.

563
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,777
Then eight months later,

564
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,489
Superintendent Yoon was killed.

565
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:45,657
And just like before,

566
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:48,701
Ena Yoon's alibi was unclear.

567
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:54,749
Can you still trust her,
now that you know?

568
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,967
That's why I didn't say anything.

569
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:13,560
If we find the accomplice hiding among us…

570
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,939
everything will become clear.

571
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:39,002
<i>Ganghyun Lee lived in unit 212.</i>

572
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:43,006
<i>And 10 years ago, my study group was</i>

573
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:45,258
<i>- in unit 314.</i>

574
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:49,387
Hey, I mean,
aren't they all fucking loaded now?

575
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,974
That's fucking chump change to them.
They can't fucking treat me like this.

576
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,310
Hey… man…

577
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,854
I've still got one fucking bullet
in the chamber.

578
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:00,356
God damn it, I might be
a has-been, shitty journalist,

579
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,483
but fuck, you know me, Cheoljin, right?

580
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:05,653
I'm Ganghyun Lee and I'm fucking
gonna fuck all of you up!

581
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,699
Once I get my shit together
and get myself fucking cleaned up,

582
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:13,369
Im'a pick the pen back up,
and they're all going down with me.

583
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:15,622
I won't fucking go down alone,
you hear me?

584
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:17,790
Who do you think they're fucking kidding?

585
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:19,834
Hey! Uh…

586
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,961
Im'a fuck 'em all up.

587
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:24,130
You got that?

588
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:28,134
<i>8:55 p.m.,</i>
<i>five minutes before study group.</i>

589
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:32,263
<i>Huh. Nothing was</i>
<i>out of the ordinary that day.</i>

590
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,807
Hey, Cheoljin, I'm so sorry

591
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:37,936
I keep talking about fucking money
and shit with you, okay?

592
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:42,398
Do you think you can put in
a good word for me, though?

593
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:43,816
Huh, what?

594
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:47,695
Hey, I wouldn't have fucking sold it if
I'd known things would turn out this way!

595
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,739
Ugh, just help me, just once.

596
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:52,784
Okay? Just once, man, just this once.
Come on!

597
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:56,162
Hey, we're buddies, right?

598
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:58,665
All the fucking good times
we had together.

599
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:00,875
We went through fucking
hell and back, didn't we?

600
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:03,086
We were like fucking brothers, weren't we…

601
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:05,088
Hello?

602
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,362
<i>"Good times."</i>

603
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,657
<i>That was the last time</i>

604
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,867
<i>I ever saw Ganghyun Lee.</i>

605
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:39,330
We've established that variance
is npq, and that q equals one minus p.

606
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:42,792
The square root of the positive number
gets you the standard deviation.

607
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,544
Now, let's look at the problem.

608
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:47,630
What's the mean and standard deviation
of 2x minus 5?

609
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:50,508
What does the mean
of 2x minus 5 look like?

610
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,885
It's 2x minus 5,

611
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:55,179
but we can multiply it by two

612
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:56,973
and write it as 2.

613
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,017
Then what value would we get?

614
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:02,103
Now, if we bring the 5 over to this side…

615
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:05,815
<i>I went up to the rooftop</i>
<i>during the session because I felt stuffy.</i>

616
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:09,444
<i>And if I'm remembering things correctly,</i>

617
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:12,155
<i>nothing interesting happened</i>
<i>up until then.</i>

618
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,158
<i>I remember that night was really cold.</i>

619
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:18,369
<i>What song was I listening to?</i>

620
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:22,206
<i>I listened to it all the time</i>
<i>when I was in high school.</i>

621
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,518
<i>That's when I saw</i>

622
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:45,563
<i>someone entering the building</i>
<i>through the front.</i>

623
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:51,360
<i>Who was it?</i>

624
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:16,260
<i>This was the killer's first murder.</i>

625
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:18,846
<i>It was almost flawlessly executed.</i>

626
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:21,349
<i>They must have been nervous</i>
<i>since it was their first,</i>

627
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:25,019
<i>but they didn't slip up like an amateur</i>
<i>or leave any traces on the scene.</i>

628
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:29,273
<i>I suppose, the only failure</i>
<i>on the killer's part</i>

629
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:32,777
<i>was that the puzzle piece</i>
<i>didn't get much attention.</i>

630
00:43:35,488 --> 00:43:38,157
<i>Had they put away the soju bottle</i>
<i>and sleeping pills,</i>

631
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:40,118
<i>the case wouldn't have</i>
<i>been ruled a suicide.</i>

632
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:42,411
<i>It would have become</i>
<i>a murder investigation.</i>

633
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:44,539
<i>That was their mistake.</i>

634
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:58,386
Who, me?

635
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:02,181
Captain Yang asked you
whether I was the culprit?

636
00:44:03,933 --> 00:44:06,602
I wonder why he suspects me.

637
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:10,231
Mok-dong Apartment unit 314.

638
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:21,075
What were you doing at the time
of Ganghyun's death?

639
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:25,496
That night,

640
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:28,166
I went up on the roof to chill.

641
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:30,168
I really, really didn't want to study,

642
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:32,712
and if I went home,
my uncle would've talked my ears off,

643
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:35,047
so I went up to the roof to get away.

644
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,343
I thought you trusted me 100 percent.

645
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,055
Why didn't you tell me
you knew Ganghyun Lee?

646
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:45,933
He was your friend's dad,
how could you not have known him?

647
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:48,394
You didn't tell me
about the handkerchief either.

648
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:50,813
- Not true, I did tell you about that!
- Yeah, too late.

649
00:44:50,897 --> 00:44:52,773
That's because you never
pick up your phone!

650
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:56,736
Look, I did tell you in the end, though,

651
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:59,030
so why didn't you ever tell me
you knew Ganghyun?

652
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:02,200
We all have our embarrassing secrets,
okay?

653
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:05,494
Did I really need to tell you that
I got illegal tutoring in high school?

654
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:07,955
If it was relevant to the case,
then of course you did.

655
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:11,626
Then how about Jungho?

656
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:15,046
Why do you think he didn't say anything
when he knew about the Ganghyun case?

657
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:18,007
When I first brought up the puzzle pieces,
why did he ignore me?

658
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:21,052
Because he doesn't trust you.
Because he thinks you're the killer!

659
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:24,472
I can see why he thinks that,
but why did he leave you in the dark too?

660
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:27,516
He had a lot of time to tell you
everything that he knew.

661
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:37,568
You need to decide
who exactly you're going to trust.

662
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,804
Call history

663
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:08,975
Cheoljin Oh

664
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:15,815
Cheoljin…

665
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,987
Cheoljin…

666
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:27,910
Ena, I didn't know you were here.

667
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:30,913
Youngim…

668
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:33,374
do you know anyone named Cheoljin Oh?

669
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,960
Who? Cheoljin Oh?

670
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,215
The name's quite familiar,

671
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:43,342
but I don't think
I've ever met him before.

672
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:14,498
Ena Yoon: Decide quickly whom to trust.
Once you do, trust me no matter what.

673
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:30,431
Look over here.

674
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:33,184
One, two…

675
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:36,896
Jeju International Airport

676
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:08,719
Do you remember that you always
sent gifts to my uncle?

677
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:12,014
You sent something on holidays
and my birthday.

678
00:48:12,515 --> 00:48:15,184
No wonder your name sounded familiar.

679
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:18,020
I sent things on your birthday,

680
00:48:18,104 --> 00:48:21,023
'cause I heard
Superintendent Yoon loved his niece a lot.

681
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:24,360
Besides, they weren't really gifts.

682
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,904
They were more like telephone fees.

683
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:30,950
There's a lot of things that can be solved
with a simple phone call.

684
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:35,746
Wow…

685
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:38,040
That was a long time ago.

686
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,669
Did you really come all this way
just for that?

687
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:43,838
No, of course not.

688
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,258
Did you know Ganghyun Lee?

689
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:52,555
You did, didn't you?

690
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,899
How do you know Ganghyun?

691
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:07,778
Are you really Chief Yoon's niece?

692
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:14,743
I don't think I should tell you over text.
Let's talk in person.

693
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:18,330
What are you up to right now?

694
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:31,177
Calling…
Ena Yoon

695
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,143
Hey, hello.

696
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,145
<i>Hello, this is Ms. Yoon's phone.</i>

697
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:44,940
Hello?

698
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:49,028
This is Ms. Yoon's phone, right?

699
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,613
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

700
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:52,364
<i>This is the Jeju Police Station.</i>

701
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:54,575
<i>What's your relation to Ms. Yoon?</i>

702
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,953
Oh, I'm Lieutenant Yoon's colleague.
Did something happen to her?

703
00:49:58,037 --> 00:50:00,372
<i>Uh, this is a bit hard to explain.</i>

704
00:50:01,207 --> 00:50:04,793
<i>Lieutenant Yoon is at the station with us</i>
<i>due to a delicate matter.</i>

705
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:07,755
Is she there to assist you on a case?

706
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:08,964
<i>No, she's not.</i>

707
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,342
<i>Actually, she's a murder suspect.</i>

708
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:13,719
What?

709
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,242
Excuse me.

710
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,161
Excuse me!

711
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:42,998
Uh… What are you doing there?

712
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:49,964
Hey, excuse me.

713
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,757
What are you doing over there?

714
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:25,416
