1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:18,352
The waves are looking
pretty calm today, huh?

2
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,646
Hey, where's your wife? She's not coming?

3
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:23,857
In the States, with the kids.

4
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:25,943
- Engine oil's good?
- I just changed it.

5
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,529
I took care of that
and maintenance for you.

6
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:31,114
- Safe travels, sir.
- Thank you.

7
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,124
Let's see.

8
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:22,499
Chamisul Soju

9
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:20,909
Nine Puzzles

10
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:38,051
She's a Metro Police profiler?

11
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,177
Yes.

12
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,264
Then why won't she tell us anything?

13
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,141
I don't know.

14
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,227
I'm just worried that this'll come back
to bite us in the ass.

15
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:53,608
What's taking that Hangang guy so long?
He said he'd deal with her.

16
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,819
Okay, and who received it?
Lieutenant Park?

17
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,832
This is why you asked me
to trust you no matter what?

18
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,508
What the hell happened?

19
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,011
Hey, how exactly do you expect me

20
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,846
to respond to this?

21
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,433
How do you want to respond to it?

22
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:28,643
Ena Yoon.

23
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:33,023
If you believe me,
that means I'm not the killer,

24
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,902
and if you don't believe me,
I am the killer.

25
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,987
Stop messing around and answer!

26
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,201
Cheoljin Oh was mentioned
in the Ganghyun Lee case file.

27
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,330
He was the last person Ganghyun Lee called
before he was killed.

28
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,749
You came here to meet with him.

29
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:57,714
Ena Yoon!

30
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:02,844
I don't know.

31
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,106
Look,

32
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,984
we also doubt
that a police officer's behind this.

33
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,695
However, we did find her prints
on the boat,

34
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,865
and she was found
holding the rope tied to the corpse.

35
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:26,201
So it's looking awfully suspicious,

36
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,370
but she's not answering any questions.

37
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,622
Please try and get her to start talking

38
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,457
or figure something else out

39
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:36,127
because once the press finds out,
this place will become a circus.

40
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,046
When was the victim's time of death?

41
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,841
Sometime between
5:00 and 8:00 p.m. yesterday.

42
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,885
People on a yacht tour
that happened to be passing by

43
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:47,055
witnessed Ena Yoon with the victim
a little after 5:00 p.m.

44
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,807
What'd she do after that?

45
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,142
I don't see
how that would be relevant at all.

46
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:54,479
As far as we're concerned,
we believe she's a prime suspect.

47
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:58,191
And we have more than enough evidence
against her to keep her in custody.

48
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,034
Since you personally reached out to us,

49
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,495
I put the investigation on hold.

50
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,332
But you'll need to get this resolved.
I can't delay much longer.

51
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,380
By the way,
why is Hangang Police handling this?

52
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,799
Isn't the suspect from Seoul Metro?

53
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:24,759
How is she a suspect?

54
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,513
I already said all of this over the phone…

55
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:30,390
Would an officer

56
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:34,311
and an active profiler
go and murder someone?

57
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,564
I'm sure this is just…
a misunderstanding.

58
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,317
Well, we'll look into it more.

59
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,571
She's here
because of the case she's working on.

60
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,156
I can't go into details, but--

61
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,949
So spare me, I don't wanna hear them.

62
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,413
About the man, Cheoljin Oh…

63
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,749
He was well-connected
in the political world

64
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,334
and quite influential in Jeju.

65
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,836
No need to elaborate.

66
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,046
I understand.

67
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,467
Sorry, Chief, we should get going.

68
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,720
I'd like to see Lieutenant Yoon, please.

69
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,692
You were working a serial murder case.

70
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,404
How'd you end up behind bars?

71
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,992
And they caught you on the scene.

72
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,703
What the hell happened?

73
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,918
What are you hiding? Tell me now.

74
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,062
Why do you think
I'm hiding anything from you?

75
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,358
I hear you've named me as a suspect.

76
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:07,278
Seems like…
this'll make things easier for you.

77
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,031
There's more than meets the eye to this.

78
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,327
I do find this attitude shift
a little weird.

79
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:17,205
You know…

80
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:22,127
I think the one hiding something…
might actually be you, Captain.

81
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,421
Am I wrong?

82
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,549
I think you are, Lieutenant.

83
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,762
What the hell are you playing at?

84
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,561
Where have you been?

85
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:43,231
Have you confirmed where she was…
on the day of the incident?

86
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,275
Found any security footage?

87
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,986
Sergeant Choi's checking it now, uh…

88
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,656
We don't have enough
to clear her name yet.

89
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,702
You have got to make her talk,
get us an alibi or something, okay?

90
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,787
You gotta figure this out.

91
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,289
I know, sir.

92
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,710
Captain…

93
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,420
we need to talk.

94
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,311
Hmm…

95
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:33,198
Why didn't you say anything
when I first mentioned the puzzle?

96
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,825
I didn't trust Ena Yoon.
I said that already.

97
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,369
You could've told me that at the time.

98
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,415
Didn't you trust me?

99
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,960
It's just you two were always together.

100
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,924
So you're saying
you didn't trust me either.

101
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,675
It's not like you trust anyone.

102
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,345
Guess I learned from the best.

103
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,436
The pieces, they only go to her?

104
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,729
Yeah.

105
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,690
Ever since Miyoung's death.

106
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,901
You don't believe that either?

107
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,490
What do I believe?

108
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,325
I just don't know anymore.

109
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,370
She's up to something.

110
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:22,914
It's my duty to find out what.

111
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,592
Today…

112
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:39,264
I'd like to tell you about a boy
who was swallowed by darkness.

113
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,766
For 10 years,

114
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:46,062
this child lived in a truck
with his father.

115
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,567
During this time,
his father beat his son repeatedly

116
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,986
until the child fled to an orphanage.

117
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:55,947
And that is where I first met him.

118
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:59,742
The child was suffering
from severe depression.

119
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,162
He attempted suicide several times.

120
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,958
I tried my best to help my patient.

121
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:11,212
I wanted to see him recover,
no matter what it took.

122
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:13,715
I frequently visited him at the orphanage.

123
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,175
One day…

124
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,051
this patient

125
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:21,055
decided that he would visit me
at my office instead.

126
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,517
I had never seen this boy
look so relieved,

127
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,436
so unburdened.

128
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:29,272
He told me that everything had been fixed.

129
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,523
Hangang Police Station
Lieutenant Hansaem Kim

130
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,609
He told me that he was fine now,

131
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,195
and he asked me to look him in the eyes.

132
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:40,867
And then, without saying a word,
the patient stared at me,

133
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,827
he refused to look away.

134
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,749
It seemed as though he wanted
to communicate something.

135
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,504
That's when it hit me…

136
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,258
this young man had killed his father.

137
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,101
As it turned out,

138
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:10,521
he'd set fire to the truck
in which his father was sleeping.

139
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,865
Do you know what I remember seeing…

140
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,869
when I looked into the boy's eyes?

141
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:29,874
What I saw was…

142
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,127
dark.

143
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,923
I saw darkness in his eyes.

144
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,228
Hangang Police Station
Lieutenant Hansaem Kim

145
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:53,606
Calling you about Ms. Ena Yoon,
please write back

146
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,249
How did you know that I was in Jeju?

147
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:16,212
So you think if I go,
Ms. Yoon will start talking?

148
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,924
- Is it already over?
- Yeah.

149
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,301
I just need a sec.

150
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,137
Who's that? What about Ena?

151
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,037
To what do I owe the pleasure?

152
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:52,540
Did Hansaem Kim tell you to come?

153
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,084
Yes.

154
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,253
I happened to be in Jeju.

155
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,672
Dr. Hwang had a seminar,
so we came right away.

156
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:01,924
Hmm…

157
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,596
I just heard about his patient
who was "swallowed by darkness."

158
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,098
Is that what's happening to you?

159
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,642
What are you talking about?

160
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:19,067
It's a case that I shared at the seminar
we were at earlier.

161
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,528
I'm pretty sure
I brought it up a couple of times

162
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,655
during a few of our sessions.

163
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,991
The story of the boy
who killed his father.

164
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:31,621
I'm sorry, Dr. Hwang…

165
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:35,249
but would you mind…
stepping out for a bit?

166
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,252
I'd like to have a chat with her,
just us girls.

167
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,299
Go ahead.

168
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,066
Why on earth are you doing this?

169
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,610
You have too much trust in me.

170
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,906
Shouldn't you be asking why I killed him?

171
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,106
I really didn't get much out of her,

172
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,984
but… she said to give you this.

173
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,802
When did you get this?

174
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,096
Was it after Cheoljin Oh died?

175
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,225
Why won't you talk?

176
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,936
I can't get you out of here
if you don't give me anything!

177
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,441
Why are you acting this way?

178
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:26,068
What are you getting out of this?

179
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,448
I'll tell you after we leave.

180
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,742
Huh?

181
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,661
I really gotta get out of here.

182
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:42,043
Here. You can check my alibi.

183
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:45,379
"Jeju Private Taxi"

184
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,239
Hangang Police Station

185
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,829
Seoul Hangang Police Station
Report on puzzle-related case

186
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,799
So you're telling me…

187
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,136
Donghoon's death was one in a series?

188
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,347
Ena was right about that.

189
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,016
It's a serial killer.

190
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,852
Cheoljin Oh was the sixth victim.

191
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,564
Hey, Jungho.

192
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,899
Do you agree with that?

193
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,068
I wish I didn't, but…

194
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,362
all signs are pointing to it, I'm afraid.

195
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,114
The puzzle piece murders.

196
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,326
Sounds like we'll need a task force.

197
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:00,913
Can you get on that?

198
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,542
You're willing to call up
a failed detective.

199
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:06,752
Thanks for that.

200
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,089
This time around, do better.

201
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,507
I see that…

202
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,177
Hansaem Kim's not around.

203
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,762
He's still in Jeju.

204
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,893
I've confirmed you were in a taxi in Jeju

205
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:25,062
at Cheoljin Oh's estimated time of death.

206
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:29,483
The taxi driver said
he picked you up from the docks

207
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,611
took you to the hotel,
then back to the docks.

208
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:33,571
Why would you do that?
Can you tell me now?

209
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:34,822
Nice!

210
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,616
I just had two days of pure fun.

211
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,534
Can you just tell me what's going on?

212
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:41,704
What have you gained from all of this
other than two days of pure fun?

213
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,379
You know how I got this piece here?

214
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,550
When I was coming back
from meeting Cheoljin Oh,

215
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,594
and the taxi was approaching the hotel,

216
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,721
someone knocked on the car window.

217
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,821
How did they know which taxi I was in

218
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,866
and how did they know
which hotel I was staying at?

219
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,454
The culprit's been leading us
on a chase all along.

220
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,873
When we got a puzzle piece,
we had to look for a case

221
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,167
and find the link
between the piece and the victim.

222
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,003
Right, but the thing is,
we still don't know the motive,

223
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,798
or even why these victims were chosen,
so what are you saying?

224
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:37,218
We're still just walking blindly
through the mist,

225
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:40,554
but all along,
the killer can see us crystal clear.

226
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:43,391
So is this the reason
that you made yourself a suspect?

227
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:47,019
I wanted to see how they would react

228
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:50,731
if I tried to frame myself
after finding Cheoljin Oh's body.

229
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,151
They're killing people
in order to achieve some sort of goal,

230
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:56,195
and they want to use me in that process.

231
00:19:56,278 --> 00:20:00,408
That's why I wanted to set up a situation
where I was about to drown

232
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,952
and see who'd pull me out.

233
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,999
The killer doesn't want me
to drown just yet.

234
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:11,836
Okay, so…

235
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,337
…who pulled you out?

236
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,341
Four people came down to Jeju to see me,

237
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,051
aside from you, Curry Kim.

238
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:22,805
Chief Hogeun Hyeun, Captain Jungho Yang,
Dr. Seungjoo Lee,

239
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:24,515
and…

240
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,559
Inchan Hwang.

241
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,615
What happened?

242
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,617
You're out already?

243
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,911
I'm gonna sit here today.

244
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:07,057
So this is what you look like
from over here.

245
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,602
How do I look?

246
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:15,316
You look like someone
who wants a fresh perspective.

247
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,359
You can ask me anything.

248
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:19,779
Why'd you go to Jeju?

249
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:21,781
To attend a seminar, I told you.

250
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,201
Dr. Hwang was invited
to give an important lecture.

251
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,622
This seminar you went to,
when was it first scheduled, do you know?

252
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,791
I heard about it three months ago.

253
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,584
Are you…

254
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:38,964
Am I a suspect now?

255
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:51,977
I just find it odd.

256
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,898
I'm not sure
why your face suddenly came to mind.

257
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:57,691
Well, that is odd.

258
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,654
I'd also like to know
why my face came to mind.

259
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,325
How long have I been a patient of yours?

260
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:09,370
Having an incurable patient
must be hard on you.

261
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,580
You could've given up on me long ago, so…

262
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,041
why do you keep treating me?

263
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:18,546
Remember that you're the one who chose me.

264
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,382
Your very first sessions
were with Dr. Hwang,

265
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,217
but you said you were uncomfortable.

266
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:28,013
Also, I'm sure you remember
this is a police-affiliated hospital?

267
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:30,599
Hmm… That's a good point.

268
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,601
I should note…

269
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,312
helping you recover memories
isn't my goal here.

270
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:39,692
I'm way more interested
in the reasons behind lapses in memory.

271
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:43,028
Although…

272
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:47,241
I was really curious
about that specific memory.

273
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,206
For real?

274
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,544
Why were you so curious about that?

275
00:22:58,627 --> 00:22:59,962
Were you part of it?

276
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:06,343
You're overthinking it.

277
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:07,678
The reason's simple.

278
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,263
I just…

279
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:12,182
wanted to do what Dr. Hwang couldn't.

280
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:22,026
You two were rivals then, huh?

281
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,697
Anyways, I'm heading out.

282
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,116
I'm gonna go question Dr. Hwang now.

283
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,750
This is Sunshine Mental Health Clinic.

284
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,752
I'm about to fax over
the doctor's diagnosis

285
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,712
and the medical certificate you requested.

286
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:42,796
Doctor's office 2

287
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,632
Would you confirm your fax number?

288
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,428
02-0624-1219.

289
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,303
Hangang Police Station HR Yeongseong Kim

290
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:32,930
Sent what you asked for yesterday

291
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:35,391
Not a word about this to anyone
or I'll be in trouble

292
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,725
Jungho Yang personnel file

293
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,270
<i>Police academy…</i>

294
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:44,358
<i>Yangseo, Mapo, and finally,</i>
<i>Hangang Police Station, where he is now.</i>

295
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,652
<i>When Donghoon Yoon died,</i>
<i>he was with Mapo Station,</i>

296
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,153
<i>the next precinct over.</i>

297
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:50,656
<i>Wait, if he worked there 10 years ago…</i>

298
00:24:56,829 --> 00:25:00,916
Sandeul Precinct

299
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:09,216
You wanna know what Captain Yang
was like when he worked at Mapo?

300
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:10,300
Why do you ask?

301
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,511
I'm just curious.

302
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,264
He's really hard to read,
as I'm sure you know.

303
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:18,475
Honestly, he's a pretty mysterious guy.

304
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,979
We're the same age,
so we could've been close,

305
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,773
but the guy never really opened up to me.

306
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:26,650
He never told me anything.

307
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:28,652
He's a great investigator, sure.

308
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,448
But he wasn't interested
in friendship at all.

309
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,784
We worked together for four years,

310
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:38,996
but I can count on one hand
the times we got drinks alone.

311
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:42,624
And even then, he'd always make up
some excuse to leave.

312
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,585
And where would he go?

313
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,463
No idea. He'd just disappear.

314
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,465
Saying it was an urgent family matter.

315
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,799
This one time,

316
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:53,844
we were drinking together
on a very rainy night.

317
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:56,096
He claimed his sibling was in trouble,

318
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,891
and he up and left,
saying he'd be back in a bit.

319
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,101
He just left me alone,
what was I supposed to do?

320
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,771
So he, uh… His sibling?

321
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,482
Jungho doesn't have any siblings.

322
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,067
He was in an orphanage.

323
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,193
Huh?

324
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,445
He grew up in an orphanage?

325
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,823
Then why did he say that?

326
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,868
Maybe it wasn't a blood relative?

327
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:20,621
Anyway, I clearly remember that night.

328
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:23,832
A huge incident happened, one town over.

329
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:27,711
I'm sure you remember it…
what happened to Superintendent Yoon.

330
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:29,838
That was that night.

331
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:32,299
I was waiting for Jungho to come back,

332
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,384
and a bunch of police vehicles
and ambulances

333
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:36,136
started whizzing past the window.

334
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:39,306
As I was sitting there watching them,

335
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,934
in walks Jungho, completely drenched.

336
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,685
I was surprised he came back.

337
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:46,438
Was anything off about him then?
Maybe something he said?

338
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,858
Not sure.

339
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,654
Well, I remember him
looking pretty gloomy,

340
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,364
but he didn't really talk.

341
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,949
We just ordered another drink.

342
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,951
<i>Do you remember which bar it was?</i>

343
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:05,833
Jinhui Bar

344
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,465
<i>There's a shortcut</i>
<i>from the bar to the house</i>

345
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,759
<i>where Superintendent Yoon was murdered.</i>

346
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:17,636
<i>It would've taken 12 minutes.</i>

347
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,264
<i>If Jungho took that shortcut 10 years ago…</i>

348
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,518
<i>…he would've had enough time to do it.</i>

349
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,938
We haven't heard from Jeju yet?

350
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:30,357
The CCTV footage you mentioned…

351
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:39,992
I'm Commander Tae
from the Regional Investigation Team.

352
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,410
Before I start…

353
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,705
I wanna emphasize the gravity of the case.

354
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:48,375
We are dealing with a serial killer
who has claimed six lives.

355
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:53,463
The Regional Team will be investigating
every case except Cheoljin Oh's,

356
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:57,426
as that case will be handled
by Violent Crimes Unit Two.

357
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,053
Though the MO and cause of death
vary with each case,

358
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:02,306
don't forget
that there is an active killer,

359
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,016
so time is of the essence.

360
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,269
Lieutenant Yoon
from Seoul's Crime Analysis Team

361
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,062
will provide the full details.

362
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,489
The man with his eyes closed,

363
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:22,200
who's taking a photo,
represents Ganghyun Lee.

364
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:26,997
The man shooting a doll

365
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,291
that's holding a gun represents…

366
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,459
Donghoon Yoon.

367
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,464
The woman whispering,
holding cotton candy, represents…

368
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,548
Miyoung Lee.

369
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,886
The dancing man
wearing an armband represents…

370
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:41,970
Chimok Kang.

371
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,224
The clown
trampling sandcastles represents…

372
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:47,768
Yoonsu Do.

373
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:51,688
The man competing
in a hamburger-eating contest represents…

374
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:53,148
Cheoljin Oh.

375
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:58,195
Each puzzle piece
has a specific drawing on it,

376
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:00,989
each of which
represents one of our victims.

377
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:05,702
Now, why don't we try putting it together?

378
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:10,916
As you can see from the pieces we have,

379
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:15,128
this is a rectangular puzzle
that consists of nine pieces in total.

380
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:17,714
For us, only the empty spaces matter.

381
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:19,967
That's three.

382
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,387
So this tells us

383
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:26,390
that there are three murders left.

384
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:31,520
All right.

385
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,230
Now you know the stakes.

386
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,274
The only way to save these three people

387
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:38,735
is to find evidence ASAP.

388
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:40,028
Let's get moving.

389
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,446
Yes, sir.

390
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:46,368
Lieutenant Yoon, I'd like a word.

391
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:51,415
Many people are opposed
to your involvement

392
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:54,084
with the investigation,
given your relation to the victim.

393
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,962
It does go against protocol, after all.

394
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:02,300
You certainly fit the bill
for a motion to challenge.

395
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:04,177
However…

396
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,139
since you got the ball rolling…

397
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:10,475
I think we'll let you stay.

398
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:19,776
Thank you, Commander.

399
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:21,945
I appreciate it.

400
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,491
I oversaw that case.

401
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:29,619
Sorry… for letting you down.

402
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,374
You've always had a way with apologies.

403
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:41,089
I'm back, everyone!

404
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:42,883
Are you all right?

405
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,593
I heard they put you behind bars.

406
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:45,927
Are you hungry?

407
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:47,012
Want some tofu?

408
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,680
No, that's why I brought this.

409
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,599
Better than tofu. It's a cream cake.

410
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,684
You have any idea how shocked I was?

411
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:53,852
You were?

412
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,896
Nothing ever fazes you, I thought.

413
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:58,565
That's right.

414
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,067
You've done the impossible.

415
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:03,028
I'm just glad you're back now.

416
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,823
The Investigation Unit sent over data,
let's start analyzing.

417
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:11,203
The killer already knew
that I would be meeting with Cheoljin Oh.

418
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,289
During the Yoonsu Do case,
they weren't expecting it,

419
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,708
but this time,
they knew and acted in advance.

420
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:19,127
But they probably didn't foresee

421
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:22,005
that you would frame yourself as a suspect
and go to jail.

422
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:23,548
You're absolutely right,

423
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:26,218
and maybe that did throw them off.

424
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:29,513
Because after all,
they can't let me drown yet.

425
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,600
But why'd they start sending you pieces
during the Miyoung Lee case?

426
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:37,229
That's what I'd like to figure out,
more than anything.

427
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,064
Consider their POV.

428
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,024
They left a puzzle piece
at the crime scene

429
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:43,068
after killing Donghoon Yoon
and Ganghyun Lee,

430
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:47,197
but no one was paying attention,
and then they stopped killing.

431
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:50,450
However, after 10 years,
they started back up

432
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:52,119
and sent you a puzzle piece.

433
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:56,623
Because that's when you appeared
on their radar.

434
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,127
Who could it be?

435
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,711
Anyone come to mind?

436
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:04,047
Someone you came to know recently?

437
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,384
They gotta be someone close to you.

438
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:12,180
Someone who I recently came to know…

439
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,854
There actually are…

440
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:23,191
a couple faces
that I can't stop thinking about.

441
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:29,406
A total of four people
came to visit me in jail,

442
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,908
none were recent acquaintances of mine,

443
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:33,243
not one of them.

444
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,412
There was one more person…

445
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,123
who was in Jeju that day.

446
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:40,250
Who?

447
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,210
That rookie, San Choi.

448
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,130
I brought him with me.

449
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:54,306
And you're sure
the killer was one of the people

450
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,183
who were on Jeju Island that day?

451
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:58,894
And are you sure
that Jungho Yang is involved?

452
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,187
As you're well aware,

453
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:03,106
Jungho was the detective
on the Ganghyun Lee murder case.

454
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:07,819
He was eight minutes away from the scene
of Superintendent Yoon's murder.

455
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:13,158
What's more, he knew Miyoung Lee
before the murder.

456
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,203
What? Do you know her?

457
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:17,579
No.

458
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,582
And when they redirected
the Miyoung Lee investigation

459
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,543
to focus instead
on the lost resident card…

460
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:25,754
that was all Jungho.

461
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,088
There's something missing.

462
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:31,301
You can't enter The One City
without a resident card,

463
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,886
but it's nowhere to be found.

464
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,055
The culprit only took one thing.

465
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,348
<i>That card.</i>

466
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:39,059
Then an unexpected variable
came into play.

467
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:41,144
I mean Yanghee Seo.

468
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:44,397
He didn't have to
kill Chimok Kang himself.

469
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,525
And then there's Yoonsu Do.

470
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:48,818
Yoonsu Do?

471
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:51,488
I did find him suspicious.

472
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:54,282
Anyway… why do you ask?

473
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:57,786
Chimok Kang's call log listed Yoonsu Do,
but he ignored it.

474
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,706
He must've wanted to buy time.

475
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:05,085
Then his plan went awry
when you met Yoonsu Do,

476
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,003
and he rushed things.

477
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:10,173
What if that's the reason
why he dropped the handkerchief?

478
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,176
What about Cheoljin Oh?

479
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:18,014
First, we'll need to confirm that Jungho
was in Jeju on the day of the murder.

480
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,809
But this is all circumstantial evidence.

481
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,645
What we need is a witness
or concrete evidence.

482
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:29,234
Rollo Tomasi.

483
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:31,903
What are you saying?

484
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:35,282
You haven't seen <i>LA Confidential?</i>

485
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:43,832
The twist is that the buddy cop,
who was with the main character all along,

486
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,542
is actually the culprit.

487
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,294
The culprit shoots Kevin Spacey,

488
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:50,880
who then says these words,
revealing who the killer is as he's dying.

489
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:54,509
Those words were… "Rollo Tomasi."

490
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,345
That's how the guy gets caught in the end.

491
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,764
For God's sake, watch the classics.

492
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:01,433
You're talking about movies now?

493
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,268
Weren't you and Jungho close?

494
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:06,187
God, you're such a Type T!

495
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:11,651
I brought it up because it might be
the kind of case we're dealing with, okay?

496
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:13,445
All right, so…

497
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:16,573
Putting Kevin Spacey aside,

498
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:19,326
do you know
what Cheoljin Oh's last words were?

499
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:21,536
So what you're saying then,

500
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,247
Ganghyun really didn't
kill himself either?

501
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:25,999
Yeah.

502
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:29,753
You're also saying that the deaths
of Mr. Do and Chimok Kang…

503
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,506
had to do with Ganghyun's death?

504
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,966
Yup.

505
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:37,135
They were all murdered by the same person.

506
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:40,388
Why do you think
this all happened in the first place?

507
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:44,267
Do you know of any ties
these people have to each other?

508
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:50,023
It involves The One City, I assume.

509
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,233
I was the one who built it, after all.

510
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,820
That means they'll come for me.

511
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,579
Let me ask you…

512
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,165
do you live in The One City?

513
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,250
Do I?

514
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:10,960
Why would I?

515
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,758
Didn't your uncle tell you anything?

516
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,970
Tell me about what? About The One City?

517
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:26,101
I guess Superintendent Yoon didn't talk
to you much about your parents, huh?

518
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:32,524
Did you really know my… my parents?

519
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,317
I knew the Yoons well.

520
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:36,444
I was quite close with them.

521
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,699
Come to think of it,
you must know my son, Yeonghun.

522
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:44,536
Aren't you the same age?

523
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,418
Okay, so…

524
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:54,295
you suspect the captain, huh?

525
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,756
You think Jungho Yang

526
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:58,758
killed Cheoljin Oh?

527
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,846
I'm just saying it's possible.

528
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,598
Would you go on record?

529
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,351
I need you to authorize a request.

530
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:12,897
Remember how Lieutenant Yoon
mentioned Unit 5802 of The One City?

531
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:15,358
So Cheoljin Oh worked
for Seongjin Construction,

532
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:17,402
which was the company
that built The One City.

533
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,863
According to a company official,

534
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:22,824
Cheoljin Oh was the one
who oversaw that entire project.

535
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,659
He apparently bragged to everyone

536
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:27,912
that he built the most expensive apartment
on the best plot in Seoul.

537
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,623
Is there a cause of death?

538
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:33,585
Yes. Death by asphyxiation.
He was choked to death.

539
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,503
There was blood on the back of his head,

540
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:37,797
but that wasn't the cause of his death.

541
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:40,216
He must've hit his head when he fell over.

542
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,761
Did we find any of the killer's DNA?

543
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:45,346
Or nothing this time too?

544
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,557
Yes, just like all the other cases.

545
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,017
A clean kill.

546
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,937
We also went over what little CCTV footage
we were able to get,

547
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:55,231
but there wasn't much.
The angles were all bad.

548
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,109
By the way, uh…

549
00:37:58,193 --> 00:37:59,986
I haven't seen Lieutenant Kim all day.

550
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:01,863
He go somewhere?

551
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,619
Yeah, I sent him on an errand.

552
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,162
Good work, everyone.

553
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,663
Let's stop here.

554
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,125
Sir.

555
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,317
Working alone right now? No partner?

556
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,532
Just doing some investigating.

557
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:47,242
You don't wanna discuss it?

558
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:53,164
I think now's not the time.

559
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:57,794
Let me ask you something.

560
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:01,089
Why have you been talking
to people at Mapo?

561
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,633
You think I might be the killer?

562
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,014
You keep thinking that.

563
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,809
In the meantime,
I'll keep working the case.

564
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:05,612
You're really giving me no choice
but to suspect you, Captain.

565
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:10,700
There are CCTVs all around here,
you know that?

566
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:14,704
Did you gain anything
by putting yourself behind bars?

567
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:17,040
Yeah.

568
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:20,501
You came all this way to ask that?

569
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:21,753
Oh, no.

570
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:25,214
There's something else
I'd like you to tell me.

571
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,137
Superintendent Donghoon Yoon said…

572
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,557
10 years ago,
when Ganghyun Lee met his demise,

573
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,644
his niece, Ena Yoon,
was on the apartment rooftop.

574
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,939
Let's assume that was true.

575
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,608
If you were on that rooftop,

576
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,277
you could have seen something
from up there.

577
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:50,907
What might that be?

578
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,372
It was a long time ago…

579
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,126
so I don't remember.

580
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:04,629
You lying to me?

581
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:08,424
Let's have the truth.

582
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:10,426
Is there something else
you wanna say to me?

583
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,553
What would I say?

584
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,894
If anything comes back to mind,
then I expect to hear from you.

585
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:43,459
We've received your official request
and attached the file

586
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:45,044
2022-2023 Flight passenger record

587
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:52,051
Open file

588
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:55,972
Passenger record

589
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,768
2023.10.19 Jeju-Gimpo

2023.11.18 Gimpo-Jeju
2023.11.18 Jeju-Gimpo

591
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:07,984
<i>He was in Jeju a month before</i>

592
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:10,028
<i>and also on the day Cheoljin Oh died.</i>

593
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:12,780
Ah, you're the first one in,
as usual.

594
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:16,951
Hey, don't you ever sleep?

595
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,293
San.

596
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,379
I'm sorry, but I have a favor to ask you.

597
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,008
Uh… what kind of favor do you mean?

598
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,509
I'm scared now.

599
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,144
Are… Are you sure about this?

600
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:46,189
I'm regretting that I told you.

601
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:57,241
Sorry to call you here, but it's urgent.

602
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:59,327
Yeah, you said that, so we hurried over.

603
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,204
We don't mind.

604
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,040
Shall we get started?

605
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:12,465
You are going
to a place of comfortable bliss.

606
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,760
Let your body loosen up.

607
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:18,805
Allow yourself to relax.

608
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,934
You're in a forest full of birds.

609
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:26,354
And the wind brushes your skin softly.

610
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:27,647
Can you feel it?

611
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:31,567
Now immerse yourself

612
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:35,863
in the sounds of the forest around you,
in the sensations.

613
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:50,795
When you're ready,
let's think back to the time

614
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:53,214
you saw the handkerchief.

615
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:55,508
In one…

616
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,094
two… three.

617
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,564
A regional investigation officer's talking

618
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,899
into their walkie-talkie
in front of the door,

619
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:15,153
but I tell them to go,
and that I'll take over.

620
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,739
Now look around you.

621
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,284
Who do you see?

622
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:24,912
I'm alone in there.

623
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:28,124
What else do you see?

624
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:33,713
The forensics team and… my unit are…

625
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:36,382
are arriving at the crime scene.

626
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:39,010
How many people in total?

627
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:42,013
Six people.

628
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:46,225
Two… Forensics brought two,
our unit has four.

629
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:49,270
What is everyone doing there?

630
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:52,231
Uh… the forensics team is taking photos

631
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:54,817
in front of the door.

632
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,196
And my unit is checking the crime scene.

633
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:01,824
Uh… it's so chaotic in there.

634
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:03,826
Now think about your colleagues.

635
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:06,537
Try to… recall their actions.

636
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,414
One by one,

637
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,917
I want you to observe them,

638
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,252
and tell me what you see.

639
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:18,758
Uh… Lieutenant Ro is taking photos
with his phone

640
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:23,387
and Youngha is going over
all the evidence.

641
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:28,059
Someone is standing over by the desk…

642
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,646
but I can't see their face.

643
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:42,198
I want you to get closer to them
so that you can see their face.

644
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:45,368
What is that person doing?

645
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:52,500
Uh, that person sits down,
and… and then gets back up.

646
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:56,003
So that person sat down, then got back up.

647
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:59,382
What is that person doing
while they're sitting down?

648
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,176
Uh…

649
00:46:07,056 --> 00:46:08,933
I can't make it out.

650
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:13,938
That's great, you're doing well.

651
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:16,023
Now…

652
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:18,693
I want you to slowly walk towards a spot

653
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:21,028
where you might get
a clear view of the room.

654
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:25,700
When you can get a better look,

655
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,870
stop right there,
and tell me what you see.

656
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:33,666
They picked something up.

657
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:35,710
What do they have?

658
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,220
A handkerchief.

659
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:49,223
They picked up an old handkerchief.

660
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,731
Now, I want you
to get a good look at the person

661
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,524
who picked up the handkerchief.

662
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:01,569
Tell me what you see.

663
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:07,491
They are… they're wearing dark colors.

664
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:14,707
Uh, I… I really don't know.

665
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:20,504
You can describe odor, sound, anything.

666
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:22,048
Do you sense anything?

667
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:25,468
It's a man.

668
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,721
Uh, I smell cigarettes.

669
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:32,475
Can you see his face?

670
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:33,976
Is he recognizable?

671
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,895
No, uh…

672
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,774
I can't make him out
because he's behind the desk.

673
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:42,985
That's okay. You're doing really great.

674
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:51,577
Now…

675
00:47:52,453 --> 00:47:56,665
I want you to walk over to that person
so you're facing him.

676
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,168
Walk one step…

677
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:01,462
toward him.

678
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:14,642
Uh… wait, I can see
the watch he's wearing.

679
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:19,939
This watch…

680
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:42,294
<i>It's Captain Jungho Yang.</i>

681
00:49:35,723 --> 00:49:38,392
