but they had three phone calls
right before he died,

for the whole ride.

at him as he was getting out.

and killed him right there on the spot.

He turned him to face him,
he looked directly into his eyes,

and he drove that hammer into his skull.

For example,

176
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,839
he could've taken a long, sharp needle,

177

What do you want to know, detective?

194
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:51,729
Did your husband ever mention someone
by the name of Yoonsu Do?

195
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:56,609
Because it appears he called him
three times right before his death.

196
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,238
Yoonsu Do…

197
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:03,866
What's his line of work?

198
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,702
He runs a construction company.

199
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:07,704
And he's older?

200
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,707
I suppose so, he's around 60.

201
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,000
You know him?

202
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,837
My husband did mention
a construction company president.

203
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,172
He asked him to officiate our wedding.

204
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,675
But the man said he wouldn't.

205
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,511
Is this the man he asked?

206
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,140
Yes, that's him.

207
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:32,937
That would have been three years ago,
before we were married.

208
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:36,357
My husband and I
went to meet him together,

209
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:39,193
and I remember him
being very polished and well-dressed,

210
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,695
but just incredibly rude.

211
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,365
I got the sense
that he resented my husband.

212
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:48,286
He seemed offended that we asked him
to officiate our wedding.

213
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,704
He was mean.

214
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,457
Did your husband ever mention
how they met each other?

215
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,042
They'd worked together before?

216
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,169
No, he never said.

217
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:58,921
Although…

218
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:03,051
he did mention that the two of them
shared some good times.

219
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,178
What do you mean by "good times"?

220

I don't know.

221
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:09,974
No idea.

222
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:17,315
Have you ever killed someone, detective?

223
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,447
[chuckles] Of course not.

224
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:29,869
That's not exactly a common thing
to have done, even for a cop.

225
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,831
No offense, but you're no fun.

but your mood seems improved.

232
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,355
I finally found a good place to sleep.

It's fine if you kill it.

[Ena sighs] Yes.

236

I slept uninterrupted

for two whole hours.

238
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,414
Wow. And where is this place?

239
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,416
I'm keeping it a secret.

Hmm.

242
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:27,009
Doctor, I wanted to ask, isn't living
with Dr. Hwang kind of awkward?

243
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,553
Why would it be awkward?

244
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,388
He's a man, for one.

245
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:33,891
And I feel like it'd be hard
sharing space with someone all the time.

246
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:39,021
I've actually never felt
any sexual tension with Dr. Hwang.

247
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,065
So, it seems to work out.

248
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:42,567
It saves money too.

after you passed out at that table,

Right here, in this chair.

that two hours had passed.

But my house is totally haunted.

And the owner of this house here
once accused me of my uncle's murder!

once I feel like I'm truly safe,
then I'll be able to sleep.

He had a strategy meeting.

And then, after an hour, I got worried

343
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,643
and came up to his office.

At first, I just assumed
he'd fallen asleep,

so I called his name a few times,

346

348

I've only seen him on the news.

361
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,690
Can't believe we're meeting like this.

362
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,902
You think his company's tanking stocks
gave him a heart attack?

363
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,156
I checked it out.

364
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,616
They were in a nosedive.

365
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,078
There's a huge crowd
of reporters downstairs.

366
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,956
This is gonna cause an uproar.

367
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,457
[Hansaem] Sorry I'm late.

368
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,003
Hmm?

369
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,754
Why'd she come with you?

370
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:03,299
Did you call for reinforcements, Captain?

371
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,217
Why would I?

372
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,095
I figured you might need my help.

373
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:11,015
Just this morning,
I had a meeting with him.

374
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,683
"President Yoonsu Do"

375
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:15,102
Why? What was it about?

376
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,063
Can I have a look?

378
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:33,787
You just asked me about Yoonsu Do
this morning.

379
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,999
Now he's been found dead,
and you have nothing to say to me?

380
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,044
Is there something
that you'd like to share,

381
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,670
or is this not the time?

00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,590
Both, I guess.

DH Construction occupies all
of Canon Tower's 30th floor.

385
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,599
However, starting from
5:00 a.m. this morning,

386
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,602
there's no CCTV footage of this floor.

387
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:57,978
It's been wiped.

388
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,231
I'll look into it immediately.

Turns out Yoonsu Do
was connected to Chimok Kang.

398
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:28,610
Apparently, all the 30th floor
security footage was erased.

399
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,405
You really think he's the fourth victim?

Mm-hmm.

Hey, now, don't be like that.

I bet this has something to do
with the mayor's lobbying scandal.

That and the incident at Yangyang Resort.

What's the cause of death?

441
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:00,679
Hypoglycemic shock
due to an insulin overdose.

442
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:04,433
There was over 2,000 pmol per liter
of insulin in his blood.

About 10 times the normal dose
for a person with diabetes.

Yoonsu Do is the fourth piece.

for blood sugar control,

According to Lieutenant Yoon's statement,

00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:34,721
Yoonsu Do set up a meeting

The media's reporting that the death

was the result of our negligent management

Yeah, that's right.
We'd arranged a meeting.

What was the exact cause
of the accidental death?

565
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,489
It was the concrete.

566
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:18,950
It was taking too long for it to set.

567
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:21,995
Due to the low temperature,
it wasn't drying fast enough.

568
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:26,082
So, to finish the job on time,
we burned lignite to speed things up.

[Doho] Oh.

577
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:52,484
There's this one guy,
but he's not linked to the resort.

578
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,778
He owns a restaurant in Gangnam.

579
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,613
His name is Chimok, if I recall.

Yes, that's right. Chimok Kang.

583
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:05,580
I always thought
there was something strange

584
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,415
about his relationship with Mr. Do.

585
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,834
What do you mean by "strange"?

586
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:12,045
Mr. Do would invite him
to join our golf game

587
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,506
whenever we'd place bets
and we were short a player.

588
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:17,717
This guy was quite the gambler,
and he had great form.

589
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:20,595
That asshole had one hell of a drive.

590
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:24,224
But then, whenever he'd get drunk,
he'd start saying stuff like,

591
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:27,519
"Hey, this isn't enough.
Give me another resort, come on."

592
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,438
And he'd keep nagging and whining
like a little bitch. [chuckles]

593
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:33,650
I mean, this dipshit wasn't even
in the resort business.

594
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:36,403
And Mr. Do, whatever else he was,

595
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:39,989
he's wasn't usually the kind of guy who'd
just sit there listening to that crap.

596
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:44,285
He'd normally either cuss him out
or punch him right in the face.

[groaning sigh]

598
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,248
He never said a word.

599
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,333
He would bite his tongue altogether.

600
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:52,919

Yoonsu Do dies a week after the incident,

642

and we initially figured
he'd just died of natural causes,

643
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,312
an illness that we didn't know about.

644

It was only a day
after his police questioning.

645
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:21,860
And he was stressed out
over everything at the company.

646
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:26,573
If the killer wanted to hide their tracks,
they could've done so.

It would've been easy
to make the death look natural.

But instead they inject him
with a suspiciously high dose of insulin.

Why?

650

Because they didn't want his death
to go unnoticed in all this chaos.

his death is unrelated
to the resort incident.

[Hansaem] Hey. Hey, hey, hey!
Slow down, kid!

709
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:43,037
Are you delirious or something?
What's wrong with you?

710
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:44,705
Are you crazy?

Isn't it like riding a roller coaster?

Isn't this fun? [laughs]

Get out!

725
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,324
This is the police. Please cooperate.

726
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:06,579
If you refuse,
you will be put under arrest.

728
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:10,625
[Ena] Let him go.

729
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:14,462
Let him go, why?

730
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,214
I'm the one who hired him.

731
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:18,257
I wanted to know who's stalking me.

732
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:19,884
What do you mean?

733
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:25,765
Are you telling me you hired this guy
to find out who was following you?

734

[Hansaem] Sit down. [clicks tongue]

739
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:53,918
I heard you were first on the scene
at DH Construction.

740
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,044
Yeah.

741
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,088
Were you also the first to confirm

742
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:59,799
that the security footage
on the 30th floor was erased?

743
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,467
Yes, I was. Why do you ask?

[breathes deeply]

745
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,055
Hey.

746
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,767
Let's go back to the crime scene.
There's something I need to check.

747
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:12,895
I still need to watch the footage
of the first-floor lobby

748
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:14,939
and compare it
to Canon Tower's entry records.

749
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:17,191
Man, there are so many people.
Over 2,000 entries.

750
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:18,734
It's such a headache.

751
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:20,987
I told you to give me that!

[groaning sigh]

754
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:34,208
Hi, I'm Lieutenant Hansaem Kim,
the officer you spoke with earlier.

755
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:36,419
- I just have a few questions to ask you.
- Oh.

756
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:44,176
Is there anything in these pictures
that… that strikes you as a little off?

757
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:47,430
For example, do you notice any items
that don't belong to Mr. Yoonsu Do?

758
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:48,848
Please look at them closely.

759
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:53,060
Uh… I'm not sure.

760
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,730
I think those are all Mr. Do's things.

761
00:46:56,397 --> 00:46:58,983
What are you looking for?
I checked all those already--

762
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,401
Here, take a good look.

763
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,069
[sighs] Huh?

764
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:05,156
What?

765
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:12,955
There's no handkerchief.

766
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,000
Handker… Wh-What handkerchief?

767
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:20,421
Here. Here, next to his slippers,
there was a handkerchief…

768
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:21,505
[gasps]

769
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:23,466
…on the evidence list.

770
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:27,595
Uh… President Do didn't use handkerchiefs,
as far as I'm aware.

771
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,347
Are you sure?

772
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:30,931
Yes.

773
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:37,438
It was right… right here.
R-Right here, like this.

774
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:41,275
[Hansaem] Hmm…

775
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:43,402
Now try to remember

776
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:46,864
what's different between this picture
and what you saw when you arrived.

777
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,407
No, I know what I saw.

778
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:50,659
There were business cards
and pens on the ground,

779
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:55,039
and next to the acupressure slippers
was this ratty old handkerchief.

780
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:56,916
The kind that old guys use.

781
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:01,212
You were the first one here.
Who came here after you?

782
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:05,966
Lieutenant Ro, Youngha, Captain Yang,

783
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:07,676
and the forensics team, yeah.

784
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:09,929
Lieutenant Yoon came too.

00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:07,611
Are you sure?

798
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:09,280
You'd better be certain.

799
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,073
This is very serious.

800
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:13,159
Yes, I'm sure. I remember it clearly, uh…

801
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:15,536
'cause the handkerchief
was so totally messed up.

802
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,913
Why didn't you mention this to me before?

803
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:22,042
Well, I just assumed it was
one of the victim's things,

804
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:24,587
and forensics was at the scene too,

805
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,297
so they'd be collecting it.

806
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,841
I mean, what else
could I have possibly thought?

807
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:32,720
In any case, I'm sorry.

808
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:35,264
This might be a slip-up.

809
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:38,017
Or it could be intentional.

810
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,310
What was that, sir?

811
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:40,603
Never mind.

812
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:44,440
Well, thanks for telling me.
And San, listen to me.

813
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:46,692
This is an incident.
It's a major incident.

814
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:50,362
I need you to promise me one thing.

815
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,909
Don't breathe a word of this to anyone.

816
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:57,161
Understood?

817
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,955
- You're not answering.
- Okay.

Captain, I have something to…
[breathes deeply]

820
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:47,419
I mean, I need your help, sir.

821
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:53,259
Could it have been the victim's or not?

822
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:55,261
No, it wasn't.

823
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:59,056
I've already asked around,
I asked his chauffeur and his family.

824
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:00,975
He never carried a handkerchief with him.

825
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:03,936
He also never wore hats, gloves, scarves,
or anything like that.

826
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:06,564
San has no reason to lie
about what he saw.

827
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:07,815
Which means…

828
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:10,859
it's looking like
someone took it from the scene.

829
00:51:11,527 --> 00:51:12,570
Yeah.

830
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:15,030
Captain, I have no doubt.

831
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:18,993
Either the killer or their accomplice
is within Hangang Police.

832
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:20,869
All right then.

833
00:51:20,953 --> 00:51:23,455
San cannot tell anyone. Keep an eye out.

834
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:26,041
Yeah.

[Ena] Just wondering.

852
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:24,785
Given that your mom lives so close to you,

853
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:26,203
why do you live alone?

854
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:28,706
Wouldn't it be weirder
if I still lived with my mom?

855
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:29,957
Nope.

856
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,000

Nah, it wouldn't work.

861
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:49,893
We'd both be uncomfortable.

862
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:56,024
When I was a kid, after my dad died,
I wouldn't even let my mom date other men.

863
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:59,236
I insisted on keeping my dad's stuff.

864
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:03,532
It's easier for both of us to live alone.

865
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:07,369
You're way more screwed up
than I'd realized.

866
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:10,748
You're incapable of putting stuff
in the past, aren't you?

What do you mean?

This place is what Miyoung Lee,
Chimok Kang, and Yoonsu Do have in common.

00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:50,913
I knew there had to be something
that linked these three people together.

880
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:55,083
And then, I remembered

881
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:58,795
what Chimok Kang allegedly said
at Miyoung Lee's bar,

882
00:54:59,588 --> 00:55:02,591
which was that her apartment
was originally his.

883
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,721
Yanghee Seo told us the same thing.

884
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:10,015
How he'd given Miyoung Lee
an expensive apartment.

885
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,561
What if what those three people shared

886
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:16,647
was a place, not a characteristic?

887
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,316
What if that place is this apartment?

888
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:22,152
So, once that occurred to me,

889
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:24,571
I immediately accessed the register

890
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:27,115
for Unit 5802 of The One City.

891
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:32,204
Comprehensive Property Register
(including deregistration)

892
00:55:34,206 --> 00:55:35,999
March 17, 2011 sold to owner Yoonsu Do

893
00:55:37,793 --> 00:55:40,420
May 18 transferred to Kang
June 11 transferred to Lee

894
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:44,216
Owner Miyoung Lee

895
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:45,592
Owner Chimok Kang

896
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:46,927
Owner Yoonsu Do

897
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,470
And Yoonsu Do

898
00:55:48,554 --> 00:55:50,806
was the first name that popped up.

899
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,601
The question is… [sighs]

900
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:56,687
…what exactly happened here?

901
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:04,403
[♪ dramatic music]

902
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:31,305
[♪ closing theme music]
