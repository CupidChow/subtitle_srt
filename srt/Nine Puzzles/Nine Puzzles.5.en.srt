1
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:38,247
<i>Yanghee Seo definitely killed Chimok Kang.</i>

2
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,541
<i>So why did I get a puzzle piece?</i>

3
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:43,418
<i>The puzzle murders</i>
<i>had nothing to do with Chimok.</i>

4
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,318
Yanghee was the one who killed Chimok.

5
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,740
I'm sure Yanghee killed Chimok.

6
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:15,367
So it couldn't have been him.

7
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:19,162
What's happening?

8
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:20,372
What's going on?

9
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:30,275
Nine Puzzles

10
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,377
Why did you come to work so early?

11
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:53,965
Ew, I smell booze.

12
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,219
Were you up late drinking last night?

13
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,388
I'm always here early.

14
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,973
How about you?

15
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,267
Looking at these red lines,

16
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,645
they know exactly
how the body was chopped up.

17
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:10,190
I think whoever sent these puzzle pieces
to me is probably the killer.

18
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,402
That info was classified, right?

19
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:15,862
What are you talking about?

20
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:19,408
This case was all over the news.
Would've been pretty simple to find out.

21
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:20,575
You're wrong.

22
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:23,203
These are the exact parts mentioned
in the autopsy report.

23
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,288
That kind of info doesn't make the news.

24
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,128
That's weird.

25
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,964
It looks like
they could've drawn over an older drawing.

26
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,465
I noticed that too.

27
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:36,716
And what that tells me…

28
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,053
is that Chimok Kang was
the real murderer's main target all along.

29
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,099
But why didn't they kill him
with their own hands?

30
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,518
You think they let him go?

31
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,020
Or maybe they enjoyed watching the guy?

32
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:51,231
Slow down a bit and let me think, okay?

33
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,943
One thing's for sure now though.

34
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,530
- What's that?
- That each one of these puzzle pieces

35
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:01,366
portrays one of the victims
of these serial killings.

36
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,327
The gun, the whisper,

37
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,455
and the armband.

38
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,001
You got a point though.

39
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,961
Why didn't they kill them in person?

40
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,714
Could it…

41
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,341
have to do with their motivation?

42
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:56,338
Good to see ya. How've you been doing?

43
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,012
It's good to see you too.

44
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,848
Honestly, I was getting
pretty bored in here.

45
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,275
What's that then?

46
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,029
I've never seen anything like that.

47
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,244
It does show the same exact spots
that I cut though.

48
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:32,999
Wait a minute.

49
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,335
Are you trying to tell me
that I wasn't the only one

50
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,087
who was out to murder my husband?

51
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,423
That's right.
Could you tell me if there was ever a time

52
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:43,051
that you felt as though
you were being watched or followed?

53
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:46,763
They seem to have known
that you were out to kill Mr. Kang.

54
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,306
They've been watching.

55
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,474
Whoa…

56
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,853
I had no idea that I had an audience.

57
00:05:58,692 --> 00:05:59,985
At the reservoir.

58
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,322
I had a feeling
that I wasn't alone up there.

59
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,244
But who was it?

60
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:39,107
One thing I'm damn good at
is noticing those tiny details.

61
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,446
Now how did you find that little suitcase?

62
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,656
I was pretty sure
no one would find it out there.

63
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,074
That wasn't the hard part.

64
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,327
There were some tread marks
at the entrance.

65
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:52,912
That's weird.

66
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,915
The two of us carried it there.

67
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:13,642
Yeah, I don't know man.
The police captain told me to wait.

68
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,686
- How long do you think this'll take?
- I dunno, could be a while.

69
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,188
- Hey, sir.
- Oh, hey, sir.

70
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,367
- What's the story?
- Hey.

71
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,206
Well, looking at the redness
of the mucous membrane

72
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,083
and the vomit around the mouth,

73
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,919
I'm guessing
the primary cause of death was poisoning.

74
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,629
'Round what time did he die?

75
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,507
I'd say between one and three
this morning.

76
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,801
He was already dead when the call came in.

77
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,599
Got it.
See if we get anything.

78
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,752
The gun, the whisper, and the armband…

79
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,798
What the hell are they trying to tell me?

80
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,633
Oh?

81
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,343
How you doing?

82
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,011
Has forensics finished up yet?

83
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,221
Just about.

84
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,515
Good.
Have your sessions been helping?

85
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,059
Just so you know,
Dr. Lee's better than Doc Hwang.

86
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:39,769
What?

87
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,896
Huh? Sessions?

88
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:43,982
What does she mean? What sessions?

89
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,942
Uh, I dunno what she's on about.

90
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,277
Huh?

91
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,117
Hey there. You guys doing all right?

92
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,871
You don't look too pleased.

93
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,123
Look who it is.

94
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,083
Oh, you're happy to see me.

95
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,503
Why are you here? Aren't you busy?

96
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:06,963
Yeah, why?

97
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,465
This is a pretty standard case.

98
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,383
We don't need a profiler.

99
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:13,094
Let's just say I'm here
to satisfy my curiosity.

100
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,888
Do you mind if I look around?

101
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:17,849
Is that allowed?

102
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,435
Where are those three
that drank with the victim?

103
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,103
<i>Yeah, our three guys.</i>

104
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,773
<i>The first one, who called the police,</i>
<i>is at the station now,</i>

105
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:25,982
<i>being interviewed by San.</i>

106
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,318
<i>And Youngha's gone to meet</i>
<i>with the other two.</i>

107
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,944
We've given all three a tox screen,

108
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,905
though they haven't shown
any symptoms yet.

109
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,865
I'm gonna check the camera footage.

110
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,450
Yeah, get the CCTV footage.

111
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,123
Curry Kim.

112
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,043
What's taking so long?

113
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,169
What do you mean?

114
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,338
Are you still not finished profiling me?

115
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,090
Am I really that hard to read?

116
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,717
Let's talk later, okay?

117
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,075
<i>There was only one entrance.</i>

118
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,370
<i>And the CCTV system</i>
<i>had a clear view of it.</i>

119
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,707
<i>The perfect sealed room.</i>

120
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,709
<i>And yet, a killer…</i>

121
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,419
<i>was able to poison someone.</i>

122
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,825
<i>Mm… Scratch that.</i>

123
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,411
<i>There were no poison containers</i>
<i>found at the scene.</i>

124
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,915
<i>The killer wouldn't have poisoned</i>
<i>the drink in front of people…</i>

125
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,919
<i>which means</i>
<i>they spiked the drink in advance.</i>

126
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:49,083
<i>They made the victim drink</i>
<i>the poisoned soju by himself.</i>

127
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,544
<i>He didn't suspect anything</i>
<i>or put up a fight.</i>

128
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,716
<i>They couldn't have done that,</i>
<i>not without a really solid plan.</i>

129
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,102
<i>Detailed and careful planning,</i>

130
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:09,771
<i>cold and calculated execution,</i>

131
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,689
<i>and a high degree of self-control.</i>

132
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,525
<i>All of these traits are a match…</i>

133
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:15,944
<i>for the Puzzle Killer.</i>

134
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,451
Hang on a minute.
Can you zoom in a little?

135
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,700
Are you able to fast-forward it?

136
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,430
Seems the only people in or out
were the three of them.

137
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,557
Let's go talk to them.

138
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,143
At first, I just thought he was sleeping.

139
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,062
When I woke up in the morning,
it was 8:00…

140
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,981
Uh, I mean, it was almost seven.

141
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,941
And, um, I shook him to wake him up.

142
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,443
We had to get to work.

143
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,111
But something wasn't right.

144
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,864
He wouldn't wake up,

145
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,116
so I reached out
and grabbed his hand, like this.

146
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,701
His hand was…

147
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:48,953
really cold.

148
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,913
So I was like, "What's going on?"

149
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:54,167
And took a closer look at his face.

150
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,668
That's when I noticed…

151
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,837
that he wasn't breathing, you know?

152
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,464
Then I called the cops, yeah.

153
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,591
Younghan returned to work yesterday,

154
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,678
so we all got together
for dinner and a drink.

155
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:09,807
Guess we started drinking around eight,
after we clocked out of work.

156
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,311
My wife didn't want me to stay out late.

157
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,773
I kept telling her that I was leaving,

158
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:20,068
and I got into a huge fight with her
on the phone.

159
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,321
Around 1:00 a.m.

160
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,700
Wanna know who bought drinks?

161
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:30,161
Yeah, I bought the <i>makgeolli.</i>

162
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,579
The soju as well.

163
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,457
I don't normally drink soju though.

164
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,752
I also bought some canned peaches,

165
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,879
kimchi, and some peanuts too.

166
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,380
Snacks, right?

167
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:44,926
Uh, then there was the instant noodles
all of us ate for dinner.

168
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,385
Jungchul brought those.

169
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,055
Um…

170
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,683
I don't, uh, remember exactly
what time it was.

171
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,853
But, um, when I got back
from the bathroom,

172
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,941
I saw that Younghan and Jungchul
were sleeping already.

173
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,235
Gabje wasn't around.

174
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:06,072
So, uh, since there was
no one left to drink with,

175
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,783
I… just went home.

176
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,619
And then, when I got to…

177
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:12,912
work in the morning…

178
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,582
they told me that Younghan…

179
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,837
was found dead.

180
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,589
So, like…

181
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:27,301
did someone poison him intentionally?

182
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,303
Their testimony does line up

183
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:32,140
with the CCTV footage
recorded at the scene.

184
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,560
So which one of 'em did it, hmm?

185
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,979
None of these guys
looked like they were lying.

186
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:41,983
Let's not forget that those guys worked
with Younghan Choi for more than a decade.

187
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,986
And yesterday was his first day back
after taking a year sabbatical.

188
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,947
Almost like they waited to kill him
till he came back.

189
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,491
How about his family?
You get ahold of 'em?

190
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,869
Uh, well…

191
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,912
His wife passed away five years ago.

192
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:57,623
And his son died last year,
so there was no one to contact.

193
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,959
So are you just giving up?

194
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,004
See if he's got a sibling
or some relatives.

195
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,006
- Get in touch with them.
- Yes, Captain.

196
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:07,675
Oh, come on.

197
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,928
Shouldn't the first people you call
when something bad happens be family?

198
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:12,513
That should be the way, right?

199
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:15,266
I'd call 911
if I found somebody unconscious.

200
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:16,767
Sure, I get that.

201
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:19,187
But he just found a body,
I betcha he called me first

202
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,647
because he wasn't thinking straight,
know what I mean?

203
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,191
Anyway, he called me on the phone

204
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,651
and kept telling me
that Younghan wouldn't wake up,

205
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,445
and that he didn't know what was wrong.

206
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,031
And then,
I told my husband to call the police,

207
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,991
and that's exactly when he called.

208
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,952
Look, my husband didn't do it.

209
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,120
Didn't do what?

210
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:41,167
All I'm saying is he doesn't have it
in him to harm someone else.

211
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,836
Aha, the cause of death
hasn't been released,

212
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,504
but you seem to know a lot.

213
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,506
I'm his wife, of course I know a lot.

214
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,218
What, did you think
he just kept me in the dark?

215
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,596
Oh, and I'd just like to add,
'cause you'll find out anyway.

216
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,307
It's true that my husband
borrowed money from Younghan,

217
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,309
but it's all been paid off now.

218
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,645
So I hope you don't get any wrong ideas.

219
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:03,064
Who told you about that, huh?

220
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:07,360
I betcha it was Gabje or Deokmun,
wasn't it?

221
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,694
Deokmun's a prick.

222
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,364
Yeah, it's true.

223
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,116
I borrowed a bunch of money
from Younghan, okay?

224
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,702
But I always paid him back every month.

225
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:19,038
I was down to, like, three million.
What d'ya think?

226
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,957
You think I killed someone over three mil?

227
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,501
Then why the hell would I've paid back
the seven million?

228
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,294
You think I'm an idiot, huh?

229
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,004
I really just wanna help you.

230
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:30,216
Look, obviously,
that asshole Deokmun is the one.

231
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,718
You said the soju was poisoned.
The soju, right?

232
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:35,846
Well, Deokmun was the one
who took it out of the fridge, 'kay?

233
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,390
And here's the kicker.

234
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,058
He didn't drink any!

235
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:43,271
And then, at some point,
that son of a bitch woke me up

236
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:45,106
just to say he was leaving.

237
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,567
I mean, he normally just leaves
when he gets too drunk.

238
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,110
Why the sudden change, huh?

239
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,403
Why, huh? Is it 'cause…

240
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:53,155
he needed a fucking alibi
or whatever the fuck you call that?

241
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,491
Oh, fuck this shit, I mean… I swear! 'Kay?

242
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:59,120
He was the fucking one
who put this whole goddamn night together!

243
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,706
Ah, shit, I'm so fucking pissed right now!

244
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,457
Do you know this guy?

245
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,543
Yeah, I do. That's Mr. Lee.

246
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,296
Yesterday, he bought some soju,

247
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,799
three bottles of <i>makgeolli,</i>
some pig trotters,

248
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,634
some kimchi, and a few other things.

249
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:16,679
How do you remember it so well?
Did you pick it all out yourself?

250
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,222
Hey, it was only yesterday.

251
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,974
That dude comes in here a lot.

252
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:22,643
He normally just buys <i>makgeolli</i>

253
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,270
without any snacks, but…

254
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:27,189
he bought snacks and soju yesterday.

255
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,526
So I thought to myself, uh…
"What's his deal?"

256
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,861
What time did he come by?

257
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,447
Gimme a sec. Lemme have a look.

258
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,368
He was here at 7:42 p.m.

259
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,787
Oh, he bought a bunch of other stuff.

260
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,331
Peanuts, peaches,

261
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:44,915
lip balm, and wet wipes.

262
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,585
Didn't Deokmun arrive at…

263
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,087
the break room at around 20:16 or so?

264
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:51,255
That's right.

265
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:56,177
It took him 34 minutes to get there?
It's a five-minute walk.

266
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,350
Captain, we have the cause of death.

267
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:04,602
Apparently, it was nicotine poisoning.

268
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,020
Nicotine?

269
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:10,441
Yeah, anything above a 3.7-milligram
blood-nicotine level is lethal,

270
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:13,486
and tox showed
his level was higher than 5.9.

271
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,197
And they found traces of nicotine
in the soju bottle.

272
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,240
As for Deokmun, Jungchul, and Gabje,

273
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,534
their tox screenings
all came back negative.

274
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:21,952
The hospital just told us.

275
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:26,040
That means… that Younghan was
the only one who consumed the nicotine.

276
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,334
Yeah, it sure looks that way.

277
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,839
Uh… Gabje Kim smokes though.
He smokes e-cigarettes.

278
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:36,175
Yeah.

279
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,636
His brother-in-law owns a vape shop,
doesn't he?

280
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:42,264
All right, let's just think about it
a second, 'kay?

281
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:46,227
Okay, let's just say, uh…

282
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,855
Let's just say I really did it.
I wanted to kill Younghan, 'kay?

283
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:53,192
Pretend you're me for a second, detective.
Would you use nicotine to do it?

284
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,195
Most killers gravitate towards tools
they're used to using.

285
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:02,827
I just didn't do it!

286
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,038
I was seriously just going to show up
to say hi and then leave.

287
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,624
Look, the only reason
that I ended up staying there late

288
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,334
was 'cause Younghan asked me to.

289
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,512
Hang on a minute.

290
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:24,724
You should talk to Jungchul.

291
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:28,144
Younghan lent him some money recently.

292
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,937
I bet he hasn't paid him back.

293
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:32,898
They were together until the end.

294
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,358
To sum things up,

295
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:37,737
we know that Gabje made a bulk order
of nicotine about a month ago.

296
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,489
And Jungchul was with the victim
till the very end

297
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,158
and had financial dealings with him.

298
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,869
Deokmun has a 34-minute gap in the day,

299
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,413
and he took the poisoned soju
out of the fridge,

300
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,373
yet chose not to drink
any of it that night.

301
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,876
Gabje suspects Jungchul of foul play,

302
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,170
and Jungchul suspects Deokmun. Is that it?

303
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,131
Deokmun did it.

304
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,008
Look…

305
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:02,636
I think we could all agree
that the soju is what killed the guy,

306
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,681
and Deokmun Lee was the only one
who had anything to do with it.

307
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:08,184
He purchased the soju,
he brought the soju,

308
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,436
he served it, and he didn't drink it.

309
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,856
- I'll have to go with Sukwang on this one.
- Right.

310
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,150
Besides, those 34 minutes really bug me.

311
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,694
We can't find anyone
who met with him or anything.

312
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,029
Hey.

313
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,865
Yeah, but…

314
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,909
…what was Deokmun's motive?

315
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,410
Huh?

316
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,579
I agree, he's a prime suspect,

317
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:31,332
and I agree
that the missing 34 minutes is suspicious,

318
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,500
but what was his motive?

319
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:35,961
Younghan Choi may have been an introvert,

320
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:38,631
but he took good care of his friends
and the people he knew.

321
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,841
He even gave them
New Year's presents every year.

322
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:43,969
We know Deokmun looked up to him
'cause they were from the same town.

323
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:46,222
The two of them didn't have any bad blood.

324
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,266
Did Lieutenant Yoon say anything,
motive-wise?

325
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,185
I'm curious 'cause she came by.

326
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,561
You punk!

327
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,688
Why would you even ask that?

328
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,190
All we gotta do to end this

329
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,859
is to find the evidence
and get the perp to confess.

330
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,237
You're a detective, not a… profiler.

331
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,158
I just don't see a motive.

332
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,745
When do we not see the motive?

333
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:12,039
When we don't have enough evidence
to work with?

334
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,333
Wrong, that's not the answer.

335
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,752
Since when did she need any evidence?

336
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,587
She solves the case at the crime scene.

337
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:22,258
Could there have been something off
with the crime scene?

338
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,553
Wrong, that's not the answer either.

339
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,182
There's no such thing
as an "off" crime scene

340
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:31,851
unless it's been tampered with.

341
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,941
You're right.

342
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:42,444
I guess this could be similar
to the Chimok Kang case.

343
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:45,364
A scene that's been tampered with.

344
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,324
Captain,

345
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,535
you're a genius.

346
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,288
You just figured that out?

347
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,312
Curry Kim, what are you doing here?

348
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,938
I figured you might show up.

349
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,946
Do you know why people kill other people?

350
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:29,033
Some people kill because a stranger
they just met a minute ago

351
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,910
won't lend them 1,000 won,

352
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:33,454
and some kill 'cause the laughter
of a stranger they hear

353
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,873
while out on a stroll
rubs them the wrong way.

354
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,084
Do you think
one of our three suspects is the killer?

355
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,712
Are you saying they're not?

356
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:43,797
Motive.

357
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,842
Oh, there might not have been one.

358
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:50,137
So… you're telling me
the killer had no motive

359
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,222
when they made the victim
drink poisoned soju?

360
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,809
The motive might not be clear,
but there had to have been one.

361
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,853
You're a smart cookie.

362
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,814
You've read some detective novels?

363
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:06,362
You ever read the Agatha Christie novel,
<i>Crooked House?</i>

364
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,155
No.

365
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:11,408
Well, in that story, there's a murder
in a sealed room just like this,

366
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:14,870
and every family member on the scene
has a strong motive to do the deed.

367
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,581
Can you guess who it was
who killed the grandpa?

368
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:19,291
I shouldn't tell you, it'll spoil it.

369
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,751
Out with it.

370
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,252
I won't read it anyway.

371
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,715
The 12-year-old granddaughter
was the killer.

372
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,802
Her motive had been obscured by her age.

373
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,054
Someone who was beyond suspicion
turned out…

374
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:34,014
to be the killer.

375
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,766
How cliché.

376
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,520
Nowadays, there are a lot of cases
where the killer is a kid.

377
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:42,147
I guess it's just an old book.

378
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:43,941
Then how about this one?

379
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,945
<i>The Murders in the Rue Morgue.</i>

380
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:50,948
The very first detective story,
published in 1841

381
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,700
and written by Edgar Allen Poe.

382
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:55,995
Who was the killer
in that sealed room mystery?

383
00:24:57,955 --> 00:24:59,164
An orangutan.

384
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,336
I've thought this for a while.

385
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,505
I think you're losing it.

386
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,757
You're missing the point.

387
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,968
All I'm trying to tell you
is that homicide cases

388
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,678
can often be unpredictable like that.

389
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,890
Did you get another puzzle piece?

390
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:18,142
Come this way.

391
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,145
Where are you going?

392
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,787
Hey, what's with the…

393
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:47,880
Gabje Kim

394
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,136
There.

395
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,763
"Gabje Kim"

396
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:57,014
Now then…

397
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:58,682
Mr. Gabje…

398
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,185
why did you kill Mr. Choi?

399
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:03,729
Come on, what the hell are we doing here?

400
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:06,065
Why did you kill Younghan?

401
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:13,238
If I were Gabje, you mean?

402
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:19,828
I guess it's because…

403
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:22,539
So I got a promotion…

404
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:25,626
later than Younghan did. Shoot.

405
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:28,087
I mean, I joined the company
earlier than he did.

406
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,422
Do you think
Younghan rubbed that in his face?

407
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:32,883
I'd guess not,
knowing Younghan's personality.

408
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:33,967
Then again…

409
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:37,513
maybe, um, I may have had a slight
inferiority complex towards the guy.

410
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:39,807
Just like Hansaem Kim?

411
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,225
Mm-hmm.

412
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,684
Whoa, don't do that!

413
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,603
I don't have an inferiority complex.

414
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,980
Inferiority complex or not,

415
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:49,024
he's not someone
who would have acted on it.

416
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:51,276
We're talking about a dude
who's so indecisive

417
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,946
that he has to call his wife to ask
what to have for lunch.

418
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,448
Aside from that,
Younghan was the only person

419
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:58,784
who recommended Gabje for a promotion.

420
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,702
There was nothing for him to gain.

421
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:01,954
There's no motive here.

422
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:05,415
"Jungchul Yeo"

423
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:17,761
Now Jungchul… Hmm, let's see…

424
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,513
Money issues.

425
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,600
You've seen my transaction history,
I've only got 3 million in the bank!

426
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:24,685
I'm innocent, okay?

427
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:28,313
Hmm.

428
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:31,024
I just don't think
that's enough of a motive.

429
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:33,944
It's not like he didn't work
to pay the man back or anything.

430
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:36,446
The money isn't the issue here.

431
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:39,157
Maybe if there were emotions
attached to the cash.

432
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:42,619
Although, Younghan wasn't the kind of guy
that would've nagged him.

433
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:44,872
I guess he didn't even
charge interest, right?

434
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,207
That leaves us…

435
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,296
with the man your team considers
to be the prime suspect.

436
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:54,882
Deokmun Lee.

437
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,384
Anyone would assume
I'm the guy who did it.

438
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:59,720
I'm the only one
who didn't drink the soju.

439
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,639
I took the soju bottle containing nicotine
out of the fridge.

440
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:06,602
Also… my missing 34 minutes.

441
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:08,478
Want to know…

442
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:11,273
…what it was I was doing?

443
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,733
What the heck?

444
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:14,985
What are you doing?

445
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,411
Are you implying
he met his mistress or something?

446
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,040
That's wassup!

447
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:31,960
I went to visit my mistress,
who also works at the factory.

448
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:34,212
That's why I got the lip balm,

449
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:36,757
and also why I didn't wear
my wedding ring that day.

450
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,841
You following?

451
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,094
What are you, a PI?

452
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:44,056
How the heck do you know
he was having an affair?

453
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,893
Do you think
Younghan knew about their relationship?

454
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:51,188
He may have told him to stop seeing her,

455
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,690
and then Deokmun got angry
with him for saying that.

456
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:58,111
But then if we were to consider
how impulsive Deokmun Lee is,

457
00:28:58,195 --> 00:29:00,572
we would certainly have seen
signs at the scene.

458
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:03,325
However… there weren't any.

459
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:05,410
So he didn't do it.

460
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,751
So did you get a puzzle piece or not?
Can you answer that?

461
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:22,177
Detailed and careful planning,
calculated execution,

462
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,595
and a lot of self-control.

463
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,765
All of these traits match
the puzzle murder suspect.

464
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:28,308
That checks out.

465
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:31,019
Uh-huh. So did you get one or not?

466
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:33,689
Hang on…

467
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:37,109
That soju bottle with the nicotine in it…

468
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:40,028
How long do you think
it had been sitting in the fridge?

469
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:43,907
I've no idea.

470
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,660
The security footage gets deleted
every week.

471
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:50,330
I'm just wondering what the chances are
that the bottle could've been, uh…

472
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:52,332
somehow put in the fridge in advance.

473
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:55,419
What if there was a trap being laid
for the three of them…

474
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,587
trying to get them to suspect each other?

475
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,884
We shouldn't be looking at these three.

476
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:04,469
The cause of death is elsewhere.

477
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:06,304
I think we should expand our search.

478
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:09,766
I think that Deokmun, Jungchul,
and Gabje are quite lucky

479
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,810
because Younghan died in their place.

480
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,439
Are you saying
that the wrong person might've died?

481
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:19,109
All I'm saying is
we shouldn't rule anything out.

482
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:21,862
The killer might've born a grudge
against all four men.

483
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,071
That could also be true.

484
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,954
Hey, did they pay you for yesterday?

485
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:33,457
Yeah, they paid enough.
Took my girl out to dinner.

486
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,083
The boss really paid you that much?

487
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,927
Besides the victim and the three suspects,

488
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:48,847
there's one other person
that's been in and out of the break room

489
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,182
over the past seven days.

490
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,851
The janitor, Mr. Yeom.

491
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:56,688
Look at this.

492
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:59,274
He went in five days ago.

493
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,359
Again, three days ago.

494
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:03,445
And even the day before.

495
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,701
I wonder what he's got
in the bucket on the cart.

496
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:13,747
Apparently, he hated that those guys
would party together in the break room.

497
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,041
It used to be dorm lodging
for the foreign workers,

498
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,877
but they were using it as a break room
because it was vacant.

499
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,545
Now Jungchul told me

500
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:23,715
that he ran into Mr. Yeom
on the morning of the incident,

501
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,425
and Mr. Yeom said…

502
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:27,844
"You seem fine."

503
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:33,892
I noticed
you went in and out of the break room.

504
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:38,396
'Course I did, it's my job.

505
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:40,315
Why's that weird?

506
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,151
I'm a janitor, that's what I do.

507
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:46,738
Uh, what was in that bucket on the cart?
Aside from your cleaning tools.

508
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:49,533
There was nothing in there
but cleaning tools.

509
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,828
A little while back,
you bought some nicotine.

510
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,123
So what?

511
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,501
I smoke a vape while I'm at work.

512
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,631
See?

513
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:06,758
Mr. Choi gave it to me.

514
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:10,637
Mr. Kim's brother-in-law.

515
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:15,308
He opened an e-cigarette store,
so Mr. Choi bought one of these.

516
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,937
But then, he told me he doesn't smoke.

517
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:21,106
And he gave it to me.

518
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,150
He told me I should try it.

519
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:26,153
Is it true you didn't like it
when people drank in the break room?

520
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,282
I still don't like it.

521
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,201
But you know…

522
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:35,829
it's just part of my job.

523
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:38,373
On the morning that Mr. Choi was killed,

524
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,917
you came across Mr. Yeo.

525
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:42,878
Why did you say, "You seem fine," to him?

526
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,839
I said that
'cause I rarely saw him that way.

527
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,091
Most days, he was badly hungover.

528
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:49,676
He looked really awful to me.

529
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:56,516
I don't know what those three men
told you about anything,

530
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:58,852
but it wasn't me.

531
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:04,024
Mr. Choi was a really good man.

532
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,402
I didn't kill him, I swear.

533
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:13,783
Say, uh…

534
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:19,789
anyone ever tell you guys about
what happened a year ago at the factory?

535
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,926
What's bothering you so much?

536
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,058
If I…

537
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:40,393
decided to kill you right now…

538
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,355
what's my motive?

539
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:44,773
Kill me?

540
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:47,400
Right now?

541
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:53,573
Kill me. Huh…

542
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:55,075
I guess that'd be…

543
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:56,576
curiosity?

544
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,371
You can see that?

545
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:02,123
I know what kind of person you are,
Ms. Yoon.

546
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,419
Well, why can't I see the motive?

547
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,296
It's hiding from me.

548
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:12,342
Leaving traces of one's crime
at a crime scene is inevitable.

549
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,552
Even if a killer tried
to clean up the scene,

550
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:16,471
we would be able to learn something.

551
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,266
So why…

552
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,102
What kind of person was the victim?

553
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:25,522
It seems to me that…

554
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:29,234
you've always… looked at your cases
from the side of the aggressor.

555
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:32,529
This time,
try looking from the other side.

556
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:36,992
Put yourself in the victim's shoes
and look the culprit in the eyes.

557
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:41,162
The culprit… had no motive to kill me.

558
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,415
So why'd I end up dead?

559
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:48,086
Was that person
even the culprit to begin with?

560
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,968
Maybe it's time to return to square one.

561
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:02,350
Details on victim

562
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:13,612
2022 January 18,
death of son Dongkyung Choi

563
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,615
That was it.

564
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:21,077
We should've focused on that
from the start.

565
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:25,040
Mr. Choi's son died a year ago.

566
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,374
Why didn't you tell me that?

567
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,378
Does that, um…

568
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,173
give you an idea?

569
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:52,919
For a single man in his fifties,
living all by himself,

570
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,754
this house is too clean to me.

571
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,924
It's so clean that it's weird.

572
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:01,511
Yeah, this place is
a whole other level of tidy.

573
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:05,557
Everything's been… arranged meticulously.

574
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:08,351
It seems like
he was getting ready to go on a trip.

575
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:10,562
That's a strong observation, Curry Kim.

576
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:13,148
You pick that up from one of your novels?

577
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:18,403
My curry friend's house
was just like this.

578
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:21,740
That friend also lived alone
without any family.

579
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,410
They tried committing suicide.

580
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,735
It was all an act, wasn't it?

581
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,572
I guess…

582
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,741
the victim did have a motive in the end.

583
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:11,623
You said Younghan's son
died a year ago, right?

584
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,125
Try asking those three men about it.

585
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:18,254
Ask them why Younghan Choi
might have wanted the three of them dead.

586
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,609
I called you all here
'cause I wanted to ask you something.

587
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:46,157
Was there anything that would've made
Mr. Choi want to kill the three of you?

588
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:53,832
You got nothing to say?

589
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:55,875
Fine.

590
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,504
Let me ask again.

591
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,298
How are the three of you linked

592
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:04,926
to the death
of Mr. Younghan Choi's only son?

593
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,636
Dongkyung died a year ago, right?

594
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:11,516
Mr. Yeom's already filled me in a little,
but I'd like to hear it from you.

595
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:18,648
What happened at the factory last winter?

596
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:29,409
- I look forward to working with you.
- Thanks.

597
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,035
Hey, all right.

598
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,205
I told him to relax till he gets
to college, but he won't listen.

599
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:35,748
Yeah, well…

600
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:38,543
I think it's cool
he wants to work to pay for college.

601
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,086
You know, he's gonna go far.

602
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,131
- Thanks for the drink.
- You're welcome.

603
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,341
I heard you nailed your entrance exam.

604
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:46,426
Wow.

605
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,678
Younghan, this kid must be
your pride and joy.

606
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,263
Hey, you owe us a drink.

607
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,514
All right.

608
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:54,100
- For real, you owe us a drink.
- Yeah, okay, fine!

609
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,494
Hurry!

610
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,705
Over here! Hurry!

611
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,999
<i>Mr. Choi wasn't at the factory that day.</i>

612
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,375
<i>He was away on business.</i>

613
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:23,212
<i>There's an accident and Mr. Choi's son</i>
<i>was taken to the hospital.</i>

614
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,924
<i>But by the time the ambulance</i>
<i>could get him to the hospital,</i>

615
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:27,175
<i>it was too late.</i>

616
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,593
<i>The kid was dead.</i>

617
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:32,221
<i>They said that he got caught</i>
<i>in the conveyor belt.</i>

618
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:36,601
<i>But exactly what happened</i>
<i>and how it all went down,</i>

619
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,227
<i>I'm not entirely sure.</i>

620
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,271
<i>Those three guys?</i>

621
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:42,273
<i>They were there. They should know.</i>

622
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,696
- You can handle this, right?
- Yeah, sure.

623
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:52,617
Uh… are you sure
I just use this broom to do it?

624
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,826
That's what we do.

625
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,912
Yeah, you just need to nudge it
with the broom

626
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,705
so it doesn't get stuck in the machine.

627
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,540
- And try not to break it.
- Okay, got it.

628
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:03,836
- Get to it then.
- Okay.

629
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,964
I'm coming, okay?

630
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:07,507
Yeah, you guys get started.

631
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:09,050
What's that?

632
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,929
Whoa, kimchi, pig trotters, and <i>makgeolli?</i>
Sounds great!

633
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:34,617
- Hey, get over here.
- All right.

634
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:36,828
- Come here!
- Let's do it!

635
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,830
It's still warm. Yeah, come on.

636
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,206
- Here.
- Ah…

637
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,582
Good work, you two.

638
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,001
- There. Cheers.
- Yeah.

639
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:44,544
All right.

640
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,881
Ah, that's good.

641
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:53,011
Oh, shit!

642
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:54,095
Dongkyung!

643
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,764
What the hell happened?

644
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,560
What happened?

645
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:03,521
- What do we do?
- Shut it down! Go!

646
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,068
Hurry up and pull!

647
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:11,487
It's stuck!
It won't come out!

648
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:15,033
Dongkyung!

649
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,369
Ah, Jesus, how did this happen?

650
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:19,620
Hey, man!

651
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:22,040
How could you leave
this kid unsupervised, huh?

652
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:24,709
Oh, God, I'm gonna call 911. Oh, Jesus…

653
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:25,793
Ah, shit.

654
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:27,003
- Wait, hold up.
- Come on!

655
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:29,630
We should call the boss first.

656
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:31,215
Why should we do that?

657
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:34,969
Remember the last time we had an accident?
Hassan, that Pakistani kid, you remember?

658
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:38,097
The boss told us
not to make any decisions at all.

659
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,892
He told us to report everything in first,
remember?

660
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,769
Oh. Oh, yeah, you're right.

661
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:44,896
- Call the boss right now.
- Okay, I'll call him.

662
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,481
Shit! What do we do?

663
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,858
Should we try to pull him out?
Huh? What d'ya think?

664
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:51,527
Whoa, don't touch him.
My God! That's dangerous.

665
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:53,696
The boss isn't picking up. What do we do?

666
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,531
Shit!

667
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,366
He's not answering.

668
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:00,787
Look, we didn't leave our stations,
all right?

669
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:03,372
- And we were working with the kid.
- Yeah, uh-huh.

670
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:05,124
We're all fucked otherwise.

671
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:06,626
- Okay.
- Yeah.

672
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,044
It was quick.

673
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:09,462
The kid got careless, okay?

674
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,130
- We did nothing wrong, 'kay?
- Right.

675
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:23,851
Did Mr. Choi ever blackmail you
regarding this?

676
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:25,895
Did he ask you for money?

677
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:29,690
No.

678
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:33,236
Younghan knew that it was an accident.

679
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,238
It wasn't just an accident!

680
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:37,824
You think Younghan didn't know that?

681
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:44,163
I've been wondering why he died
on the day he returned to his job.

682
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:47,125
Originally, I thought
that one of you three

683
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:48,626
had been waiting for that day.

684
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,796
When, actually, it was Younghan
who had been waiting.

685
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:54,090
What do you mean by that?

686
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:56,425
Younghan must have been
so angry with you three.

687
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,220
I bet he wanted you all dead.

688
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:02,014
If you guys hadn't left his son
alone unsupervised,

689
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:03,641
he wouldn't have had an accident.

690
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,560
If you had only called 911 first…

691
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:11,107
then maybe he wouldn't have downed
a glass of soju laced with nicotine.

692
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:19,115
Younghan…

693
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:00,948
Stop half-assing
everything you do, it's annoying.

694
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:02,408
Just step off, man.

695
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,745
Ugh…

696
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:07,914
Have a drink.

697
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:13,419
We're all out.

698
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,340
I told her I'd leave soon.

699
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:20,384
I need to take this.

700
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:24,555
Hey.

701
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:27,058
I told ya I'm coming home soon.

702
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,477
I'll go grab some more alcohol.

703
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,103
I could use the fresh air.

704
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:34,815
I think there's, uh,
some soju in the fridge.

705
00:45:35,775 --> 00:45:37,109
Let's just drink that.

706
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:40,446
There is? Really?

707
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,667
Ah, sweet.

708
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:58,339
Here, you go ahead.

709
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,549
I just need to take a leak. Be right back.

710
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:07,510
He looked too clean
for someone who drank the night away.

711
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,595
Then I went to his house,
that's when I knew.

712
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:12,014
That's what confirmed it.
His house was the same way.

713
00:48:12,098 --> 00:48:15,434
It was tidied up like he was never
coming back from where he was going.

714
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:18,020
I mean, how would any of that matter
once you're dead?

715
00:48:18,104 --> 00:48:19,522
Why would anyone care, you know?

716
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:22,775
Younghan Choi's house…

717
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:25,152
was like a stage set for a play.

718
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:27,905
There wasn't even a family photo
hung up on the wall in there,

719
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:31,409
but there was a photo of the four of them
stuck on the mirror above the dresser

720
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:35,496
as if to draw the audience's attention
by shining a spotlight on that spot.

721
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,915
So stupid, isn't it?

722
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:40,459
Did he really think
that he could fool us with all that?

723
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:41,961
I mean…

724
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:43,712
he could have just killed them all.

725
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:45,381
Why did he kill himself instead?

726
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:48,384
Besides, if he wanted
to pin the murder on them so badly,

727
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,678
why not come up with a much better plan?

728
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:52,555
Right?

729
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,807
I just don't understand
the point of it all.

730
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:56,934
Ms. Ena.

731
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:59,937
Calm down.

732
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:06,694
I've never seen you
get so worked up before.

733
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,155
What is it
that's making you get this angry?

734
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:10,948
All of it!

735
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:13,534
Hmm…

736
00:49:14,535 --> 00:49:16,495
Sometimes, when people

737
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:18,622
get stuck in a tough situation,

738
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:22,334
they may kill other people,
or they may do harm to themselves.

739
00:49:25,546 --> 00:49:27,506
This man was the latter type.

740
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:30,176
He killed himself
because he couldn't kill someone else.

741
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:33,762
He could have taken
everyone else out with him though.

742
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:36,599
I don't understand
why he chose to only take himself out.

743
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:39,393
I'd say that he wanted
the three of them to…

744
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:41,270
suspect each other and go to jail.

745
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:45,983
I imagine he was hoping those three men
would be branded as killers.

746
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:49,445
And I'm guessing that he didn't want this
to be seen as vengeance.

747
00:49:50,029 --> 00:49:53,282
As far as Younghan was concerned,
those men were murderers.

748
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:58,245
I hear you,
but I still can't wrap my head around it.

749
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:04,543
Mr. Choi was…
a man with quite a soft heart.

750
00:50:04,627 --> 00:50:06,837
I mean, he probably
didn't have the courage

751
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:08,672
to watch those men meet their end.

752
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:10,841
Just like you.

753
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:14,595
I'm not soft.

754
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:18,140
You may put on a tough front,
but you've got a soft heart.

755
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:20,976
I absolutely do not.

756
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:25,189
All right then.
Let's just say that you don't.

757
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:28,651
You should go.
I have a dinner appointment to get to.

758
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:59,723
Am I playing Mr. Choi this time or what?

759
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:07,398
Sit down.

760
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:13,320
Who would've thought it'd be suicide?

761
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:20,327
I thought this kinda stuff only happens
in John Dickson Carr novels.

762
00:51:55,738 --> 00:51:58,240
I heard when folks
are in a tough situation,

763
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:01,035
some of them kill other people,

764
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:03,537
and some folks choose to kill themselves.

765
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,165
What do you think I would do?

766
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:14,632
You've been watching me for a while now.

767
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:16,967
Are you still not totally convinced?

768
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,971
I've got a soft heart, you know?

769
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:29,271
Tell me now. Answer.

770
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:19,697
And you answered me correctly.

771
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:22,825
I'll show you now. Check it!

772
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:36,547
When did you get this piece?

773
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:40,926
Wait…

774
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:42,761
Chimok Kang was cut up like that.

775
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:44,513
How did they know that?

776
00:53:45,431 --> 00:53:47,766
Maybe 'cause the killer is around us.

777
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:50,519
We should probably ask them
when we see them.

778
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:53,689
Why was it
that they let Yanghee take the kill?

779
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:59,528
The sender of the puzzle pieces
is definitely someone who kills others.

780
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:01,488
How do you suppose they got to this point?

781
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:03,824
What do you think
drove them over the edge?

782
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:05,784
Why are the people in the puzzle

783
00:54:05,868 --> 00:54:08,454
shooting at little human-shaped dolls

784
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:11,498
or holding cotton candy
and smiling while whispering?

785
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:14,501
Why are they dancing
while wearing armbands?

786
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:17,212
Is it that…

787
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:20,090
the three of them weren't victims at all,

788
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,384
but culprits instead?

789
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:24,845
Like the case this time.

790
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:29,767
What?

791
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:32,686
What if Donghoon Yoon, Miyoung Lee,
and Chimok Kang…

792
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,605
committed a crime?

793
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:38,317
What if there's a case out there
where they're the culprits?

794
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,446
And what if there are even more culprits

795
00:54:43,155 --> 00:54:44,490
to be revealed?

796
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,961
We've only got three pieces of the puzzle.

797
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:00,964
But we could end up with six

798
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:02,883
or maybe nine of them.

799
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:09,723
You never know…

800
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:11,892
we could get a lot more.
