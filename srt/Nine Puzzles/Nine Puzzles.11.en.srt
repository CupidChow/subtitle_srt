1
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:14,306
20 years ago

2
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:19,269
Dream Land

3
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:50,092
Ms. Seungjoo Lee?

4
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,260
"10 years ago"

5
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:52,386
Ms. Seungjoo Lee?

6
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:03,855
Hansung University Hospital

7
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:14,700
These are yours.

8
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,952
They once belonged to your mother.

9
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,049
You changed your name
so finding you took me a while.

10
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,093
My apologies.

11
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:55,449
If these were hers, why do you have them?

12
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:01,747
And how…

13
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,791
How do you know my mother then?

14
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,128
We were colleagues.

15
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,256
I worked in a restaurant
with her 10 years ago.

16
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:13,884
I want you to know…

17
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,471
Namsuk wanted to find you, no matter what.

18
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:24,436
So do you know
where my mother is right now?

19
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:34,673
Nine Puzzles

20
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,352
Ena.

21
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,778
Can you turn around?

22
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,711
I don't think you'll be needing
any further counseling.

23
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,840
That's right.

24
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,136
This was the face I saw.

25
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:22,637
Yes, you're right.

26
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,473
It was me.

27
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,852
I guess it was really entertaining…

28
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:33,565
watching me doubt myself
and try to remember.

29
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:37,527
Watching me struggle to solve the meaning
of the puzzle pieces you left behind.

30
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,029
I guess that was a lot of fun.

31
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,158
Not really.

32
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,410
It was quite the opposite.

33
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,662
I was trying to…

34
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:50,457
allow you to get close,
but not close enough.

35
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,253
You did a very nice job, Ms. Yoon.

36
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:57,255
Really good work.

37
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,180
So who's the next victim?

38
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,807
Muryong Kim?

39
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:08,975
Why don't you come along

40
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,061
and I'll tell you?

41
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,026
This is fun.

42
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:20,821
You must be a little curious

43
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:22,948
who the last one is?

44
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,285
They're still alive?

45
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,249
Let's find out.

46
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:37,796
Oh.

47
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:39,923
I suppose…

48
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,593
you could arrest me instead.

49
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,262
Or maybe you'd…

50
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,182
prefer to kill me.

51
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:41,902
Hansaem Kim

52
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:08,345
Hansaem Kim

53
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,809
<i>The number you have called…</i>

54
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,936
Hansaem's gonna come looking for me.

55
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,855
I don't wanna be interrupted.

56
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,288
Commander.

57
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,624
Uh, I haven't been able
to reach Ena for a while.

58
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,919
She went to go pick up a document,
but I haven't seen her since.

59
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,927
Did you know that no one knew?

60
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,806
No one was curious at all

61
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,767
as to why the victim was murdered

62
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,020
or what the meaning of the puzzle was.

63
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,775
If no one was curious, then why even try?

64
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,819
So I stopped killing.

65
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,281
But then I ran back into you, Ena.

66
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:20,208
Imagine my surprise when I saw
the child I left behind that day

67
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,086
reappear before my eyes.

68
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:30,969
Why didn't you kill me then?

69
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:32,804
You did nothing wrong.

70
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,681
Why would I want to kill you?

71
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:38,393
Captain Jungho also didn't do
anything wrong,

72
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,603
and he ended up dead 'cause of you.

73
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,273
It wasn't me who fired the gun though.

74
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:52,949
That handkerchief…

75
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,076
It once belonged to my mother.

76
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,369
Did you know that?

77
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,469
We wanted you to live a normal life
like everyone else.

78
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,305
I did.

79
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,892
And so did your mother.

80
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,106
You should go skiing.

81
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,027
Spend some time at the ocean.

82
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:35,116
And maybe enjoy Christmas
together with your friends.

83
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,415
Please stop, Seungjoo.

84
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,837
I really have no idea
what you're talking about right now.

85
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,931
You can speak freely.

86
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,600
I'm not recording any of this.

87
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,688
Will getting back at them change anything?

88
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,114
Then why do you bother
helping those children?

89
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,158
Do you really think
that's gonna change anything?

90
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,368
Yes.

91
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,078
It really does.

92
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,789
I just have to believe it does.

93
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:27,836
Live your own life.

94
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,130
Just like those children do.

95
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,759
It's too late for me.

96
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,638
Here's what I suggest.

97
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:42,142
You should return to what you were doing.

98
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:48,273
The life that you've lived
must have been full of misery and hurt.

99
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,400
I understand that.

100
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,236
You must hate the world.

101
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,363
I was like that.

102
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,121
You "understand," do you?

103
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:06,416
How can you?

104
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:19,804
You're right.

105
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,850
I can't understand completely.

106
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,690
Though I do understand
the anger and pain you have inside.

107
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,573
I grew up in an orphanage
just like you did.

108
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,536
It is not too late.

109
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,956
Look, I can take care of everything.

110
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,459
So let it go

111
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,628
and start living.

112
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,339
How are you gonna take care of everything?

113
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,176
This is the life that I want.

114
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,266
Why did I have to come looking for you?

115
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,686
The fault is mine.

116
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,399
Since I'm the one who started it,

117
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:16,486
I should end it all
by telling the world about it.

118
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,447
That is what you want, is it not?

119
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,828
Stop, please.

120
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,920
No,
this is not what I wanted at all!

121
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,512
Why in the world are you doing this?

122
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,642
Would things have gone differently?

123
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,812
If your mother hadn't taken
Captain Yang in

124
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,397
when he had nowhere to go…

125
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,861
do you think he would've died
instead of your mother?

126
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,238
Could that have happened?

127
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,452
What if he never found you
because you changed your name?

128
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,414
Would it be different?

129
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,126
Would this story
have played out another way?

130
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,005
You know, Jungho often wondered
exactly the same thing.

131
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:20,675
What if, what if, what if…

132
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,139
No.

133
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,142
This story was written this way.

134
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,148
How about we go see the city lights?

135
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,217
Hansaem Kim

136
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,097
<i>We've put out an APB</i>
<i>for Lieutenant Yoon's vehicle.</i>

137
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,099
<i>We know the route they took</i>
<i>till Dumugae Road.</i>

138
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,684
<i>We're trying to figure out</i>
<i>where they went.</i>

139
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:14,187
But why the hell was
Lieutenant Yoon kidnapped?

140
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,981
Do you think, maybe,
she's the final piece of the puzzle?

141
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:18,399
She's not.

142
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,526
Ena's got nothing to do with the puzzle.

143
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,903
<i>So then why?</i>

144
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,074
If they went that way…

145
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:28,951
The One City.

146
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,746
They're going to The One City.

147
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:33,706
Are you sure about that?

148
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,166
That's where they're going.

149
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:37,877
It's where this all began.

150
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,463
That place is built
on the ashes of Shindonga Market.

151
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,716
She's trying to end it there.

152
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:33,057
Aren't you going to ask why I killed them?

153
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:37,311
Wasn't there any other way?

154
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,940
And what other way was that?

155
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:47,989
I mean…

156
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,491
none of them ever apologized.

157
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,243
Not a single one.

158
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,372
You'd think at least one of them
would've apologized

159
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,207
even just to beg for mercy.

160
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,210
No.

161
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,545
None of them ever did.

162
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:04,547
Why?

163
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,761
It's because they forgot

164
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:13,514
that Namsuk Lee… existed.

165
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,187
So that's why you're killing people?

166
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,862
Where are the victims?

167
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,655
That's why we're here.

168
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,159
Unit number 5802.

169
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,746
The next piece is there.

170
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:08,694
Muryong Kim!

171
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:09,862
This is the police!

172
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,072
Mr. Kim!

173
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:04,644
What the hell happened?

174
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:06,896
Where's Seungjoo?

175
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:09,857
I don't know.

176
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,362
What the hell were you thinking
following her here, huh?

177
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,449
I thought I might be able
to stop her from killing again.

178
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:23,621
I wanted to believe her,
though it was a lie.

179
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,585
Don't you realize the danger
you just put yourself in?

180
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,547
Why would a serial killer
who's killed seven people

181
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,550
suddenly decide
to spare their victim, huh?

182
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,344
Right?

183
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,472
Then why did she come to see me?

184
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,725
It's not like she was here to kill me.

185
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,941
Do you think
she wanted to see my powerless face?

186
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:00,408
Here.

187
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,327
I found it on the table
in Miyoung Lee's house.

188
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,167
Is this the last one of them?

189
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,087
This is just a black puzzle piece.

190
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,381
There's nothing drawn on it.

191
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,633
What could it mean?

192
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,471
Remember the Shindonga Market fire?

193
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,057
When it burned down?

194
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,894
Do you think it has to do with that?

195
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:49,999
After '87, private companies took over
the demolition of redevelopment areas,

196
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,251
now called demolition service agencies.

197
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,546
Yoonsu Do started it all with Jeoksan.

198
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:59,258
They practically monopolized
redevelopment area demolition

199
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,135
from the early to mid-90s.

200
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:04,388
They were notorious for using
whatever means necessary,

201
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,348
including force, to get what they wanted.

202
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:10,102
They got so much bad press that
construction companies and cooperatives

203
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:12,521
were reluctant
to offer them any contracts.

204
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:15,733
That's why Yoonsu made a subsidiary
under someone else's name.

205
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,653
Dasan Development, owned by Chimok Kang.

206
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,701
So, how much do you know?

207
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,583
About…

208
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,920
…my uncle?

209
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,300
I'm sure you read up
on Superintendent Yoon as well.

210
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:46,514
I guess he got paid out
for dropping the case.

211
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,266
Or was promised a promotion.

212
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,395
Donghoon Yoon…

213
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,734
received three apartment units
in The One City for covering up the fire.

214
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:01,153
And then,

215
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:04,657
he claimed them under his niece's name
instead of his own.

216
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,621
And the year
his niece became a high schooler,

217
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,498
he sold The One City units

218
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,667
and bought a luxurious house
in Hannam-dong.

219
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:21,966
You know, my parents joined
the Shindonga Market Cooperative.

220
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,178
They owned 10 lots in the market.

221
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,313
Where do you think
this story is going to end?

222
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,652
How far down does this rabbit hole go?

223
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,867
Mayor Kim had been
receiving bribes from Yoonsu Do

224
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,035
since he was a city council member.

225
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:53,664
Later, he helped Yoonsu
rebrand himself as a contractor

226
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:56,458
when he was chairman
of the Seoul Metropolitan Council.

227
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:59,086
Who do you think's gonna be next?

228
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:02,131
Someone involved
with the Shindonga incident?

229
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,508
'Cause they could be
the final piece of the puzzle.

230
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:08,012
Somehow I don't think Shindonga
has anything to do with the last one.

231
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,514
The piece had Mr. Kim sitting on a throne,
didn't it?

232
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,183
The black puzzle piece…

233
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:14,977
Come on, think, why is it black?

234
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,562
It's black 'cause…

235
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,148
We need to figure out what it means.

236
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,109
Let's think about
where Seungjoo Lee might have gone.

237
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:25,362
Where would she wanna wrap up this story?

238
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:41,712
The puzzle is set in a theme park, right?
Dream Land.

239
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:45,883
Dream Land.

240
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,969
Where Seungjoo lost her mom
at the theme park.

241
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:50,429
And The One City.

242
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:54,183
From her point of view,
that's also where she lost her mom.

243
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,478
The black puzzle piece…

244
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,114
Hey, San.

245
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:12,159
Lieutenant Kim, I think
we figured out where Seungjoo's going.

246
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,327
Really?

247
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:16,121
I checked the CCTV footage
for The One City's parking lot

248
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:18,707
at the time Muryong Kim fell to his death.

249
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,460
You can see
Seungjoo Lee getting into a deluxe taxi.

250
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,129
And the taxi driver also confirmed it.

251
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:27,091
He said that he dropped her off
at a funeral home in Namyangju.

252
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,342
A funeral home?

253
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,844
Yeah. But, uh, listen…

254
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:35,432
It's the same place
where Captain Yang's body is being kept.

255
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:44,149
Why did she go to Jungho's funeral home?

256
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:45,234
"Ena Yoon"

257
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,403
Do you think
the black puzzle piece means death?

258
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,363
I mean, you do wear black to a funeral.

259
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,782
Guess we'll find out what it means
when we find her.

260
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:53,742
Let's split up and look.

261
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:56,078
You go to the funeral home,
I'll head to Dream Land.

262
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,080
Wait, you wanna go there by yourself?

263
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,640
Sky Light Funeral Home

264
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:44,334
Sky Light Funeral Home

265
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,811
She just stood there for 30 minutes,

266
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,396
without doing anything, then left.

267
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,815
She'd be soaked from the rain.

268
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,276
She must have known that Jungho was here,

269
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,528
so why did she
just stand outside like that?

270
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,697
She never went in.

271
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:18,327
So why did she come here?

272
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:31,733
Hello again.

273
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:34,194
I've been waiting for you.

274
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,706
You're not a coward, Seungjoo.

275
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,626
You shouldn't end it this way.

276
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:56,884
My mom and I…

277
00:27:57,968 --> 00:27:59,386
went on this ride.

278
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,598
I was so little.

279
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:05,100
I couldn't go on many rides.

280
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,981
We also went on the merry-go-round

281
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:13,483
and the bumper cars were really cool.

282
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,612
My mom got us cotton candy.

283
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:32,461
Time and again,

284
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:35,255
I waited for my mom right here…

285
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,426
not knowing she was waiting for me
at the restaurant.

286
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:43,597
<i>I used to have this fantasy.</i>

287
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:47,976
<i>I would dream about</i>
<i>seeing my mom's face one day.</i>

288
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,979
<i>In my dream, she would smile</i>

289
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:53,357
<i>and cry when she saw me.</i>

290
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:58,570
<i>She'd tell me how long</i>
<i>she'd been looking for me</i>

291
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,199
<i>and that she hadn't abandoned me.</i>

292
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:12,125
I also wanted to tell her about
how long I had been looking for her.

293
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,549
I couldn't remember
what restaurant she worked at.

294
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,487
I'm sorry.

295
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:49,037
That's not what I wanna hear
from you, Ms. Yoon.

296
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:52,040
Why would you want to… apologize?

297
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:53,875
Now that I know

298
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:57,462
my parents' story, and that of my uncle…

299
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:04,052
I think that maybe…

300
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,930
I'm not really that different

301
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:08,765
from the puzzle-piece characters.

302
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:13,186
Ena, that's not your fault though.

303
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,897
Don't be so sensitive.

304
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:18,108
That's why you have trouble
falling asleep.

305
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,360
The guilt isn't yours to bear.

306
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,240
There's something I'd like to know.

307
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,492
In Miyoung Lee's car,

308
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:29,995
why did you play
the piece <i>Nocturnes, Op. 15?</i>

309
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,040
I want to know. What did it mean to you?

310
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:35,667
I didn't select that.

311
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,379
Miyoung played it
as soon as she got in the car.

312
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,840
I thought about turning it off.

313
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,217
But it was…

314
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,472
…so beautiful.

315
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:54,394
I never…

316
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,189
had a chance to listen to much music.

317
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,441
How nice.

318
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,359
How beautiful.

319
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,820
Those concepts meant nothing.

320
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:10,077
But that piece of music was so beautiful
that it made me forget…

321
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,580
I was there to kill someone.

322
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:20,921
It's not too late.

323
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,590
You're still able to…

324
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,884
You can live a life like that.

325
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:30,597
You see, Ena…

326
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,558
I've done all I set out to do.

327
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,978
I don't wish to go on living.

328
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,731
Nor do I have a reason to.

329
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:42,734
Why is that?

330
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:44,611
Why?

331
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,907
Why don't you want to keep on living?

332
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:58,667
I…

333
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,546
can no longer…

334
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:05,799
tolerate myself.

335
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:12,472
That's how you feel now.

336
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:14,558
Stick it out!

337
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:19,604
Stay alive, pay for what you've done,
and keep on living!

338
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,694
Seungjoo Lee!

339
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,161
Come out of there.

340
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:50,677
Seungjoo Lee…

341
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:55,515
you are under arrest
on suspicion of serial murder.

342
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:00,687
Put your hands up and walk this way.

343
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,235
I really hate people.

344
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,781
Why the hell do you work so hard
just to stay alive?

345
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:16,786
Why would you struggle to live?

346
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,248
I don't see the point of it.

347
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:53,949
Why?

348
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,535
Ena…

349
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,331
Why would you just… Why would you?

350
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:05,085
Why would someone kill one person…

351
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:11,174
to build a place where another can live?

352
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:19,075
Tell us how it all went down.

353
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:23,246
What did you talk about with the suspect
while you were alone with her?

354
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:31,379
Lieutenant Yoon.

355
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:36,593
I, uh…

356
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,095
don't remember.

357
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,681
You don't remember?

358
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:46,227
And you?

359
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,938
You got something to say?

360
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:35,837
I wanted to stop her, no matter what.

361
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,594
I finally understand
why you did what you did.

362
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:47,432
I'm sorry.

363
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:01,070
I'm back again.

364
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,073
How is she today?

365
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:06,117
Same as she was yesterday.

366
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:08,703
Poor girl's cooped herself up
in her room for days.

367
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,040
Can you give her this?

368
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:15,376
She hasn't drunk a single one of these.

369
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:19,232
Letter of Resignation

370
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:26,489
So… you sure this is what you want?

371
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:29,909
I've put in a lot of thought.
It is what I want.

372
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:35,623
Sure you won't regret it?

373
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,500
Yeah.

374
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:42,046
So what are you gonna do now?

375
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:45,216
Hmm… Hard to say.

376
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:49,178
I'm still pretty young.
I'll figure something out.

377
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,398
Tell you what.

378
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,734
I'll put a hold on this.

379
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:06,237
If you change your mind,
you can come back.

380
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,868
Thank you very much
for letting me work here.

381
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,700
Lieutenant Yoon.

382
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:06,130
It's good to see you out of the house.

383
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:14,722
The Insa-dong murder case,
what are your thoughts on that?

384
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:17,642
What murder case?

385
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:20,395
The one that's all over the news.
Where have you been?

386
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:24,357
Three people were murdered in a <i>hanok,</i>
and they still don't have a suspect.

387
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:27,610
Don't you tempt me.

388
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:29,904
Besides, Insa-dong isn't
even in your jurisdiction.

389
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:32,281
It's just…

390
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:35,868
interesting.

391
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,917
I wasn't expecting company.
I hope it's okay.

392
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:46,212
Eat it while it's hot.

393
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,226
Dig in.

394
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:18,703
It does.

395
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:21,497
It tastes like black bean sauce.

396
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:24,959
Told you so.

397
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:38,848
-So, Curry Kim.
-Hmm?

398
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,641
Riddle me this real quick.

399
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,978
How did your mother end up
living in The One City?

400
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,109
Well…

401
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:53,654
When I said I was gonna be a cop…

402
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:55,740
…my mom used my name to apply for a unit

403
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,159
'cause she was worried
the job wouldn't pay well.

404
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,577
Then she won it in a lottery.

405
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,996
Whoa… No way.

406
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:04,082
She hit the jackpot.

407
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:06,000
She did. She hit it big.

408
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08,503
She dreamed of a house like this.

409
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,838
Guess her wish came true.

410
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,425
Well, it's a pretty common dream.

411
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:16,260
Everybody wants a nice home.

412
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:19,055
You can't judge them for it.

413
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:34,529
"The puzzle murders"

414
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,531
Hello, everyone, and good evening.

415
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,492
We have a special interview
for our viewers right now.

416
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:42,662
Nine puzzle pieces, and only one culprit.

417
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,080
Does that sound familiar?

418
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,915
The high-profile Puzzle Murder case

419
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:48,751
left a terrifying trail
of eight deaths in its wake.

420
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:50,086
The case caused a huge stir

421
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,630
when a member of the National Assembly
ended up dead.

422
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:53,840
We have with us today

423
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:56,008
a former police officer
and criminal profiler

424
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:57,510
who brought this case to light.

425
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:00,138
It was her analysis
that helped solve the case.

426
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:02,014
Welcome, Lieutenant Yoon.

427
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:03,391
"Ena Yoon
Former Seoul Metropolitan Police profiler"

428
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:06,811
Please just call me by my name.
I'm no longer a profiler after all.

429
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,396
Oh, right.

430
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,314
Then Ms. Ena Yoon, uh…

431
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:12,984
let me start with what you might say
is a boring question.

432
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,986
Why did you become a profiler?

433
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:18,030
That is a boring question.

434
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:19,532
<i>Right.</i>

435
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:22,034
Looks like we found the right person
for this interview.

436
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:23,202
This should be fun.

437
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,413
Do I need to be more entertaining?

438
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,665
Oh, no,
you're doing great already.

439
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:32,378
I became a profiler to profile myself.

440
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:33,504
What?

441
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:37,466
Oh, would you… mind telling us
what you mean by that?

442
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:39,927
I wasn't sure if I killed my uncle.

443
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:43,055
To be clear, my uncle was
Superintendent Donghoon Yoon.

444
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:47,143
And he was the second victim
in the Puzzle Murder case.

445
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:49,604
Hold on.
Just to make sure,

446
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:52,940
I wouldn't happen to be interviewing
a murderer now, would I?

447
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,526
"Consider yourself a suspect."

448
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:59,488
That's the reason I became a profiler.
I had to make sure.

449
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,115
Then…

450
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:04,243
are you now done
suspecting yourself of his death?

451
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:11,751
"Forced demolition is an act of murder!
We will never back down!"

452
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:13,169
-And then they bled out?
-Yeah.

453
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:14,503
We should get another look.

454
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:28,267
- Hello.
- Hello.

455
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:32,563
Looks like they called
every profiler on the force.

456
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:33,648
Who called them all?

457
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:37,026
Apparently, the case is so weird
the chief requested backup right away.

458
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:39,237
Guess he doesn't trust us.

459
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:49,121
- She doesn't have anything on her?
- Hey, Hansaem.

460
00:45:49,205 --> 00:45:50,414
D'you ID her yet?

461
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:51,999
Uh, hold on.

462
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:58,965
Looks like her prints just got run.

463
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,550
Miso Jeon. She was 23.

464
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:04,637
Her address was 7 Changil-dong.

465
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,055
And the cause of death?

466
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,975
We're not gonna have a complete report
until we do an autopsy.

467
00:46:09,058 --> 00:46:10,977
But judging by the incision
around the neck,

468
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,478
we're assuming she bled out…

469
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:15,690
after which the killer
seems to have sewn up the wound.

470
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:18,234
Her time of death is, uh…

471
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:22,738
around two days ago.

472
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:28,494
Looking at the gash and that stitch job,
I don't think a surgeon did this.

473
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:32,581
Her face seems a bit too pale
to have been killed two days ago.

474
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:34,333
-Sure you got the timeline right?
-Mm.

475
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:36,419
Yeah, I'm sure.

476
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:38,254
She had her blood completely drained.

477
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:40,423
Otherwise her face
would've turned black by now.

478
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:42,425
The killer
left her like this intentionally.

479
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,052
It's like she's been preserved.

480
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:49,557
Why would they put her
on display like this?

481
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:52,393
'Cause they wanted
everyone to see it.

482
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:54,979
This is their finished work of art.

483
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:02,611
They combed her hair
and redid all of her makeup,

484
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:04,405
just the way they like it.

485
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,615
They even gave her a pretty dress.

486
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:08,534
She's on display.

487
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:12,913
This was a long-held fantasy.

488
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:15,624
A twisted notion
they perfected in their head,

489
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:18,377
born out of an attempt
to appease the sense of emptiness

490
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:19,962
that lives inside a lonely heart.

491
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,798
I'd say, the moment they laid eyes on her,

492
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:25,760
they decided that she would be
the perfect vessel to fulfill it.

493
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,511
Once the deed was done,

494
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:30,097
they probably wanted to show off
their signature work.

495
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,851
That's why she's on display.

496
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:38,898
It's pretty, but…

497
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,026
it's damn unsettling.

498
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:44,236
Hmm.

499
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,864
They may also have wanted
to debase the victim.

500
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:50,242
The object of one's desire
tends to manifest in two ways,

501
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:52,411
becoming both yearned for and hated.

502
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:54,121
Mm…

503
00:47:56,665 --> 00:48:00,169
Why would the killer dump a body out here?
It's completely abandoned.

504
00:48:01,504 --> 00:48:03,255
The culprit knows this place well.

505
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:07,134
What I mean is…
they're closer than we think.
