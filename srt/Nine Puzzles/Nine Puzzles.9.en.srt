1
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:13,931
You looking for this?

2
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:19,019
I did it.

3
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:21,438
I killed everyone.

4
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,305
Jungho Yang…

5
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:02,896
I'm placing you under arrest
on suspicion of committing murder.

6
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,740
You have the right to remain silent.

7
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:15,826
Anything you say can be used against you

8
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,537
and you have the right
to request an attorney.

9
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:20,872
Do you understand?

10
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:44,289
Nine Puzzles

11
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,181
Please state your name.

12
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,267
My name is Jungho Yang.

13
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:07,979
Occupation?

14
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,236
Police detective.

15
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:21,159
Where is your current address?

16
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:25,455
Dongjak-gu… Shinil-dong, number 35.

17
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,215
The suspect, Mr. Jungho Ya…

18
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:47,269
I really wish it wasn't you.

19
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,523
All the circumstantial evidence we had
pointed at you,

20
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,108
but I didn't want it to be you!

21
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,696
I thought I told you not to trust anyone
till you wrapped up the case.

22
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,156
Is this a game to you?

23
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,493
Have you been toying with me
for a decade? Huh?

24
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,124
10 years went quick.

25
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,129
Fine.

26
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,631
I murdered them all.

27
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,552
Ganghyun Lee, Donghoon Yoon…

28
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,847
Miyoung Lee, Chimok Kang, Yoonsu Do,

29
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:24,973
and Cheoljin Oh.

30
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,643
That's right,
I didn't kill Chimok Kang.

31
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,356
I also sent the puzzle pieces to Ms. Yoon.

32
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,902
Why did you do it?

33
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:40,822
Why the hell did you murder
those five people? Huh?

34
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,162
I'll answer that,
but call the press first.

35
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,335
You want me to call the press?

36
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,420
Yes.

37
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,631
I'll talk, I promise.

38
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,342
I'll explain exactly
how everything happened.

39
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,677
You'll get all the answers you want.

40
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,098
I'll also tell you about the murders
I have yet to commit.

41
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,360
Then why did you turn yourself in?

42
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,615
Why did you turn yourself in,
if there's three left to kill?

43
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,625
I guess I'm tired.

44
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,212
I just want it all to be over.

45
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:54,563
- Hello, sir.
- You're here, sir.

46
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,576
This make any sense to you?

47
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,536
Is this really happening?

48
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,662
Jungho killed Donghoon?

49
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,794
I'm not sure what to believe.

50
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:22,525
Boys' Room

51
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,283
Who are you?

52
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,306
Nice to see you.

53
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,644
What's nice about seeing me?

54
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,479
For the last 10 years,

55
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,148
I've been trying real hard
to remember that night.

56
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:06,069
There were times that I thought
I had actually done it.

57
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:10,198
But now,
I finally get to meet the real killer.

58
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,035
That's why I'm glad to see you.

59
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,168
The day my uncle died…

60
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,338
did you know I would show up?

61
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,844
That wasn't part of my plan.

62
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,846
I apologize.

63
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:36,891
What were you thinking…

64
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:38,852
as you stood behind me?

65
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,238
Why didn't you…

66
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:52,824
just kill me as well?

67
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,372
That's all I'm going to tell you for now.

68
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,959
I'll give you a detailed answer
once the press is called.

69
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,974
Jungho's father passed away
due to illness when he was five,

70
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,268
and his mother abandoned him
two years later.

71
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,354
So he was raised in an orphanage
till he came of age.

72
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,523
He's got no relatives,

73
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,609
and according to recent call history,

74
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,570
uh, he was only in contact
with around 10 people.

75
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,406
I see.

76
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,242
So did that handkerchief reveal anything?

77
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,702
Uh, well…

78
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,037
We've sent it to forensics,

79
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,999
but they said that it'll take a while
to run a full DNA workup.

80
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,419
They said they should have
some detailed results ready for us

81
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:47,629
by the end of this week.

82
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,547
What did we get from his house?

83
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:52,592
We learned that he wasn't actually living
at his registered address.

84
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,594
There were other people living there.

85
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:55,720
What are you saying?

86
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:56,888
Can you explain that?

87
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,682
Oh, uh… Yeah, so, normally, uh…

88
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,769
children have to leave the orphanage
when they reach the age of 18.

89
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:06,147
It seems the kids who had nowhere to go
were living at his house together,

90
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:07,690
like a, uh…

91
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,651
a shelter, something like that.

92
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,446
Then where has Jungho
actually been living?

93
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,199
We're trying to figure that out.
He's gotta live somewhere.

94
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,162
So basically, we've got nothing.

95
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,457
This isn't good enough.

96
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,752
All we have so far is a confession
and hypnosis results.

97
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,881
And that type of evidence
isn't admissible in court.

98
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,593
So why do you think
he wanted us to call the press?

99
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,721
We both know
that he's not that kind of person.

100
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,642
What if we do call the press?

101
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,687
If we actually did allow him
to speak to the media.

102
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,981
What's the worst that could happen?

103
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,902
This isn't a normal case, after all.

104
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,989
I think we should run
a simulated press conference.

105
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,198
Learn what we can.

106
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,824
Why did you do it?

107
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,252
I've thought about
why you might have done it, <i>Hyung.</i>

108
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,884
But as much as I try,
nothing comes to mind.

109
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,807
Do you remember
when you first came to work here?

110
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,278
Please catch Yeonghun's real murderer!

111
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,781
1123 days since Yeonghun's death
Died 16 years old

112
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:36,714
Do you remember what you said to your team
when you met us for the first time?

113
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,428
There was a random person protesting
right outside our front gate,

114
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,681
you asked our team
if anyone knew his son's name.

115
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,392
Then you said this…

116
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,023
"Let's not forget…

117
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:56,776
the victim."

118
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,950
That's the kind of person you were.

119
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,579
So why would you have done this?

120
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,418
You spoke out about
remembering the victims,

121
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,420
but then went on to create more of them?

122
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:19,632
Why?

123
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,220
Lieutenant Hansaem Kim.

124
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,223
Don't make this complicated.

125
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,227
You will understand everything
in due time.

126
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,562
Call the press.

127
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,405
All right, then where have you
actually been living?

128
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:45,158
Or will you only
tell the press that as well?

129
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:59,172
Live Living Motel

130
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:15,521
Live Living Motel

131
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:57,605
Substantialization of
hands-on character education

132
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,543
A new take on sociology

133
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,096
Sir, I finally graduated!

134
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,430
Thank you, Detective

135
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:40,606
I've just gotten through boot camp, sir!

136
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,359
Congratulations on your promotion
to technical sergeant!

137
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:49,907
Detective! We got married!
We'll be coming to see you

138
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:35,536
Curry Kim, did you find anything?

139
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,414
Just go.

140
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,125
I don't really feel like talking.

141
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,545
I'm not here to talk, okay?

142
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,964
You're acting like an F-type.

143
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,304
Here it is.

144
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,389
This is the fish Jungho wanted to feed.

145
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,272
I guess you've never been to his house,
have you?

146
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:08,361
He had organized
all the letters and photos

147
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,905
sent by the kids from the orphanage
into boxes.

148
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:21,082
Are you just gonna give up then?

149
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,252
You're the one who wanted to know
if I could face this case or not.

150
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,254
So why are you crying like a child?

151
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,301
Do you think Jungho really did it?

152
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:36,347
Are you sure
he was the one standing behind you?

153
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,974
And if he wasn't?

154
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,230
Why do I feel that his confession…

155
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,067
is just an act of self-harm?

156
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:54,323
Have you been to the orphanage
he was donating to?

157
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:02,123
Violent Crimes Unit 2

158
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,795
Jungho, uh… talked a lot
about you, Detective Kim.

159
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,007
But I mean…

160
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,467
Did Jungho do it?

161
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,178
Uh, I just don't think he would.

162
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,806
We're still investigating.
I can't answer that.

163
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,725
How long have you known Jungho?

164
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,730
We grew up at the orphanage.

165
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:30,651
The two of us… spent our childhood here.

166
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,862
And Jungho…

167
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,281
wanted to go find work.

168
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,657
He didn't waste any time.

169
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:37,742
He left at 18.

170
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,910
I chose to stay and started working here.

171
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:45,124
Um… so when was it
the two of you reconnected?

172
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,335
Well, after he got into
the police academy,

173
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,170
Jungho came back to the orphanage.

174
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,632
I was shocked.
He was different.

175
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,926
But how? How was he different?

176
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,428
When I knew him before,

177
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,264
he was a really shy kid
and kind of an introvert.

178
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:03,225
But once he got into the police academy…

179
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,394
…he was a lot tougher from it.

180
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,314
He was driven by a very strong goal.

181
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,650
- A goal?
- Yeah.

182
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,818
He said he wanted to find someone.

183
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,987
That's why he became a police officer.

184
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,947
Any idea who he wanted to find?

185
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:20,117
Uh…

186
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:23,204
Well… I'm sorry, that's private.

187
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,122
I'm afraid I can't tell you.

188
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:26,540
- It's personal.
- Personal?

189
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:29,460
There's been six murders,
and who knows how many more will come.

190
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,170
And you're worried about some kind of

191
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,755
- personal matter?
- I'm sorry.

192
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,548
But that's all I can tell you.

193
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:35,633
It's personal.

194
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:39,387
Anyway, he kept supporting
the children here

195
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,930
at the orphanage until now.

196
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,807
When he'd come by,

197
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:46,686
he would say that everyone deserved
at least one chance to get ahead.

198
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,189
Everyone here looked up to him.

199
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,615
Can you think of anyone
that Jungho needed to protect?

200
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,367
Is there anyone in particular?

201
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,328
If there was anyone for him to protect…

202
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,038
Well…

203
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,290
I would say
that would be the children here.

204
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:13,045
Above anything,
supporting these kids was most important.

205
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:14,588
Here's…

206
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,467
a list of the kids you sponsored.

207
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,971
Is the person among these 21 individuals?

208
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,932
The one you're trying to protect?

209
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,226
Why would I have anyone to protect?

210
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,937
Those kids have nothing to do
with this case.

211
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,189
I'll be the judge
of who's involved in this.

212
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,735
We're digging into
every single person on this list.

213
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:38,779
Tell me.

214
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,406
Who's the real killer?

215
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:45,494
Huiwon Nam? Jaeil Jung?

216
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,079
Yeseul Lee? Gyeongjin Park?

217
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,457
Or maybe it was one of the kids
living in your house!

218
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,333
I told you, I did it!

219
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,003
No, it wasn't you.

220
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,756
Lieutenant Hansaem Kim,

221
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,716
there's no time for this.

222
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:03,179
I'll admit to everything.
Will you please just call the press?

223
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:11,812
<i>Hyung.</i>

224
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,525
Has it occurred to you

225
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:20,279
that another murder might happen
if you don't talk to us?

226
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,157
The puzzle has three pieces left.

227
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,410
Three more people will die.

228
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:27,578
They won't.

229
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:30,414
The killings are finished.
There won't be any more.

230
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:31,499
It's done.

231
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:33,083
I'll ask you again.

232
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,086
Who was it?

233
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,600
I want you to know…

234
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,522
if someone else dies, that's all on you!

235
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:18,254
Jungho is not the killer.

236
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:20,422
I agree. He didn't do it.

237
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:22,883
It seemed that Jungho was shocked to learn

238
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:25,678
that the killer was behind me
on the day my uncle died.

239
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:29,765
Aside from that,
there's the kind of man he is.

240
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,016
He's got a warm heart.

241
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:35,437
Someone selfless enough
to offer their house to someone in need

242
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,356
would have no reason to become a killer.

243
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:42,027
He's drawing our attention
so we look the wrong way.

244
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,447
Because he's protecting someone.

245
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,784
So who's the person he's protecting?

246
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:49,910
We need to know.

247
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:23,402
Let's go.

248
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:34,788
Seoul Hangang Police Station

249
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,467
What are you doing?

250
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:49,386
We're letting you go.

251
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,681
There's no real proof
that you're the killer

252
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:54,183
except for your confession.

253
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:57,102
When Miyoung Lee died,

254
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:59,229
you were at the orphanage
at her time of death,

255
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:02,149
and when Yoonsu Do died,
you were at the Hangang Station with San.

256
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:05,402
There's a ton of security footage
and witnesses to back up your alibi.

257
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:06,612
We know you didn't do it.

258
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:09,573
I gave you a signed confession,
what more do you want?

259
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:11,492
There are still three puzzle pieces!

260
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:16,497
We need to catch the real killer,
so don't get in the way.

261
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:21,210
It hasn't been 48 hours yet,
and you're just letting me go?

262
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,294
This your idea?

263
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,589
I've already cleared it
with the station chief and Dongsu.

264
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,300
Just stay away from this case.

265
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,181
Hey, Lieutenant Kim.

266
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:19,935
The captain just…
entered the motel he's been staying at.

267
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:22,980
Hello.

268
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,774
Wait, you shouldn't go in that room now.

269
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,945
I'm going out to clear my head.

270
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,280
Let's go for a drive?

271
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:35,284
Sorry, I've got plans today.

272
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,507
Look, there's nothing else to say.

273
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:52,134
What more do you want from me?

274
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:55,429
Was it like five years ago,
that we first met?

275
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:57,264
That's random.

276
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:00,851
How did you get to know about me?

277
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:04,313
I was introduced to you
by an older colleague.

278
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,647
That's right.

279
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:09,109
The doctor who was counseling me
five years ago told me

280
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:11,987
that I should try meeting
a great junior doctor that they knew.

281
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,906
That's how we first met, right?

282
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,115
Yes.

283
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,160
Did you, maybe, know about me

284
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,454
before we were introduced?

285
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,292
Why do you wanna know?

286
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:28,837
Well, I was just wondering
if you'd asked to be introduced to me.

287
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,673
Or did your old colleague
really just refer me to you?

288
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,637
I don't remember.

289
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,138
It's been a long time.

290
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,226
You don't remember, huh?

291
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:46,647
This is actually important though.

292
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:49,316
Then…

293
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:51,819
do you remember that patient you had?

294
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:53,946
The boy who became darkness.

295
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,284
By any chance,

296
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:01,662
is that your own story,

297
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,956
or is it just someone
that you're close to?

298
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:06,458
Why would you think that?

299
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:11,171
Because psychiatrists don't tend
to talk about their patients.

300
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:14,842
I've barely ever heard you talk about
any of your other patients, Dr. Hwang,

301
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:18,262
but I do seem to recall hearing you
talk about that patient you met

302
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,555
over at the orphanage.

303
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:22,182
That was a mistake.

304
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:24,643
I should never have shared
any of that with you.

305
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,941
So, what are your plans today?

306
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:34,111
Why on earth
would I tell you about my plans?

307
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,445
Whoa!

308
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:38,532
Don't we know each other well enough
to be asking personal questions?

309
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:39,908
I thought we were close.

310
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,994
Oh, yeah, we're quite close.

311
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,829
That doesn't mean I need to fill you in

312
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,789
on every single one
of my personal affairs,

313
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:47,124
so I'm not going to.

314
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:53,046
Where can I let you out?

315
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,464
I really should get going.

316
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:05,517
<i>What happens</i>
<i>if Jungho doesn't make any moves?</i>

317
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:07,811
<i>Not like he doesn't know</i>
<i>you guys are tailing him.</i>

318
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:09,396
I'm sure he knows.

319
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,231
He'll make a move.

320
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:13,942
He was really bothered
when I uncuffed him yesterday.

321
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,905
First time I'd ever seen him so rattled.

322
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,783
His face basically said
his whole plan had been ruined.

323
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,535
What could his plan be though?

324
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:27,414
Why did he turn himself in like that,
then ask us to call a press conference?

325
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:30,167
<i>What could the press have to do</i>
<i>with protecting someone?</i>

326
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,668
<i>Seems a little weird.</i>

327
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,004
This ever happen in one of your novels?

328
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:36,965
Hold on a sec.

329
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:39,593
San Choi

330
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:40,969
Hey, San.

331
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:42,804
Hey, Lieutenant.

332
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:44,640
The captain took his car and left.

333
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:45,807
He's heading somewhere.

334
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:47,392
Any idea where?

335
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,478
Uh, no, I'm not sure yet.

336
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,147
Well, stay with him and let me know
if anything comes up.

337
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,109
Looks like Jungho's headed somewhere.

338
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:58,236
Sooner than we expected. You going?

339
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,529
Of course.

340
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,518
Chuncheon Junction

341
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:41,488
Hey, San. Talk to me.

342
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:42,572
All right.

343
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:47,119
Well, the captain's car just took the exit
toward Chuncheon on the highway.

344
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,080
I'm getting in my car.

345
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,624
Now don't lose him. Stay on his tail.

346
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:53,875
I'm on the way.

347
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:17,482
Are you sure we can't just leave him be?
I don't know where he's going.

348
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,526
He's gotta be going to meet with someone.

349
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,278
I'm on the way. I'll catch up soon.

350
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:22,946
- <i>Don't lose him.</i>
- I'm on it.

351
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:41,423
Hey, you're early.

352
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:43,300
Hello, sir.

353
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,595
I heard you were coming,
so I made sure I was here.

354
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:49,222
You…

355
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:00,859
So, Mayor…

356
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:03,236
have you hunted here before?

357
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,321
Who, me?

358
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,656
Well, I've hunted pheasants here
a few times.

359
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,866
How about you?

360
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:10,327
Well, it's my land, so I hunt here often.

361
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,330
Did you know we'll get a boar
every now and then?

362
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:17,501
You aim at the crown of the hog's head
and at the heart.

363
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,212
Bang! Yeah.

364
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,965
I know all the youngsters these days
are into playing golf,

365
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,967
but that doesn't even
come close to hunting.

366
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:29,930
I think hunting is
mankind's most primal instinct.

367
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:31,973
It's addictive.

368
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:34,434
Sometime, I'll take you boar hunting,
but first…

369
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:37,104
green belt designations gotta go.

370
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:41,650
You know, I didn't buy all this land
just so I could hunt wild boars.

371
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,819
I'll need a little more time.

372
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,113
You know, pretty soon,
they'll build a highway.

373
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:47,280
Rest stops'll follow.

374
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:48,949
The green belt'll vanish.

375
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:51,368
You could say I was looking out for you
so you could…

376
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,161
enjoy your boar hunts longer.

377
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:54,246
- You know?
- Uh-huh.

378
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,872
Thanks for looking out for me.

379
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:58,166
Let's make it happen within the year,
all right?

380
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,731
One shot, one kill. See?

381
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:23,316
- Nice shooting.
- Hey, photo.

382
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,943
- Heh.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

383
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,195
Just a sec.

384
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,449
- 'Kay, here we go.
- Yeah.

385
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:33,618
- Looking good!
- Ha!

386
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:35,453
- One, two…
- Yeah!

387
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:07,986
All right, I got him.

388
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:10,614
He parked his car behind an SUV
and he's on foot.

389
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,617
I think he's about to meet someone.

390
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,328
What should I do?
Wait it out or try and follow?

391
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:46,626
Not bad, huh?
It's this easy. What's so hard about it?

392
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:52,549
Complications?

393
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:53,758
What do you mean?

394
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:57,971
Come on, lifting green belt restrictions
is a much more complicated affair.

395
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,806
Not like I said I'm not going to do it.

396
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,099
There's a procedure.

397
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,183
Procedure?

398
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,102
I don't care about any of that, okay?

399
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,271
Just give me some more time.

400
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,481
Hey, you got a nice bird today…

401
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,155
Get down!

402
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:42,158
<i>Hyung. Hyung!</i>

403
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:44,703
Wake up!<i> Hyung!</i> What happened?

404
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:54,254
Yes, I'm in Sangji-ri Reed Field.
I need an ambulance.

405
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:55,880
Right.

406
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:58,299
It's a gunshot wound.

407
00:36:58,383 --> 00:36:59,426
Yeah, hurry up!

408
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,012
<i>Hyung.</i>

409
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:06,975
<i>Hyung!</i>

410
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:16,276
Hansaem, hey…

411
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,570
<i>Hyung,</i> what the hell happened? Huh?

412
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,489
I called an ambulance.
They'll be here really soon, okay?

413
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,994
Is he alive?

414
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,204
What do you mean?

415
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:30,623
The victim.

416
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:34,711
Is he alive or no?

417
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,296
Which victim?

418
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,759
I tried to stop it.

419
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,806
I wanted to stop it from happening.

420
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,312
But I couldn't.

421
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:56,691
Who couldn't you stop, <i>Hyung?</i>

422
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:59,027
Who did you go this far to protect?

423
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,074
I'm sorry, Hansaem.

424
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:09,370
Who needed your protection so badly, huh?

425
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:11,831
Huh? Why would you take things this far?

426
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,210
It all…

427
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:20,548
It all began 'cause I started it.

428
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,718
What do you mean you started it?

429
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:26,179
<i>Hyung…</i>

430
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,848
Miyoung Lee.

431
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,850
Chimok Kang.

432
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,728
Yoonsu Do.

433
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,774
All of them were scum of the earth.

434
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,112
But that doesn't change the fact…

435
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,077
that all these murders…

436
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:55,458
They all started
because of something I did.

437
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:02,340
It's not that poor kid's fault.

438
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:06,010
Who are you talking about?

439
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:15,311
Shindonga…

440
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:21,442
Seojin.

441
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:29,492
<i>Hyung?</i>

442
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:34,622
Why?

443
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,458
<i>Hyung! Hyung!</i>

444
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:46,384
No!

445
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:19,542
All right,
check around the field.

446
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:22,045
See if you can find anything else.

447
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,672
Let's get forensics out here.

448
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,007
"Emergency Medical Services"

449
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,134
We've cleared the scene,
we're moving the body.

450
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,469
The scene's clear, over.

451
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:35,683
Roger that, we'll take
another look in the field, over.

452
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:38,561
- Nothing in south quadrant.
- Roger that.

453
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:48,112
Why…

454
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:14,430
He wanted to tell me something.

455
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,522
Maybe I really should've called the press.

456
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:54,679
Shindonga…

457
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:57,015
Seojin.

458
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,309
Those were Jungho's final words.

459
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:06,107
We were too late again.

460
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:11,904
I think we should…
get the culprit to make the first move.

461
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:17,243
There's too much bleeding
from the right abdomen. Current SBP is 60.

462
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:27,003
<i>Shindonga Apartments.</i>

463
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:29,297
<i>Construction company.</i>

464
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,673
<i>A monthly magazine.</i>

465
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:32,300
"Shindonga, Shindonga Group"

466
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,302
<i>Yoonsu Do worked for DH Construction</i>

467
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:38,639
<i>and Cheoljin Oh worked</i>
<i>for Seongjin Construction.</i>

468
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,311
<i>Did this have anything to do</i>
<i>with Ganghyun Lee?</i>

469
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:46,147
<i>He worked for </i>Myungsung Daily<i> though.</i>

470
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:51,069
<i>Why does all of this sound so familiar?</i>

471
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:55,239
Yeah,
Sangbeom Kwon is 58 years old.

472
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:57,533
He's a former chief prosecutor
turned consultant.

473
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:00,661
From all accounts,
the victim was an avid hunter.

474
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:02,330
Seems the killer knew that as well.

475
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:05,541
It would appear so.

476
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:09,420
Well, how do you suppose Jungho…

477
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:11,756
knew where the killer
was gonna strike next?

478
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:15,009
I'm guessing he must have tracked the guy.

479
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:16,761
The captain's phone went missing.

480
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,429
It wasn't at the scene.

481
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:20,181
The culprit must have taken it.

482
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,143
Then our first priority
would be to find that cell phone.

483
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:26,687
And our witness? What did he have to say?

484
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:28,439
Uh, right, Mayor Moil Kim.

485
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,567
Apparently, the captain fired
a round skywards,

486
00:43:31,651 --> 00:43:33,528
then ran towards Sangbeom Kwon.

487
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:36,781
Uh, the mayor feared for his life,
and then he ran away.

488
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,407
Where did he get the gun though?

489
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,205
I'm sorry, sir, that's all on me.

490
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,085
Mr. Kwon's at the hospital.

491
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:50,461
Who's guarding him?

492
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:34,005
Ladies and gentlemen,
you are now watching <i>DBC News at Nine.</i>

493
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:38,050
First on the news this evening,
a puzzle sent by a serial killer.

494
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:39,635
This isn't a movie plot.

495
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:42,763
It's from an ongoing murder case
that's been unfolding in Seoul.

496
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:44,265
And after much deliberation,

497
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:47,393
we have decided to unveil this puzzle
for the public good.

498
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:49,645
If you know anything
about these puzzle pieces

499
00:44:49,729 --> 00:44:53,399
or recall seeing them somewhere,
please contact us with the information.

500
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:56,736
Now let's go over the details
with reporter Seungmin Hong.

501
00:44:57,236 --> 00:45:00,656
<i>Honestly, this is like a mystery case</i>
<i>straight out of a movie or a novel…</i>

502
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:03,242
Which one of you did this?

503
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:06,245
Who was it? Huh?

504
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,873
Which one of you leaked this to the press?

505
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:12,293
<i>There are six puzzle pieces,</i>

506
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,170
<i>and there have been six victims as well.</i>

507
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,422
You want to use the puzzle?

508
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:19,842
The murderer committed these killings
'cause they have a message to deliver.

509
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:22,094
So let's try giving them a mic.

510
00:45:22,178 --> 00:45:24,222
Then we can see who's gonna speak into it.

511
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:26,891
It's also what Captain Yang wanted to do.

512
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,101
He wanted to call the press.

513
00:45:29,602 --> 00:45:31,354
He had to have had a reason for that.

514
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:41,530
Ena Yoon

515
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:43,032
Hey.

516
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:46,077
A puzzle piece just showed up.

517
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:48,120
What?

518
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:50,248
Hold on a minute.

519
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:02,802
Hey, Mr. Kwon is still alive.

520
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:04,720
<i>Turn on the TV.</i>

521
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:12,395

<i>that we received from an anonymous source.</i>

522
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:16,357

<i>was delivered to our newsroom.</i>

523
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,735

524
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:23,239
<i>Considering the gravity of the matter,</i>

525
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,865
