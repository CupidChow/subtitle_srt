1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,965
Calling Hansaem Kim

2
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:57,766
Who is it?

3
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:02,271
<i>Ah, just… a co-worker checking in.</i>
<i>Is Hansaem there?</i>

4
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,731
<i>My name's Lieutenant Ena Yoon.</i>

5
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:06,066
Ah, right.

6
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,486
Yeah, Hansaem doesn't actually live here.

7
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,821
Oh, yes, I know.

8
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,198
Although doesn't he come here
on this day every week?

9
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:15,993
<i>Right, but not today.</i>
<i>Want to leave a message?</i>

10
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,077
Oh.

11
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:18,829
Guess he's not here.

12
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:22,332
Uh, I only came
'cause I couldn't reach him.

13
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,501
<i>Well, good night.</i>

14
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,100
Which floor did I park on?

15
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:30,061
Nine Puzzles

16
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,900
There, I think that's her.
Park in front of the car.

17
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:58,006
Yes, Captain.
Making our way to The One City.

18
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,258
Right, Building A's
underground parking lot.

19
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,428
Uh, we'll be there in about five minutes.

20
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:06,515
The crime scene
is almost ready for forensics.

21
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,393
No gloves?

22
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,395
I'll wear 'em later if I have to.

23
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,898
Find anything interesting?

24
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:21,404
<i> Forensics should be there soon,</i>
<i>make sure they have everything they need…</i>

25
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,990
Please stay behind the tape.

26
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:28,537
Yes, sir.

27
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,710
The victim's a resident here, right?

28
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,171
Yeah.

29
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:41,132
The guard confirmed, Unit 58-02,
in Building A.

30
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:43,093
Sorry, this area is restricted.

31
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,761
We appreciate your cooperation.

32
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,014
<i> That's correct.</i>
<i>Take pictures of everything.</i>

33
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:51,184
<i>Even if it doesn't seem important.</i>
<i>You never know, over.</i>

34
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,272
They left the scene spotless.

35
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,858
And her purse was left behind,
so it wasn't a robbery.

36
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,027
Driver's license
Miyoung Lee

37
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,699
What? Do you know her?

38
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:06,783
No.

39
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,619
Who found the body?

40
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,329
And who reported it to us?

41
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,599
<i>After 10 years,</i>
<i>another puzzle piece shows up.</i>

42
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,644
<i>On top of that,</i>
<i>a person was murdered on the same day.</i>

43
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,356
<i>This new puzzle piece</i>

44
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,067
<i>matches the one I found</i>
<i>the day my uncle was killed.</i>

45
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,529
<i>Must be the same person. It has to be.</i>

46
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,910
<i> Man, I really</i>
<i>don't wanna be involved with this mess.</i>

47
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,286
<i>I can tell you this.</i>

48
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:54,414
<i>I got texted that a prepaid</i>
<i>delivery order came at 10:32.</i>

49
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:57,000
<i>They said the item would be</i>
<i>in the bathroom supply closet</i>

50
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,084
<i>in the building.</i>

51
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,753
<i>In the men's bathroom.</i>

52
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,005
<i>There is no CCTV here.</i>

53
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,507
<i>They obviously chose this place</i>
<i>because of that.</i>

54
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,762
<i>And there's no way</i>
<i>I'll find any fingerprints.</i>

55
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:10,805
<i>Also, the delivery order</i>

56
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,891
<i>was most likely placed</i>
<i>with a burner phone.</i>

57
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,144
<i>Ten years have gone by.</i>

58
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,272
<i>Who sent me that puzzle piece?</i>

59
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:20,940
<i>Why send me that piece?</i>

60
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,531
So that's what you meant
by "someone died"?

61
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,242
Why didn't you pick up my call?

62
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,705
Why is it you again?

63
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,375
It happened 10 years ago too,

64
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,835
so of all people,
why were you there again, huh?

65
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,588
- Well, I came by to see you today.
- Mm-hmm.

66
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,674
Am I your alibi this time?

67
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:48,176
You didn't go to your parents' today.
Why's that?

68
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,928
Why would you come by to see me?

69
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,806
- Because I had something to tell you.
- And what could that be?

70
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:01,898
The same person drew this.

71
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,150
What's this, and where'd you get it?

72
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,320
I found it on the day my uncle was killed.

73
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,621
Check it out.

74
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,751
It's a serial killer.

75
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,295
Ten years pass
and the killing starts again.

76
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:31,386
Based on what?

77
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,888
I'll start looking for the evidence now.

78
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,599
Already wrote my statement,
so take a look.

79
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,313
You sure you didn't kill her
and then call me?

80
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:43,398
Hmm…

81
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,150
I bet you're behind the puzzle.

82
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,110
Why me?

83
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,446
Ah, I should believe
it's all a coincidence?

84
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,117
Make of it what you will then.

85
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:59,539
Statement
Ena Yoon

86
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,632
<i>So, she came by around 12:00 a.m.?</i>

87
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:10,884
Mm-hmm.

88
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,762
<i>I think it was just before midnight.</i>

89
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:16,431
<i>She said she came</i>
<i>because you wouldn't answer her calls.</i>

90
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,433
Okay.

91
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,061
It's late, you should get to bed.

92
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,229
Wait, can you tell me who she is?

93
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,523
She said that she's your coworker?

94
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:29,152
<i>It must've been something urgent</i>
<i>if she stopped by so late to see you.</i>

95
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,904
Don't worry. She's nobody important.

96
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,781
<i>Okay, fine. I'm going to bed.</i>

97
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,491
'Kay. I'll visit next week.

98
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,367
<i>- Sounds good.</i>
- Mm.

99
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:46,753
"I drove to the parking lot with my car,
but forgot where I parked it,

100
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:50,298
so I went through all the floors and tried
to look around for my car."

101
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,008
Does this make any sense?

102
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,426
Uh, well…

103
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,846
Hmm, sometimes I forget
which floor I parked on

104
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,473
when I go to the supermarket.

105
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,475
But I mean, her alibi is really solid.

106
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:03,978
Her alibi… Tch.

107
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,232
Let's double-check
that she's telling the truth.

108
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,738
Sir, but don't you wanna
get some breakfast?

109
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,907
Nah, I'm not hungry.

110
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,117
Got it.

111
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:22,288
If you don't mind,
I'll stop by the convenience store.

112
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,499
Haven't had a bite to eat
since last night.

113
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,683
Hmm…

114
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,894
So, she was alive up until then.

115
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,480
So her estimated time of death…

116
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:51,317
has to be sometime
between 10:10 p.m. and 11:30 p.m.

117
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,653
Could you show us the B3 parking lot too?

118
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:54,737
Sure.

119
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:10,044
How come we can't see when she's parking?

120
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,589
There's no coverage there, sir.

121
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:14,591
We're aware of it.

122
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,176
Residents have been complaining,

123
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,970
so we were going to install
more cameras, but, well…

124
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,890
I want you to check the dashcams

125
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:24,100
of all the cars
parked on B2 as well, Choi.

126
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,980
All, like, every single car?

127
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,900
Hey, remember
that Korea's the republic of CCTVs,

128
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,985
and as detectives, we have to check them.

129
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,738
Well, I know we check 'em.

130
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,449
CCTVs aren't the same
as dashcams though, right?

131
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:44,287
You joined Violent Crimes
about a month ago, correct?

132
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:48,458
CCTVs, dashcams, doesn't matter.
Search every floor.

133
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,461
And from now on,
eat your meals before working with me.

134
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,422
You never have a response,

135
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,633
which is why they say
Millennials are so rude.

136
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,134
Understood, sir.

137
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,431
Aren't we going?

138
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,353
Can you check one more thing for me?

139
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:11,105
Could you show me the shared entrance
beginning from around

140
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:13,983
10:10 p.m. and 11:30 p.m.?

141
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,109
Sure.

142
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,658
- Please fast-forward it.
- Yeah.

143
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,661
Yeah, right there.

144
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:26,788
Here?

145
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:28,623
Her?

146
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,106
Wow.

147
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,900
Will I ever get to live
in a palace like this one?

148
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,112
No signs of a robbery.

149
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,865
Seems like
nothing was even touched, right?

150
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,284
I don't think they set foot in here.

151
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,164
- Oh. Hey, buddy. Come here.
- Why is there a dog here?

152
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,458
Nothing unusual
from the apartment shopping center.

153
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,085
I struck out
with the parking lot cameras too.

154
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,588
I think they knew
where the blind spot was.

155
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,298
That's the only spot we can't see.

156
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,467
We're attempting to get
some dashcam footage,

157
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,595
but these rich folks just ignore me.
They won't cooperate.

158
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:09,348
Come on, you thought they would?
They're all basking in the lap of luxury.

159
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:13,019
Hey, the rich people here,
they make the most money in the country.

160
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,772
Well, there's even a doggy daycare here,

161
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:19,358
and for 20,000 won each,
there's even ice cream for dogs.

162
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,944
Holy shit. Doggy ice cream for 20,000?

163
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,613
Jeez, that's crazy.

164
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:27,283
Team One, you check the MO
against other ex-convicts.

165
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,328
Check her phone records
for the past six months, okay?

166
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,747
And Choi, do your best
to get dashcam footage.

167
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,750
- Detective Kim, go to the whiskey bar.
- Yes, sir.

168
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,712
Hey, this is Lieutenant Kim,
Violent Crimes, Unit 2.

169
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:43,341
At what time did you get the call
for the Hangang Street incident

170
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,592
in The One City?

171
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,803
11:35 p.m.?

172
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,056
Is it possible to send
those call recordings now?

173
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,724
New recording 34

174
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,559
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

175
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:56,020
<i> Hi, I'm on Hangang Street,</i>
<i>The One City.</i>

176
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,522
<i>I'd like to report something.</i>

177
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,190
<i>Go ahead, I'm listening.</i>

178
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,192
<i>Looks like there's a dead woman here.</i>

179
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,361
- <i>Sorry, where?</i>
- <i>Wasn't an accident either.</i>

180
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,822
<i>She was killed.</i>
<i>Building A's parking lot, B2.</i>

181
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,743
- <i>There's a dead woman here.</i>
- <i>Sorry, where?</i>

182
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,454
<i>Wasn't an accident either.</i>
<i>She was killed. Building--</i>

183
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:14,789
<i>There's a dead woman here.</i>

184
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,958
<i>- Sorry, where?</i>
<i>- Wasn't an accident either.</i>

185
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,168
<i>She was killed.</i>
<i>Building A's parking lot, B2.</i>

186
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,046
Crime Scene Investigation

187
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,548
I ran it through the database.

188
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,217
And it came up empty.
Found absolutely nothing.

189
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,635
Yeah, that's what I thought.

190
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,263
They were thorough,
so didn't expect anything to be found.

191
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:31,973
What case is this?

192
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,225
Something that seems simple
on the surface,

193
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,893
but in reality, it's not.

194
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,729
Appreciate it. Enjoy the latte.

195
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,318
Ena Yoon sent a gift

196
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,237
E-card 50,000-won gift card

197
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,992
Lieutenant Hansaem Kim
Violent Crimes Unit 2

198
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,120
Sunshine Mental Health Clinic

199
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,705
Is Dr. Lee in right now?

200
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:05,882
Hello.

201
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:09,343
I'm Lieutenant Kim,
do you remember me?

202
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,016
We've met once before about Ms. Ena Yoon.

203
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,352
I understand if you've forgotten me.

204
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:27,153
Has Ms. Yoon ever mentioned a puzzle piece
or shown this picture of it to you?

205
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,740
Since you're her doctor and all.

206
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,369
As we've discussed in the past,

207
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,122
without the written consent
of the patient,

208
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,498
no information can be shared.

209
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,627
The patient and the puzzle are related
is what you're saying.

210
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:49,967
What did she tell you?

211
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,845
I can't say, sir. I'm sorry.

212
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,308
And what if that patient killed someone?

213
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:01,437
I can't answer your questions,
even when they're hypothetical.

214
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,648
You haven't changed at all, you know that?

215
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,150
And neither have you.

216
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,076
The whiskey bar. Did you go yet?

217
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:18,204
Ah, well…
the whiskey bar is still closed.

218
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,207
So, I was tracking
a suspect's whereabouts.

219
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,875
What suspect?

220
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,128
Lieutenant Yoon?

221
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,797
Listen to me.

222
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,550
There's no way she's the first witness
for two homicides.

223
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,343
How could that be a coincidence?

224
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,053
You think our profiler's the killer?

225
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,805
She doesn't even know the victim.

226
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,349
Are we supposed to share minds
with criminals now?

227
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,520
Just track the victim's activities.

228
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:47,775
If you truly believe that it's Yoon,
maybe their whereabouts will coincide.

229
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,486
Fine, I'll focus on the victim.

230
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,160
Hi.

231
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:05,001
But why did you go to the clinic?
And how'd you know I go to that exact one?

232
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,752
I've known for a while now.

233
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:09,171
Come on. Just ask me already.

234
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,215
Oh, shall I?

235
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,176
Why ring a stranger's doorbell
after she's murdered?

236
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,636
Maybe so I don't get caught?

237
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,305
Finally confessing?

238
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,932
You didn't find anything
at the crime scene, right?

239
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,017
I'm sure.

240
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,395
And the estimated time of death
is reportedly before 10:32.

241
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,857
And why should I tell you anything at all?

242
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,066
Don't have to.

243
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:36,365
So, they killed her,
then sent me a piece again.

244
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,075
You're still on that?

245
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:39,619
It's a serial killer.

246
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,871
I'm telling you, it has to be,
with how meticulous

247
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,581
and clinical they've been.

248
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:47,418
The puzzle piece had a woman drawn on it,
then a woman was killed after.

249
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:50,504
It's logical, then you must agree.

250
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:53,174
Also, it's clear
their patterns are consistent.

251
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:56,844
A clean murder,
with precision and singular focus.

252
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:59,138
Oh, some crazy fucker kills a woman,

253
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,974
then sends puzzles to you,
is that what you're saying?

254
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,142
That right?

255
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,271
Why send these puzzles to me, huh?

256
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:09,607
What's up with those weird drawings?

257
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,525
I wonder what their motives are.

258
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,986
Any theories? Who could it be?

259
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,322
You're writing a thriller right now?

260
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,069
Hello.

261
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:59,031
I'm Lieutenant Kim with
the Hangang Police, Violent Crimes Unit.

262
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:04,203
Well, earlier today,
I had a bartending licensing exam,

263
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,747
so I had to get off work early.

264
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:07,998
The owner…

265
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,713
She had mentioned she had things to do,
so she headed out early too.

266
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,256
What time did you clock out?

267
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,382
9:00 p.m.

268
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,885
Did Ms. Lee…

269
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:23,597
mention that she was gonna meet up
with someone or anything like that?

270
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,224
No.

271
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,478
No CCTV inside, huh?

272
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:33,524
The owner made it so that privacy
was a top priority, so no cameras.

273
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,402
When you got off work,
how many customers were still here?

274
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,195
About four people.

275
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:41,198
And the owner spent a lot of time
with one of the customers.

276
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:43,826
- Safe to assume that it was a man?
- Yes.

277
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,119
Do you know who he is?

278
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:48,706
I don't. I barely know his name.

279
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:52,418
Oh, I think my friend Jeoungun would know.

280
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:55,379
But as the manager, she's probably asleep

281
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,715
since we're open late
into the early morning.

282
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,967
Is it possible to get
your manager's number?

283
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,135
Of course.

284
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:09,226
4 customers, spoke to 1 customer

285
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,311
Jeoungun

286
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,188
Also,

287
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,439
by any chance…

288
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:16,317
does this person look familiar?

289
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,571
Never seen her here.

290
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,198
I see.

291
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:28,412
Well, if you remember anything else,
use this number to contact me.

292
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,581
Thank you.

293
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,444
"Call history"

294
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:02,279
<i>A call at 8:00 p.m.</i>

295
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:04,824
<i>Then a missed call</i>
<i>from the same number at 9:45.</i>

296
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,035
<i>That's the end of her call log.</i>

297
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,620
<i>Then she was found dead.</i>

298
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,818
<i> Yes, this is Hyeun Hogeun.</i>

299
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:43,904
<i>Who's this?</i>

300
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,615
<i>Anyone there? Hello?</i>

301
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,535
<i>Who the hell is this?</i>

302
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,371
<i>I can't hear you, so I'm hanging up.</i>

303
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,290
Congratulations on your promotion

304
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,712
Miyoung Lee is dead?

305
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,591
The owner of the Griffin, right?

306
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:05,843
Yes, sir.

307
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:08,679
I'm a regular.

308
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:13,434
That's been my go-to spot
for the past two years.

309
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,937
For the first time,
I called for a reservation.

310
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:18,981
That's the missed call.

311
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,150
I called to cancel that reservation.

312
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,985
She didn't pick up, so I left it.

313
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,863
So, you're saying it wasn't possible
to cancel your reservation?

314
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:29,491
You could've sent a text, but didn't.
There a reason why?

315
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,285
Do I have to have a reason?

316
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,829
She didn't pick up, so I couldn't cancel.
End of story.

317
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,707
Why are you questioning me?

318
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,001
I said I didn't go.

319
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,009
If you were trying to reserve a room…

320
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,595
you must've planned
to meet someone, right?

321
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,223
Why, you little shit.

322
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:56,143
Is this necessary?

323
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,354
To tell you every detail of my life?

324
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:19,333
So, you called to cancel the reservation,
but on the day of the crime,

325
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:22,169
I discovered that some whiskey
was reserved under your name.

326
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,712
Still claiming you weren't there?

327
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,007
How many times have I told you?

328
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:28,467
I wasn't there.

329
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,636
Hansaem Kim. Enough.

330
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,473
Chief, is there anything more
you want to tell us?

331
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,849
Not really.

332
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:39,144
I'd like an official statement, Chief.

333
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:43,732
Statement

334
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,234
Here's the form.

335
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,944
Please fill it out when you can.

336
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:07,589
Ena Yoon

337
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,884
Hey, what's going on?

338
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:14,054
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>
<i>Chief Hyeun is a regular here.</i>

339
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:17,516
<i>He reserved a room yesterday,</i>
<i>but never showed up.</i>

340
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,476
How come the whiskey was reserved

341
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,895
under Chief Hyeun Hogeun's name
yesterday then?

342
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:23,313
Well, that's because

343
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:25,774
people who are close friends
share their liquor here

344
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,317
as long as they let them know.

345
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:30,279
I see. And do you happen to know
who the last customer was

346
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,031
that spoke with Ms. Lee that night?

347
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:36,785
Well, it's hard to remember the names
of all the customers who visit here.

348
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,622
Hmm… I do remember him being pretty big.

349
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:43,667
<i>Ah, the customer had a large build, huh?</i>

350
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:46,503
Yeah, seemed like he was an officer.

351
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:51,216
<i>He's been to the bar before.</i>
<i>Uh, with Chief Hyeun.</i>

352
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,344
- A police officer?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

353
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,056
Officers like to come here.

354
00:25:58,057 --> 00:25:59,892
Hangang's where you're stationed, right?

355
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,063
<i>You'd probably find this guy</i>
<i>by just asking around there.</i>

356
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,066
Got it, thank you.

357
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,920
So, what's up?

358
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,588
I'm usually the one who calls.

359
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:33,592
Today's been… quite hectic.

360
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:34,676
Miyoung Lee…

361
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,512
What kind of person was she?

362
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,098
Is my uncle connected to her?

363
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,475
Why are you asking me that?

364
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:45,020
I know things about you,
and it's more than you think.

365
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:47,815
Like, the last person
who called Miyoung Lee was you.

366
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:52,444
Well, that much is true.
But why are you bringing up your uncle?

367
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,491
Miyoung Lee and my uncle.
Did they know each other?

368
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,577
Beats me, I don't know.

369
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:02,871
Why are you asking?

370
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:05,207
So, you're saying
my uncle may have known her,

371
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,417
but the three of you never met up, right?

372
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,545
'Kay, that's all I need.

373
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:13,924
Were you the one who killed her?

374
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,467
Come on!

375
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:18,011
Stop at three drinks max, okay?

00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:21,074
Don't tell me you were there too.

382
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:24,578
It was the Chief's inauguration.
Everyone visited together.

383
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,079
Why didn't you say anything?

384
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:28,957
I'm sorry.
Thought it'd give you the wrong idea.

385
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:31,335
Let's get this over with.

386
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:32,794
You can start with me.

387
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,548
So, you went often, huh?

388
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,260
Where were you two days ago,
around 10:00 p.m.?

389
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:42,596
Home, of course, why?

390
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,556
Track my phone if you don't believe me.

391
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:46,725
I'll confirm that later.

392
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,062
Have you ever met with the victim,
just you two?

393
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:53,690
You think I'm crazy? Meet her alone?
What kind of bullshit question is that?

394
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:56,193
Were you close
with the victim named Miyoung Lee?

395
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,528
The owner's name is Miyoung Lee, huh?

396
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:00,447
I haven't ever seen her face before.

397
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:03,116
<i>I only went</i>
<i>because the chief wanted to, okay?</i>

398
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,368
<i>You think it was my idea?</i>

399
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:07,287
Of course I know that.
This is just due diligence.

400
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:08,664
Hey, hold the door.

401
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:10,832
- Better not take long.
- Yes, sir.

402
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,709
Uh, thank you, sir.

We'll be careful, sir.

411
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:32,706
<i>A woman in her forties was found dead</i>
<i>in the underground garage</i>

412
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:35,083
<i>of a mixed-use apartment complex in Seoul.</i>

413
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,335
<i>The police have launched an investigation.</i>

414
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:39,504
<i>Without any prime suspects to be found,</i>

415
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:41,506
<i>there are suspicions</i>
<i>that the police officers</i>

416
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,383
<i>of the jurisdiction are involved,</i>

417
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:46,219
<i>which has only been drawing</i>
<i>more attention to the case.</i>

418
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:48,055
<i>Reporter Jung is on the scene.</i>

419
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:50,390
<i>I'm reporting live</i>
<i>from that parking garage</i>

420
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:52,309
<i>located in Hangang-gu, Seoul.</i>

421
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:55,020
<i>A report was received</i>
<i>on the night of the 25th</i>

422
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:58,523
<i>that Lee was found murdered</i>
<i>inside a parked car.</i>

423
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,567
<i>The officers who went to the scene</i>

424
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:04,529
<i>have secured CCTV and dashcam footage</i>
<i>of the surrounding area,</i>

425
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:06,948
<i>but they have yet to identify a suspect.</i>

426
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:10,494
<i>Meanwhile, it was revealed</i>
<i>that Hangang Station's police officers</i>

427
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:13,914
<i>have received multiple favors</i>
<i>in the whiskey bar named the Griffin,</i>

428
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,749
<i>that was also owned by the victim.</i>

429
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:18,043
<i>The police officers</i>
<i>who received those favors</i>

430
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:21,421
<i>are reportedly from the Violent Crimes</i>
<i>and Community Order Division,</i>

431
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:24,132
<i>with at least seven</i>
<i>to eight officers involved.</i>

432
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:27,302
<i>The Hangang Police Station</i>
<i>is not responding to phone calls</i>

433
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:31,515
<i>or answering questions from the press</i>
<i>asking about their involvement.</i>

434
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:58,583
- Look at this fucking asshole.
- Isn't he on our side? Jeez.

435
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:01,753
- The prick thinks he's a hotshot.
- Just seeing his face pisses me off.

436
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:05,757
Let's see where he ends up
with all that "amazing investigating."

437
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:07,843
He doesn't trust any of us.

438
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,262
He's sure got a knack
for stirring shit up.

439
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:15,433
I brought us coffee. Feel free.

440
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:17,018
Appreciate you.

441
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,854
You get any sleep?

442
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:19,980
Enough.

443
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,731
There's condensed milk in mine, right?

444
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:23,191
Of course, man.

445
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:25,443
- Go give this to the captain for me?
- Yep.

446
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,285
Having a nice morning, huh?

447
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:38,123
Wow. Not a care in the world.

448
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:43,837
Fake news and rumors
running rampant out there.

449
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,674
I guess that doesn't matter to you guys.

450
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:50,552
All this bullshit and you guys
are enjoying a coffee break, huh?

451
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,596
Why aren't you solving this case?

452
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,057
I'm sorry. We'll close it ASAP, sir.

453
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:58,476
By the end of the week.

454
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,853
Get your shit straight.

455
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,485
You were chomping at the bit
when you started this case.

456
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:10,405
You run out of steam or what?

457
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,365
Doing my best, sir.

458
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:26,004
Well, it's already Friday, so…

459
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,215
…guess we're not going home this weekend.

460
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:30,717
This sucks.
Stuck here all weekend?

461
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,801
Yes, Ms. Yu.

462
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:35,764
<i>Hey, Lieutenant Kim, that guy</i>
<i>that you were asking about before?</i>

463
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,183
<i>Uh, the last customer</i>
<i>that spoke to my boss?</i>

464
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,392
Yeah?

465
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:42,270
<i>I was just tidying up here and…</i>

466
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:45,106
I found the name of the customer
who reserved that whiskey.

467
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,441
So, who is it?

468
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:49,986
Looks like his name is Tae Dongsu.

469
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:53,156
From the Seoul Regional
Investigation Team.

470
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,616
<i>It's all coming back to me.</i>

471
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,826
<i>I remember him</i>
<i>taking a shot of Chief Hyeun's</i>

472
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,246
<i>25-year-old Laphroaig whiskey that day.</i>

473
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:01,414
That helps me a lot, thanks.

474
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:21,268
Seoul Metropolitan Police

475
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,147
Oh. Hey, guys.

476
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,986
Let's go in. I'll introduce you
to the whole team inside.

477
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,408
Sorry, we're here to ask
about Miyoung Lee.

478
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,788
Where should we do this?

479
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:43,748
Somewhere private?

480
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:53,008
The last person she saw
before she died was me.

481
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,467
Is that what you're saying?

482
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:05,186
Have you spoken to our chief at all
about this case?

483
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,856
We may be close friends and all…

484
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,692
We never discuss our cases though.

485
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,699
On the day of the incident,
why'd you meet with Ms. Lee?

486
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:20,327
To drink whiskey and enjoy a cigar or two.

487
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:22,245
Why? Is that illegal?

488
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:24,205
Did you see her after I left?

489
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,833
- Yeah.
- Alone?

490
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:28,543
Yes, alone.

491
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,837
You sure you didn't have plans
with Chief Hyeun?

492
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,505
For God's sake.

493
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:36,926
I had plans that day to meet with you,
so why would I ask Hogeun to come by, huh?

494
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:40,430
Especially when I know
you guys pretty much hate each other.

495
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:44,559
Am I a suspect?

496
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,688
Do you think I'm suspicious?

497
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,691
Should I be suspicious of you?

498
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:57,322
Miyoung said
that she had to take off early…

499
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,742
so I only had three shots of whiskey.

500
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,244
And after that, I left.
It was just about 9:30.

501
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:05,330
According to my sources though,

502
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,582
Ms. Lee left early
and you followed her outside.

503
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,709
Man, I didn't follow her outside.

504
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:13,630
I just wanted fresh air, so I took a walk.
To sober up a little.

505
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:16,341
Did you not drive your car that day, sir?

506
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,427
After you and I met up,
I dropped off my car at home,

507
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,137
then walked to the bar, okay?

508
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:23,390
It's only a 10-minute walk.

509
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:26,935
The apartment I moved into
is right there, you know that.

510
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:32,816
All right.

511
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:36,069
I'll check on that.

512
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,738
How'd you come to know Ms. Lee?

513
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:42,659
What kind of a question is that?

514
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,828
What'd she mean to you?

515
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,125
Absolutely nothing.

516
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,836
And I'll confirm that too.

517
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:03,263
- Are we done?
- Yes, sir.

518
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,432
Fuck off.

519
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:21,489
Jeez. Man, I know
instant coffee isn't healthy,

520
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,324
but I've been drinking it like water.

521
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,412
That'll be what kills us,
am I right?

522
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:30,957
What?

523
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,251
Something wrong?
All day you've been serious.

524
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:37,046
Ah, it's nothing. I'm okay.

525
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,507
I bet it's because of that case,
messing with you.

526
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:40,675
Forget about it.

527
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,635
The blood and violence
are part of the job,

528
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:44,512
so don't let it get to you.

529
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:47,891
I hear that case
still doesn't have a suspect yet.

530
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:50,643
I expected it to be open and shut,
but guess not.

531
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:08,369
This is Lieutenant Kim from Violent--

532
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:09,871
<i>Hey, Lieutenant Kim.</i>

533
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,582
Sergeant Nam, hey. Why'd you call?

534
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,336
Well, it's because I have something
I wanted to ask you.

535
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:17,504
<i>Go ahead.</i>

536
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:19,672
It's about The One City case.

537
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:21,382
The estimated time of dea…

538
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:26,721
We're positive she was murdered
inside the parking lot, right?

539
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:29,098
Have you found anything new
that might verify that?

540
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:30,850
No, there's nothing new really.

541
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:32,811
But, um… why do you ask?

542
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:34,646
Coming up empty, huh?

543
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:37,649
Okay. Well, never mind then.
Thanks anyway.

544
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,574
Lieutenant Kim.

545
00:38:57,794 --> 00:38:58,837
Sir?

546
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:02,924
Chief Hyeun and Commander Tae
don't have alibis yet, right?

547
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,259
Yeah.

548
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,678
I double-checked the apartment's CCTV.

549
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,430
They both arrived
after the estimated time of death.

550
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,851
What's this?

551
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:14,894
There's something missing.

552
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:19,274
You can't enter The One City
without a resident card,

553
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,817
but it's nowhere to be found.

554
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,987
The culprit only took one thing.
That card.

555
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:26,489
You said there were no signs of a robbery.

556
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:27,615
Yeah, I did.

557
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:30,201
Why'd the culprit only take
her resident card?

558
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,162
I think the killer might know her.

559
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:34,998
Hmm.

560
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:37,500
Resident card.

561
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,921
Yes?

562
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,049
Yeah, this is Jungho speaking.

563
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,261
Hospital?

564
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,306
Ah, hold on a second.

565
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,100
Yeah, sure.

Criminal linkage with profiling

570
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:10,617
Pleased to meet you all.

571
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,703
Today, we'll be discussing
criminal linkage with profiling.

572
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:16,873
I work with the Criminal Analysis team.
My name's Lieutenant Yoon.

573
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,041
Thanks for having me.

574
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:28,635
Seoul metropolitan serial killer
Donghwi Han

575
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,180
I'm sure you all know
the Han Donghwi case.

576
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:36,434
This case involved incidents
in multiple areas.

577
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,895
Since there wasn't a common thread
connecting them all,

578
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:42,398
the station in charge determined
that it wasn't a serial killer.

579
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:47,278
Though, I discovered a key link
that suggests it actually was.

580
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:49,364
What do you think the common thread is?

581
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:51,157
Any guesses?

582
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:55,578
Maybe it's that he only targeted women?

583
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:56,663
Not quite.

584
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:00,792
Every incident occurred past midnight
and took place in dark alleyways.

585
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:04,504
Uh… yes, it's true that all three murders
happened in dark alleyways

586
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,838
that were missing cameras,

587
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:09,300
but crimes in alleyways are common,
so it doesn't really stand out.

588
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:10,593
Is it 'cause…

589
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:12,637
- they all died the same day?
- Bingo!

590
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,514
They all occurred on Wednesday.

591
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:17,183
But I don't believe
that the weekday's enough to determine

592
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:19,394
that it's a serial killer, ma'am.

593
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,187
Might need more commonalities.

594
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,439
The victims were all women,
but different ages.

595
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:26,734
The weapons used, and MO,
and the regions were all different.

596
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:27,819
That's all true.

597
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:31,990
However… there is one crucial detail
you're missing

598
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:34,492
that linked these three cases together.

599
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:37,245
What do you think
is the final piece of the puzzle?

600
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,250
"Go to hell."

601
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:52,301
This is what Han Donghwi said…

602
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:57,056
all those poor survivors,
repeatedly, like a broken record.

603
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:01,144
And so, I focused on the symbolic meaning
of the word "hell".

604
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:04,105
What could possibly be the reason

605
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:08,026
why this man chose to spew out
this specific word?

606
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:14,157
It was church, of course.

607
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,035
Early morning services are on Wednesdays.

608
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:19,787
And those services
were being held at local churches.

609
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:22,707
All of the alleyways
where he committed the crimes

610
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,208
were on the way to a church.

611
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:27,879
This murderer… held a grudge

612
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,339
against all women who were churchgoers.

613
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:34,093
And it's a high probability
that these killings were premeditated.

614
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,721
You see, Han Donghwi's wife…

615
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,932
went to early morning services
on a Wednesday,

616
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:43,394
leaving his only son home alone,
who perished in a fire.

617
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:45,063
This was the church's fault to him,

618
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:48,024
so he killed anyone
who even looked close to his wife.

619
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,359
As you can see, his MO changed,

620
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:53,446
but him saying "hell"
was clearly his signature.

621
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:57,033
And so, when the signature of a culprit
stands out like this,

622
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,786
crime linkage in profiling can be vital.

623
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:04,832
That said, it can be dangerous to assume
all cases are serial killers.

624
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:10,463
You need hard evidence
such as the MO or their signature.

626
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:21,307
<i>That's the signature.</i>

<i>The woman in the drawing</i>
<i>on the puzzle is Miyoung Lee.</i>

<i>The culprit aimed with precision</i>
<i>for the carotid artery,</i>

630
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:35,196
<i>and pulled with their full strength</i>
<i>from the back seat.</i>

631
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:40,451
<i>There are traces of her</i>
<i>resisting in the car,</i>

632
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:43,079
<i>but not a single fingerprint was found.</i>

633
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:47,542
<i>The culprit must've had gloves on</i>
<i>when they strangled her.</i>

634
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:57,009
<i>It's crystal clear</i>
<i>that their only intention was to kill.</i>

635
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,470
<i>There were no wasted movements.</i>

636
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:01,973
<i>Just enough to get the job done.</i>

637
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,058
<i>They're pretty clever. </i>

638
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:05,893
<i>Cold and calculating too.</i>

639
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:11,274
<i>If the culprit is the same</i>
<i>as my uncle's killer,</i>

640
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,276
<i>there has to be a common thread.</i>
