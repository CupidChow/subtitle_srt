1
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:43,961


2
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:12,489


3
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:41,393
Uncle.

4
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,565
Uncle?

5
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:29,770
Nine Puzzles

6
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:34,566
We'll sweep the outer perimeter.

7
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,193
Start taking statements.

8
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,737
Team 3, go the other way around.

9
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,947
<i>This is a police investigation.</i>

10
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,283
- Yes, sir.
<i>- Follow police instructions.</i>

11
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,660
<i>- This is a police investigation.</i>

12
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:48,413
Hey, stay here, control the scene.

13
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,582
Hey! Any security footage?

14
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,001
No, sir. We only just got here.
We don't have it yet.

15
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:56,463
Round up any CCTV
and dashcam footage covering this area,

16
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,507
- and look for any witnesses.
- Yes, sir.

17
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,467
Have you looked into
getting the power back?

18
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,302
Focus on finding witnesses first.

19
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,054
Ena, come this way.

20
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,810
Give me something to work with.

21
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,812
Have we discovered the means of entry?

22
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,815
Be methodical. Don't overlook anything.

23
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,526
Stabbed in the carotid artery.

24
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,153
As for the time of death…

25
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,823
about 9:00 p.m.

26
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,325
- He was killed an hour ago?
- Mm-hmm.

27
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,286
Shit.

28
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:33,250
Uh, did you know the victim?

29
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,921
He's the ex-station chief. Donghoon Yoon.

30
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,300
He was my supervisor.

31
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,596
This is one hell of a first case.

32
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,473
Got your hands full, rookie.

33
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,145
All right,
horizontally… 340.

34
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,314
Vertically…

35
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,693
Hey, can I get some light here?

36
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,321
Over here.

37
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:06,741
Uh, I don't see any prints.

38
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,745
Nothing here either.

39
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,625
Have you checked the bookcase?

40
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,127
Yeah. Nothing.

41
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,885
It's weird there's no prints.

42
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,971
I'll do another sweep.

43
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,808
Yeah, let me help you.

44
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:48,366
I'm sorry about this,
I know it's hard.

45
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:52,245
It's just so we can catch the one
who did this quickly, all right?

46
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:57,876
Do you remember what time it was
when you arrived home?

47
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,091
Uh…

48
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:08,970
Did you notice anything
that seemed out of the ordinary, like…

49
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,598
Uh…

50
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:16,978
Ena?

51
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:29,824
Uh… I mean, is there anything
that stood out to you, more or less?

52
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:32,410
Why do we have to do this now?

53
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:37,707
I don't remember anything…
after I went in the house.

54
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,214
Can't remember?

55
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,592
It was only a few hours ago.

56
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:49,678
Right.

57
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,810
Uh…

58
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,478
Well, how about this?

59
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:03,483
Let's talk about what you were doing
on your way back to the house.

60
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,902
You do recall
coming home from school, right?

61
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,905
What can you share with me about that?

62
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,825
What time did you leave school?

63
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,911
Around eight o'clock.

64
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,041
<i>When did you get home?</i>

65
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,128
<i>I took the bus home.</i>

66
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,507
Guess I got home around nine?

67
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,302
After that?

68
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,974
<i>I opened the gate</i>
<i>to enter the front yard.</i>

69
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,477
<i>Then entered the code to open the door.</i>

70
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,358
<i>I opened the door.</i>

71
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:52,115
And after that, I can't recall.

72
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,750
Um, then…
where does your memory start back up?

73
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,086
Let's pick it up there.

74
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,258
Our housekeeper lady was suddenly there.

75
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,970
I heard her calling out my name.

76
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,975
And I noticed I was standing in the den.

77
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,019
And then…

78
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,524
I remember seeing my uncle lying dead
on the living room floor.

79
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:32,280
That's all, I guess.

80
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,996
Crime scene photos
The victim's body, the crime scene

81
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,541
Six months ago,
the girl bought a three-piece set of awls,

82
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,794
then one of them was used to kill him.

83
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:48,213
Then there's a 13-minute gap
between when she got home

84
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,964
and when she called the cops.

85
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,843
Uh, no signs of a break-in
and no indication of a struggle.

86
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,221
Points to the killer knowing our victim.

87
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:59,140
Motive, some kind of dorm conflict?

88
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:00,850
And that's why you think she did it?

89
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:02,519
Yeah.

90
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,271
You don't have any hard evidence though.

91
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,856
- Huh?
- Look here.

92
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,026
That would give her about 10 minutes
to do it.

93
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,528
You really think it's possible?

94
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,779
It's not impossible.

95
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:16,116
Had she taken a shortcut from the bus stop
instead of the route she claims,

96
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,076
she could've shaved off 8 whole minutes.

97
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,328
21 minutes would be enough.

98
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,790
All right. Fine.

99
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,959
Why don't you go and talk to her then?

100
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:03,997
The victim, he didn't resist,
not even a little bit.

101
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,750
Despite the horrible pain he was in.

102
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:12,505
You said that you arrived home
at around nine, right?

103
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,675
Yeah.

104
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:19,262
The victim, Donghoon Yoon,
he was your uncle.

105
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,390
You know he was stabbed to death
with an awl.

106
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:26,394
And you're aware that…
only your fingerprints were found

107
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,062
on the awl that killed him, right?

108
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,774
Yeah.

109
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:35,737
Is it also true that you were arguing
with your uncle about your dorm?

110
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:38,615
Yeah.

111
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:42,952
And you were arguing over an inheritance.
Is that true?

112
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,246
That's not true.

113
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,378
Really?

114
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,059
Did you kill your uncle?

115
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,360
Let me ask you again.

116
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,112
Did you do it or not?

117
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:28,289
You're the only one who was home
at the estimated time of death.

118
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,049
I really don't know.

119
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,760
Seriously.

120
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:42,887
Damn.

121
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,099
Pretty darn convenient.

122
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,278
Mister…

123
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,281
I'm done talking tonight.

124
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,075
Can I go home now?

125
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,036
- Are you gonna catch him or what?
- Huh?

126
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,996
There's something I forgot.

127
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,123
Here you go.

128
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,126
It was on the floor in the den.

129
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,837
I think the killer left it behind.

130
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:38,479
10 years later

131
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:02,128
- What's wrong with her?
- Is she laughing?

132
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:09,635
Huh. Again?

133
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:13,014
How many times are you gonna jump off
before you're done?

134
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,685
Why do you like it so much?
It doesn't get old?

135
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,939
Every time I jump off,
it feels like I'm gonna die.

136
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:23,774
And that makes me feel super good.

137
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,111
Fair enough.

138
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:05,900
Huh?

139
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,156
It's not funny to you?

140
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,158
Isn't it ridiculous?

141
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:17,245
She murdered her husband
and puts a Bacchus bottle cap on the spot.

142
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,413
Guess she did that
'cause the field was too big.

143
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,874
I mean, she can't plant
sweet potatoes there anymore.

144
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,044
Uh, what part of that is funny?

145
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,713
The Bacchus bottle cap or the potatoes?

146
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,009
Don't you like listening to my stories?

147
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:33,970
I guess not.

148
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:35,888
You're kinda lame.

149
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:39,433
When we first met, you were young and fun,
but now you've gotten old.

150
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:48,150
I didn't think
that I'd never remember anything.

151
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:50,903
Those dreams…

152
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:52,697
Still having them?

153
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:55,575
Guess it'd be weird if I wasn't.

154
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:59,287
I pressed the keypad combination
for the front door.

155
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,751
Then I stepped on this puzzle piece.

156
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:11,132
And then the power came back on and I saw…

157
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,801
my uncle lying there on the floor.

158
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,596
It always ends there.

159
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,100
Something must have happened that night.

160
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,102
I just can't remember anything.

161
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,272
You know…

162
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,400
you might not remember
'cause there's nothing there.

163
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:32,778
Whoa!

164
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:35,823
You really have grown old.
You didn't talk like that back in the day.

165
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:36,991
Yeah.

166
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,451
I'm just trying something new

167
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,411
since you keep telling me
you can't recall.

168
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,580
You're a terrible shrink.

169
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,750
Your defense mechanism's getting worse.

170
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,753
Not only do you blurt out
whatever comes to mind,

171
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,338
you began bungee jumping.

172
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,090
Bungee jumping is bad?

173
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,718
I've given it some thought.

174
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,178
I think…

175
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,598
it could be a sign of regression.

176
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,643
It always happens to you
around this time of year.

177
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,980
Have you been socializing lately?

178
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:11,025
Do you… still have trouble interacting?

179
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,612
Oh, I'm doing great.

180
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,748
Well, actually, I'm not great.

181
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:31,128
It's like when I'm hanging out and stuff,
I'm not bothered by anything.

182
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:35,758
Then when I'm back home,
I go over every detail.

183
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,010
"Why did I act that way?"

184
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,346
"What if they all hate me
because I did that?"

185
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:43,015
Like that, you know?

186
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:52,191
Honestly, I'm scared.

187
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:57,738
I don't wanna go back… into that house.

188
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,790
- Have a nice day.
- Ms. Yoon.

189
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,419
Will you be attending the exhibition?

190
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,213
We'll see.

191
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,257
Get home safe.

192
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,239
I wanna try the chocolate one.

193
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,747
Here you go. Enjoy.

194
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,959
A meat pie to go for ya?

195
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,295
I heard this place was hot.

196
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,922
Guess people don't just come for the buns.

197
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,718
It's been a while, Ms. Yeom.

198
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,931
- Do I know you?
- You changed your nationality.

199
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,602
I wanna know what made you decide
to come back to Korea

200
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,437
after being away for 10 years.

201
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:13,647
Ah.

202
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,317
You're her husband,
aren't you?

203
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,194
I know you very well.

204
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,280
- Hey… Stop!
- Who the fuck are you?

205
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,783
- I'm police!
- Who sent you? Speak, damn it!

206
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:28,788
I'm police.

207
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:29,955
- Police?
- Okay.

208
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:32,833
- Calm down.
- Police officers don't have tattoos!

209
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,418
Calm down!

210
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:36,587
Calm down. Relax.

211
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,931
Calm down.
I think he really is a police officer.

212
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:48,849
I am a police officer.

213
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:50,768
Okay?

214
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:54,188
I'm not here…
I'm not here for you.

215
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,776
Calm down. Calm down.

216
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,528
What else is there? Um…

217
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:02,863
And…

218
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,699
Be careful. Okay?

219
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,077
Be careful.

220
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:13,833
All right, Ms. Yeom…

221
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,545
do you know what day it is today?

222
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:19,630
I have no idea.

223
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,340
Today…

224
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:25,219
is the 10th anniversary of the murder,
Ms. Ena Yoon's uncle,

225
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,595
Superintendent Yoon.

226
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,472
So let me ask again.

227
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,225
Why did you return to Korea?

228
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,143
I left Korea
because I didn't like it here,

229
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:35,145
and then returned because I missed it.

230
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:36,730
Good enough for you?

231
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,192
Your husband is
a Venezuelan national, right?

232
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:42,111
With a drug-related criminal record?

233
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,826
If it's okay with you,

234
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:53,664
could I speak with you a little about
Ms. Ena Yoon and that day 10 years ago?

235
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,044
<i>Did you notice anything off?</i>

236
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,171
<i>Maybe something she said?</i>

237
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:05,384
<i>I didn't really think anything of it…</i>

238
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:11,015
<i>but she said something</i>
<i>as she was leaving our room.</i>

239
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,061
That I was her alibi.

240
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:25,905
You know who she is?

241
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:28,324
I know all too well.

242
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,035
Hello?

243
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,079
Well, well.

244
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:36,665
Haven't seen you in a while, right?

245
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:39,251
So, uh, what brings you here today?

246
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:42,838
Oh, you guys were slacking off.
I was worried, is all.

247
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:46,342
Wear a bib next time at lunch.
You've got kimchi on your shirt.

248
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,968
Hmm?

249
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:51,764
And stick to three beers max, okay?
You can't handle more than that.

250
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,478
Wow!

251
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:01,231
The detective who can't catch the criminal
took the longest lunch break?

252
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:07,112
Your timing couldn't get
much better than this.

253
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:08,489
Your roommate's back in town.

254
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:09,907
Coincidence?

255
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,200
She's back in town?

256
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:12,910
What did she say?

257
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,537
Why are you so curious?
You guys not in touch?

258
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,339
You should buy new clothes.

259
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,466
You're out of date. Seriously.

260
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,238
Donghoon Yoon

261
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,533
Born August 25, 1969
Died October 25, 2013

262
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,041
Donghoon…

263
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,169
If you hadn't quit the force…

264
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,880
you probably wouldn't be dead right now.

265
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:09,967
Damn it.

266
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:12,803
If it hadn't been for that night…

267
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,555
It was a bad way to go.

268
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:22,646
Hey, I wanna know…
out of all the police stations nationwide,

269
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,940
why did you come back to Hangang Station?

270
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,234
Out of loyalty to a dead guy?

271
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,028
I know, right?

272
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:31,280
Out of all the places to get transferred…

273
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:34,324
That's life, huh? Ironic.

274
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,205
There's a guy that works for you…

275
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:43,042
Hansaem Kim. Do you remember him at all?

276
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,545
He was the one investigating that case
back then.

277
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,714
He was just a rookie.

278
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,340
Hansaem Kim?

279
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:52,509
He's a loose cannon.

280
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:54,678
The kid may have a few screws loose,

281
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:56,638
but he's not crazy.

282
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,682
He's a decent guy
once you get to know him.

283
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,601
Wait a second.

284
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,895
Does that idiot still think
Ena's a suspect?

285
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,066
Yeah, I guess he does.

286
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:11,904
After all, every one of Ena's
family members ended up dead.

287
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:16,950
Her mother, her father,
and even her only uncle.

288
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:19,453
I'd say that's a little unusual.

289
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:20,537
Donghoon Yoon

290
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:29,797
Seoul Metropolitan Police

291
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,123
You transferred
to Public Affairs on 12, right?

292
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:29,565
Captain, where are you?
I'm at the office. No one's here.

293
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,024
<i>What do you mean?</i>

294
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:32,526
<i>Did you forget again?</i>

295
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:35,153
<i>I told you to come</i>
<i>to the scene right away.</i>

296
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:36,613
<i>Hurry up and get over here.</i>

297
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:44,872
- Hi.
- You're here.

298
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:46,039
- Hey.
- Hello.

299
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:48,792
Here.

300
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,133
Do you think I'm pretending
not to remember anything?

301
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,342
- No.
- No.

302
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:58,719
No for me too.

303
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,304
That's good.

304
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:01,638
That's a relief.

305
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,266
Mm, so…

306
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,643
why haven't you caught the guy yet?

307
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:09,313
They only found the parents
and the older brother's prints,

308
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,398
which puts the parents
at the top of the list,

309
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:14,776
but proving they actually did it
is turning out to be a challenge.

310
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:19,406
Hmm-hmm-hmm.

311
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:20,782
I can see why.

312
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:23,243
Trouble is, there are
no signs of a break-in anywhere,

313
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:26,580
and I assume there are no acquaintances
with much of a motive to do it.

314
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,916
Family, friends from class,
and maybe a tutor.

315
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:31,084
That'd be everyone
a 10-year-old knows, right?

316
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:32,794
Why would anyone kill a 10-year-old?

317
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:35,923
They were so blinded with rage
that they wildly stabbed the victim

318
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:37,382
over and over again,

319
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:38,675
but after that,

320
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:40,636
the murder weapon
was cleaned and returned.

321
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,346
Why would they do that?

322
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:43,931
Got any idea?

323
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:45,807
And what calmed them down again?

324
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:49,645
Why? Why did they do that?

325
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,105
'Cause it's a force of habit.

326
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:00,280
The mom sure is a tidy person, huh?

327
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:02,407
I'll bet she hates having people over.

328
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,755
<i>First place in the mathematical Olympiad.</i>

329
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,216
<i>Took gold in an English competition.</i>

330
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:23,220
<i>The deceased victim was a younger sibling</i>
<i>who excelled over his older brother.</i>

331
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:27,641
<i>The older brother labeled</i>
<i>every one of his possessions.</i>

332
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,726
<i>Judging by the lilt of his handwriting,</i>

333
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:33,105
<i>he seems dejected</i>
<i>and suffers low self-esteem.</i>

334
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:37,401
<i>He wanted to assert ownership</i>
<i>over his possessions.</i>

335
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:42,489
<i>The older brother,</i>
<i>who discovered the body, said…</i>

336
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:47,369
<i>he opened the front door,</i>
<i>took his shoes off,</i>

337
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,329
<i>and headed straight for Junseo's room</i>

338
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:52,332
<i>to find his brother</i>
<i>had been stabbed with a knife.</i>

339
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:53,917
<i>He called his parents to tell them</i>

340
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:56,670
<i>that his brother had been stabbed</i>
<i>with a sharp object.</i>

341
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:59,172
<i>After that, he called the police.</i>

342
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:03,385
<i>Terrified, he exited the house</i>
<i>to wait for the police to arrive.</i>

343
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:07,222
<i>At first, he referred</i>
<i>to the victim as Junseo,</i>

344
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:10,267
<i>but then began referring to him</i>
<i>as his "younger brother."</i>

345
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,937
<i>He went out of his way</i>
<i>to call the knife "a sharp object."</i>

346
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:17,065
<i>It's rare for someone to switch up</i>
<i>their form of address in a sentence</i>

347
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:18,483
<i>without a good reason.</i>

348
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:19,818
<i>So why did he do it?</i>

349
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:24,448
<i>Could it be that he subconsciously wanted</i>
<i>to distance himself from the victim?</i>

350
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,912
<i>And then my mom rushed into Junseo's room,</i>

351
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,831
<i>looking like she had seen a ghost.</i>

352
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:36,752
<i>- And my dad's eyes were already red.</i>

353
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:40,756
<i>He had the exact same expression</i>
<i>during my grandpa's funeral.</i>

354
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,592
<i> He only gave</i>
<i>a brief testimony of the case,</i>

355
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,052
<i>but he went to great lengths</i>

356
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:48,388
<i>to give a detailed account</i>
<i>of his parents' reactions.</i>

357
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,725
<i>Could his little brother's murder</i>
<i>matter less to him</i>

358
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,894
<i>than his parents' reaction to it?</i>

359
00:30:56,271 --> 00:31:00,108
<i>An older brother who refers</i>
<i>to his own room as "Junseo's room."</i>

360
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:04,112
<i>And parents… who openly played favorites.</i>

361
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:09,576
I vote the older brother killed him.

362
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:10,952
What?

363
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:13,497
I'm heading out now.
See you guys at the office.

364
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,086
"Bitcoin"

365
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:21,296
Ugh,
who's making our valued rookie

366
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,006
run all these stupid errands, huh?

367
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,884
- What if he runs away?
- Oh, I didn't know I was valued.

368
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,969
Since when was that a thing, guys?

369
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:32,224
Uh, earlier, that woman who was in here.
Is she really a cop who killed someone?

370
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,810
You can't be a cop
and have a murder record.

371
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:38,396
She's an analyst for the Seoul
Metropolitan Police. Lieutenant Ena Yoon.

372
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:41,316
Ena Yoon? You're kidding me.

373
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,693
Isn't she the niece
of the murdered Superintendent?

374
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:45,278
How do you know that, rookie?

375
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:47,489
Oh, come on, sir. That case is famous.

376
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,574
I heard about it
while I was in the academy.

377
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,619
Anyway, could you stop
calling me "rookie"?

378
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,204
I'm too old for that.

379
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,581
What are you so upset about, huh?

380
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,125
You joined the force so late.

381
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,544
Fuck! Stupid shit is falling again.

382
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:01,878
God dammit.

383
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:03,713
Sir.

384
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:09,553
Our suspect in the net café case
retracted his testimony.

385
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:10,720
What?

386
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:12,764
He's now claiming
that he didn't do anything.

387
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,975
He says an accomplice
committed the murder.

388
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:17,060
Well, that sucks.

389
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:20,397
We busted our asses on that case.
What a load of shit.

390
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,190
So what are we going to do now?

391
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,193
We just prove
he didn't have an accomplice.

392
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:26,820
Don't jump to conclusions yet.

393
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,738
All right, Lieutenants Ro, An, and Choi,

394
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:30,532
I want you to dig into this accomplice.

395
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,368
Kim and I will operate
under the assumption that he acted alone.

396
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:36,163
Yes, sir.

397
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,291
Ena Yoon

398
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:42,210
Think this might look good on you

399
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,468
Think this might look good on you

400
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:57,726
There's strawberry cake in the fridge.

401
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,394
Coffee's on the table.

402
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:02,230
There's one Americano
and a cappuccino too.

403
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:04,900
Thanks as usual.

404
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,737
Hmm, she treats us better
than the department does.

405
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,322
Thanks for the drink.

406
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:16,661
You must have a lot of storage space
up there, Lieutenant Yoon.

407
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,496
You remember everyone's favorite coffee

408
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,708
and you also know which floor
everyone in this building is on.

409
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,294
I heard you pressed
everyone's elevator buttons again.

410
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:27,881
What good is that when she can't remember
anything that actually matters?

411
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,967
She's right. You should stop pressing
everyone's buttons like that.

412
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:32,260
Why do you say that?

413
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,679
'Cause people will think she's a weirdo.

414
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,932
She <i>is</i> a weirdo.

415
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:40,727
Being a weirdo
and being perceived as one are different.

416
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,609
Hey, you changed your makeup.

417
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:51,112
What were you doing?

418
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,032
What are you saying? Nothing's changed.

419
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:04,209
Oh, uh, we got candles.
Is it someone's birthday?

420
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:07,921
Oh, is today that day?

421
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:15,136
I don't know what day it is,
I'll just put them all on.

422
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,145
That's the Investigation Team.

423
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,314
They wanna know
when they'll get their report.

424
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:30,610
Mm… Ena, you might like to know that
the older brother is on the suspect list.

425
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:33,863
But he… claims he can't recall anything.

426
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:35,156
It's got your vibe.

427
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,952
He suddenly doesn't remember anything?

428
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:42,872
Guess I'll go talk to him then.

429
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:47,711
I'll tell them you're coming.

430
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,597
Wallet.

431
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,265
Car keys.

432
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:17,741
I've never met a profiler.

433
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:20,493
Are you like an investigator?

434
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:23,455
No, not really. We're kinda like backup.

435
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,999
Right now, I'm just personally curious.

436
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,751
Curious about what?

437
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,502
I heard you can't remember things.

438
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:32,088
So?

439
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:34,424
I'm also having trouble
remembering something.

440
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,177
So why don't we take turns
talking about it?

441
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:42,474
I once wanted to talk to my uncle,

442
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:46,019
so I traveled by bus from my school
and went back to my house.

443
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:48,855
Junseo…

444
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,650
was home by himself,

445
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,777
so I came home right away after school.

446
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,821
I pressed the keypad combo
for the front door.

447
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:59,157
2-0-1-3-1-0-2-5.

448
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:02,744
I pressed the keypad combo
for the front door.

449
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,289
4-1-2-4-5-3-9-7.

450
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:09,751
I took my shoes off
and walked into the living room.

451
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,753
I take off my shoes…

452
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,005
and go to my brother's room.

453
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:20,011
It was dark 'cause of a blackout.

454
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:23,682
But I could feel something warm and wet
against my feet.

455
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,934
I'm opening the door to his room…

456
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,104
There's blood.

457
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,106
Everywhere.

458
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,987
This thing happened a few days ago.

459
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:41,574
But you're using
both past and present tense now.

460
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:45,245
What do you mean?

461
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,539
I mean you're referring to events

462
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:50,917
that occurred on the same day
as having occurred in the past,

463
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,378
while other events from the same day
are occurring now.

464
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:58,675
I was…

465
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,469
just trying to remember.

466
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:04,973
People only tend to refer to past events
in the present tense in two scenarios.

467
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,976
The first,
when they're constructing a story.

468
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,771
Second, when they're creating details
that they don't actually recall.

469
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,360
Which means that your version of events…

470
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:20,655
is taking shape in your head as we talk.

471
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:24,659
No, wait.

472
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:27,746
Do you really think I'm lying
about what happened to him?

473
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:29,831
I pressed the keypad combo
for the front door.

474
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,250
2-0-1-3-1-0-2-5.

475
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:37,672
I press the keypad on the front door.

476
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,885
I mean, I pressed it.

477
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:45,388
4-1-2-4-5-3-9-7.

478
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:47,849
I opened the door, took my shoes off,

479
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:50,602
and entered the darkened living room.

480
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,688
I take my shoes off
and open my brother's door.

481
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,232
It was pitch black in the living room

482
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:58,985
and I could feel something warm and wet
against my feet.

483
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,697
Inside the room… I mean, the kitchen…

484
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,204
Why did you go to the kitchen?

485
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:18,171
And the blood-stained clothing…

486
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,257
how did you get rid of them?

487
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,092
Actually,

488
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,428
I already know where they are.

489
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:36,272
Was your younger brother Junseo…

490
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,776
really dead when you found him?

491
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:49,160
He wasn't.

492
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,962
I'm back, everyone.

493
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,552
What'd you say to the kid
to make him confess?

494
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:08,429
Nothing special, really.
The two of us just clicked.

495
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,348
We had something in common.

496
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,809
So you made it all about you
in there, huh?

497
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,394
Don't do that again.

498
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:17,313
Why would you tell her to stop?
That's her greatest asset.

499
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:20,483
I know, right?
Wasn't that why you took me on here?

500
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:21,693
Am I wrong?

501
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:24,279
It wasn't 'cause my parents
owned a hospital, was it?

502
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,447
Yeah.

503
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:28,950
Your parents owning a hospital
is the reason.

504
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,452
Not like they're helping anyone now.

505
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:34,914
I'm gonna head home.
My report's on the messaging app.

506
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:39,836
Couldn't stop you if I tried.

507
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:51,931
Hey, that's enough.

508
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,309
At the cinerarium,

509
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,978
I think I had a little too much whiskey.
My stomach's sour.

510
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,688
You went to the cinerarium?

511
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,440
Then you could use a drink.

512
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,941
Oh, come on.

513
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:04,319
I just told you
that my stomach's totally fucked.

514
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,778
Are you trying to poison me or something?

515
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:07,572
It's been 10 years
and we haven't caught the killer.

516
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:08,823
This drink is our penance.

517
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,658
So that's what this is about.

518
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:13,369
All right,
let's drink till we're dead.

519
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:16,372
Donghoon, I'm sorry.

520
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:25,423
Man, time sure flies though.

521
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,800
Can't believe it's been 10 years.

522
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,931
Even this neighborhood's changed a lot.

523
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:37,810
Of all the places we went,
this is the only one left.

524
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:41,731
How's Ena doing?
Still come by the station?

525
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,274
She came by today.

526
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,944
You've gotta stop letting her do that.

527
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,404
She only comes to the station
'cause you let her.

528
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:51,491
Look, all I'm trying to do
is establish rapport.

529
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:56,788
I mean, I'm still convinced that girl
was a prime suspect in this case.

530
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,749
It's been 10 years and I still believe it.

531
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,294
So I guess you're thinking
she'll slip up someday,

532
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:05,171
am I right? Is that it?

533
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:08,216
Why would someone
who inherited so much money…

534
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:12,679
choose to join the force
and then become a profiler as well?

535
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,723
Seems a little weird, yeah?

536
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:19,686
It would be a good way for her
to keep track of the case.

537
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,271
Could be why she's following you.

538
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:30,947
Come on, the night's still young.
Let's go somewhere else.

539
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,074
Why are you in such a hurry
to get out of here?

540
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,575
Let's get another drink.

541
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,412
Sorry, but there's something I need to do.

542
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:40,164
Well, Jungho, where are you going?

543
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:43,167
Your ass is coming with me
to get another drink.

544
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:45,586
I still wanna talk shit
about your boss, okay?

545
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,715
Sorry, I also have to be somewhere.
Appreciate it though, guys.

546
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:50,299
Thanks. For everything.

547
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:52,385
Yeah, Batman there is busy tonight.

548
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,971
He's gotta take care of the kids
over at the orphanage.

549
00:41:56,723 --> 00:41:57,765
I'll be right back.

550
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,144
Where's he going?

551
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:02,895
"Taehwa Supermarket"

552
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:05,314
- Three popsicles.
- Oh, sure.

553
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,196
What the hell are you doing?

554
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:15,491
Commander, congrats on your promotion.

555
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,036
You're giving me a popsicle?

556
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:19,954
Come on, we're not little kids.

557
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:25,043
You guys are no fun. We should get drunk.

558
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,378
You got a ride?

559
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:30,590
Have a safe trip home then.

560
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,592
- I got somewhere to be.
- Mm.

561
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:21,099
<i>At 8:00 p.m. that night,</i>
<i>she leaves school without permission.</i>

562
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:25,978
<i>From the front gate to the bus stop</i>
<i>is a five-minute walk.</i>

563
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:35,404
<i>8:08 p.m. One hour</i>
<i>before Donghoon's death.</i>

564
00:43:35,905 --> 00:43:40,326
<i>She arrives at the bus stop</i>
<i>and boards Bus 147 three minutes later.</i>

565
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:50,670
This stop is International High School

566
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,859
<i>She's the only passenger on the bus.</i>

567
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:16,696
<i>There are five stops from school</i>
<i>to the one near her house.</i>

568
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,448
<i>Nothing happened during this time.</i>

569
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:55,318
<i> It takes 32 minutes for her</i>
<i>to arrive at the stop near her house.</i>

570
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:58,738
<i>And no one gets off with her. No one.</i>

571
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:27,475
<i>8:40 p.m. 20 minutes</i>
<i>before Donghoon's death.</i>

572
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:31,562
<i>Ena's house is a 20-minute walk</i>
<i>from the bus stop.</i>

573
00:45:32,355 --> 00:45:35,608
<i>12 if you take the shortcut</i>
<i>and shave off 8 minutes.</i>

574
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,902
<i>The timing was meticulous.</i>

575
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:42,907
<i>No CCTV, no witnesses, nothing.</i>

576
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:51,332


577
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:26,742
Excuse me, sir. Can we chat?

578
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:28,577
Do you live around here?

579
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,329
Huh?

580
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:31,747
Lieutenant Kim?

581
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:33,666
What are you doing here?

582
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,127
I'm just checking up on something.

583
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,421
How about you guys? You on patrol?

584
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:40,214
We're actually on a call.

585
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:43,467
Apparently, there's a suspicious man
lurking around the neighborhood.

586
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:46,470
So, you come across anything strange
around here, Lieutenant?

587
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:49,515
No, not really.
This is a pretty quiet neighborhood,

588
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:50,725
- right?
- Oh!

589
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:54,312
It was the hat that threw me off.
That's why I didn't recognize you.

590
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:56,022
Makes you look really different.

591
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:00,818
I called the police

592
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:03,821
'cause there was a stranger
trying to peek into our house.

593
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:06,949
Ah, you were talking about me.

594
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:13,289
Man, he's tenacious, right?

595
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:15,666
I mean, I get it,
but the dude's still obsessing

596
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,960
over a 10-year-old cold case.

597
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,088
I don't think he's completely human.

598
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:24,425
Well, they say
he doesn't make a move for no reason.

599
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,052
Apparently, he's quite thorough.

600
00:47:26,135 --> 00:47:27,803
He's too thorough.

601
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:31,599
And that's why
he hasn't gotten a promotion

602
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,934
since he first started 10 years ago.

603
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:39,357
You know a guy like that
ain't gonna impress the boss.

604
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:42,234
- Thanks for staying late.
- Of course.

605
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:43,944
Call me if you need me?

606
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:45,154
- You sure? Okay.
Mm.

607
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:46,906
- Drive safe.
Good night.

608
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:28,489
When you're in there,
can you grab me a cola? Thanks, man.

609
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:32,493
You've been drinking way too much soda,
you know? It's not good for you.

610
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:36,122
Maybe it's 'cause I quit smoking,
but I need something to take the edge off.

611
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:39,875
How about I get you a diet one, okay?

612
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:44,130
It's better than a pack of cigarettes.

613
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,824
Whoa, what the…

614
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:26,839
You're lucky
that I have to wait for my partner.

615
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:17,348
Uh… I was going to leave
before you got here.

616
00:50:32,071 --> 00:50:34,156
Is this Ms. Ena Yoon's house?

617
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:35,991
Yes, that's correct.

618
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:37,910
Hey, I'm Ena Yoon.

619
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:47,878
Hey, you! Who sent this letter?

620
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:49,380
How would I know?

621
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,610
Hansaem Kim

622
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:03,662
<i>The number</i>
<i>you have dialed is currently--</i>

623
