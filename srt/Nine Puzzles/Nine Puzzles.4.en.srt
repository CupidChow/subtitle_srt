1
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:24,525
Open the door.

2
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:29,821
I swear to God I'm gonna break down
this fucking door, you little bitch!

3
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:30,948
Let me in!

4
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:23,662
Nine Puzzles

5
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,789
Chimok Kang hasn't been home
since yesterday,

6
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,833
- so go file a travel ban first, Choi.
- Got it.

7
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,543
Especially 'cause he's a flight risk.

8
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,962
Track down Chimok's whereabouts,
and find his car too.

9
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,506
We're gonna head to the last place
his phone was pinged.

10
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,049
<i>Copy that, sir.</i>

11
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,396
Let's see if we can find Chimok's vehicle.

12
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,106
- I'll look over there.
- Sounds good.

13
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,128
118M 5221

14
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,514
I'm with Hangang Station
and my name's Capt. Yang.

15
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,767
I'd like to request
a forensics team, please.

16
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,143
<i>Chimok Kang.</i>

17
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,061
<i>Violent,</i>

18
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,272
<i>impulsive, and an addict.</i>

19
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,400
<i>Meticulous, elaborate, apathetic,</i>

20
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:36,818
<i>and extremely disciplined.</i>

21
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:40,989
<i>Those are the traits of the suspect</i>
<i>I'd profiled for the other cases.</i>

22
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,741
<i>But Chimok's the complete opposite.</i>

23
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,828
- That's him, right?
Yeah.

24
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,674
2023-11-01 Wednesday

25
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,053
Could you fast forward it?

26
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,732
Looks like
he doesn't return to his car.

27
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:16,983
Anything else, sir?

28
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,070
What's behind this rest stop?
Can you tell?

29
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,281
Well, I guess
there's a mountain. That's it.

30
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,973
The dashcam
and the navigation SD card are missing.

31
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,142
- And the toll transponder?
- Also gone.

32
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,769
So he must've gotten rid of anything
that might track him.

33
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,730
Think maybe he's faking a suicide?

34
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:40,066
Well, he was going to Seoul,
which is where he lives, so no.

35
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,318
Sir…

36
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,695
I think this was all planned out.

37
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,989
He made sure to clean his tracks.

38
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,036
Let me see.

39
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,713
- San, have you tracked his whereabouts?
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

40
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,924
Chimok Kang left the restaurant
last night at 2100 hours,

41
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:06,926
then went to Hannam-dong to his house.

42
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,680
After that, he left and got on the highway
towards Chuncheon.

43
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,140
Didn't Chimok's wife say

44
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:14,809
that he didn't come home last night
when we questioned her?

45
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,896
Yeah, so he must've turned the car around
after stopping by,

46
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,564
'cause not even five minutes later,

47
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:21,900
he was caught on CCTV
in front of his house.

48
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:25,570
After that, we caught him on the highway
at 2300 hours,

49
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,822
heading towards Yeongpyeong Reservoir.

50
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,950
Later, he shows up at 0229 hours
on the highway

51
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,369
coming from the reservoir.

52
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,871
Finally, he ends up at the rest stop
where you're at.

53
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,416
He spent more than three hours
over in that area.

54
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,503
Either he was fishing or cheating.

55
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,381
For now, let's head over to the reservoir.

56
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,466
San, why don't you meet us there?

57
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,942
Doesn't look like a good spot to fish.

58
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,492
<i>Sir, we got Mr. Kang's</i>
<i>credit card transaction history.</i>

59
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,661
<i>The last place he used it was…</i>

60
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,914
<i>Uh, in Yeongpyeong, at a "Y Hotel." Huh.</i>

61
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,042
<i>Isn't that where people go</i>
<i>to have affairs?</i>

62
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,304
I don't work the weekends,

63
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,974
so I'm not sure
if this guy was here yesterday.

64
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,935
Well, would you check
if a Chimok Kang shows up in your system

65
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,645
or had a reservation last night?

66
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:41,980
Gimme a minute.

67
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:44,399
Hmm…

68
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,611
Oh, yeah.

69
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,321
- There he is.
- He is?

70
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,032
Mr. Kang booked a one-night stay.

71
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:56,077
Wait. The system has him
checking out last night.

72
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:57,746
From which room?

73
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,467
What kinda freaky shit
were they doing in here?

74
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,970
I mean, what could they have done
to make a mess like this?

75
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,096
Sorry to interrupt you.

76
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,434
Lieutenant Kim.
Could I poke around a little bit?

77
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,855
Wait, did you finish cleaning already?

78
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,398
Not yet.

79
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,067
Just came in a second ago.

80
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,902
Could you hold off for now?

81
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,447
Huh.

82
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:57,991
What the hell is this?

83
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:01,035
How many more
is this fucker gonna kill, huh?

84
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,414
Think this guy's long gone.

85
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,041
Where'd they hide the victim's body?

86
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:10,670
I was able to confirm that he checked in
at 9:00 p.m. on the hotel kiosk.

87
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,422
Security footage is already erased.

88
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,382
The hotel does that
as part of their policy.

89
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:17,051
Policy is to erase footage
at the end of the day?

90
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,304
Privacy is huge for the average customer.

91
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:22,932
If he checked in at nine, he must have had
someone else check in earlier.

92
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,351
Have you talked to the night staff yet?

93
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,353
Oh, that reminds me to tell you…

94
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,899
a lot of complaints of really loud music
were reported last night

95
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,233
coming from the fifth floor.

96
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,651
- Loud music?
- Yeah.

97
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:36,279
And while the staff was figuring out
how to handle it,

98
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,697
at two in the morning,

99
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,699
a guy with red pants pulling a suitcase

100
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,951
was seen leaving
out through the hotel lobby.

101
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,077
A suitcase?

102
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:44,495
Yup, a red one.

103
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:47,165
His pants were red,
and had a matching suitcase with him.

104
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,335
Mr. Kang was wearing red pants, wasn't he?

105
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,389
- Ready?
- Going in!

106
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,071
Police officer

107
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,618
Unit 1! We're starting here!

108
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,621
Careful, the water's pretty deep!

109
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:13,501
<i>I'm certain that Chimok Kang</i>
<i>stormed in foaming at the mouth.</i>

110
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,504
<i>So there has to be</i>
<i>traces of a confrontation.</i>

111
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,181
<i>Not a scratch on the floor,</i>

112
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:28,474
<i>or a dent in the wall.</i>

113
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,935
<i>Not a single sign of a struggle.</i>

114
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,770
<i>The room looks untouched.</i>

115
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:35,690
<i>So he must've been able to restrain</i>
<i>his victim from the get-go.</i>

116
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,946
<i>How exactly did he subdue the victim?</i>

117
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:55,585
<i>Violence, impulsiveness, and addiction.</i>

118
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:02,091
<i>Chimok Kang isn't the type of guy</i>
<i>to plan things out in advance.</i>

119
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:31,204
Missing the hands and a head.

120
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,539
To ID them won't be easy.

121
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,375
Start with the hotel,
then search around the reservoir.

122
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,461
Think the body parts are hidden here?

123
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,004
We won't know until we check.

124
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:41,839
- Start looking.
- Yes, sir.

125
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,801
We got a lot of ground
to cover, so get going!

126
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,094
Yes, sir!

127
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,890
You in a freeze frame or something?
You're not moving.

128
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,601
Looks like I can't escape you.

129
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:58,022
The culprit and I have similar taste.

130
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:00,525
I bought a red one too. It's a nice color.

131
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,276
Beating me to the punch by confessing?

132
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,861
Can't be me. Different brand.

133
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:06,280
And it's not Chimok Kang either.

134
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:12,703
Are you saying
that Ms. Lee and Chimok aren't connected?

135
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:15,998
Or saying that Chimok didn't kill
that guy in the suitcase?

136
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,250
Yeah and yeah.

137
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,048
You guys must be looking into
Mr. Kang's history, right?

138
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,968
He was expelled from school
due to fighting

139
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,512
and couldn't hold down a job.
What does that tell us?

140
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,014
He was easily swayed and emotional.

141
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,100
But what about Ms. Lee's murderer?

142
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,144
Her killer was disciplined and precise,

143
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,604
making sure to leave
no evidence at the scene.

144
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:41,691
Additionally, my analysis suggests
incredible self-control

145
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,192
and emotional restraint.

146
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,986
Cold and calculated.

147
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,445
But what about Chimok?

148
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,698
His temperament's too hot.

149
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,200
What are you, a weatherwoman?

150
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:54,078
The guy has a clear motive
and his fingerprints were in her car.

151
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:56,956
Don't you remember seeing
how Ms. Lee was in her last moments?

152
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,166
In the footage?

153
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,543
Her shoulders were all hunched over,

154
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:04,630
with her hands gripping the wheel tightly
and her eyes like a deer in headlights.

155
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:05,798
Extreme fear

156
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,467
is what she had to have been experiencing.

157
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:11,637
Reminds me of a beginner driver
who just got their license.

158
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:21,856
Ms. Lee was a person who opened a bar
at a young age, far away from home.

159
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,357
She was strong and brave.

160
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:24,901
Her reaction tells me

161
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,153
that she didn't expect it
to be Chimok Kang,

162
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,573
who she knew to be an easy-to-read
and impulsive kind of guy.

163
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,284
It looked like
she was reacting to the situation

164
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,536
as if it was
a complete stranger attacking her,

165
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,580
unsure of their capabilities.

166
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:41,083
It's like being in that murky water,
unable to see what's beneath it.

167
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,168
Pretty scary.

168
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,836
So, therefore,

169
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,340
Miyoung Lee wasn't killed
by Chimok Kang's hand.

170
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,592
But you said yes to my questions earlier.

171
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,137
If he's not our guy, explain the body.

172
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:55,056
I think it's Kang's body in there.

173
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,058
Man, I'm getting sick of your nonsense.

174
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,185
It's not some baseless prediction.

175
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,063
In that suitcase is the body of Mr. Kang.

176
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:09,320
The rest stop CCTV showed that Chimok
was wearing black gloves that night, but…

177
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,615
why would a person wear gloves
driving in their own car?

178
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,743
Sure it was him in the footage?
Are you certain?

179
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,246
So the evidence proving
it's not Mr. Kang is what?

180
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,289
His gloves? Black gloves?

181
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:24,543
Check Chimok's DNA against that one,
then you'll find your answer.

182
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:26,921
Good luck. I believe in you.

183
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,059
Yes, copy that.

184
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:41,978
Thanks for calling me.

185
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:48,150
The headless body's DNA
and Chimok's DNA are a perfect match.

186
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,823
Man, this is some crazy shit.

187
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,284
Wait, so… that means he killed Ms. Lee,

188
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:59,120
then gets himself killed
and shoved in a suitcase?

189
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,913
I get that right?

190
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,666
We talked a big game
asking for jurisdiction.

191
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,002
And now our suspect is dead.

192
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,463
Are we absolutely certain that it was
Chimok Kang who murdered Ms. Lee?

193
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:12,216
Come on, Youngha. What a stupid question.

194
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,052
We got a partial fingerprint.
What could be better than that?

195
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,722
Don't know if we can trust that anymore.

196
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:20,224
Well then… we're shit outta luck.

197
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,270
Speaking of luck,
even my stocks are sliding, fuck.

198
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,189
All right, well,
let's try to confirm

199
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,108
that it really is Mr. Kang in the footage.

200
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,443
Understood, sir.

201
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,945
Choi, go and talk
to the restaurant staff.

202
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,238
You got it, sir.

203
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,374
After eating, just leave it there.

204
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,917
I'll clean it up tomorrow.

205
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,002
Got a minute?

206
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:49,712
Hmm?

207
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,213
Chimok Kang, Miyoung Lee.

208
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,132
Those names sound familiar?

209
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,636
Doesn't ring a bell, no.

210
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,220
Why do you ask?

211
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,514
What kind of person was my uncle?

212
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,933
'Cause I don't think
I knew him as well as I thought.

213
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,647
I didn't know him well.

214
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,484
Or was there ever a time
when you noticed he changed?

215
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,612
What's making you ask all these questions?

216
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,281
All good. Forget I asked.

217
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,996
Well, you see,
when your parents got in that accident…

218
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:29,168
your uncle was distraught
once he heard that you became an orphan.

219
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,213
That was when he changed.

220
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,633
I mean, it really messed with him.

221
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:40,012
Your uncle went to the station
immediately after that,

222
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:42,306
and he turned in his badge and his gun.

223
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,316
I should go.

224
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,245
Damn, this chair is comfy.

225
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,664
I should get one for myself.

226
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,999
I didn't think
I'd see you back in it so soon.

227
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,084
What's going on?

228
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:14,755
I started having it again. That dream.

229
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:23,347
I know the killer was there
and that I didn't do anything,

230
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,141
so why am I dreaming it again?

231
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:28,978
You might still have
some unanswered questions.

232
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:32,398
I can't sleep because of that, huh?

233
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,735
Because I can't sleep,
my eyes are all puffy.

234
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,781
Or is it the <i>ramyeon</i> I had last night?

235
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:44,869
The question keeping you up isn't
if you're the culprit or not, correct?

236
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,288
I believe the real questions
bothering you are…

237
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,416
"Who killed my uncle that night?"
And "Why'd this happen?"

238
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,710
You must answer these questions
for yourself.

239
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,503
Mm…

240
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:57,923
But those are obvious questions.

241
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,884
I'm off to find answers.

242
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,385
One last thing.

243
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:04,555
Apart from dreaming, when do you think
I can start getting some sleep?

244
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:08,058
Probably when you feel safe enough
to actually relax.

245
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,144
You want some sleeping pills?

246
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:13,397
I'll pick insomnia over that.

247
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:17,276
Maybe I'll just try to meditate.

248
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,569
Ah!

249
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,488
Don't forget. Sushi tomorrow at six.

250
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,114
Do you want me to invite Dr. Hwang?

251
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:23,324
- Mm.
- I can ask him.

252
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,250
Doctor's office 2

253
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:34,710
Oh!

254
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:44,929
Sorry about that.

255
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:04,448
It can't be…

256
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:08,327
Is my husband really dead?

257
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:12,164
The DNA from Mr. Kang's razor
was a perfect match with the body.

258
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,755
The last thing he said
was he'd be home late.

259
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,344
This can't be happening.

260
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:32,768
This man.

261
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,355
Do you mind taking another look?

262
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:39,817
Are you sure you don't know
who this man is in the photo?

263
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:43,320
No, I don't.

264
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:48,617
I honestly thought
it was my husband at first.

265
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:54,123
He's even wearing the same clothes
my husband wore when he left that day.

266
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,299
The restaurant staff
didn't recognize the man.

267
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,634
Their CCTVs didn't catch anything either.

268
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:08,679
But I think the guy in the footage
probably knew who Chimok Kang was.

269
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:11,891
Of course they knew each other.
Hey, just think about it.

270
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:14,393
I wouldn't go that far
to see a random guy. Hmm?

271
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:15,811
But look.

272
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,521
His phone records show

273
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:21,483
that Chimok Kang received a call
from a burner phone at 2140 hours.

274
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:24,862
The phone call only lasted 47 seconds.

275
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:27,990
Mr. Kang was near his home
when he got the call. After that…

276
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:32,578
What the fuck did the guy say
to make Mr. Kang drive all the way there?

277
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:36,081
Our culprit must've booked a room
under Chimok Kang's name.

278
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,000
I mean, the hotel records show

279
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,169
that he checked in
when Chimok was seen at home.

280
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,670
The timeline doesn't match up.

281
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:45,341
The guy wanted to get caught
on camera intentionally,

282
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:48,469
and that allowed him to escape,
pretending to be Mr. Kang.

283
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:52,306
Judging by the damage to the body,
it was personal,

284
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,475
so I'll start talking
to people that he knew.

285
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,270
I'll check if he had any debt
and if he borrowed any money.

286
00:23:58,354 --> 00:23:59,730
It's always money, isn't it?

287
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,690
And me? How can I help out?

288
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:04,151
You can check
the rest of the CCTV footage.

289
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,235
There's a shitload.

290
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:07,529
- Well, but…
- He couldn't have just vanished.

291
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:08,697
Watch every second.

292
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,033
You got it, boss.

293
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,535
All right. Let me know
if you find anything, okay?

294
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:14,828
Yes, sir.

295
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:17,164
CCTV, CCTV.

296
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,249
Fucking Republic of CCTV's.

297
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,632
Good morning! I brought us coffee.

298
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:27,716
Goodness.

299
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,385
- You're spoiling us.
- Nice.

300
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,803
Thank you.

301
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,191
What do you want?

302
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,236
Come on, spit it out!

303
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,321
You must already know, but…

304
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:50,906
…puzzle never came.

305
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,199
So it's not Mr. Kang.

306
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,451
Oh, did his wife say anything?

307
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,120
She know Ms. Lee?

308
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:58,122
It's a secret.

309
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,082
Guess that means she didn't.

310
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:03,043
Even if I knew that, why would I tell you?

311
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:04,211
Huh?

312
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:06,797
By any chance…

313
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,883
do you like to think of me
as your archrival?

314
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,428
A what?

315
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,555
A ri--

316
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:27,109
<i>Do you happen to know</i>
<i>anyone named Miyoung Lee?</i>

317
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:30,738
<i>I've never heard that name before.</i>

318
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:36,118
That's not a rare name or anything though.

319
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,579
And she answered so fast.

320
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,132
<i>Who is it?</i>

321
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,216
Hello.

322
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,844
I'm a profiler
working with the Seoul Police.

323
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,804
I have some questions I'd like to ask you.

324
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,514
Do you have time right now?

325
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:15,741
I'm sorry for the mess.

326
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,743
Ever since what happened…

327
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:20,329
I haven't had the energy to clean.

328
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,081
So when was the first time

329
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:24,666
that your husband
mentioned Ms. Lee to you, huh?

330
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:29,088
You know her, right? Miyoung Lee?

331
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:34,134
Oh, this isn't an interrogation.

332
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:35,552
Don't worry, I'm just curious.

333
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:41,266
Look, I'm not naive or anything.

334
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:44,186
I knew my husband had
past lovers and ex-girlfriends.

335
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,230
Doesn't bother me at all that he did.

336
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:55,781
"Remember the apartment
I gave Miyoung Lee?

337
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,407
Know how much it's worth now?"

338
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,286
That's what he said, verbatim.

339
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,791
He kept saying that
when we moved into our first house.

340
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,961
That was the first time
I heard Miyoung Lee's name.

341
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:11,463
What else did he say?

342
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:14,633
Did he mention anything about
how Ms. Lee was a different person?

343
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,051
Different person?

344
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,012
I don't think he did.

345
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:21,890
Hmm…

346
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:27,271
Why do you keep asking me
about a dead woman?

347
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,565
Did your husband mention that to you?

348
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,066
That Ms. Lee was dead?

349
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,317
Well, no.

350
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:34,778
The police did yesterday.

351
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:36,363
Ah.

352
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,492
Is that so?

353
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:43,787
How did…

354
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,624
you know I wasn't telling the truth
about knowing her?

355
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,752
I just didn't wanna cause any issues.

356
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,046
Well, it's my job to know.

357
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,631
As a profiler.

358
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:56,216
You really are, huh?

359
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,969
I've always wanted to become one.

360
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,973
Can I make you a coffee?

361
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,225
He came by to check on us that day,

362
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:07,185
though he left early just before lunch.

363
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:08,562
That was around 11:30.

364
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:10,564
And so when did he come back to work?

365
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,482
A little after seven.

366
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:15,027
Brought three of his golf buddies
back with him.

367
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,029
- Golf buddies? Hmm.
- Yes.

368
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:19,031
What was the vibe like?

369
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,365
Did anything stand out?

370
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:22,409
Well, it was definitely weird.

371
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:25,078
After his buddies left,
something made him snap

372
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:27,581
and he threw bottles
against the wall in here.

373
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:30,208
- Why?
- No idea.

374
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:32,961
It's kind of a known thing…
Chimok's a hothead.

375
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,296
He gets really angry.

376
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,298
So his golf buddies left…

377
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:39,593
After that, did anyone come by
to meet with him, maybe someone he knew?

378
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,053
No, nobody.

379
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,305
He called a driver
and went home around nine.

380
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:46,099
- Oh, he called a driver, did he? Hmm.
- Yes.

381
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:01,823
Mm…

382
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:03,241
Wow…

383
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:15,337
Mm.

384
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,130
How's the coffee?

385
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,049
I was bored, so I took some classes.

386
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,133
It's not bad.

387
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:22,678
Tastes like you've had
six months of experience.

388
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:23,929
Oh my.

389
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:26,765
I've been learning for exactly that long.

390
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:29,685
Huh.

391
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,270
Our nails have the same design.

392
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,190
Oh, we have similar taste.

393
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,617
So, what else can you see?

394
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:52,040
That you truly enjoy
having your alone time.

395
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:59,423
Your husband stayed
in a separate room, right?

396
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:01,299
Yeah.

397
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,722
I can't sleep with someone next to me.

398
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:09,850
When I would hear him breathing, I just…

399
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,143
couldn't stand it.

400
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:14,855
Conflicts are bound to happen
if you don't give each other space.

401
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:17,607
I know, right?

402
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,820
That's why we had separate rooms
ever since we lived together.

403
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,739
My husband never understood though.

404
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:29,494
The man just loved
to do everything together.

405
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,668
Mm.

406
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:43,341
So, Ms. Profiler, how old were you
when you got your own room?

407
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:45,635
Think it was when I was born.

408
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,679
My family was wealthy.

409
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:49,890
Both of my parents were doctors, so…

410
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,144
Must be nice.

411
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:56,772
What is?

412
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:00,275
That since the day you were born,
you had your own room.

413
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,360
Then because you're a profiler as well.

414
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,454
You've already lost family
in the past, right?

415
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,456
You're very perceptive.

416
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,959
You weren't intimidated at all
during the initial interrogation…

417
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:21,171
and it seems like
death doesn't really phase you.

418
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:23,840
You're really good at this.

419
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,886
I probably shouldn't even attempt
to lie to you, huh?

420
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:38,480
When I was 13, I saw my house on fire.

421
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:41,900
My grandma and sister died that night.

422
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,279
Then in the morning,
we moved somewhere else.

423
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:51,952
There were only two rooms
in the new house.

424
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:54,496
So I had to share a room.

425
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,587
Tell me, Ms. Profiler,

426
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:05,549
have you also suffered
the loss of someone close?

427
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,967
That's right.

428
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:10,303
When I was a little kid,
both my parents died in a car accident.

429
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,266
Oh, wow…

430
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,017
What gave it away, huh?

431
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,478
It's your eyes.

432
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,107
Looks like you've seen a lot.

433
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,608
I have as well.

434
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:32,284
I appreciate you talking to me.

435
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,120
Huh? Leaving so soon?

436
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:39,416
I had a lot of fun today.

437
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:41,376
I hope we get to do it again.

438
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,022
Hi, everyone.

439
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,398
You all doing good today?

440
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:04,900
Lieutenant Yoon!

441
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,194
Glad you're here.

442
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:08,528
I missed your treats.

443
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:10,322
Welcome back. I missed you.

444
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:13,074
I know you really missed my treats.

445
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,624
What's that weird smell on you?

446
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,418
Didn't go home yesterday?

447
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,087
Uh…

448
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:29,174
Oh, man, this cake looks good.
What kind is it?

449
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:32,135
Strawberry, huh?

450
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:34,638
I was just looking into
this case of yours.

451
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,348
It's an interesting one.

452
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,350
Interesting one, my ass.

453
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,101
Don't turn into another Ena.

454
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:41,853
What's wrong with another Ena?

455
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:44,314
Shall we start?

456
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:48,443
Accomplice…

457
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:57,702
For now,

458
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:00,997
within this case, I'm the killer.

459
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,083
Begin the questions.

460
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,584
Does the victim know you?

461
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:06,294
Mm-hmm.

462
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,588
That's why I cut up the body like that.

463
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:10,674
To throw people off
and make me hard to catch.

464
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,509
But you were caught within a day.

465
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,136
You're probably a suspect already.

466
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,346
No, not yet.

467
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,932
It's not me they're looking for.

468
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:23,019
Police are trying to find
the man in the CCTV footage.

469
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:25,188
Well, you must know that man, correct?

470
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,815
He a hitman?

471
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,234
Not a hitman, no.

472
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,903
I just know that this guy…

473
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:35,365
wouldn't betray me.
He wouldn't dare to do that.

474
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,492
Who wanted you to murder him?

475
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:40,620
- Me.
- Why? 'Cause of money?

476
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:42,497
Money wasn't the issue.

477
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:44,666
I just…

478
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,419
wanted him to be cleaned outta my life.

479
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,838
Why did you want him out of your life?

480
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,132
I just like living alone.

481
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,342
You've done this before, haven't you?

482
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,099
Betcha.

483
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:04,519
How do you think I knew exactly
how the officers would react?

484
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:06,855
I'd guess
you probably frequent that hotel.

485
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,524
Could your name be in the hotel ledger?

486
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,193
Wasn't in there.

487
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:14,237
So what pushed you two over the edge?

488
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:17,907
That guy started it.

489
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:20,744
He got mad
when I said we weren't "together."

490
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,078
After that,

491
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:24,164
maintaining his composure was difficult,

492
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,624
making him shake,

493
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:28,960
trembling, pissed off…

494
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:31,087
Man, he was shaking with rage.

495
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:35,050
He really wouldn't leave me alone,
making me lose control.

496
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:42,015
You…

497
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,436
You're a woman.

498
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:51,149
So how'd you do it?

499
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,403
Well, first he…

500
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:58,490
knocked…

501
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,617
on the door like so.

502
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,661
When he opened the door,

503
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:06,414
I took the chance to tase him in the neck
immediately like this.

504
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,416
He dropped to the ground.

505
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:12,712
And that's when I threw a plastic bag
over his head to suffocate him.

506
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:14,631
Then I dragged him to the restroom.

507
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:17,884
It turned out exactly how I envisioned it.

508
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:22,222
How did you feel after you killed the guy?

509
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:25,475
How'd I feel…

510
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,354
when he stopped breathing in front of me?

511
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,486
I was truly happy.

512
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:46,788
Hey, wait a minute.

513
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:50,250
Usually, female murderers
don't use physical force

514
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,502
as their primary means of murder.

515
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:56,589
They usually kill victims with poison
or some kinda medication,

516
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:59,134
due to money and physical limitations.

517
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:02,053
Nowadays,
the motives and MOs are different.

518
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:05,682
Women are much bolder
and are keen to destroy evidence.

519
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,143
You remember the Gapyeong murder case
not too long ago

520
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,686
where the ex-husband was killed?

521
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:12,397
The culprit used weapons
and also sleeping pills.

522
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:15,567
They couldn't even find a strand of hair.

523
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:18,987
How do you catch me…

524
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:23,158
if you don't have any evidence?

525
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:30,373
<i>Chimok Kang's wife definitely said</i>

526
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:32,292
<i>her husband didn't come home that night.</i>

527
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:35,336
He said he was gonna be late.

528
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,798
But he didn't come home that night.

529
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:44,554
The man drove a Mercedes.

530
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,514
To him, it's chump change to hire drivers.

531
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:49,768
I swear, I'm a professional,
and I usually drop them off safely.

532
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:51,978
But I was so pissed off that day

533
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:55,190
that I didn't take him
into the parking lot like I should've.

534
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:58,067
I was gonna call the cops
if he tried to drive drunk.

535
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:00,653
That's why I filmed him,
just in case, you know?

536
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:08,077
Ena Yoon

537
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,549
Hansaem Kim

538
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:38,274
Okay…

539
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:43,363
1-2-0-5, pound.

540
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:44,781
Aw…

541
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:48,785
0-5-1-2, pound.

542
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:51,329
Wrong again.

543
00:38:57,669 --> 00:38:58,878
Could it be?

544
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:02,173
1-0-2-5, pound.

545
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:04,384
No way!

546
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:06,719
Open sesame!

547
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,614
Agatha Christie complete collection

548
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,449
Agatha Christie's detective fiction
Crooked House

549
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,034
Aha!

550
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:32,579
Agatha Christie fanboy.

551
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,040
We have nothing in common.

552
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,997
Right, something isn't adding up
with the driver's answers and whatnot.

553
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:19,584
Yeah, that's why I'm going to meet
with Chimok's wife tomorrow.

554
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,044
We'll have to arrange a--

555
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:25,214
Hey, Curry Kim. What's up?

556
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:26,841
What are you doing here?

557
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:28,968
You weren't picking up.

558
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:30,678
What?

559
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:32,764
Brought pizza for us.

560
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:35,224
Do you have dipping sauce?
How 'bout some ranch?

561
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:54,285
Why is your passcode 1-0-2-5?

562
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,121
Still profiling me, are you?

563
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:58,706
I'm done now.

564
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,166
It's your turn though.

565
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:02,752
How'd you know my passcode, huh?

566
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:05,463
You know this is
breaking and entering, right?

567
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:09,717
I knew we would come up
with the same combination.

568
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:11,803
They mean something to you and me.

569
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,137
The day my uncle died.

570
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:16,724
And to you, it's your first case
and the only one you couldn't solve.

571
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:19,727
If you think about it,
we have a lot in common.

572
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:26,109
Your late father was an officer?

573
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:28,194
Don't remember that
in your personnel file.

574
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,490
Look at that,
even you can get things wrong.

575
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,410
He wasn't an officer.

576
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,453
Really?

577
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:40,081
Then why is he wearing
a police uniform in this?

578
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:45,545
Have you ever seen the film <i>Red Zone?</i>

579
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,173
- Never.
- He was cast in a role

580
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:51,259
as a Violent Crimes Team detective.

581
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,721
My father was an actor,

582
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,390
although he wasn't famous.

583
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:01,269
Of course he's an actor.
He's got dashing good looks.

584
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:05,440
Your mom's a lucky woman.

585
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:17,368
What are the reasons
why husbands are killed by their wives?

586
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:21,247
Money, domestic violence,
or crimes of passion.

587
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,999
Those are the usual reasons.

588
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:25,501
I met up with Chimok's wife.

589
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:27,211
You did? Why?

590
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,591
I was curious if she heard about
Miyoung Lee from her husband at all.

591
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,801
But the whole thing was weird.

592
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:36,345
It was bizarre that she didn't look sad

593
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:38,681
talking about
how her grandma and sister died.

594
00:42:38,765 --> 00:42:41,601
Though when she mentioned about
how she didn't have her own room,

595
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:44,103
her facial expressions
showed resentment and anger.

596
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:49,400
Her own room?

597
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,819
Why'd a room trigger her like that?

598
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:54,197
Also… her husband dies,

599
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,449
and she doesn't ask about it at all.

600
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:58,868
She seems like the type
to want to know everything,

601
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:02,080
but she didn't ask about the investigation
or if there are any leads.

602
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:03,539
She didn't seem to care at all.

603
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:06,250
Why could that be?

604
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:08,377
It's because she knows already.

605
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:10,630
That's why she didn't react
like a normal person

606
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,131
when someone they love dies.

607
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:15,093
You sure you're not describing yourself?

608
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:17,804
Did you react normally
when your uncle died?

609
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:21,557
No wonder
we purchased identical suitcases!

610
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:23,267
I'll question Mrs. Seo tomorrow.

611
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:25,394
You think it's her 'cause of a suitcase?

612
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:28,022
And what makes you think
you can make her confess to you?

613
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:29,941
I don't believe she will.

614
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,401
Just like you refuse to.

615
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,822
Why would I confess? I'm innocent.

616
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,036
We'll bring her in for questioning.

617
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,122
So tomorrow, let's see what she says.

618
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,292
And can you stop treating me
like we're friends?

619
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:56,008
Ah, I bought some coffee. For us.

620
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:24,871
You can start.

621
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:34,380
This man here.

622
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:37,341
Do you know him?

623
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,470
Don't think so.

624
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:44,223
It's your job
to find out who he is, right?

625
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,767
You didn't firmly say no this time.

626
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:52,398
Initially, you said your husband
didn't come home that day, correct?

627
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:54,150
Yes.

628
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:59,030
Then please, could you explain this?

629
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:07,079
I guess… I didn't see him
because I went to bed early.

630
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:11,125
And once I fall asleep,
I'm out like a light.

631
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,544
After your husband called you that night,

632
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:16,214
you turned your phone off
the entire time until the morning.

633
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:17,632
Your phone records show that.

634
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:19,592
What were you doing?

635
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:21,177
Sleeping at home.

636
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:23,554
Why ask what I was doing?

637
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:25,056
Is it 'cause…

638
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:28,100
you think I'm a suspect?

639
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:29,852
Now why would you say that?

640
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:33,231
I'm not stupid.

641
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,524
I've seen this happen on TV.

642
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:39,111
When the husband dies,

643
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:41,906
the wife tends to become
the number one suspect.

644
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,825
- There a reason for us to suspect you?
- There has to be.

645
00:45:45,952 --> 00:45:47,870
I mean, you brought me in, didn't you?

646
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:54,335
So besides your husband,
have you been seeing anyone on the side?

647
00:45:56,629 --> 00:45:57,630
Yes.

648
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,466
Maybe…

649
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:02,969
three to four in total.

650
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:04,595
Wow.

651
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:07,723
Shit!

652
00:46:07,807 --> 00:46:10,559
Out of those guys,
I'm sure you loved one of them.

653
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:12,645
The athlete?

654
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,146
He was nothing.

655
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:16,524
I mean, we broke up a month ago.

656
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:19,735
So I don't think
he'd have a motive or anything.

657
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:21,279
She's like a faucet.

658
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:23,281
The information's leaking out of her.

659
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,576
Does he have a motive, you think?

660
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:30,997
Do you think he held a grudge
because I broke up with him?

661
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:34,375
I wonder what triggered you
to come up with that.

662
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,794
As I was thinking, it just came to me.

663
00:46:37,837 --> 00:46:39,463
I remember he asked me…

664
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:42,925
if he could take my husband's place
if anything should happen to him.

665
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:45,803
Think it would help you…

666
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:48,431
to go meet the guy yourself?

667
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:07,742
Yeah, it's true. We broke up a month ago.

668
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,911
But it's all good,
Yanghee wasn't the only girl I was seeing.

669
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,122
At the end of the day, she was married,

670
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:15,666
so anything serious
would've been too much for me.

671
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:17,460
I guess…

672
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:19,795
a booty call was all she was to me.

673
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:24,300
Looks like you messed up your hand.

674
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:26,719
Can I check it out?

675
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:29,305
Uh, sure.

676
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:34,352
I go all out when I play,
so I get hurt often.

677
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:37,396
But listen…

678
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,859
instead of me,
you should ask Yanghee these questions.

679
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:43,903
The other day, she asked me

680
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:47,198
if her husband disappeared,
would I be down to take his place?

681
00:47:48,074 --> 00:47:50,284
Her marriage with her husband was failing.

682
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:51,535
Right.

683
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,500
Sorry, but it's time for my next lesson.

684
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:58,584
I better get going.

685
00:47:58,667 --> 00:47:59,835
- 'Course.
- Excuse me.

686
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:11,639
Looks like your hands are messed up too.

687
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:14,517
They're accomplices.

688
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,190
So, Yanghee Seo and Jaewook Roh

689
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:24,360
were in the same classes together
in their senior year of high school.

690
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:25,820
But they've lost contact

691
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:29,281
until Yanghee Seo joined
Mr. Roh's tennis club about a year ago.

692
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:32,785
That's when they reconnected again.
Rumors about them spread in the club.

693
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:34,703
I'm looking at both of their call records

694
00:48:34,787 --> 00:48:37,331
and exactly one month ago,
they cut off contact completely.

695
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:39,250
Their calls stopped on the exact same day.

696
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:42,461
There's no way this is a coincidence.

697
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:45,548
l went ahead and looked into
Chimok Kang's insurance plans,

698
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,883
and he didn't have
a life insurance policy.

699
00:48:47,967 --> 00:48:49,760
What are you saying, Youngha?

700
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:52,096
Because they're married,
Seo will receive everything

701
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,223
that they shared once he dies.

702
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:55,808
Even when their debt is paid off,

703
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:58,519
she'd still get
hundreds of millions of won, right?

704
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:02,314
Also, doesn't their restaurant take in
millions of won a month?

705
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:06,110
And so they both end up benefiting
if Chimok passes away, correct?

706
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,571
But there had to be a catalyst.

707
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,323
Let's say that…

708
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:14,785
Chimok Kang found out
about their relationship…

709
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:18,289
Oh, man, he would've lost his shit.
We all know he's got a hot temper.

710
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:20,416
I'm sure
he would've threatened to kill them.

711
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:22,835
Right. I agree with you.

712
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:27,631
So what if they planned it out
to trigger Mr. Kang and then murder him?

713
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:28,841
One call from Jaewook,

714
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:31,051
and Chimok would've rushed there
in a frenzy.

715
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:33,971
The motive and the circumstances
are clear, but…

716
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:36,307
we really don't have any hard evidence.

717
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:39,226
We need a confession.

718
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:45,274
They're already trying to shift the blame
onto each other, so…

719
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:46,692
we just need to let them.

720
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:52,072
Getting caught on CCTV
was all Yanghee Seo's idea.

721
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:55,284
And stuffing the body in the red suitcase
was her idea too.

722
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:59,455
Destroying and manipulating evidence
resembles the culprit's characteristics.

723
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:02,541
Out of the two, who is the worse liar?

724
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:06,253
I mean, who's easier to crack?

725
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:09,256
Who might confess first?

726
00:50:19,642 --> 00:50:21,477
You say you know Yanghee Seo.

727
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:24,772
Think you know her well?

728
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,483
I've known her since high school,
so of course.

729
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:29,652
Also…

730
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:31,946
we were sleeping together often

731
00:50:32,488 --> 00:50:33,572
until a month ago.

732
00:50:33,656 --> 00:50:35,991
Has Yanghee ever spoken to you
about her family?

733
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:37,076
Yeah.

734
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,828
I know her parents died
when she was young,

735
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:42,831
so her grandma raised her
and her sister afterwards.

736
00:50:42,915 --> 00:50:45,167
Did she say
her grandma and sister died too

737
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:46,544
or did she not tell you that?

738
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:47,628
She did.

739
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:49,630
But why bring that up, huh?

740
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,173
Did she tell you how they died?

741
00:50:52,675 --> 00:50:54,260
They burned in a house fire.

742
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,011
She wasn't home at the time.

743
00:50:56,095 --> 00:50:58,013
Think it's possible
she could've been lying?

744
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,935
Newspaper said it was arson.

745
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,772
And the culprit's still missing.

746
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:08,983
"2 dead, 1 injured in a house fire"

747
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:12,570
Back then, no one was suspicious
of Yanghee since she was only 13.

748
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:16,574
The poor girl lost her grandma and sister.

749
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:18,242
Both of 'em on the same day.

750
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:19,827
People felt sad for her.

751
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,122
There was another person
who became a suspect,

752
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:24,832
just like you right now.

753
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:27,459
A boy who was only 15 and lived next door.

754
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:31,297
Do you know
what happened to that teenager?

755
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:34,758
Should I know?

756
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:36,093
He also went missing.

757
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,262
Still hasn't been found.

758
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:44,059
You should really know these things,
Mr. Roh.

759
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,312
"Missing child
Seungho Baek"

760
00:51:46,395 --> 00:51:47,813
Because this could be you.

761
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:52,943
You know
Yanghee's in the room next door, right?

762
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:56,614
She's in there claiming
that you were the one

763
00:51:56,697 --> 00:51:58,532
behind the murder of her late husband.

764
00:52:00,576 --> 00:52:02,036
That's hilarious.

765
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:10,210
Gosh, seriously?

766
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:11,712
I can't believe that.

767
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:16,800
Wow… Are you serious?

768
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:19,053
So you're saying
that Hansaem really suspected you

769
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:20,804
as the murderer for the past 10 years?

770
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:22,848
Yeah! It's crazy, isn't it?

771
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:24,933
Seriously. I can't stand it.

772
00:52:25,017 --> 00:52:26,935
And there's not even evidence
that I did it.

773
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:29,980
But he still thinks
you're the culprit, right?

774
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:34,109
Right.

775
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:38,364
By the way,

776
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:40,532
I wonder if you know…

777
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:43,786
The red suitcase
that we fished out of the reservoir

778
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:46,038
turned out to be…

779
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:48,624
identical to my own suitcase.

780
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:53,003
Where'd you get your suitcase?

781
00:52:55,047 --> 00:52:57,466
This is the suitcase
we found in the reservoir.

782
00:52:58,759 --> 00:53:02,763
We discovered that this is the exact one
that Yanghee bought three months ago.

783
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:06,475
We even found the receipt.

784
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:08,185
That suitcase…

785
00:53:09,478 --> 00:53:10,896
It's yours, right?

786
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:17,903
I think that's everything I wanted to say.

787
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,075
Then…

788
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:25,703
I'm guessing I'm allowed to go home now?

789
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:29,331
Jaewook Roh!

790
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:33,127
Don't you think
it might be safer for you in custody?

791
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:36,839
You watched her
chopping up the body, right?

792
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:41,927
Every single soul that was associated
with Ms. Seo have passed away.

793
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,279
Her parents,

794
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,030
her grandma…

795
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:04,742
even her sister.

796
00:54:06,535 --> 00:54:08,787
What do you think is gonna happen to you?

797
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:14,001
A-Actually…

798
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,420
We planned to meet up
after all of this today.

799
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:19,548
B-But Yanghee…

800
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,426
She…

801
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:37,733
Hey, we found a bag here!

802
00:54:49,495 --> 00:54:51,121
<i>Police have made an arrest</i>

803
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:53,457
<i>in the Yeongpyeong Reservoir</i>
<i>mutilation murder case,</i>

804
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,918
<i>just six days after the body was found.</i>

805
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:58,504
<i>Shockingly,</i>
<i>the killer was the victim's wife,</i>

806
00:54:58,587 --> 00:55:01,840
<i>who has turned from a widow</i>
<i>to a killer in less than a week.</i>

807
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:04,801
<i>The police are still investigating</i>
<i>the exact motive of the crime,</i>

808
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:07,346
<i>carried out by the wife, Yanghee Seo.</i>

809
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:09,389
<i>Our reporter, Jiyun Park, has more.</i>

810
00:55:09,473 --> 00:55:13,268
<i>The police have arrested</i>
<i>Yanghee Seo and her lover, Jaewook Roh.</i>

811
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:17,064
<i>They've been charged with conspiracy,</i>
<i>murder, and mutilation of a corpse.</i>

812
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,024
<i>Two days ago, around 6:00 p.m.,</i>

813
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:21,693
<i>the wife and her accomplice</i>
<i>confessed to the crime</i>

814
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:23,654
<i>during a police interrogation.</i>

815
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:26,698
<i>It's also come to light</i>
<i>that they were still having their affair</i>

816
00:55:26,782 --> 00:55:28,283
<i>when Seo's husband was killed.</i>

817
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:30,869
<i>To avoid being caught,</i>
<i>the two culprits were meticulous,</i>

818
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:32,996
<i>carefully dismembering the victim,</i>

819
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,498
<i>and disposing of the body parts</i>

820
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:37,125
<i>in the Yeongpyeong Reservoir</i>
<i>and nearby mountainside.</i>

821
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:40,254
<i>The police have identified this case</i>
<i>as a premeditated murder,</i>

822
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:43,590
<i>and they are calling on the prosecution</i>
<i>to push for harsh sentencing.</i>

823
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:47,386
<i>It has also been revealed that the victim</i>
<i>from the Yeongpyeong Reservoir murder case</i>

824
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:48,804
<i>was involved in the murder</i>

825

826

<i>The police investigation confirmed</i>

827
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:56,895
<i>that the body found in the reservoir</i>
<i>is in fact, Chimok Kang.</i>

828
00:55:56,979 --> 00:55:59,231
<i>Solving these murders</i>
<i>has helped clear suspicions</i>

829
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:02,985
<i>of the Hangang PD's involvement</i>
<i>with the murder of the whiskey bar owner.</i>

830
00:56:07,406 --> 00:56:09,491
Hey, these hats are pretty cool.

831
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:10,951
Wow.

832
00:56:11,994 --> 00:56:13,245
Oh, yeah.

833
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:14,746
Check me out in this, huh?

834
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:16,039
I'm looking good, eh?

835
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,126
Thank you.

836
00:56:19,835 --> 00:56:21,920
I swear I bought them
Sherlock-styled hats,

837
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:24,756
and I know for a fact
I bought the largest size.

838
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,133
How uncanny.

839
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:27,342
Let me use the mirror.

840
00:56:27,426 --> 00:56:28,510
Okay.

841
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:31,888
Hmm.

842
00:56:31,972 --> 00:56:33,599
How do I look? Like a detective?

843
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:36,018
- Hmm?
- What the hell did I walk into?

844
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,147
I can't accept this gift.

845
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:42,316
What do you mean? It's just a hat.

846
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,985
Come on,
she went through the trouble of buying it,

847
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,486
so just take it, sir.

848
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:47,779
We can buy her a gift too.

849
00:56:47,863 --> 00:56:50,240
What would you like?
Is there anything you want?

850
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:52,826
There's nothing that comes to mind.

851
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,703
I do wanna say something though.

852
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:57,539
Go ahead. The case is closed,
you bought us these hats,

853
00:56:57,623 --> 00:56:59,291
so it's the least we could do for you.

854
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:01,710
The case isn't closed though. Not yet.

855
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:08,383
Miyoung Lee wasn't killed
by Yanghee or Mr. Chimok Kang.

856
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:10,886
What are you saying?
What are you getting at?

857
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:13,930
That's it. Make sure
to really think about it, 'kay?

858
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:35,952
What?

859
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:39,998
Oh, maybe you don't like the hat?

860
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:42,417
So who do you think it is?

861
00:57:43,377 --> 00:57:44,670
What do you mean?

862
00:57:44,753 --> 00:57:46,838
If Ms. Lee wasn't killed
by Yanghee or Chimok,

863
00:57:46,922 --> 00:57:48,298
who do you think is the killer?

864
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,886
That's a good question. I'm not sure.

865
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:57,599
I do think
that everyone around me is a suspect.

866
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:00,060
You're the only one that I can trust.

867
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:08,860
Are you still keeping secrets from me?

868
00:58:30,966 --> 00:58:35,053
It actually kinda shook me because,
well, she had the same taste as I do.

869
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:38,473
Also, her parents passed away
in a tragedy like mine did.

870
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:43,812
I was wondering
if I've deceived people just like she did.

871
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:45,814
That's what I've been thinking about.

872
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:48,608
I don't think you have.

873
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:50,652
Actually,
you're a very transparent person.

874
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:55,115
When I was holding Yanghee Seo's hand,

875
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:57,576
I thought of a movie I watched
when I was a kid.

876
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:00,829
There was a scene
where the protagonist says this quote

877
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:03,081
to the murderer
that they were questioning.

878
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,625
"We grew up in the same house,

879
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:07,669
but I came out through the front door,

880
00:59:07,753 --> 00:59:10,297
while you escaped out
through the back door."

881
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:14,509
All that matters is that
you came out through the front.

882
00:59:15,594 --> 00:59:19,014
Yanghee Seo's only reason to kill
wasn't really because of the money,

883
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:20,932
or even because of the affair.

884
00:59:21,016 --> 00:59:22,684
Yanghee Seo wanted a bigger house

885
00:59:22,768 --> 00:59:24,686
and a place
where she could have some peace.

886
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:26,438
Marriage was going to give her that.

887
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:29,733
But her husband kept violating her space
and wouldn't leave her alone,

888
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:30,859
so she…

889
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:32,611
simply removed him from her life.

890
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:37,240
It was just like when her grandma
and her sister were killed.

891
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:40,827
That sounds complicated.

892
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:42,662
I'm not sure I have the answers.

893
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:45,499
What kinda therapist are you?

894
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:47,834
I'm off the clock now, Ena.

895
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:49,836
The beer tastes good today.

896
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:51,463
Tch.

897
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:19,533
- Here's your key, ma'am. Of course.
- Thank you so much.

898
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:58,405
