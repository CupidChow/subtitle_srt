1
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:05,380
Mr. Kwon.

2
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:07,341
Mr. Kwon! Mr. Kwon!

3
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,432
<i>What's going on?</i>

4
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:18,018
<i>- Hansaem? Hansaem!</i>
- Doctor, this way!

5
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,186
He's in cardiac arrest!

6
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,230
-Step aside, sir.
-Confirming cardiac arrest.

7
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:22,856
-Beginning CPR.
-Get me epinephrine!

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,067
- Check the intervals.
- Here you go.

9
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,152
Check his EKG.

10
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:29,404
No change in rhythm.

11
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:36,471
Nine Puzzles

12
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:39,349
I told you no one had access
but hospital staff.

13
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,768
Another missed opportunity
to see the killer's face.

14
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:45,731
Since we've publicized the puzzle,
I'm sure tips will start coming in.

15
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,482
<i>But for now, let's head to DBC.</i>

16
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,415
That was delivered via courier.

17
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,667
We don't know who it was sent by though.

18
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:08,045
So the courier had been requested online,

19
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,797
and then you find this
and some cash at the drop point?

20
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:11,923
Yes.

21
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,509
Thanks for your cooperation.

22
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,470
Thank you.

23
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:29,816
You know where Jungho was
the day after Yoonsu Do's murder?

24
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,069
The One City.

25
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:36,031
There was nothing in his phone records
to prove that,

26
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,449
but location tracking shows

27
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:40,202
that his phone was within 200 meters
of the building.

28
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:44,623
When I called Jungho to let him know
that Yoonsu Do had been discovered dead

29
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,792
and the cause was an insulin overdose…

30
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:49,044
that's where he was.

31
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,381
The day after Yoonsu Do died,

32
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,466
the day he hid the handkerchief.

33
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:55,842
Exactly.

34
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,428
Why did Jungho go there?

35
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,309
Do you think the handkerchief's owner
was in the building then?

36
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:10,899
And we've come full circle,

37
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,235
back to The One City.

38
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,611
<i>The killer…</i>

39
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,865
<i>they knew that Sangbeom Kwon</i>
<i>was an avid hunter.</i>

40
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,993
<i>They even had a shotgun ready for him.</i>

41
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,913
<i>This fits the exact pattern we've seen,</i>

42
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,999
<i>so why didn't they kill him this time?</i>

43
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,418
<i>Leaving the target behind</i>

44
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,296
<i>without confirming his death?</i>

45
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,715
<i>I can't think</i>
<i>of a good explanation for it.</i>

46
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,554
<i>Jungho Yang was the unknown variable.</i>

47
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,348
<i>The killer hadn't anticipated</i>
<i>that he'd intervene</i>

48
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,933
<i>to disrupt the plan.</i>

49
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,271
<i>He's definitely not an accomplice.</i>

50
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,565
<i>So, why?</i>

51
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,276
<i>Why didn't the killer</i>
<i>finish both of them off?</i>

52
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,504
<i>They must not have wanted</i>
<i>Jungho Yang to die.</i>

53
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:57,756
<i>They tried to save him.</i>

54
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,637
<i>The reason they couldn't kill</i>
<i>Sangbeom Kwon then</i>

55
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,430
<i>has something to do with Jungho.</i>

56
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,351
<i>So what's behind that?</i>

57
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,520
<i>How are Jungho and the killer connected?</i>

58
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,730
"Puzzle: DBC Newsroom"

59
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,732
Do we have the autopsy results yet?

60
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,068
The report confirmed it.
It was a poisoning.

61
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,029
It appears
that someone got a hold of his IV

62
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,114
and then swapped out his meds with poison.

63
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,536
The killer likely disguised themself
as hospital staff

64
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,037
and slipped into the IV room

65
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:30,872
and switched it out there.

66
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,167
They really know what they're doing.

67
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,422
They probably have some medical expertise.

68
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:42,425
To start, request names
and photos of medical staff

69
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,177
-at Yangcheon Hospital.
-Yes, sir.

70
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:47,389
Someone must have noticed a person
not included in those photos.

71
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,183
Compare them with everyone
on the CCTV footage.

72
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,434
Right.

73
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,358
Is Dr. Hwang around?

74
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,194
I'm sorry, you missed him.
He just stepped out.

75
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,865
Actually, could you tell me…
Was he here two days ago?

76
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,033
The clinic was closed until yesterday.

77
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,285
Hmm…

78
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,497
I wonder when he'll be back. Hmm.

79
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,040
He's not answering his phone.

80
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,042
I'll go inside and wait for him.

81
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,420
Uh, he…
he did say he'd be back soon.

82
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,751
<i>"H…"</i>

83
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,588
<i>As in… Dr. Hwang?</i>

84
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,026
<i>Someone with medical expertise</i>

85
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,694
<i>who knows Ena Yoon…</i>

86
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:27,906
<i>and has connections to The One City.</i>

87
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,867
Four people came down to Jeju to see me.

88
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:32,702
Aside from you, Curry Kim.

89
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:36,873
Chief Hogeun Hyeun, Captain Jungho Yang,
Dr. Seungjoo Lee,

90
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:37,957
and…

91
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,626
Inchan Hwang.

92
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:41,503
Inchan Hwang.

93
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,254
Seungjoo Lee.

94
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,554
This is Hangang Police Station.

95
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,225
Hello?

96
00:07:57,394 --> 00:08:00,021
If you're not talking,
I'm hanging up.

97
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,524
<i>I'm calling about the puzzle…</i>

98
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,609
<i>that was on the news.</i>

99
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,111
Yes?

100
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:07,821
Uh…

101
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,041
Sir, do you know something about it?

102
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,794
<i>What makes you so sure that the killer…</i>

103
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,797
<i>is the one who's been sending the pieces?</i>

104
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,923
Sir, I'll come meet you

105
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,425
wherever you are--

106
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,926
Hello? Hello?

107
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,228
What?

108
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,313
What is it?

109
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:53,533
Over here!

110
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,210
It's this one. He made the call from here.

111
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:05,336
You know what to do.

112
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,881
Get CCTV footage
from the surrounding area.

113
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,132
-Get it quick.
-Yes, sir.

114
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,967
-C'mon, let's move.
-CCTVs, let's go.

115
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,594
I'll start looking over here.

116
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,221
-You guys go that way.
-Hey, let's start over there!

117
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,849
- Tell me when you find something!
- Yes, sir!

118
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,601
I'm gonna concentrate on this area.

119
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,519
There should be cameras over there.

120
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:08,877
"H."

121
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,532
<i>Inchan Hwang knows</i>
<i>something about the killer.</i>

122
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:43,203
Because Inchan is the one
who… drew the pictures.

123
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,288
So you're saying he's the killer?

124
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:49,000
He just called the station himself
and asked if the puzzle

125
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,502
really was connected to the murders,
so I'm thinking…

126
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,421
if he were the killer,
he wouldn't do that.

127
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,382
What if Inchan Hwang…

128
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,427
drew those illustrations for someone else?

129
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,971
For someone else?

130
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,850
All this time, I just assumed
the killer had made the puzzle themself.

131
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,770
That's why I came all the way
to Inchan's house.

132
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,606
Hey, why would you go there alone?
We should've gone together!

133
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,068
In any case, this isn't the place.

134
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:16,861
It doesn't fit.

135
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,916
In the same way
Captain Yang's home just didn't fit.

136
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,252
I know it's not the killer's home.

137
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,519
<i>I started receiving the puzzle pieces</i>

138
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,229
<i>after Miyoung Lee's murder.</i>

139
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:56,442
<i>I only shared what happened that night</i>
<i>10 years ago with two people.</i>

140
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,611
<i>Inchan Hwang…</i>

141
00:12:58,695 --> 00:12:59,821
<i>and Seungjoo Lee.</i>

142
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,450
Nice to meet you.

143
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:05,952
My name is Ena.

144
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,620
Welcome, Ms. Yoon.

145
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,914
Dr. Hwang's told me a lot about you.

146
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,254
<i>The person who tries to save me,</i>

147
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,673
<i>who pulls me up when I'm drowning.</i>

148
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,384
I happened to be in Jeju.

149
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,095
Dr. Hwang had a seminar,
so we came right away.

150
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:30,226
I just heard about his patient
who was "swallowed by darkness."

151
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,520
Is that what's happening to you?

152
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,355
<i>And the person who knows me…</i>

153
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,899
<i>better than anyone else.</i>

154
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:40,445
Those dreams… still having them?

155
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,280
Guess it'd be weird if I wasn't.

156
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:46,034
I pressed the keypad combination
for the front door.

157
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,501
Then I stepped on this puzzle piece.

158
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,172
And then the power came back on and I saw…

159
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,050
my uncle lying there on the floor.

160
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,302
It always ends there.

161
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,099
Something must have happened that night.

162
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,851
I just can't remember anything.

163
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:15,688
The question keeping you up isn't
if you're the culprit or not, correct?

164
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,107
I believe the real questions
bothering you are…

165
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,943
"Who killed my uncle that night?"
and "Why'd this happen?"

166
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,654
You must answer these questions
for yourself.

167
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,655
It was over 10 years ago.

168
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,910
Seungjoo asked me
to draw something for her.

169
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:02,039
It was just an illustration.

170
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,625
But it wasn't a puzzle.

171
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,338
And I know Seungjoo…

172
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,924
I don't believe she would kill someone.

173
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:18,889
Seungjoo wouldn't do that to Ena,
I'm sure.

174
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,529
This puzzle piece. What does it mean?

175
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,802
I don't really know what it means either.

176
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:59,096
She just asked me to draw it for her.

177
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:03,809
Is she really the killer?

178
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:15,279
All right, move in. Hurry up! Let's go!

179
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,890
Violent Crimes Unit 2

180
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,229
This city's covered with security cameras,

181
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,272
so how've you still not tracked her down?

182
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,692
Are you gonna let her kill someone else?

183
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,867
Hangang Police Station
Investigative Headquarters.

184
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:05,204
Hangang Police Station Headquarters.

185
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,373
Dongsu Tae here.

186
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,211
What do you mean missing?

187
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,338
Assemblyman Kim?

188
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:15,923
Where?

189
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,509
All right, listen up.

190
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,512
You're familiar with Assemblyman Kim?

191
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:24,306
Former Land, Transport,
Infrastructure Minister?

192
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,517
He's just gone missing
in our jurisdiction.

193
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:29,895
Could Assemblyman Kim be…

194
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,023
the next puzzle piece?

195
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,942
"Muryong Kim"

196
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,112
"Former head of Hangang-gu"

197
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,698
"Former Minister of Land,
Infrastructure, and Transport"

198
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,284
When I first started profiling the killer,

199
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,995
you know what kind of home
I was envisioning?

200
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,584
A place that's as neat and tidy
as a hotel.

201
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,879
With no furnishing or anything
besides the fixtures that came with it.

202
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:58,507
A space with only the bare essentials,
and nothing more.

203
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,593
But her place was a complete opposite.

204
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,181
She did a great job
of hiding her true self.

205
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,686
We need to find out

206
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,271
who the real Seungjoo Lee is.

207
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,815
That way, we can figure out
where she is now

208
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,400
and who the remaining victims are.

209
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,904
I need to talk to Inchan again.

210
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:25,034
The illustration on the puzzle,
how did you know I drew it?

211
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,912
You hide the same initial
in all of your artwork.

212
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,289
Why'd you help her?

213
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:33,042
You must've known what she was up to.
You lived together.

214
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,544
I didn't know any of this.

215
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,379
I promise I didn't know about it.

216
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:39,340
You saw it yourself.

217
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,052
Our living areas
were entirely separated, right?

218
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:45,513
And I didn't…

219
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:48,432
Then why did you both live
and work with her?

220
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,895
Do you have some kind of crush on her?
That's the only plausible explanation.

221
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:02,863
From the first year of medical school

222
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:04,907
up until today…

223
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:10,371
Seungjoo was the only person on earth
who knew my secret.

224
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,169
I'll tell you in the interest
of clearing up suspicions. I'm…

225
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,093
I am…

226
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:31,058
…different from most other guys.

227
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,518
I'm a homosexual.

228
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:36,313
Yeah.

229
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,820
My relationship with Dr. Lee
isn't what you thought, Ms. Yoon.

230
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:46,282
Anyway…

231
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,660
Seungjoo and I…

232
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,997
we spent our residency
at the same hospital.

233
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,834
After she opened up the clinic
at The One City building,

234
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,670
Seungjoo suggested
that we run it together as partners.

235
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:04,800
Why did she choose
to open the clinic here?

236
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,678
I never bothered to ask her about it.

237
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,974
But it's the… the nicest
and most upscale apartment building

238
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,434
north of the Han River.

239
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:16,478
So I thought that was the reason.

240
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,439
Did Dr. Seungjoo Lee…

241
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,943
ever talk about a detective
by the name of Jungho Yang, by chance?

242
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:24,987
Jungho Yang?

243
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:27,990
Jungho Yang… No.

244
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:30,200
No, never.

245
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:32,745
You know…

246
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:38,500
She was visited a few times by the police
when we were in school though.

247
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:41,879
That was the first time
somebody came looking for Seungjoo.

248
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,965
And since she was talking to the police,

249
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:48,469
there were rumors amongst the students.

250
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:51,430
Some said it was about an ex,
others said it wasn't.

251
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:55,184
Some said a patient was suing her.

252
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,436
Well, anyway…

253
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,357
Around that time,

254
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,984
Seungjoo decided
to take a year off of school.

255
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:05,486
A year off?

256
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:06,695
Do you know why?

257
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,364
I really can't say for sure.

258
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,991
Is there anyone else who might know why?

259
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:15,037
Do you know anyone that Dr. Seungjoo Lee
could have been close with

260
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,413
or someone who knew her well?

261
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,253
Seungjoo doesn't have any friends.

262
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,300
I think her closest acquaintance

263
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:29,969
is Ms. Yoon.

264
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:41,563
Nari Nam, do you know her?

265
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,400
She's a patient of ours.

266
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:47,194
She's a sergeant, I believe.

267
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,737
Sergeant Nari Nam?

268
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:53,367
Well, she and Seungjoo went
to the same middle school.

269
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,787
She began coming to our clinic
very recently.

270
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,041
Well, she said
that she wouldn't have been comfortable

271
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:04,461
being treated by someone she knew,
so I saw her instead.

272
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,929
We'd like to ask you a few questions
about Seungjoo Lee.

273
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,764
What sort of person she was,

274
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:18,559
if she was ever involved in any incidents,
that kind of thing.

275
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:27,568
Well, I wouldn't say
that we were actually close.

276
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:32,072
We were in the same eighth-grade class,

277
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,992
but she was a little unapproachable.

278
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,952
She hardly ever talked to people,

279
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,704
and she had a certain vibe.

280
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,832
But one thing I still remember about her…

281
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,127
there was a field trip.

282
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,422
Whoever didn't go on the trip
had to stay at school

283
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,257
and study on their own.

284
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,552
I think me and Seungjoo

285
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:56,055
were the only two students
who stayed at school.

286
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:57,931
That was the first time we talked.

287
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:02,269
I asked if she chose not to go on the trip
because she wanted to study…

288
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,483
and she said she didn't want to go
to an amusement park.

289
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:10,402
It was an amusement park?

290
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:11,570
Yeah.

291
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:14,823
She said she'd been left at one
when she was seven.

292
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:19,244
Her mom abandoned her there,
and she lived in an orphanage afterward.

293
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:25,167
To be honest,
I was a little taken aback by that.

294
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,878
Seungjoo just brought the story up
so nonchalantly.

295
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:32,049
So I remember telling her…

296
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,635
"But if you go back
to that amusement park,

297
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,720
you might find some clues
about your mother."

298
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,182
Seungjoo stared back at me and said,

299
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,727
"Do you know what I would do
if I ever did find her?"

300
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,690
What did she say she'd do?

301
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:54,113
She said she'd kill her.

302
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:56,698
That she'd rip her to shreds.

303
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,541
Seungjoo Lee was abandoned
when she was seven.

304
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,043
She lived in an orphanage
for the rest of her childhood.

305
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:10,295
Could she've been
in the same orphanage as Jungho?

306
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,006
Let's go look into that.

307
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,217
There must be a link between those two.

308
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:19,221
What's certain is that 10 years ago,
when Seungjoo Lee was still a med student,

309
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,764
Jungho went to see her,

310
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:23,267
and Seungjoo probably planned
these murders after that.

311
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,352
That's how it seems.

312
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:27,980
"It's all my fault."

313
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:30,190
He said that.

314
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:34,611
He said this all started because of him.

315
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,948
That it wasn't that kid's fault.

316
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:43,078
"Looking for missing child"

317
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:46,081
I've been doing this
all on my own for 32 years.

318
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:48,667
I've found 827 children.

319
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:52,880
An old guy like me's gotta do it
because the government sure as hell won't.

320
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:54,756
"Seungjoo Lee"

321
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:56,508
Let's see…

322
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:59,887
Between the years 1995 and 2000,

323
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:02,472
there were no missing girls
named Seungjoo Lee.

324
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:04,725
There's one boy though.

325
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,269
Ah, uh…

326
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,563
How about children who went missing
at Dream Land?

327
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,189
I'll have a look.

328
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,984
"Dream Land"

329
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:15,861
Ah…

330
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:19,406
There's no record of a child by that name
going missing at Dream Land.

331
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,325
Not during that period of time.

332
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,703
Oh.

333
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:27,664
There's one of a seven-year-old girl
named Seol Lee.

334
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:28,749
"1995_Seol Lee_F_7 YO"

335
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,459
"Seol Lee"

336
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:34,963
"Went to amusement park with mother
and went missing"

337
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:40,761
<i>She might have had</i>
<i>a different name then.</i>

338
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,221
<i>An amusement park.</i>

339
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,016
<i>A girl who went missing at Dream Land.</i>

340
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:48,060
<i>Seven years old.</i>

341
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,187
<i>About 20 years ago.</i>

342
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,356
"Location of disappearance:
Dream Land, Gapyeong, Gyeonggi"

343
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:55,734
<i>"Shindonga." "Seojin."</i>

344
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,027
"Guardian: Namsuk Lee
Seojin Diner, Shindonga Market Unit 204"

345
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,706
So was he cremated?

346
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,211
His body's still in the morgue.

347
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,051
It's just because…

348
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,346
Jungho told me what he wanted.

349
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:27,975
He asked to be cremated
and scattered somewhere sunny.

350
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:30,852
He always hated the cold.

351
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,981
When he was a kid, one winter…

352
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:36,566
his mom threw him out of the house
with no shoes.

353
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:40,404
He couldn't forget how cold it was.

354
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:43,031
I just remembered that story.

355
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,784
Anyway…

356
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,286
what is it you wanted to ask?

357
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:58,338
Did this girl ever stay at this orphanage?

358
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,007
Her name is Seol Lee.

359
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,134
She also goes by Seungjoo Lee.

360
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,427
Not sure.

361
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,637
Don't think I've seen her before.

362
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:10,642
You mentioned, Jungho told you
he became a police officer

363
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:12,227
because he wanted to find someone,

364
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,646
but you couldn't tell me who
because it was personal.

365
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:16,982
I need you to tell me now though.

366
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:20,027
That person's name is Seungjoo Lee,
isn't it?

367
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:22,863
Oh, that…

368
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:25,949
Right.

369
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:28,660
No point in keeping it a secret.

370
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,873
I don't know what her name is.

371
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:36,043
But the person Jungho was looking for,

372
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:37,627
her mother owned Seojin Diner.

373
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:39,755
That's where Jungho used to be employed.

374
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,298
Seojin?

375
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:43,675
Seojin Diner?

376
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:48,055
It was a diner located in Shindonga Market
20 years ago.

377
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,850
It was razed and then
The One City was constructed there.

378
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,062
Can you contact the owner?

379
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:58,690
She died in an accident 20 years ago.

380
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:01,943
You might be too young to remember it.

381
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:04,446
It was a pretty major incident.

382
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,032
<i>Jungho nearly died too.</i>

383
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:33,326
20 years ago

384
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:38,248
Shindonga Market

385
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,041
Over my dead body!

386
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:55,640
Is that a bag of candy?
You gonna share it with your grandma, huh?

387
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:58,185
Could be for his girlfriend, never know!

388
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:01,855
You about to eat?

389
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,317
Hey, let me join you, man.
I haven't eaten anything all day.

390
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,526
Yeah?

391
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,612
Hey, don't be so scared.

392
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,488
Why would I bother beating you up?

393
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:11,615
What do we got here?

394
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:14,534
Hey, just relax, lemme carry it for ya.
Hey, whoa, whoa… easy.

395
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,664
Hey…

396
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:21,541
I've got a question for you.

397
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:25,170
Those geezers in there, they've all got
one foot in the grave already,

398
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:28,506
but what does a young guy like you
stand to gain by hanging around?

399
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:32,427
Get a real job
and make some money, kid. Hmm?

400
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,806
Hey, I already have a job.

401
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,016
I do make money.

402
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,065
"Compensation agreement notice"

403
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,651
They're giving us 30% more
than their original offer.

404
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:49,319
It's too good to pass up.

405
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,112
Listen,

406
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:54,074
3 million for relocation,
plus another 15 million?

407
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,493
This is an incredible deal
they're giving us, Auntie.

408
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:02,040
Also, I set some nice clothes aside
for you

409
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,125
when I was getting rid of my inventory.

410
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,294
As I've already said,

411
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,922
compensation isn't what I'm looking for.

412
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:11,800
I just need them
to let me have my diner here

413
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,135
until I find my daughter. That's all.

414
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,306
Hey, you know…

415
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,268
If she wanted to come home, she would've.

416
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:23,895
She's been gone for 10 years already.

417
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:26,481
You think she'll come back
if you keep running the diner?

418
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:27,565
Miyoung.

419
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:30,026
You might have an easier time
leaving your store

420
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,028
because you haven't been here long.

421
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:34,239
But this is my place of business.

422
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,951
I've been running this diner
for 20 years, okay?

423
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:40,745
That money isn't enough for me
to open a new diner.

424
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,290
The other owners say

425
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:46,126
if we all hold out,
they can't start construction.

426
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,962
You don't get it!

427
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,589
You really believe that?

428
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:55,010
The court's already ordered
that the evictions be enforced.

429
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,680
It's only a matter of time
until they throw you out of here.

430
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:03,685
What is it?

431
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:07,105
You trying to get first claim
on an apartment?

432
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:12,736
Seojin Diner

433
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,991
Pathetic losers…

434
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,168
- Hello, sir, how are you?
- Hey, you good?

435
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,672
What'd she say?

436
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:34,758
I can't get through to the diner bitch.

437
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:37,677
The owners of units two and three
are united against it.

438
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:39,012
So what do we do?

439
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,723
Ah, these goddamn beggars.

440
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,225
How much more do these people want?

441
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,269
You're the head of demolition.

442
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,855
Can't you just bulldoze this whole place?

443
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:51,483
If it's legal,
there shouldn't be any problems.

444
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,193
Hey, hey.

445
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,779
This isn't the '80s anymore,
we'd be in pretty hot water

446
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,906
if we did that.

447
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,033
Ah, shit, I don't even wanna know

448
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,369
how much these fuckers are costing us.

449
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:04,454
You crazy? We're in public.

450
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,580
Just get over here.

451
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,457
-Ugh… Get off!
-What?

452
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,170
Miyoung's on the association's side now,
isn't she?

453
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:14,172
Yes.

454
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:15,965
Some people said

455
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:19,302
she was paid off
to take sides with the association.

456
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:20,804
God.

457
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:23,890
She's been meeting with all the merchants

458
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,850
to get signatures from everyone.

459
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:28,144
Ugh, unbelievable.

460
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:31,314
Oh, and after everything
I've done for her.

461
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,027
Jungho.

462
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,614
Why don't you leave now
and find a new job?

463
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:42,742
I don't think it's right for me
to keep you here.

464
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:45,078
You should save yourself.

465
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,666
I can't do that to you.

466
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,126
You piece of shit!

467
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:55,088
So what, how much more time
do you need then?

468
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,924
Hey, Yoonsu, I'm sorry. I just…
I just need a little longer.

469
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:00,218
God, you dipshit.
I thought you could handle this!

470
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,678
You're fucking incompetent!

471
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:03,972
Hey!

472
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:07,767
Do you have any idea how much interest
I'm paying every day, huh?

473
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:13,148
If you don't finish it this week,

474
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:16,067
I'm not paying you the balance
or any incentives, got it?

475
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:17,652
Huh?

476
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,447
Answer me, you fucking idiot!

477
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:23,158
You think you're gonna get paid
for doing a shit job?

478
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,576
Come on, Yoonsu.

479
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,996
Don't you think you're being
a little bit harsh, man?

480
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,373
I've been working
my fucking ass off for you.

481
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:31,791
Look, kid.

482
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:34,085
If it were me, back in the old days,

483
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:37,505
I would've easily chased them out
and knocked it down, okay?

484
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,427
If I'd known
you'd be this fucking useless,

485
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,636
I'd have done it myself!

486
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,638
Why hire a shitty subcontractor?

487
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,016
I'm done talking to you.

488
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:50,477
Yoonsu, come on.

489
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:57,734
Shit.

490
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,838
<i>I'm shutting the whole thing down today.</i>

491
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:21,049
<i>So pay me the rest of what I'm owed.</i>

492
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:25,011
<i>Also, you should give the police a call.</i>

493
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:27,806
<i>Ask them to look the other way.</i>

494
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:55,625
You guys ready?

495
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,418
Yes, sir!

496
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:58,503
Let's go!

497
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:08,179
Now get in there and drag them out!

498
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:09,806
Yes, sir!

499
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:51,639
How dare you! How dare you!

500
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:56,311
Get out of here! Hurry!

501
00:39:57,854 --> 00:39:59,522
What you waiting for? Get up there!

502
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:01,941
Let's go, let's go…

503
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,036
Gimme that. Gimme.

504
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:29,886
Please help me! Help!

505
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:36,392
Everyone taken care of over there?

506
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:37,936
-Yeah, all done, sir.
-Let's go.

507
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,575
-Get out!
-Come on, you dumb bastard!

508
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,877
What do you think you're doing?
You lousy scum!

509
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:06,673
What are you guys doing?

510
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:08,257
Jungho, Jungho!

511
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,969
You stubborn fucking bitch.

512
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:14,222
This is all your fault, lady.

513
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:17,016
You should've signed on the dotted line
when we asked nicely.

514
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,267
Why wouldn't you listen?

515
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:20,144
You're an animal!

516
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:21,938
You're an animal, that's what you are!

517
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,824
None of you do a thing.

518
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:35,118
Just stand by and watch. Understand?

519
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,244
Yes, sir!

520
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:58,808
No, I'm never leaving!

521
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:01,894
You can't make me!
I said I'm not going. I won't!

522
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:03,813
- Damn it!
- Just kill me…

523
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,565
You really wanna die here?

524
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,066
Let's go!

525
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,861
-I'm not going!
-Let's go, let's go!

526
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:12,030
Are you out of your fucking mind?

527
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:22,081
Chimok, we gotta go!

528
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:24,000
Why is this thing so fucking heavy?

529
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:28,588
Damn it, come on!

530
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,256
Let go, you crazy bitch!

531
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,842
Let go, lady!
The fuck is wrong with you?

532
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:39,098
We're gonna burn alive in here!

533
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:40,933
Chimok, let's get the fuck outta here!

534
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:42,351
We gotta go!

535
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:59,660
Seojin Diner

536
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:06,125
Hello, director, it's Yoonsu.

537
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:08,086
You're seeing this?

538
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:11,297
Honestly, you didn't need
to be so extreme.

539
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,176
Well, the faster we can get it done,
the better.

540
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,761
"Yacht Owner
We'll make that dream come true"

541
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:20,014
Those fireworks we set off,
that won't be a problem, I hope?

542
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:22,642
I mean, we did come up
with a nice little story for it.

543
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,977
I gave the boys at Hangang Police Station

544
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:26,813
and the district office a heads-up,

545
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:29,315
so there shouldn't be any issues.

546
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:31,067
That's great to hear.

547
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,444
They're on the same page.

548
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:36,155
They'd like to see this wrapped up soon.

549
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:56,092
It's really such a shame.

550
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:59,846
Well, this one diner owner was asleep
when it happened

551
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:01,639
<i>and wasn't able to get out in time.</i>

552
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,307
I received that report as well.

553
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:07,019
Nothing for you to worry about.

554
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,689
There were a lot of
Molotov cocktails thrown,

555
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:12,358
and that place was
one big fire hazard anyway.

556
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:16,487
I guess you gotta pay a small price
if you want to build a masterpiece, huh?

557
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:20,783
Hang on a minute.
Let me call you right back.

558
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:23,578
Hi, sir. Go ahead.

559
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,413
God…

560
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,415
Whose idea was this?

561
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,458
Things happened so fast.

562
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:32,795
Thanks to them, Hangang-gu
will finally have a landmark.

563
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:39,844
I won't forget this when I'm the mayor,
and then a minister.

564
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:42,180
Anyway, I know this is good for me,

565
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:43,848
but it's even better for you.

566
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:47,310
You'll be a billionaire, Chief Yoon.

567
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:49,020
Congrats.

568
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:53,357
Yes, thanks very much.

"Prosecutor Sangbeom Kwon"

570
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:55,526
Yes.

571
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:59,655
Yes, we'll say we have no right to indict
and get the case dismissed.

572
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:01,782
Oh, no, it's nothing.

573
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:03,201
"Fire death at Shindonga Market"

574
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:06,871
Oh, for dinner?

575
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,873
Ah, yes, thanks very much.

576
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:11,751
Yeah, sounds good.

577
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:13,169
I'm not too picky.

578
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:14,670
<i>Last month, Ms. Lee,</i>

579
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:17,215
<i>the owner of a diner</i>
<i>located in Shindonga Market,</i>

580
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:19,383
<i>started a fire with a Molotov cocktail.</i>

581
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:22,428
<i>She was unsatisfied</i>
<i>with her compensation for redevelopment</i>

582
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:25,139

583
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:27,099
<i>As a result, many employees of the company</i>

584
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:30,102

585
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:32,813
<i>and in the blink of an eye,</i>

586
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:35,191

590

593

Ena.

594
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,900
Can you turn around?
