1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The End

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Who is it?

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yes, it's my friend, Bani.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Bani, drink some alcohol.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Oh my!

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Hello.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What's wrong with him?

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's not that he drank with me.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I just brought him home.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Oh, you brought him home. Thank you.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Oh, my.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Let's go in today and see you next time.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Yes.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Come in.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Come in.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Oh, my.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Sang-ah.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Sang-ah.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What are you doing?

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I understand the same thing as you and your friend,

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
but you should stop now and keep your hands on me.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yes.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Oh, my.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Come in.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Oh, my.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Sang-ah, can you keep your hands on me?

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yes.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Oh, my.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Come in.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Oh, my.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Sang-ah.

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Sang-ah.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I was a little drunk yesterday, right?

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's not a bit.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What happened yesterday?

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You said you were going to rest at home.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Oh, that's...

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I was going to rest yesterday,

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
but the kids dragged me out of the museum.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I don't know either.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Oh, no.

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The professor is in the classroom later.

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Oh, yes.

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
No.

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Sang-ah.

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Sang-ah.

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yes?

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yesterday?

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
There was a rumor recently,

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
and I don't want to make Yeori misunderstand more.

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I think I should keep distance with you from now on.

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yes, Professor Lee.

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Oh, my.

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Oh, no.

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Don't go to the left.

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Come to the right.

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Professor Lee,

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
you can't keep distance from the beginning.

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So, are you done?

62
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yes, I guess I'm close.

63
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's too complicated.

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You want me to finish this in a month?

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
What?

66
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Why are you like that?

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Did you fight with Ban?

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Did you fight with Ban?

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Here's your delivery.

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Oh, no.

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Oh, no.

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Oh, no.

75
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's okay.

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I said it's my first delivery.

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Have some of this.

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Oh, thank you.

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Oh, no.

81
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Oh, you're so cold.

82
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Oh, I'm so happy.

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm cold.

84
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I was surprised to see you like this, right?

85
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
No, it's okay.

86
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's okay.

87
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Well,

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I have a job at home because of me.

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm sure Ban will be very tired because of me.

90
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Oh, my daughter has been so worried since she was young and she grew up in a good mood.

91
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But she's a man called dad.

92
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
She's so bad at helping.

93
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But this is a secret from Ban.

94
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Okay.

95
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Promise.

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Let's go.

97
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Okay.

98
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Oh, my.

99
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Did you see this?

100
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Uh, yes.

101
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I saw it stuck on the hallway.

102
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:40,000
The mentoring and internship connection program are very well done here, so it's going to be a detailed solution, but it's going to be a lot of help.

103
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Of course, the dorm and the school fee are supported by the transfer.

104
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:52,000
No one has been stuck in our school yet, but I thought it would be enough for your portfolio.

105
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Put it in.

106
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
If you need a recommendation, I'll write it for you.

107
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yes, thank you.

108
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Why isn't he coming?

109
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Oh, is that... You're here today, right?

110
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Oh, you're here today?

111
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Yes.

112
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
He said he wouldn't come today.

113
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What?

114
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Why didn't you come to the Doohyung Cafe today?

115
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You weren't scared to meet him and say that, right?

116
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Oh, my.

117
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Oh, my.

118
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Are you still mad?

119
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Are you mad?

120
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I don't know either.

121
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Oh, you're here.

122
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Thank you.

123
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm here right now. Nice timing.

124
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Are you going on a blind date today?

125
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Yes.

126
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's been five months since I last went on a blind date.

127
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's been five months already.

128
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Time flies.

129
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Are you mad at me?

130
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Are you mad at me?

131
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What? Still?

132
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I think you're mad at me.

133
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So I can't contact you first.

134
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What if you really can't trust me?

135
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Hey, you're going to be mad at me now.

136
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Don't worry.

137
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You didn't say you'd come to the community.

138
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Hurry up and eat.

139
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You're a little bit more like an idol than an actor.

140
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Because I really like idols.

141
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I was the one who watched the idol video when I was studying at the school.

142
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I was a little bit like a YJ Entertainment girl.

143
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
How can there be such a fate?

144
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm sorry. I'll go to the bathroom.

145
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Oh, it's boring.

146
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Why didn't you come to the cafe today?

147
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You weren't scared to meet me like that.

148
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Are you scared?

149
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm not stupid.

150
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Who's scared?

151
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm sorry, but I have a habit of being bored.

152
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Let's not be in a relationship with someone who has a good taste in movies.

153
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
If you look at it, I think you're a good-looking guy with a good taste in movies.

154
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You're a good-looking guy.

155
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
What?

156
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Are you saying I'm a real bad-looking guy?

157
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You can't win against me without a good taste in movies.

158
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm worried you might get bored.

159
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You call the major other than the good taste.

160
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You're a minor.

161
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You have to be very patient.

162
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Really.

163
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Let's meet now.

164
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Let's meet and see who's the major or the minor.

165
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Okay, I'll wait for you.

166
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's nice to meet you in front of a movie theater.

167
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Where are you from?

168
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm sorry, but I'm an actor.

169
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Then, do you love someone who's an idol?

170
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Hey, where are you going?

172
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'll finish it all at night.

173
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I waited for a long time for this blood.

174
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Hey, I'm going.

175
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Hey, Lee Dong-ah.

176
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Hey.

177
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Why is he dancing?

178
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Are you...

179
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Is he a dora?

180
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Dora Land?

181
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Oh, my.

182
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Oh, my.

183
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
280-1?

184
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Oh, my.

185
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
What?

186
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Are you busy?

187
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
What?

188
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
No.

189
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Oh, my.

190
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Hey.

191
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
No.

192
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Oh, my.

193
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Just in case, I can solve the problem with you.

194
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Don't worry about me.

195
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I've applied for this.

196
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
If you do this, you can go to the scholarship.

197
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
If you don't, you can go to the scholarship.

198
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It's basic to go to the scholarship these days.

199
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Thank you.

200
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And I'm sorry.

201
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm sorry to have to take care of you at school.

202
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
No, dad.

203
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I understand dad.

204
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I heard this is all because you thought about me and mom.

205
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Oh, my.

206
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And that's your boyfriend.

207
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I think he's okay.

208
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm sorry.

209
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Where are you going?

210
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I was going to go to you.

211
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
No, who are you?

212
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
What?

213
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Oh, my.

214
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You're a boyfriend.

215
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Hello.

216
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It's cold, go in and talk.

217
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm not cold.

218
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
No, no, go in and talk.

219
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Come in.

220
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Come in.

221
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Oh, well, well, let's talk.

222
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I think it's frustrating.

223
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Should I open it up as much as possible?

224
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Oh, my.

225
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Do you want to sit here?

226
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Yes.

227
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Yes.

228
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Oppa.

229
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Thank you for coming to me first.

230
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I was going to go.

231
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Why did you drink so much?

232
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Did something happen?

233
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Actually, my dad was a little bit fooled.

234
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Why didn't you tell me right away?

235
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I had a good thing to do back then, but I didn't want to ruin it.

236
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
But tell me right away.

237
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:53,000
If anything happens to you, you have to be with me first.

238
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Thank you.

239
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I'll do that from now on.

240
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I have something I want to tell you first.

241
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
What is it?

242
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Dad's house is about the same as his work, and the school is about the same as the next semester.

243
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:29,000
So I applied for a foreign scholarship program.

244
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,000
If that happens, I'll send you a year-long American education for full-time support.

245
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
America?

246
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Why do people watch movies in the end?

247
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I've decided on what I want to see, but I'm going to release it in a way I haven't seen before.

248
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's like the movies I like.

249
00:18:51,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Movies that add new things to the familiar.

250
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Why?

251
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Why?

252
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,000
It's fun.

253
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It's a relief that it's fun. I thought it would be fun to meet.

254
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
But it's so good that it's a bobae.

255
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It was good because it was a bobae. Isn't it very revolutionary?

256
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
What are you doing?

257
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I have a boyfriend.

258
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
When did you break up?

259
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Did you break up?

260
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:20,000
It's the same as now.

261
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Really?

262
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Yeah.

263
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Hey.

264
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It's been a long time.

265
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
What's this?

266
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
That neighbor's brother.

267
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It's not just an older brother. You're suspicious of your face.

268
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
What?

269
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Why are you so detailed?

270
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Oh, it's more suspicious to see you hide it.

271
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Next, isn't it your first love?

272
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
That's not true.

273
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
That's right. Let's ask.

274
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I'm sorry.

275
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
No, I'm sorry.

276
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Oh, really?

277
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Yeah.

278
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Let's go see it.

279
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It's so pretty.

280
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Hey, I'm going to see it with my first eyes.

281
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Oh, for the first time, eat dinner and go.

282
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I'll make the lady make tteokbokki for you.

283
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
You don't have to make me something delicious.

284
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Are you being serious?

285
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
No.

286
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Hey, the tteokbokki you ate and the tteokbokki is really good.

287
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Oh, my.

288
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I lost my bucket.

289
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Huh?

290
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm getting my first eye together.

291
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I told you in advance.

292
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm going to be with you today.

293
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm a little worried about you.

294
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Yes, Hyeyeon.

295
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Are you going to school?

296
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Yeah.

297
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I talked to my mom, but I'm going to go to the States first before I enter school.

298
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I'll get used to living there, and I'll send you some time with my parents.

299
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Yeah, that would be better.

300
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
You're going with me, too, right?

301
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Let's go together.

302
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'll take a break from college and send you some time with me there.

303
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I miss you a lot, too.

304
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Huh?

305
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Oppa.

306
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,000
No, why did you support this program?

307
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
There are many art schools that have the best art school.

308
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I want to make a more specific story about what I want to do after hearing those lessons.

309
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:09,000
If you're selected in this program, please tell me about the plan to go to the States.

310
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
First of all, I want to listen to the installation art class.

311
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:21,000
If you've only made a separate work so far, I want to expand the field a little more and learn space production.

312
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
That's good.

313
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Okay, go home and call me when you're done.

314
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Hey.

315
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
What do you think about the launch?

316
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
What do you ask?

317
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
It's the worst.

318
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
That much?

319
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Yeah.

320
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Hey, it's human's heart to change even if it's on 365.

321
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Why do you say it's going to be gone if you get away from your eyes?

322
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Hey, I'm going in first today.

323
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Aren't you going to eat dinner?

324
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Yeah, I have a place to go.

325
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Take care of yourself.

326
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I'm going.

327
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

328
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,640
The people there gradually started to kiss each other.

329
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,280
Because they can't take contacted of non- increase's status between men and women.

330
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,920
Let's give her a date?

331
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,880
Yes, let's give her a date.

332
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:10,360
I'm not the type to kiss anyone outside of my job.

333
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:17,360
Then, are we really dating?

334
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:27,360
Thank you for your hard work.

335
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,360
No, eat this.

336
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:40,360
No, eat this.

337
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:50,360
What are you looking at all day?

338
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:54,360
Did you put this on your stomach?

339
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,360
Honey, honey.

340
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,360
Honey, honey, honey.

341
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,360
How much is there in your stomach?

342
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,360
Honey, can I take this home?

343
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,360
What?

344
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,360
Oh, my God.

345
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,360
I'm so sorry.

346
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,360
I'm so sorry.

347
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,360
Who can take my daughter?

348
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,360
I'm so sorry.

349
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:30,360
Honey.

350
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:42,360
There was a rumor recently that I don't want to make Yeori do anything more.

351
00:27:42,360 --> 00:28:10,360
I think I should hang out with you from now on.

352
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,360
Hello?

353
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,360
Yes, Hyeyeon.

354
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:18,360
Huh?

355
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,360
I'll go to the US with you.

356
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,360
Really?

357
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,360
Really?

358
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,360
Then I'll tell my parents.

359
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,360
When are we going to leave?

360
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,360
Let's go before the end of the year.

361
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:39,360
I'll have to find out the flight ticket first.

362
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:53,360
Why is there still someone who went to buy cake?

363
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,360
You didn't deliver it, did you?

364
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,360
I promised not to do it with me.

365
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,360
No, what's the delivery?

366
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,360
I bought a cake at the bakery here.

367
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,360
I'll be right back.

368
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,360
Okay.

369
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,360
Okay.

370
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,360
I'll be right back.

371
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,360
Oh?

372
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,360
I'm going home.

373
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:26,360
Okay, let's go home with money.

374
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,360
Bani.

375
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,360
Hey, oppa.

376
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,360
It's cold.

377
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,360
You're going in first, right?

378
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,360
I waited for you to go in with me.

379
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,360
Let's go in.

380
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:43,360
Okay.

381
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,360
Thank you.

382
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,360
Thank you.

383
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,360
What do you want to eat?

384
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,360
What do you want to eat?

385
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,360
I want meat.

386
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:02,360
Let's eat steak.

387
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:12,360
I've been in the kitchen where you're staying right now.

388
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:18,360
Bani, please turn your eyes.

389
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,360
What?

390
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,360
Oh, no.

391
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,360
Spam?

392
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:32,360
Yes.

393
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:42,360
What?

394
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,360
What's wrong with you?

395
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,360
What?

396
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,360
I want to hug you.

397
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,360
I like it so much.

398
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,360
Of course.

399
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,360
Thank you for coming.

400
00:30:53,360 --> 00:31:04,360
Hang on.

401
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:08,360
Isn't he my dad?

402
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,360
Hey, I didn't see him well.

403
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,360
I saw him, but he didn't come.

404
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:19,360
Oh, really?

405
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:29,360
Be careful with the driving, sir.

406
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,360
Oh, Bani.

407
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,360
What are you going to talk about?

408
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,360
Oh, that?

409
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,360
That's...

410
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:51,360
What are you talking about?

411
00:31:51,360 --> 00:32:01,360
I passed the US.

412
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,360
Really?

413
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,360
Congratulations, Bani.

414
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,360
Thank you, oppa.

415
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,360
I didn't know it would really happen.

416
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,360
I can't believe it.

417
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,360
It's so good.

418
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,360
I heard that the competition was really strong.

419
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,360
Did you listen to that?

420
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,360
Hey, my girlfriend is amazing.

421
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:33,360
Really?

422
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:43,360
Wait a minute.

423
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,360
Hello?

424
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,360
Yes, I'm calling you with Bani's cell phone.

425
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,360
There's an accident in the car here.

426
00:32:50,360 --> 00:33:00,360
I'm on my way to the emergency room at the hospital for the first time.

427
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:04,360
Mom.

428
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:10,360
No.

429
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,360
Dad, dad, why?

430
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:17,360
Don't worry, it's okay.

431
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,360
You're a guardian of Bani.

432
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,360
Yes.

433
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,360
I think you should have surgery on your right leg.

434
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,360
We already have a surgery.

435
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:31,360
So we have a different hospital that can be operated on, but we can't get here.

436
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,360
If you don't get it right now, it's a big deal.

437
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,360
How can I help you?

438
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:41,360
Oh, my.

439
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,360
Dad, dad, dad.

440
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:51,360
Oh, my.

441
00:33:51,360 --> 00:34:13,360
I told you not to deliver it.

442
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:21,360
I wanted to earn it myself as much as you did.

443
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,360
I knew it would happen tomorrow.

444
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:29,360
No, it's a bit of a waste to ride a motorcycle.

445
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:39,360
I can't believe you didn't listen to me like that.

446
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,360
The surgery is over.

447
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:49,360
I think you should take a look at the results for eight seconds.

448
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,360
If you work hard on the ER, you'll be better.

449
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,360
Thank you.

450
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,360
Thank you.

451
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,360
Thank you, doctor.

452
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,360
It's a day off.

453
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,360
But if Jiwon asks, you should come out.

454
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:05,360
Thank you.

455
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,360
Thank you so much. What should I do?

456
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,360
Thank you so much, brother.

457
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,360
I told you, right?

458
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:17,360
Dad will be fine soon.

459
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,360
I'll go first.

460
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,360
Call me.

461
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:29,360
Yes.

462
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:34,360
Excuse me.

463
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:40,360
Thank you for today.

464
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:46,360
No, thank you for the surgery.

465
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:56,360
Thank you for the surgery.

466
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:04,360
But I'm glad I can recover.

467
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:08,360
I'm glad you can do that.

468
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,360
Go ahead.

469
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,360
Mother will be waiting for you.

470
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,360
Yes.

471
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,360
Oh, right.

472
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:20,360
I was going to ask you earlier.

473
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,360
Why did you call me earlier?

474
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:27,360
Did you contact your dad recently?

475
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:34,360
Oh, that's...

476
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:39,360
I actually knew that you were working part-time.

477
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:45,360
I've been a delivery man at the creative office.

478
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,360
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you in advance.

479
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:55,360
My dad asked me to keep it a secret.

480
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:59,360
But you still tell me.

481
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:07,360
I think that's why I'm like this.

482
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:11,360
That's not it. Why did you leave your dad in the accident?

483
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,360
I just...

484
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,360
I don't think I can help you.

485
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,360
What are you talking about?

486
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,360
You've been with me all day.

487
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:27,360
I was so tired today because of you.

488
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,360
So don't think like that.

489
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,360
Okay?

490
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:39,360
Okay.

491
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,360
Huh?

492
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,360
Is Longjae real?

493
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,360
Are you okay?

494
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,360
Not even a week.

495
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:11,360
A year...

496
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,360
Oh, my God.

497
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,360
I just came home from the hospital.

498
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,360
Hey, Yeol, I'm here.

499
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,360
I'm here.

500
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,360
I'm here.

501
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,360
Oh, my God.

502
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,360
Why are you so upset?

503
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,360
He's going to get hurt again.

504
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,360
I'm really going to have to know what you're going to do.

505
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,360
Oh, hey, come over here later.

506
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,360
Hey, do you want to have dinner with me at my house today?

507
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,360
I'm so happy to have you.

508
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,360
That's...

509
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,360
I can put on some red.

510
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,360
Oh, yes.

511
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,360
Oh, that's good.

512
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,360
I'm glad I didn't get in love.

513
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,360
Be honest with me.

514
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,360
I called you to eat something that makes a tree.

515
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,360
No, I called you because I like it.

516
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:55,360
When did you open your eyes and play games like this?

517
00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:00,360
Did you like this heavy guy?

518
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,360
Yeol, thank you for keeping it secret until the end.

519
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,360
Of course, I was eliminated because of me.

520
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,360
Hey.

521
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:31,360
Oh, at the hospital.

522
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,360
Right, right?

523
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,360
Yes.

524
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,360
Hello.

525
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,360
Thank you so much for that.

526
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,360
No, it's not.

527
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,360
Did you come to see me?

528
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,360
Oh, that...

529
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,360
No, I just...

530
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,360
I'm sorry.

531
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,360
I'm sorry.

532
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,360
I'm sorry.

533
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,360
I'm sorry.

534
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,360
Oh, that...

535
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:53,360
No, it was just a passing road.

536
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,360
Well, I'll go now.

537
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:04,360
Yes, okay.

538
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,360
I saw that friend outside.

539
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,360
Why did you help him at the hospital?

540
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,360
Wonhee.

541
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,360
Oh, Wonhee.

542
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:15,360
I asked if you were here, and you said you were just passing by.

543
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:25,360
I'll be right back.

544
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:30,360
Yeah.

545
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:46,360
Hey.

546
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,360
Oh, that...

547
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:54,360
He said he was in front of my house.

548
00:40:54,360 --> 00:41:03,360
Yeah, I had something to tell you, but I was in a hurry, so I called him.

549
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:14,360
Oh, can I say it now?

550
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:22,360
No, I'm going to America.

551
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,360
America?

552
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,360
Yeah.

553
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:30,360
I'm going to go to New York with you before Hye-won leaves.

554
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:41,360
I think I'm going to New York to take my parents.

555
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:54,360
But I think I have to say goodbye.

556
00:41:54,360 --> 00:42:08,360
Thank you for all this time.

557
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,360
Me too.

558
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:19,360
I was grateful too.

559
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,360
You'll be waiting.

560
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,360
Go inside.

561
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:26,360
I'll go too.

562
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:36,360
Yes.

563
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,360
I'm going to the CD store.

564
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,360
I'm going to the CD store.

565
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,360
Oh, what's up?

566
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,360
What did you say?

567
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57,360
I just have something to tell me.

568
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,360
Oh, yeah?

569
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,360
What's that?

570
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,360
I'm going to America because of my sister's work.

571
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,360
I'm here to say hi.

572
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,360
America?

573
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,360
Where?

574
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,360
New York.

575
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,360
You're going to New York with me?

576
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,360
Aren't you going to meet up?

577
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,360
Oh, this is really a review.

578
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,360
I have to try it.

579
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,360
Let's eat.

580
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,360
I'm going to wash it all.

581
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,360
I'm full, but it's better to walk.

582
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,360
Right?

583
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:35,360
Yes.

584
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,360
Bani.

585
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,360
Yes?

586
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:49,360
Do I have to go to America?

587
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,360
What?

588
00:43:52,360 --> 00:44:00,360
Can't you just go to America?

589
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:09,360
Is it because of you?

590
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,360
Don't worry about you.

591
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:15,360
We're not going together.

592
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,360
It's not even a month.

593
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,360
It's been a year.

594
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:28,360
Actually, I couldn't tell you, but it wasn't easy to accept that.

595
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:33,360
But it's good for you.

596
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:43,360
Of course, I thought it was right to wait.

597
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:49,360
But it's not something else.

598
00:44:49,360 --> 00:45:01,360
If you're going to that extent, I can't let you go.

599
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,360
You know, too.

600
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,360
I know how hard I've been preparing for this.

601
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:10,360
I know. I know everything.

602
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,360
You know, too.

603
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:20,360
What kind of heart does he have for you?

604
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,360
Can't you trust me a little more?

605
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:33,360
I'm not going to see Wonhee and don't worry about you.

606
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:37,360
I don't know.

607
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:47,360
I just don't think I should let you go now.

608
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:57,360
I'm sorry.

609
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:04,360
Why are you so angry today?

610
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:10,360
I don't have much time left on the day I go to the States, but I'm going to stick to it for a long time.

611
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,360
Good.

612
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:17,360
But what's wrong with your face?

613
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:22,360
Are you worried about something?

614
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:26,360
Mom.

615
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:31,360
Am I doing well going to the States?

616
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,360
What?

617
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,360
When did you like it when you got stuck?

618
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:39,360
It's not even a short period of a year.

619
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:45,360
I just want to go without fear.

620
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:49,360
I don't know if I can get used to it.

621
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:57,360
I have to stay away from Yeori.

622
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:05,360
Oh, my Bani likes Yeori a lot.

623
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:09,360
I think I did that when I was your age.

624
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:14,360
I want to be good at volleyball and love.

625
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:20,360
I don't want to be greedy for both of us.

626
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:24,360
But what if you don't want to let go of both of them?

627
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,360
That's my honest heart.

628
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:31,360
Right?

629
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:37,360
But Bani, don't worry about Jin-il anymore.

630
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:41,360
Just do what you want to do.

631
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:51,360
I can't help it if something happens to Jin-il later, but what you don't have in your heart right now, I'm really regretting it later.

632
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:14,360
Even if you're stuck 365 days, it's human's heart to change.

633
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:17,360
Why do you say that if you get away from your eyes, you get away from your heart?

634
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:20,360
I'm going to the States because of my sister's work.

635
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,360
I'm here to say hello.

636
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,360
Where?

637
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,360
New York.

638
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:21,360
Oppa.

639
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:40,360
I want to go no matter how I think about it.

640
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:45,360
I want to do this.

641
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:53,360
I want to do this until the end.

642
00:49:53,360 --> 00:50:05,360
Can you understand me just once?

643
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:09,360
Can't you understand me?

644
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:26,360
I'm really regretting it if I miss this opportunity.

645
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:30,360
Oppa.

646
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:34,360
Just once.

647
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,360
Can't you?

648
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:47,360
I don't know anything else, but this really doesn't work.

649
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:50,360
Then what do I do?

650
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:59,360
Are you going to break up with me when I go to the States?

651
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:18,360
That's not it.

652
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:27,360
I told you my true feelings.

653
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:37,360
I'll wait.

654
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:03,360
You can't eat Korean food in the States, so eat a lot.

655
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,360
How many Korean restaurants in New York?

656
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:07,360
I know.

657
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,360
But it's the same as my hand.

658
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,360
Eat everything.

659
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:16,360
I sent a text to Yeori to eat.

660
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:19,360
She said she couldn't come because she didn't have time.

661
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,360
Are you busy?

662
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:29,360
I'm busy preparing the final PT for the contest.

663
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:33,360
I was going to eat with you before I left, but I'm sorry.

664
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:39,360
Can't you see the final PT at the airport?

665
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:45,360
Oh, that's a huge contest.

666
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:49,360
Yeori must be happy.

667
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:59,360
It's delicious.

668
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:12,360
You know I'm going to the airport today, right?

669
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:22,360
I hope you look at your face.

670
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:55,360
Yeori, are you nervous?

671
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:56,360
Don't be nervous.

672
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,360
We can do it.

673
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,360
We can do it.

674
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:23,360
As prepared.

675
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,360
Let's go.

676
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,360
It's been eight hours.

677
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,360
You're hurt, right?

678
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:43,360
No, if you arrive, find the bag first.

679
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,360
And call me right away.

680
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:49,360
I know. Tell me how many times.

681
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,360
You're so stupid.

682
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:54,360
Thank you for coming.

683
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,360
Of course.

684
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:59,360
Yeori, how nice it is to have you here.

685
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:03,360
It's a prize ceremony at the museum.

686
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:08,360
Yeori must have wanted to come, too.

687
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:13,360
First of all, congratulations to all the participants who entered the main line.

688
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:17,360
Thank you for completing the assignment on a busy schedule.

689
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:21,360
Today is Christmas Eve.

690
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:25,360
Did you cancel the appointment because of this announcement?

691
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:30,360
I'm going to buy fish cake and fish cake on the street.

692
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,360
First, close your eyes.

693
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:38,360
Lastly, send Christmas Eve together.

694
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:44,360
I'm so sad to send Christmas Eve with my boyfriend.

695
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:18,360
I'm so sad to send Christmas Eve with my boyfriend.

696
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:28,360
I'm so sad to send Christmas Eve with my boyfriend.

697
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:38,360
I'm so sad to send Christmas Eve with my boyfriend.

698
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:48,360
I'm so sad to send Christmas Eve with my boyfriend.

699
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:58,360
I'm so sad to send Christmas Eve with my boyfriend.

700
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:08,360
I'm so sad to send Christmas Eve with my boyfriend.

701
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:18,360
I'm so sad to send Christmas Eve with my boyfriend.

702
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:28,360
I'm so sad to send Christmas Eve with my boyfriend.

703
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:38,360
I'm so sad to send Christmas Eve with my boyfriend.

704
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:48,360
I'm so sad to send Christmas Eve with my boyfriend.

705
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:58,360
I'm so sad to send Christmas Eve with my boyfriend.

706
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:06,360
Let's hear the first team's name from the fansome dolphins.

707
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,360
Okay.

708
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,360
Hey, why aren't you coming?

709
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:14,360
Dongho.

710
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:25,360
I'm sorry, but I can't take my foot out.

711
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:35,360
Okay.

712
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:45,360
No, we have to go home now.

713
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:50,360
Yeah, I'll be back soon.

714
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,360
I'll call you often.

715
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,360
I'll go, dad.

716
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:57,360
Don't worry.

717
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:02,360
Don't be too hard on yourself.

718
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:04,360
I can't.

719
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:07,360
Come to me later.

720
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:10,360
I'll be back.

721
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:13,360
Take care.

722
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:16,360
Come back when you're tired.

723
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:29,360
Dongho.

724
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,360
Dongho.

725
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,360
Dongho.

726
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:51,360
Dongho.

727
01:00:51,360 --> 01:01:01,360
No.

728
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:11,360
Dongho.

729
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:13,360
I'm going now.

730
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:19,360

01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:31,360
I heard that you came to Korea today.

01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,360
I've never contacted you.

I thought I might go back to Korea if I meet you again.

You're not perfect.

Except for one person.

Except for the first person.
