1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The End

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You talk a lot about the main work,

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
but I actually like the work called fate the most.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I wanted to be on that side,

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
but you recognized that.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Writer.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yes, Jiyeong. What do you want to say?

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I have something I want to ask you.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm confused.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So I want to be with you.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We're going?

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yeoram, where are you going?

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Kwanhee.

14
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Wait a minute.

15
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's done.

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yes, thank you.

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Kwanhee.

19
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Let's go home.

23
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Leave me alone.

24
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Leave me alone.

25
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Leave me alone.

26
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Do you like that writer?

27
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What?

28
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Don't like us.

29
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Why?

30
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Why?

31
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I told you not to like that person.

32
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Don't you know how to be that kind of person?

33
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But what does that have to do with you?

34
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You're overreacting.

35
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You're the only one who's hurt since you've met that kind of person.

36
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Think about it.

37
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Do you think that kind of person will like you?

38
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Do you want to be in a relationship again?

39
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You still can't get your mind off me?

40
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What?

41
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:23,000
No matter who I meet or get arrested, I don't have the right to let you go even if I'm a traitor.

42
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So please don't get into my business.

43
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What kind of business is this?

44
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Are you a coffee too?

45
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I can't drink coffee, so I'll drink it.

46
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What?

47
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You're really like a hero.

48
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Actually, I was invited by the writer's office separately.

49
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You're meeting well.

50
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You're sleeping?

51
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:57,000
No.

52
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I thought you were gone.

53
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I waited for you.

54
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What's wrong with that friend?

55
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Oh, I guess I misunderstood something.

56
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's nothing, so you don't have to worry.

57
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Are you okay?

58
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yes.

59
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Do you think that kind of person will like you?

60
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Do you want to be in a relationship again?

61
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Writer.

62
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yes.

63
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What kind of relationship are we?

64
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Us?

65
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,000
What kind of relationship do you think it is?

66
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I don't invite anyone to the studio.

67
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I don't come to the park with anyone.

68
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What?

69
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What kind of relationship do you think it is?

70
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Do you want to be in a relationship again?

71
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Are you still not conscious of being rejected?

72
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
What?

73
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Are you dead?

74
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What are you doing?

75
00:08:47,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Did you go in well yesterday?

76
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Did you go in well?

77
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
What kind of relationship are you talking about?

78
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I don't have anything to do with you anymore.

79
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Talk to me.

80
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Me?

81
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'll call you brother.

82
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I have to organize the flower house.

83
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I don't know what we're going to say.

84
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's about Ban Hee-jin.

85
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You can't meet Ban Hee-jin and Jo Ha-rang.

86
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What are you talking about?

87
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I have something I'm curious about.

88
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I keep getting confused.

89
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So I want to make sure that the relationship between the writer and me is clear.

90
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Our relationship?

91
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I was with the writer at home that night.

92
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
We're dating, right?

93
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Is that important?

94
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I don't add anyone to my house.

95
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
That bastard is a crazy girl.

96
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Did you even bring this to Ban Hee-jin?

97
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
No.

98
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I just told him not to meet that person.

99
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
But Ban Hee-jin didn't listen to me at all.

100
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I think you'll listen to me if you stop.

101
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
But I guess the Oji-rab is a little wide.

102
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You and Ban Hee-jin are not that close.

103
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Isn't this not Oji-rab, but a human stone?

104
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm not good at looking at the fire again.

105
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Then I'll go because I have all my stones.

106
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Okay.

107
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'll do it myself.

108
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I don't know.

109
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I did my best.

110
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Hello?

111
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yes, yes.

112
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'll be right there.

113
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Hey, I'll go to the creative room for a minute.

114
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Okay.

115
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I hope you know what's urgent.

116
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I wanted to be on both sides, but there was a fan who recognized that.

117
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
That was the most impressive.

118
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Wow, as expected, Hwang Jae-hyun.

119
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Hey, did you edit all this in that short time?

120
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Thank you for your hard work.

121
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
If you have something to fix for Ban Hee-jin, tell me.

122
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Hey, you can talk.

123
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I don't want to talk to me.

124
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Ban Hee-jin, do you have feedback?

125
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I heard that you look darker than the real thing.

126
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Please tell me to fix it a little brighter.

127
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I want you to fix it a little brighter.

128
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
In the first place, you said you couldn't do that because your face was sticky.

129
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I can't control the brightness.

130
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Please tell me to use the left angle a little more because your left face is cooler.

131
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I want you to use the angle a little more diversely.

132
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Please tell me to share the space between the two.

133
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Can you tell me?

134
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
If you're in this situation, tell me to raise your eyes.

135
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I did.

136
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Please tell me not to interfere with other people's work.

137
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I can hear everything.

138
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Hey, am I a bug?

139
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Is it a voice-over?

140
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You guys talk directly.

141
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
That's really...

142
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What's wrong with that person?

143
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Yes, writer.

144
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm on my way home.

145
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
What?

146
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Where?

147
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Writer.

148
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
How did you come here?

149
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I remember that you said you were going to live near here.

150
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Oh, so you had something to do near here?

151
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
No, I came to see you.

152
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm going to finish my exhibition this week.

153
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I think I'll be busy with the exhibition tomorrow.

154
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm going to see you for a while.

155
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Is it because you came all of a sudden?

156
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
No.

157
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Then I'll be at a coffee place near here.

158
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Would you like to come with me?

159
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Okay.

160
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I needed a coffee right now.

161
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Let's go.

162
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Yes.

163
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Oh!

164
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Are you okay?

165
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Yes, I'm okay.

166
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Let's go.

167
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Are you dating now?

168
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I didn't say I was dating yet.

169
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Hey, who's been telling me to date these days?

170
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
If you even put on your finger, you wouldn't have said anything.

171
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
But you haven't contacted me for three days?

172
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Yes.

173
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Isn't that a bit too much?

174
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm a good writer, but I'm so busy with the exhibition.

175
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And I can't contact you in advance.

176
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'll come and talk to you.

177
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Okay.

178
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
And you said you couldn't contact me.

179
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You came to me and talked to me in advance.

180
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
How sweet.

181
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Yes, that's right.

182
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
That's why I didn't contact you on purpose.

183
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'll contact you when the exhibition is over tomorrow.

184
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Is tomorrow the last day of the exhibition?

185
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Yes.

186
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Then shouldn't you buy flowers?

187
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Flowers?

188
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Hey, you said you were very busy.

189
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I think you'll have to take care of it and be a little bit clumsy.

190
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Don't go if you're not here.

191
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I might not have said anything because I was worried.

192
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It's not another day, it's the last day of the exhibition.

193
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Wouldn't you be so sad if you didn't come?

194
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You're crazy.

195
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm just a girl who's been hanging out right now, but I'm not good at it.

196
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I met the people who were famous for writing.

197
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:01,000
He was a more childish than I thought.

198
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
But I guess he's a tyrant.

199
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
How do you usually do this?

200
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You're talking about phone hacking and the non-release account?

201
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I don't know.

202
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm not doing it myself.

203
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Did you tell Ban Hee-jin?

204
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I didn't lie because I thought I'd be careful if I said it in a vague way.

205
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I found the evidence for sure, so I'll tell you now.

206
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Don't tell me you're going to tell me all this?

207
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I think it's better than knowing and becoming a fool.

208
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Oh, Ban Hee-jin.

209
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Yes.

210
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Where are you now?

211
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I'm going to go to the exhibition hall.

212
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Now?

213
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Okay, okay.

214
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Ban Hee-jin is on his way to the exhibition hall.

215
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
What?

216
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Aren't you going?

217
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
This?

218
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I've never ridden this before.

219
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm going first.

220
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Oh, my.

221
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Wait a minute.

222
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I think it hurts.

223
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I'll explain later.

224
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Hold tight.

225
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Hey, it's my dragon.

226
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Hey, get on it.

227
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Please go to the exhibition hall.

228
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Please go to the exhibition hall.

229
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'm glad you're all here.

230
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Shall we go in now?

231
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Okay.

232
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Thank you.

233
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Hey, what's wrong with the car?

234
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
You have a license, right?

235
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Hey, can I help you?

236
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Hold tight.

237
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Thank you.

238
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Thank you.

239
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Thank you.

240
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Thank you.

241
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Oh, my.

242
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Oh, my.

243
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:52,740
I make sure second as not casa, good night auf the endless

244
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,740
I can't believe you're doing this.

245
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,740
I came here because I missed you.

246
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,740
I couldn't even contact you.

247
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,740
You're going to see me tonight anyway.

248
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,740
I was going to leave this alone.

249
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,740
I'm sorry.

250
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,740
I'm sorry.

251
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,740
When did you come?

252
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,740
You should call me if you come.

253
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,740
Let's go.

254
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,740
What did I just see?

255
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,740
You don't have to see me.

256
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,740
That's not it.

257
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,740
Let's go.

258
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,740
Wait a minute.

259
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,740
I'm sorry.

260
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:03,740
Can you explain this situation to me?

261
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,740
What situation?

262
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:09,740
This situation right now.

263
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:18,740
Oh, you saw it.

264
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:22,740
But why should I explain this?

265
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:26,740
I don't think there's a reason to explain this to anyone in my life.

266
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,740
You're right.

267
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,740
We're not even dating.

268
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:39,740
I think it's my heart to meet someone and do anything.

269
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,740
Do you know Ji-young?

270
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,740
Is this what you're like?

271
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,740
I'm not like that.

272
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,740
I'm not like that.

273
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,740
I'm not like that.

274
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,740
I'm not like that.

275
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,740
Bani.

276
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,740
I think you look more weird now.

277
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:13,740
I don't think it's a bit strange to go to the exhibition hall without inviting you.

278
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,740
Let's talk later.

279
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,740
It's an important day for me today.

280
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,740
I'm going to the exhibition hall.

281
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,740
Bani.

282
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,740
What are you talking about?

283
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,740
Bani.

284
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,740
Mr. J, congratulations.

285
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,740
The work is so good.

286
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,740
I'm not done talking about myself yet.

287
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,740
Bani.

288
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:22,740
But I don't think I can talk to a person like you.

289
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,740
This is better.

290
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,740
Hey!

291
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,740
Are you crazy?

292
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,740
Are you out of your mind now?

293
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,740
You know what I'm saying.

294
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,740
I almost forgot.

295
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:59,740
But no matter how much I think about it, it's not normal to kiss someone else.

296
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,740
What are you doing?

297
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,740
You're all here.

298
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,740
Why are you so embarrassed?

299
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,740
I'm going now.

300
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,740
I have a common sense unlike you.

301
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,740
But I'll just say one thing before that.

302
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,740
You!

303
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,740
You should be a human before you do art.

304
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,740
Hey!

305
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,740
What are you doing?

306
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,740
If you don't want to get embarrassed, stop it.

307
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,740
Are you okay?

308
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,740
You're a bad person.

309
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,740
What are you doing?

310
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,740
Let's talk about that.

311
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,740
I'm sorry.

312
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,740
I'm sorry.

313
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,740
You should get dressed.

314
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,740
I'm sorry.

315
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,740
Dad!

316
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,740
Are you done crying?

317
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,740
Yes.

318
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,740
Let's go then.

319
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:01,740
I think my tears are a little bit wet.

320
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,740
I'll wash this for you.

321
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:05,740
Okay.

322
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,740
You knew everything, right?

323
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,740
That's why you're so dry.

324
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,740
I guess I really dated someone.

325
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,740
I was so beaten up by a thief.

326
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,740
I'm so sorry.

327
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,740
I'm so sorry.

328
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,740
Why are you sorry?

329
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,740
I'm sorry.

330
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,740
I'm sorry.

331
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,740
I'm sorry.

332
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,740
I'm sorry.

333
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,740
I'm so sorry.

334
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,740
Why are you so sorry?

335
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,740
Go.

336
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,740
Okay.

337
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,740
Bani.

338
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,740
Are you okay?

339
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,740
Are you okay?

340
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,740
That was the academy, right?

341
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,740
No.

342
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,740
It was really cool.

343
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:44,740
Well,

344
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,740
I was so annoyed.

345
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,740
But you didn't cry in front of me.

346
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,740
You were the coolest person I've ever seen.

347
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,740
You know when you cry, right?

348
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,740
Really?

349
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,740
Bani.

350
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,740
I told you to be gentle.

351
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:18,740
How did Yongraeng wear this?

352
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,740
Here.

353
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,740
Hey,

354
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,740
I'll kill you all.

355
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,740
It's a treasure anyway.

356
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,740
You should fix it this time.

357
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,740
It's okay.

358
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:42,740
Yongraeng is a real life.

359
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,740
Hey.

360
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,740
What happened to you?

361
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,740
You were in a hurry. Did you solve it?

362
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,740
Are you okay?

363
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,740
Bani was hurt, right?

364
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,740
Oh, my God.

365
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,740
I'll fix it for you.

366
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:21,740
Get it.

367
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:30,740
I told you to go to the exhibition.

368
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:35,740
No, I just realized that you're the only one.

369
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,740
I'm glad.

370
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:39,740
But you're so cool that you're going to get revenge.

371
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:40,740
Cool?

372
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:42,740
You're a trash.

373
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:46,740
You should cover up for him.

374
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,740
You named him Jaeil, right?

375
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:50,740
Don't worry.

376
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,740
He's always been a genius.

377
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:54,740
What?

378
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,740
He was a genius.

379
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:57,740
Next news.

380
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,740
Jaeil's personal life controversy,

381
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:03,740
known as a face-less sculptor, is growing.

382
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:07,740
Jaeil is the youngest sculptor in 2024.

383
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:11,740
He's the most attention-seeker in Korea.

384
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,740
According to the victim's testimony,

385
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,740
Jaeil has a negative influence on his reputation.

386
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:21,740
He has a negative relationship with students.

387
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,740
Yes.

388
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,740
The fourth foundation said that

389
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,740
they would stop all the complaints about the writer.

390
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,740
I think you should leave my creative studio today.

391
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,740
If you tell me to leave right now,

392
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,740
how can I leave?

393
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,740
I'm sorry.

394
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:41,740
Hello.

395
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,740
What?

396
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,740
Did you get the star?

397
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,740
What's wrong with you?

398
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,740
Hey!

399
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,740
It smells...

400
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,740
Is it a poop?

401
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:06,740
Jaeil!

402
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,740
Jaeil!

403
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:10,740
Are you sure you got a negative relationship with the women?

404
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,740
I'll tell you a word about the four-day controversy.

405
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:13,740
Jaeil!

406
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,740
Jaeil!

407
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,740
Jaeil!

408
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,740
Jaeil!

409
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,740
Jaeil!

410
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,740
Jaeil!

411
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:19,740
Jaeil!

412
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,740
Jaeil!

413
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,740
Jaeil!

414
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,740
Jaeil!

415
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,740
Jaeil!

416
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,740
Jaeil!

417
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,740
Jaeil!

418
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,740
Jaeil!

419
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,740
Jaeil is in the US

420
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,740
on the scene of him leaving the studio

421
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,740
because he is in an art festival.

422
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,740
The police...

423
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,740
Then that guy is out of the blue.

424
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,740
and our half-boyfriend is...

425
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,740
Are you two dating?

426
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,740
What?

427
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,740
Why are you two dating?

428
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,740
Yeori and Wonhee!

429
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,740
Hey, what are you saying?

430
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,740
Why would they date?

431
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,740
They're not in the same world.

432
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,740
Anyway...

433
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,740
I won't date you anymore.

434
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,740
What are you talking about?

435
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,740
Why are you going out so extreme?

436
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,740
Don't do that.

437
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,740
I've been through this twice in a row.

438
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,740
Do you want me to do it?

439
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,740
I...

440
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,740
I don't want to be first,

441
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,740
hurt, and hurt.

442
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,740
I don't want to do it.

443
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,740
It's all this way to come back when you give me your heart.

444
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,740
It's all this way.

445
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,740
Hey,

446
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,740
there's nothing wrong with the world.

447
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,740
There are some guys who think of you like this.

448
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,740
No, if...

449
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,740
If you like them,

450
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,740
you won't date them?

451
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,740
Those guys...

452
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,740
You?

453
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,740
Let's go.

454
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,740
Let's go.

455
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,740
No.

456
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,740
Hey, why did you bring me home?

457
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,740
Why would you worry?

458
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,740
Gu-hye, Won-hee is

459
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,740
the one who takes care of her sister.

460
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,740
And Yeori...

461
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,740
No,

462
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,740
let's go home.

463
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,740
I told you not to go there.

464
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,740
Don't you know that you're that kind of person?

465
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,740
What are you?

466
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,740
If you don't want to get kicked out, stop it.

467
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,740
Why aren't you being serious?

468
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,740
I'm not that bad.

469
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,740
I'm not that bad.

470
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,740
I'm not that bad.

471
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,740
I'm not that bad.

472
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,740
I'm not that bad.

473
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,740
I'm not that bad.

474
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,740
That combination

475
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,740
is really unrealistic.

476
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,740
What kind of clothes are you wearing?

477
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,740
Are you mad at me?

478
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,740
I think our relationship is over now.

479
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,740
You don't have a relationship with me.

480
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,740
I'm just here to drink coffee.

481
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,740
I'm just sitting here.

482
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,740
You're so self-conscious.

483
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,740
So you don't like me?

484
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,740
I like you.

485
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,740
But...

486
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,740
Are you really just people?

487
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,740
You put a half and a half together?

488
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,740
Why?

489
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,740
Do you think you're a fool again?

490
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,740
What about you?

491
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,740
Are you worried about Ban Hee-jin?

492
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,740
Or...

493
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,740
Love?

494
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,740
No, that's not it.

495
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,740
No matter how close we are,

496
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,740
we even know each other by sticking together.

497
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,740
And you're the one who's making up for that bastard in the car.

498
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,740
You're the one who's making up for that bastard in the car.

499
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,740
You're the one who's making up for that bastard, right?

500
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,740
I think I'm trying to make up for it.

501
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,740
Why should I make up for it?

502
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,740
It's my real relationship.

503
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,740
What are you talking about?

504
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,740
Is it about the love that Ban Hee-jin had?

505
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,740
Oh, good.

506
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,740
Hello?

507
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,740
Yes, I'm the prosecutor.

508
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,740
Now?

509
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,740
Yes, of course I can go.

510
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,740
I'll go now.

511
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,740
Where? Bororae?

512
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,740
But it's Bororae right now.

513
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,740
Do you have an apartment?

514
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,740
Don't worry about it right now!

515
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,740
Thank you.

516
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,740
Fighting!

517
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:16,740
Bororae.

518
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,740
I think you're in a hurry.

519
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,740
Should I give you a ride?

520
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:49,740
Pardon?

521
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,740
I'll give you a ride.

522
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,740
You should look a little better.

523
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,740
Yes, of course.

524
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,740
Oh, right, right.

525
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,740
Yes.

526
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,740
Then hold on tight.

527
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:12,740
Yes.

528
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,740
My heroine is faster than you think.

529
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,740
Oh, this.

530
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,740
Thank you so much.

531
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,740
Give me your phone.

532
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:51,740
What?

533
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,740
My phone.

534
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,740
Your phone?

535
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,740
This is my number.

536
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,740
Please call me. I'll kill you.

537
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,740
I'll call you.

538
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,740
I'll kill you.

539
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:10,740
I have to do it.

540
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:15,740
What do you like about Bororae?

541
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,740
Thank you, Yeonbong.

542
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:29,740
You have everything in your life.

543
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:34,740
Who will be the winner?

544
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:35,740
Me.

545
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,740
Minju.

546
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:40,740
Next, Inche.

547
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:46,740
Heejin and Wonhee.

548
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:48,740
Okay.

549
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:50,740
Professor, I'll do it.

550
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:51,740
Yurido?

551
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:52,740
Okay, then.

552
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,740
There are three teams.

553
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,740
Next, Layup.

554
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:59,740
I didn't disturb you two.

555
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,740
What are you talking about?

556
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:02,740
I'd be better if you three did it.

557
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:03,740
Really?

558
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:04,740
That's a relief.

559
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:07,740
I wanted to do the same thing with you.

560
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:08,740
Me?

561
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:09,740
Yes.

562
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:12,740
And you and Taeha.

563
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,740
Please take care of me.

564
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,740
Okay, I'll take care of you.

565
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:21,740
I have classes in the back.

566
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:23,740
I'll make a separate room.

567
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,740
Okay, I'll invite you.

568
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:26,740
Okay.

569
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:28,740
Go.

570
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:34,740
What's wrong?

571
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,740
Why are you so shy?

572
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:39,740
I was usually shy for a month.

573
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:40,740
Why?

574
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,740
Why didn't you and I be shy?

575
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:44,740
I see.

576
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:46,740
Why were you so comfortable from the beginning?

577
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:48,740
I'm sure.

578
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:50,740
I'm a bit friendly.

579
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:52,740
This is all like my dad.

580
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:54,740
When my dad goes to the police station,

581
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:56,740
two people come back from their friends.

582
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:58,740
This is all like me.

583
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:26,740
Are you okay?

584
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:56,740
I'm sorry.

585
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:51,740
Bad今日は

586
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:52,740
I knew you would do that.

587
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:55,740
He spent three days and nights with Conti Green.

588
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:57,740
Conti?

589
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:00,740
Are we going to the fair?

590
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:04,740
Anyway, there's no way to do it roughly.

591
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:26,740
Conti Green

592
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:32,740
Thank you for your hard work.

593
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:35,740
Thank you for your hard work.

594
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:37,740
Thank you.

595
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:39,740
Goodbye.

596
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:42,740
Then I'll just find the real number.

597
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:44,740
Yes, I'll ask you for that.

598
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:46,740
Hey, Suho, see you in the studio later.

599
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:48,740
Goodbye.

600
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:52,740
I thought you were being too much.

601
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,740
No?

602
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:56,740
Why am I crying?

603
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:59,740
You said they were bad people.

604
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,740
Then it's okay.

605
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:09,740
Thank you for that.

606
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:12,740
I have to go.

607
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:15,740
Goodbye.

608
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:17,740
I have to go.

609
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:19,740
Goodbye.

610
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:22,740
It's okay.

611
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:25,740
Or are you pretending to be okay?

612
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:27,740
I'm sorry.

613
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:29,740
I'm sorry.

614
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,740
I'm sorry.

615
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:33,740
I'm sorry.

616
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,740
I'm sorry.

617
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:37,740
I'm sorry.

618
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,740
I'm sorry.

619
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:41,740
I'm sorry.

620
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:43,740
I'm sorry.

621
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:45,740
I'm sorry.

622
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:47,740
I'm sorry.

623
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:49,740
I'm sorry.

624
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:51,740
I'm sorry.

625
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:53,740
I'm sorry.

626
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:55,740
I'm sorry.

627
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:58,740
Bani, should we have a meal tomorrow?

628
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,740
I borrowed all the equipment and the con-tips.

629
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,740
You have to wash them all night.

630
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:14,740
Hey, it's a shoot tomorrow. Just do it gently.

631
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:16,740
You have to work hard on this.

632
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:19,740
You can only give Chun-sik and Hodong the timetable.

633
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:21,740
Okay, I'm going.

634
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:23,740
What?

635
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:25,740
Let's cheer up.

636
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:27,740
I'm going to the real one.

637
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:29,740
Bye.

638
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:31,740
I'm going to the real one.

639
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:33,740
Bye.

640
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:35,740
I'm going to the real one.

641
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:37,740
I'm going to the real one.

642
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:39,740
Bye.

643
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:08,740
I'm just curious to know what you and Hodong would be like together.

644
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:18,740
This could be right to us here on the house.

645
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:23,740
What would this be?

646
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:25,740
Then,

647
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:27,740
We have to be grateful.

648
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:33,740
I have another class right now.

649
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:43,840
It's tasty.

650
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:49,840
Quickly, quickly.

651
00:50:49,840 --> 00:51:01,900
How come I'm like this suddenly?

652
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:07,660
task, take this for honors.

653
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:11,500
nauseous.

654
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:17,740
Take care.

655
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:27,740
I'm sorry.

656
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:31,740
Today's special was delicious without any trouble.

657
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:32,740
I knew it.

658
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:37,740
I heard that the person who sent the message late in the day was more scary.

659
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:40,740
But are you shooting something?

660
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:46,740
What is it?

661
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:50,740
This time, I'll take a picture of you going left and right.

662
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,740
I think you can do it just like just now.

663
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:54,740
I heard you're preparing for the contest.

664
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:57,740
I guess that's where you're shooting.

665
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:58,740
Shall we go?

666
00:51:58,740 --> 00:51:59,740
Yes.

667
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:01,740
Let's go, Dong-hwan.

668
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:04,740
Let's go.

669
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:06,740
Camera roll.

670
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:09,740
Dong-hwan, ready.

671
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:10,740
Action.

672
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:11,740
Action.

673
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:35,740
Cut.

674
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:36,740
Okay.

675
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:37,740
Okay.

676
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:38,740
It's so good.

677
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:39,740
What is it?

678
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:40,740
Is it an idol?

679
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:41,740
What is it?

680
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:42,740
Don't be so mean.

681
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:43,740
Don't be so mean.

682
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:46,740
This time, I'll change the lens and go into the title.

683
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:48,740
Just like just now, please do well.

684
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:50,740
No, let's go.

685
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:51,740
Okay.

686
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:52,740
Wait a minute.

687
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,740
I'll pass by.

688
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:56,740
Wait a minute.

689
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,740
I'll be careful.

690
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:00,740
Wait a minute.

691
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:02,740
I'll be careful.

692
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:16,740
Yeol, are you going in?

693
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:19,740
Yes, let's go.

694
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:27,740
But Yeol-hee, you're a better person than I thought.

695
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:32,740
I think I was a little professional when I was shooting.

696
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:36,740
Why do you compliment her?

697
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:41,740
Well, I think it's not that bad.

698
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:44,740
How nice is it to be so pretty?

699
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:47,740
Right?

700
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:51,740
I know.

701
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:53,740
What's your brother?

702
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:56,740
Are you worried about Hwanhee?

703
00:53:56,740 --> 00:54:03,740
Or affection?

704
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:04,740
You did a good job.

705
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:07,740
Thank you for your hard work.

706
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:08,740
Thank you for your hard work.

707
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:09,740
Thank you for your hard work.

708
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:10,740
Thank you for your hard work.

709
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:11,740
Thank you for your hard work.

710
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:18,740
Hey, Yeol, I've been feeling this way since I saw you in the concert.

711
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:22,740
This concert is also a big surprise.

712
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:27,740
I always turn around like this.

713
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:30,740
So you're not going to buy it?

714
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:34,740
I'm not going to buy it.

715
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:36,740
Buy it.

716
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:38,740
Everyone, you did a good job.

717
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:39,740
Eat a lot.

718
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:40,740
Thank you.

719
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:41,740
I'll enjoy the meal.

720
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:43,740
Call me when you need it.

721
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:45,740
Eat.

722
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:06,740
Yeong, can I order some miscellaneous food?

723
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:09,740
Then please give me all the miscellaneous food.

724
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:15,740
Please enjoy it alone.

725
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:17,740
I'll breathe.

726
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:19,740
Please give me some money.

727
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:33,740
Hello, mister.

728
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:34,740
Hello.

729
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:35,740
I'm a student.

730
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:37,740
Oh, are you here?

731
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:39,740
Yes, thank you.

732
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:42,740
I'll stop the pick-up.

733
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:43,740
Are you okay?

734
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:45,740
I'm okay.

735
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:52,740
I'm tired.

736
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:11,740
I'm sorry.

737
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:36,740
What's wrong with your phone?

738
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:37,840
Smile?

739
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,440
or something else?

740
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:49,320
We need to act like that.

741
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:53,200
I needed 10 grand.

742
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:00,700
Still, it's not like I don't want to cry.

743
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:16,740
I'm sorry.

744
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:46,740
I'm sorry.

745
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:16,740
Oh.

746
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:26,740
I'm sorry.

747
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:56,740
I'm sorry.

748
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:25,240
Does it hurt?

749
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:35,240
Oh, it's recent來說.

750
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:40,240
Oh, my.

751
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:43,240
Oh, my.

752
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:50,240
Why am I eloping?

753
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:08,040
I'm so...

754
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,440
I'm so sorry.

755
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:17,240
Hey, Jaeyeol.

756
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:18,840
How long has this been?

757
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,280
I missed you.

758
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:21,980
You missed me, right?

759
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:23,280
You came out for a break,

760
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,780
so I'll drink with you today.

761
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:28,680
Then what did you want to eat with Guni?

762
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:31,780
Oh?

763
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,140
I'm sick of this.

764
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:36,080
I'll be right back.

765
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:37,180
Okay.

766
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:36,100
I forgot.

767
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:50,280
Haenei!

768
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:39,140
The story that we will draw together

769
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:43,140
The sky is white, the sky is bright

770
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:48,140
The light that Bani is overflowing

771
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:52,140
I'm fine, aren't I?

772
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:55,140
You're not hurt anywhere, are you?

773
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:58,140
I'm glad.

774
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:02,140
The drawing that draws with your eyes

775
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:06,140
It never gets erased

776
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:10,140
It becomes a picture of you

777
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:15,140
Draw me

778
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:20,140
Hey, Bani.

779
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:23,140
You...

780
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:27,140
Do you want to keep on talking?

781
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:32,140
What's the problem this time?

782
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:37,140
Me...

783
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:44,140
Me...

784
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:51,140
I'm broken.

785
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:57,140
Me...

786
01:03:57,140 --> 01:04:01,140
Do you like me?

787
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:25,140
I think I've seen you for a while

788
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:29,140
You are the forward star

789
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:39,140
I turn around the road that's dark

790
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:43,140
I run without a breath

791
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:48,140
Time stops and it's hidden

792
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:52,140
I think I've laughed for a while

793
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:56,140
We are the forward stars

794
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:08,140
Like a meteor that covers the darkness

795
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:14,140
Your traces that hide my heart

796
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:19,140
Find me in the light

797
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:22,140
I'm searching for your starlight

798
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:25,140
And hear me out, what's in the shadows

799
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:28,140
Smile for her within the dark

800
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:32,140
You were always trying for me

801
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:35,140
We were always meant to be together

802
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:38,140
I'm flying into the sky to find you

803
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:40,140
Oh, my Bani

804
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:44,140
Is this really a fight?

805
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:45,140
Me?

806
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:47,140
That guy is an oppa.

807
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:49,140
Is he your senior?

808
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:51,140
If you're going to play with Bani,

809
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:52,140
you should stop there.

810
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:54,140
I'm not kidding.

811
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:56,140
You said you never like him.

812
01:05:56,140 --> 01:05:58,140
But you didn't say no.

813
01:05:58,140 --> 01:06:00,140
Is the equipment important now?

814
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:01,140
You almost got hurt.

815
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:05,140
You even confessed to me that you like him.

816
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:09,140
It's not a mistake.
