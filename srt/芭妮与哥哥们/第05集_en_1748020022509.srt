Okay, Byeongjun!

00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,920
Okay, Byeongjun!

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,120
Every Friday at 11 PM

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,540
Hey,ぜ니 ries-de-je.

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,280
Do you want to keep going back and forth like this?

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,560
What's the problem this time?

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I...

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,460
I broke up with you.

9
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,760
I...

10
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,140
I think you like me.

11
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:01,960
I...

12
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,300
I...

13
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,240
I think you like me.

14
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,400
I think you...

15
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,160
I think you like me.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm going to make a new bed.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm going to make a new bed.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm going to make a new bed.

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm going to make a new bed.

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Will you marry me?

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Will you marry me?

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Will you marry me?

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Will you marry me?

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Will you marry me?

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Will you marry me?

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Will you marry me?

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Will you marry me?

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Will you marry me?

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Will you marry me?

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Will you marry me?

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Will you marry me?

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Will you marry me?

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Will you marry me?

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Mr. Lee.

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Mr. Lee.

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm going to arrest you as a criminal.

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Let's go to the police station right now.

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Wait a minute.

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm a criminal.

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Honey.

81
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
How can you do that?

82
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm going to arrest you.

83
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Stay still, Mr. Lee.

84
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Mr. Lee.

85
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Do you really think you can marry me?

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Mr. Lee.

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I was so drunk that I had to drink.

88
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
How much do you think?

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But...

90
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm sure you're really drunk.

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
How did you come home?

92
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Did you drink too much?

93
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Come out.

94
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Do you like me?

95
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Are you crazy?

96
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Are you really crazy?

97
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Mr. Lee.

98
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Mr. Lee.

99
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Oh, yes.

100
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Because of this.

101
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Because of this.

102
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You went in well yesterday, right?

103
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You don't remember?

104
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Why?

105
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Did I do something else?

106
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You did something a lot, right?

107
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Tears.

108
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Tears?

109
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Please.

110
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Can you please cry properly?

111
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Hey.

112
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm so jealous.

113
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
My legs...

114
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
My legs are so fast.

115
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You know the fight.

116
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
What are you looking at?

117
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Aren't you going to go?

118
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You're really good at playing the main character.

119
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Let's go later.

120
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Hey.

121
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Mr. Lee.

122
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm not here.

123
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm here.

124
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
What do you mean?

125
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And...

126
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Is there another?

127
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You even confessed that you like me.

128
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
That's not a mistake.

129
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
What?

130
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's not a mistake.

131
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I almost got heartbroken.

132
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Did you just confess again in your mind?

133
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Okay, okay.

134
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Everyone's going to have an exam today, so you must have been out of your mind.

135
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Thank you for joining the meeting like this.

136
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Okay.

137
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
There's no one.

138
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
What do you mean?

139
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
No way.

140
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Are you in pain?

141
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Okay, I remember.

142
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
That black eye.

143
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That empty tail.

144
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Fighting today.

145
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm sure this is going to be a pain in the ass.

146
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Everyone, take the exam and come back.

147
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I have an important appointment. I'm going first.

148
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Okay.

149
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
What is it?

150
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Where did you go?

151
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Are you here?

152
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I don't think there's a reason.

153
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You're here.

154
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Oh, you're here.

155
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's a little cool.

156
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Oh, here.

157
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Please sit here.

158
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You eat very beautifully.

159
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I couldn't have lunch earlier.

160
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Oh, I see.

161
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Then what's your ideal type?

162
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Pardon?

163
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm a good cook.

164
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
A cook?

165
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Yes, I have a sense of taste.

166
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And I can see a little bit of the meat when I grill it.

167
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's a little bit of a heart.

168
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Well, can I have some crab meat?

169
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
No, I'm fine.

170
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
No, no, no.

171
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
This crab is the best to cut with your hands.

172
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Oh, the size.

173
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's okay.

174
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I can do it that much.

175
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Oh, my.

176
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Mom, I'm here.

177
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I ran around my hair.

178
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Then I'll go first.

179
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I was grateful again that day.

180
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Excuse me.

181
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Pardon?

182
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
By any chance.

183
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Where do you know the test report of the midterm exam?

184
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Pardon?

185
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I really want to do a lot of things today.

186
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
The midterm exam is to replace it with the midterm exam.

187
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'll reflect all the final results even if it's a midterm exam, so don't think about it.

188
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yes.

189
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You know that the midterm exam starts from the second grade, right?

190
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
The team that can work on the main song is just one team.

191
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Among them, the top-ranking will be given to just one person.

192
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Don't think about the top-ranking, think about the independent survival.

193
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Yes, sir.

194
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Everyone, good work.

195
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
The test report is always in your heart.

196
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Thank you.

197
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm going to the library and study.

198
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Do you want to go with me?

199
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Go with me. I told you to do it.

200
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Oh, okay.

201
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
But did you do all the sketching?

202
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Yes. I did it all because Wonhee oppa couldn't do it.

203
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Oh, really?

204
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm a teacher.

205
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Can you help me out?

206
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Me?

207
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Come comfortably. I'll go first.

208
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Oh, okay.

209
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Why are you going to the hap-pe again?

210
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Hello.

211
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Sit down.

212
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Didn't you put the seat in the front seat?

213
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yes.

214
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Your seat.

215
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Me?

216
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:32,000
What are you doing?

217
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Can't you just be honest with me?

218
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
What's wrong this time?

219
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You did something wrong.

220
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Then why are you doing this?

221
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You were just sitting down and looking at me like this.

222
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Excuse me.

223
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Please be quiet a little bit.

224
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Oh.

225
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm sorry.

226
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I really don't know.

227
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Then think about it.

228
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:50,000
What's wrong with you?

229
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'm sorry.

230
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Thank you.

231
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Thank you.

232
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Are you going to study?

233
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Why?

234
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
No, I didn't do anything good to study.

235
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Do you want to go with me?

236
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
No.

237
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Oh, I'm just going to study at home today.

238
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Then goodbye.

239
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Hello.

240
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Where's Bani?

241
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm at school.

242
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I thought it was a great place to study.

243
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Let's study together there.

244
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Where is that?

245
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Thank you so much for today.

246
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
No, it's the same zone.

247
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I'll help you.

248
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I found a place to study.

249
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Bani is coming.

250
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Do you want to go for dinner?

251
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Since you helped me, I'll buy it.

252
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Oh, sorry.

253
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Let's eat dinner together next time.

254
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'll go first.

255
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You did a good job.

256
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
You did a good job, too.

257
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I thought you were going home.

258
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I know.

259
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Why would I be here?

260
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Dong-ah said he could study here.

261
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
But I heard there were three of us.

262
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I was invited, too.

263
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I called you.

264
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
You're our fan, too.

265
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You can go in.

266
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It's clean.

267
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Where is Dong-ah?

268
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Oppa!

269
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
What are you doing?

270
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Let's start the pork belly party.

271
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Pork belly?

272
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
You have to make a good meal before studying.

273
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Shall we go up?

274
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I can't eat meat.

275
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I can't eat meat.

276
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I can't eat meat.

277
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I can't eat meat.

278
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I can't eat meat.

279
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I can't eat meat.

280
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I have to grill meat today.

281
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm hungry.

282
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
There's a way.

283
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Can I really eat here?

284
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Of course. I heard I'm hungry in my room.

285
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
How about this?

286
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You have to eat meat.

287
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
It looks delicious.

288
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I haven't eaten pork belly in a long time.

289
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I didn't know you'd eat here.

290
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'll grill it.

291
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I'll grill it well done.

292
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Okay.

293
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I'll just eat it.

294
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Okay.

295
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Wait a minute.

296
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It's hot.

297
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Oppa, I heard your hands are too hot.

298
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I'm hungry.

299
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Eat a lot.

300
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Oppa, hurry up and eat.

301
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I'm eating.

302
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Okay.

303
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
By the way, why are you my senior?

304
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
What?

305
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
He's my older brother.

306
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Why am I your senior?

307
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I was a little scared.

308
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I wasn't comfortable from the beginning.

309
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I don't like it.

310
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
You call me a senior.

311
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
You really hate it.

312
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I didn't have any drinks.

313
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I'll buy it.

314
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Then I'll buy it.

315
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Go with me.

316
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Are you a black-and-white drunk?

317
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I'm a black-and-white drunk.

318
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Are you a black-and-white drunk?

319
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
It's stuck on every time I see it.

320
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Because you're my brother.

321
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Oh, my brother?

322
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Is it true that you're my brother?

323
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Then why are you like that?

324
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Pardon?

325
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
If you're going to play with me, just do it there.

326
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I'm not kidding.

327
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I'm serious.

328
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Don't get into trouble.

329
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I'll do it.

330
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
No, it's okay.

331
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Pardon?

332
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I like to grill meat.

333
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Oh, my.

334
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Oh, my.

335
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Oh, my.

336
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Oh, my.

337
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Oh, my.

338
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Oh, my.

339
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Oh, my.

340
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Oh, my.

341
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Oh, my.

342
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Oh, my.

343
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Oh, my.

344
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
What is it?

345
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Isn't it a fire outside?

346
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Oh, my.

347
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I can't do this.

348
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Oh, my.

349
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Oh, my.

350
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
This, this, this.

351
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Oh, my.

352
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I think it's because of the smoke.

353
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Oh, my.

354
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Water, water, water.

355
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Water, water, water.

356
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Oh, my.

357
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Water.

358
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
It's not, is it?

359
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
What are you doing?

360
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I like this.

361
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Come out first.

362
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Look.

363
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Did you not let it go?

364
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Yes, but the equipment is wet.

365
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Is the equipment important now?

366
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
What if you get hurt again?

367
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
But it's expensive.

368
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Then you're really not hurt, are you?

369
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Yes.

370
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:23,000
It's okay.

371
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Can I really not help you?

372
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
It's okay.

373
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:46,000
We should do the surgery.

374
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Everyone must be surprised.

375
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Go in quickly.

376
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Then we'll go first.

377
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
If you need anything, contact me.

378
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Bye.

379
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
My love.

380
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Everyone, go with me on my first ride.

381
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I'll take you.

382
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
No, it's not.

383
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I'm going to be tired.

384
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Then how are you going to go?

385
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
That's right.

386
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Stay here for a while.

387
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I'll be back soon.

388
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I can't go to the water park this summer.

389
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I know.

390
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I said it's not.

391
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
What?

392
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
That guy.

393
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I said it's not what you like.

394
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
But it's not what you like.

395
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
It's a must.

396
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Didn't you see the charm on your eyes?

397
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I'm a real team member.

398
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Shalame.

399
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Palame.

400
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I'm a team member.

401
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I'm a team member.

402
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I'm a team member.

403
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Shalame.

404
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I'm a team member.

405
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
No?

406
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Shalame.

407
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I said it's not what you like.

408
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
But it's not what you like.

409
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
It's a must.

410
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Didn't you see the charm on your eyes?

411
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Hello?

412
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
You're not asleep yet.

413
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Oh, yes, not yet.

414
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
But what's going on at this time?

415
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Just because I thought I was going to get in.

416
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I'll listen to your voice.

417
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Oh, what happened to the studio?

418
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I'll tell you the manager.

419
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I just did my surgery.

420
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Oh, but aren't you getting a cold?

421
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Oh, I'm a little bit wet, but I'm okay.

422
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Wet?

423
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
No, you just sleep quickly.

424
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
It's hot to the end of the blanket.

425
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Oh, yes, yes.

426
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Then say goodbye.

427
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Okay.

428
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
What is this?

429
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
You confessed to me that you liked me.

430
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
That's not a mistake.

431
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Then think about it.

432
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Why am I doing this?

433
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Is the equipment important now?

434
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
What if you have to get hurt again?

435
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Do you really like me?

436
00:33:50,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I'm sorry.

437
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
It's been a few years.

438
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Gong-ju.

439
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
You're going to work on the afternoon, right?

440
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Yes, I'm going to do it for a while.

441
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
What about you?

442
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I'm a little tired, so I'm just going to go home early today.

443
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Why?

444
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Where's your problem?

445
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I just can't sleep well at night.

446
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I heard that if you get old, you'll get less sleep.

447
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
That's not it.

448
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Then let's have lunch together today.

449
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Okay.

450
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
What's wrong?

451
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Did you catch a cold?

452
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Oh, is that so?

453
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I got hit by water yesterday.

454
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I don't have a fever.

455
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I can't sleep, I keep cold, and I can't open my eyes properly.

456
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
It just hurts a lot.

457
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
What?

458
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I want a cold medicine.

459
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:26,000
No matter if it's a tumor, a nose cold, a neck cold, or a drug, it's all good.

460
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
All of it?

461
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I'm going to have to go home.

462
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I'm going to have to go home.

463
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Fighting today, fighting!

464
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
What's wrong?

465
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I can't do it.

466
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Just go to sleep.

467
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
It's hot to the end of the blanket.

468
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I'll prepare it for you.

469
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Hello.

470
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Yes.

471
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
That...

472
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I'm really sorry yesterday.

473
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
No, we also ate deliciously together.

474
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
But it's okay.

475
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Then have a nice day today.

476
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I have a class right now.

477
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Wait a minute.

478
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,000
This is a play I'm playing.

479
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Come see me later.

480
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
What?

481
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
The meat is baked hard.

482
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:09,000
See you that day.

483
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Finally, my phone number has been stopped!

484
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Can you see it?

485
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Oh, that's great.

486
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Oh, my friend!

487
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
What?

488
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I was in the table until yesterday.

489
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Why are you so sad today?

490
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I realized it again.

491
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I never betray my effort.

492
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
What are you saying?

493
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Hello, mother.

494
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Professor.

495
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:11,000
What are you doing?

496
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I was going to say it, but I had to stay in time to say it.

497
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
You said you were busy.

498
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
So this time, are you a professor?

499
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Do you know?

500
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Is your mother's son me?

501
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I haven't said it yet.

502
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Why?

503
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I don't think this is strange right now.

504
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
How can you do that after meeting him?

505
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
You broke up, right?

506
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
And did I have a bad time?

507
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Or did I meet a student?

508
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:55,000
If you're a good person in the first place, you can have a relationship.

509
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
You can't be happy.

510
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,000
You make weird people.

511
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,000
You really don't think about me.

512
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:20,000
In the first place, I brought you here because you said you'd get a double-edged sword.

513
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
What?

514
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
You said you'd raise me to get a building for my father.

515
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Do you know what I'm gonna do?

516
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I'll get everything I need.

517
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I don't have to worry about myself anymore.

518
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
You...

519
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
What are you...

520
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
It's okay.

521
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Let's stop.

522
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Don't think about me like you do now.

523
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Live as you want.

524
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Whatever you say to anyone.

525
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I'll really care about you now.

526
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Why did you get a building?

527
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
How can that be?

528
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Can't I get that much from your dad?

529
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
You should've been so good without missing anything.

530
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
What should I do?

531
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I'm going to live a little longer.

532
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Did you do that wrong?

533
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Huh?

534
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Excuse me?

535
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Excuse me?

536
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
What are you doing?

537
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I'm a medium-sized earner, so I was working on the guitar.

538
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I'm sorry, Ma'am.

539
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I'm sorry.

540
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I'm sorry.

541
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I'm sorry.

542
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I'm sorry.

543
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I'm sorry.

544
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I'm sorry.

545
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I'm sorry.

546
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,800
I was working on the instrument because it was a mid-range.

547
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,600
Oh.

548
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,360
Wow.

549
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,040
It's amazing to see you so close.

550
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,840
It could be like that at first,

551
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,200
but it's just like drawing.

552
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:33,940
It's not like I've never seen it.

553
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,800
What?

554
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I'm sorry.

555
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,800
But I didn't tie my hair today.

556
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,500
I usually tie it.

557
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,300
I forgot about my hair.

558
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,540
How did you know?

559
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I told you.

560
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,000
I didn't say I've never seen it.

561
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I should tie it later.

562
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Give it to me.

563
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I'm sorry.

564
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I'm sorry.

565
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I'm done.

566
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I'm done.

567
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I'm giving it to you.

568
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I bought it because I didn't know,

569
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
but you can take it if you need it.

570
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Huh?

571
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Wasn't this bought by a senior?

572
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
What's that?

573
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
It was put here well, so...

574
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I'm sorry.

575
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I'm sorry.

576
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
It was put here well, so...

577
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I thought you were a married couple.

578
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Take this instead.

579
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I asked you to take all the pills I gave you.

580
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Take the one I bought you.

581
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Take it.

582
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Yes.

583
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Thank you.

584
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Then...

585
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
I'll go first.

586
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Well...

587
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Call me if you're bored.

588
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
You can just do it.

589
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Yes.

590
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Yes.

591
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Did you do well today?

592
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Yes.

593
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I'm going to clean up and go.

594
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
You must be bored by yourself.

595
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I didn't go alone.

596
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I went to Yeori's for a while.

597
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Ah...

598
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Yes, we'll do the step-by-step now.

599
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Sir.

600
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
You can come over here.

601
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Yeoreum.

602
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
We'll go to the show in 5 minutes.

603
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Yes, I understand.

604
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I'll be back.

605
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
This is the golden welcome.

606
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
The best outfit of Yein University.

607
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
The best sports announcer.

608
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,000
I'll be in the broadcasting station like you.

609
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Yes.

610
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I won't be in the broadcasting station with anyone.

611
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I'll be an idol or an actor.

612
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Or...

613
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:40,040
I'll be a

614
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:43,040
Wow, it's been a while since I've seen you.

615
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,040
You know, you know, you're the best.

616
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,040
You're so pretty.

617
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,040
You're in my school.

618
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:49,040
You're so pretty.

619
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,040
Hey, hey.

620
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,040
You're already dead.

621
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,040
You said you two are still in the show.

622
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,040
I forgot.

623
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,040
Why do you keep saying that?

624
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,040
Don't break the record.

625
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,040
Don't break the record.

626
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:11,040
This work's theme is about the emotion of anger and sadness

627
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,040
expressed by the body and posture.

628
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,040
The details are very stable and detailed.

629
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,040
It's good.

630
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,040
You can just go over it.

631
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,040
Good work.

632
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,040
Thank you.

633
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,040
What?

634
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,040
Is there not enough time?

635
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,040
What?

636
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,040
Why are you so stupid?

637
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,040
What are you going to do?

638
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,040
I'll return it.

639
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,040
You should return the final one.

640
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,040
I should return the form.

641
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,040
Will you keep the contract?

642
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,040
Yes.

643
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,040
See you next time.

644
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,040
Bani.

645
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,040
Shall we go eat a special meal after a long time?

646
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,040
I'm going to go to bed early today.

647
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,040
We'll eat together next time.

648
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,040
Here.

649
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,040
Here.

650
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,040
How can I...

651
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,040
You don't have to pay this season.

652
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,040
What do you mean?

653
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,040
If you want to get a daughter who has a lot of money,

654
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,040
you should pay it when you can.

655
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,040
You should have a college graduation

656
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,040
because you can't send her to our company.

657
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,040
But...

658
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:56,040
Bani is so lucky to get a scholarship.

659
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,040
Right?

660
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,040
She's a young girl.

661
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,040
I'm so sad.

662
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,040
He got a middle score on the school page.

663
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,040
I'm sorry.

664
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,040
I'm sorry for everything else.

665
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,040
Call me if you're bored.

666
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,040
Hello?

667
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,040
Bani.

668
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,040
Do you want to come out?

669
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,040
What?

670
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,040
What's going on?

671
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,040
Let's go drive.

672
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,040
Right now?

673
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,040
I don't feel like that.

674
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,040
Let's go.

675
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,040
Bani.

676
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,040
It's nice to be out.

677
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,040
Yes, it is.

678
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,040
It's nice to be out.

679
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,040
I remember

680
00:52:56,040 --> 00:53:01,040
the day we met

681
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,040
I'm a forgetful girl

682
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,040
We used to be alone

683
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,040
The wind is nice.

684
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,040
The scenery is beautiful.

685
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,040
I wanted to drive and come to Han River.

686
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,040
I'm glad.

687
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,040
Thank you, Bani.

688
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,040
You brought me here to comfort me.

689
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,040
Honestly, I...

690
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,040
I was anxious because I was given a teacher's feedback.

691
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,040
I don't want to lose my scholarship

692
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,040
or my scholarship.

693
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:57,040
You're struggling to make me a art.

694
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,040
There's still time.

695
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,040
Don't worry too much.

696
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,040
Well, if you don't want to,

697
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,040
I'll go and carry it.

698
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:11,040
You trust me, right?

699
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:16,040
Oh, are you giving me a bus?

700
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,040
If you want it?

701
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:26,040
But it's cool to be out.

702
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,040
It was so much fun today.

703
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,040
Be careful.

704
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,040
See you at school tomorrow.

705
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,040
Yes.

706
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,040
Oh, my.

707
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,040
Dad.

708
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,040
When did you start here?

709
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,040
Who are you?

710
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,040
That handsome boy.

711
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,040
Are you a man?

712
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,040
No.

713
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,040
A junior.

714
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,040
Don't expect too much.

715
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:05,040
Well, a junior might be a man.

716
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,040
I think of you when you're young.

717
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,040
I like you.

718
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,040
I agree.

719
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,040
Dad,

720
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,040
that guy is really...

721
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,040
No.

722
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,040
Okay, you got it.

723
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,040
That guy is...

724
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,040
Hey, you have a crush on someone.

725
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,040
I don't know.

726
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:25,040
I'll go in.

727
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,040
Say it.

728
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,040
I don't know.

729
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,040
I'll go in.

730
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:31,040
What?

731
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,040
No.

732
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,040
Let's go.

733
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,040
I'm so tired.

734
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,040
I asked you to give me everything you can.

735
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,040
I'll buy you something.

736
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:57,040
I'll buy you something.

737
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,040
You have a crush on someone.

738
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,040
What?

739
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,040
Bani!

740
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,040
What?

741
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:51,040
Someone I like.

742
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,040
Bani!

743
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,040
The weather is great today.

744
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,040
I want to go somewhere.

745
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,040
I know.

746
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:49,040
It'd be great if I go with you.

747
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:52,040
Are you going to be a nightie today?

748
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,040
Yes, maybe.

749
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,040
Oh, okay.

750
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,040
Bani!

751
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:01,040
Bani!

752
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:06,040
You two are coming together.

753
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,040
I met you two before.

754
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,040
Can't we go together?

755
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:13,040
Aren't you tired?

756
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,040
You came home late yesterday.

757
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,040
I'm okay.

758
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:18,040
I slept well.

759
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,040
Are you okay?

760
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,040
I think you had a cold yesterday.

761
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,040
Yes.

762
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:28,040
You seem to be in a fever.

763
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,040
I'm fine.

764
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,040
You don't have fever.

765
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:44,040
If you get sick, I'll take the medicine.

766
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:47,040
Okay.

767
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:01,040
It's spring.

768
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,040
Bani!

769
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,040
Bani!

770
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,040
Bani!

771
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,040
Ha-pyul.

772
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:59,040
I found out when I realized my feelings.

773
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:02,040
How have you been?

774
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,040
Yura?

775
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:19,040
The heroine of this exciting story

776
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:22,040

The heroine of this exciting story

778
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:36,040
is someone else.

779
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:40,040
The heroine of this exciting story

780
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,040
is someone else.

781
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,040
The heroine of this exciting story

782
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:49,040

783
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:53,040
The heroine of this exciting story

784
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:56,040
is someone else.

785
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:59,040
The world is dark

786
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:02,040
before we meet.

787
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:08,040
The moment I saw you

788
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:11,040
I felt like I saw the universe.

789
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:15,040
You are my shining star.

790
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:17,040
I'm your star.

791
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:28,040
Did you see this?

792
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:29,040
Did you miss me?

793
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:31,040
Why would I care about this?

794
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:33,040
I don't think it's a relationship between you and me.

795
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,040
Are you okay?

796
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:36,040
I think you're nice.

797
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:38,040
I'm worried about you.

798
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:40,040
You don't like me?

799
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,040
Let's be careful.

800
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:44,040
I'm not joking.

801
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:46,040
I thought I should tell you.

802
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,040
I'm not joking.

803
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:50,040
What's your opinion?

804
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:53,040
I'm serious about you.
