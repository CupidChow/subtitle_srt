1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,200
You are not anything, Yohan

2
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:13,920
Vivian

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You can't just come and see me.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not sure if you're going to be able to see me.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What should I do?

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Huh?

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What are you talking about?

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I...

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I should keep looking at you.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I should keep looking at you.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Why?

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Huh?

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Shirt!

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Shouldn't you give me a shirt?

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Oh, a shirt.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Oh, yes?

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'll give it to you right away.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Bring it here today.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You're here, right?

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So it's done now, right?

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We don't have to see you again.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yeah.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Let's not see each other anymore.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
There's no reason to see each other.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I know.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Then I'll be just...

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Oh, you two are seeing each other for the first time today, right?

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
This is the CD box, and this is the library.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Was it too much?

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It was too much.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What? Do you already know?

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
No.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
No?

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
See you for the first time.

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Let's start the break right away.

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The junior is half.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Then I'll do this for the role.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I just have to decide on my graduation from the interview.

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What should I do?

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm on my graduation...

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
How about him?

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The director of the lecture this time.

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You don't interview the director, do you?

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
He said he refused all the famous magazine interviews this time.

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Oh, really?

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Who should I do?

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Then you have to decide who to cast.

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What?

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What?

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Just cast as the most famous person you know.

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's all done now, right?

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
That's it.

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What should I do?

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What should I do?

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm here.

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
By the way, what did you do?

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I just did it.

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
By the way,

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
you said you rejected all the famous magazine interviews this year.

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You got the award several times at the museum.

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Really?

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You're not the only handsome person.

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,460
You're a total

77
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,460
handsome person.

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What did you say?

79
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You're a handsome person.

80
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
This meat...

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Look, there are so many.

82
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Right?

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I like the meat.

84
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
If I don't have a meat, I don't have a meat.

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Then I'll have pork belly.

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That's delicious.

87
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Toast!

88
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Don't make a mess of the bread.

89
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Move, move, move.

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Panic, panic, panic.

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Panic, panic.

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm alive.

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm alive.

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Panic, panic, panic.

95
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'll make you dance until you're gone.

96
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'll make you dance until you're gone.

97
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
There's no time to eat.

98
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The game that you like to play.

99
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What game?

100
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Game start!

101
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Rooftop game.

102
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
One, two, three.

103
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Rooftop game.

104
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Rooftop game.

105
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Rooftop game.

106
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'll just make it two times more delicious.

107
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Why aren't you doing it?

108
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Rooftop game.

109
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Rooftop game.

110
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Rooftop game.

111
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Rooftop game.

112
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Stop it.

113
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Rooftop game.

114
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Hey.

115
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Hey.

116
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Did you make it this time?

117
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm sick.

118
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's okay.

119
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You're making it this way.

120
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Can we go to the second car?

121
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You can do it at home.

122
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Don't pull it and go straight.

123
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Okay.

124
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Let's go.

125
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Good night.

126
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Bye.

127
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Bye.

128
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Bye.

129
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Bye.

130
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Hey, you can do this.

131
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You can do it?

132
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Don't be so greedy.

133
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Get in the car.

134
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What? Like this?

135
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm going.

136
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Rooftop game.

137
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Rooftop game.

138
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Rooftop game.

139
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Rooftop game.

140
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Rooftop game.

141
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Rooftop game.

142
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Rooftop game.

143
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Rooftop game.

144
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Rooftop game.

145
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Rooftop game.

146
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Rooftop game.

147
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Rooftop game.

148
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Rooftop game.

149
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Rooftop game.

150
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Oh, I almost lost.

151
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
What are you doing?

152
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You're really a prince.

153
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I hate you.

154
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's nice to be with you today.

155
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Look, look, look.

156
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
How is it?

157
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Is it good?

158
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
No.

159
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's good.

160
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
What is this toy?

161
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Oh, it's a toy.

162
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Say hello.

163
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Young-rong.

164
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Do you want me to go to the library?

165
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
What are you looking at?

166
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Even if you give it to me, you're still a young man.

167
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Hey, we're done.

168
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Oh, my God.

169
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Look at this.

170
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm worried about you.

171
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
How?

172
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Do you want to see a drive?

173
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
No.

174
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'll make you do it.

175
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

176
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Hey, hey, hey.

177
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
The writer you talked about yesterday.

178
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You're the one who talked about it, right?

179
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yes.

180
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Did you really not know?

181
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I didn't know.

182
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
He's the director's ex.

183
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
But what's wrong with your face?

184
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Well, I'm a little dreamy.

185
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I didn't know you'd meet like that.

186
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You can sketch freely with each of them.

187
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:05,000
No.

188
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Oh, as expected.

189
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's Ye-in's official sculpture.

190
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Please come here.

191
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Oh, my God.

192
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Oh, my God.

193
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
My clothes.

194
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
My clothes.

195
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
My clothes.

196
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
My clothes.

197
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
My clothes.

198
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Wow, as expected.

199
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm a model, so I can draw a picture.

200
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Now I see it.

201
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I think you have talent in modeling.

202
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's not a model talent.

203
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's just a visual talent.

204
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Oh, my God.

205
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Oh, I can't get used to the real character.

206
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Oh?

207
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Oh?

208
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
No, wait a minute.

209
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
What's up at school?

210
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I came to see you nearby, and I was going to see your face for a moment.

211
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Can I sell a sketchbook?

212
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
What?

213
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I don't have much to do with this.

214
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Why? Just because you want to see it?

215
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Here.

216
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It's good.

217
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
The ratio is stable.

218
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It's better than me at school.

219
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Oh, I don't know.

220
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:47,000
But thank you.

221
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I think I have something to say.

222
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
That's...

223
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
No.

224
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
What is it? Just tell me.

225
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Can you do an interview for a graduate student?

226
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Interview?

227
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Yes. Actually, I was interviewed by a student, and the students said they wanted to interview the writer.

228
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Oh...

229
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Oh, I asked you in case, so you don't have to worry about it.

230
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'll do it. Interview.

231
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Really?

232
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You don't do interviews well.

233
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You should ask me to do it.

234
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
How about our Young-rok?

235
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Can you feel the speed?

236
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I like speed, too.

237
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Even if it's cute, it's faster than this.

238
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm still young. I'm not used to it.

239
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Oh, hey, isn't that Bani?

240
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Wow, you just had a headache, right?

241
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
What's wrong? I thought you had something.

242
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I thought you had a stomachache.

243
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
We're hired by the writer.

244
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Really?

245
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Wow, you said you didn't do an interview.

246
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'll do it. Interview.

247
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Really?

248
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You should ask me to do it.

249
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I guess the writer did a good job with the interview.

250
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Yes, I decided to interview you.

251
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's good.

252
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
But I guess the writer really likes you.

253
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm a fan.

254
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It's a very special fan service.

255
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Maybe it's not because you're a fan.

256
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I think I'm successful now, so it's like a dream.

257
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Bani, can you go somewhere tomorrow?

258
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Where?

259
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
But do you have a model you thought of?

260
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Not yet.

261
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I guess it's the most expensive one.

262
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
No, it won't work.

263
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It's not for anyone else, but for your brother's birthday.

264
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It's not just expensive, but for a pretty one.

265
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Did you do this?

266
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
How about this?

267
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I think this is pretty.

268
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Oh, it's pretty.

269
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You're going to support the camera, right?

270
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Hey, why is this a event?

271
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Bani.

272
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Hello.

273
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You know me?

274
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Do you know me?

275
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Do you know me?

276
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Do you know me?

277
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Oh, I'm sorry, student.

278
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm here.

279
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Wow.

280
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Why are you looking at me?

281
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Wow.

282
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Wow.

283
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
What's this student?

284
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Oh, my.

285
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You dropped your wallet.

286
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Yeah.

287
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
If you're a man, you should be that confident.

288
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
But I'm sorry.

289
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I think this wallet is going to be handsome.

290
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Thank you.

291
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You're welcome.

292
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Thank you.

293
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Is it because I'm confident?

294
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Or is it because I'm too good?

295
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Oh, my.

296
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I want to keep my jewelry.

297
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Oh, this is a good place.

298
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Oh, wait a minute.

299
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I'll get you a meal and a key call.

300
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I'll get it for you.

301
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm not eating.

302
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Why?

303
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Hey, he really brought it all.

304
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
What's wrong with the ingredients?

305
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Ingredients?

306
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Yeah.

307
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
He's a member of the car.

308
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I heard he's going to return to the library.

309
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Go.

310
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Oh, yeah.

311
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Did you buy this?

312
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Why?

313
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I really like it.

314
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It's so pretty.

315
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
But what's this?

316
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
If you bought it on camera, you should have it.

317
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Camera decoration.

318
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
What?

319
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
You're going to do that?

320
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Someone taught me.

321
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Who?

322
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Did you call me that?

323
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You two are really close.

324
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It's fun.

325
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:13,000
If we're together.

326
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Bani, I like your gift.

327
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Thanks to you, I became a sexy man.

328
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Let's take it again.

329
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It's pretty.

330
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Is it here?

331
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
No, it's not there.

332
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Is it here?

333
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Oh.

334
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Hey, it's much wider than I thought.

335
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Hey, it's clean.

336
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Yeah, it's okay.

337
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Huh?

338
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Right?

339
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
He's an old man.

340
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I heard that new people are coming in next room.

341
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Nice to meet you.

342
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm Jo Harang, a writer.

343
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I...

344
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Oh, you're next room.

345
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Nice to meet you. I'm Lee Dongha.

346
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
These guys are...

347
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It's Kwang Jaeyeol.

348
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
But what's this place?

349
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
We make videos.

350
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Music video or art film.

351
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Oh, you're on the video.

352
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I think we'll meet again.

353
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'll watch it.

354
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Really?

355
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Yes.

356
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It's an honor.

357
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Let's go.

358
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'll be right back.

359
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

360
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
That guy must be very famous.

361
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
How do you do it?

362
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I just saw it.

363
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I was wondering.

364
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
But I'm really good at riding a person like that.

365
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
It's really great.

366
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Right?

367
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I knew it.

368
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Are you two like that because you're going to interview me?

369
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It's mine.

370
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I'm sorry.

371
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Oh, here?

372
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Here.

373
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Here.

374
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Welcome.

375
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Eat meat.

376
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Here.

377
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,000
My son, you look better after a long time.

378
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I'm already shy.

379
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I'm sure.

380
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
You used to be a perfect son.

381
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Who put it in?

382
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
How's your school life?

383
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Do you have a girlfriend?

384
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
You're eating well?

385
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Ask one by one.

386
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
One by one.

387
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I have to ask one or two questions.

388
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
So come home often.

389
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I wish you could just come in.

390
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I'm going to leave the house and sleep.

391
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
You must be so upset.

392
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I'm sorry.

393
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I'm a patient who tasted it with a different oil.

394
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I thought it would be good to taste it together.

395
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Thank you, son.

396
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I'll eat well.

397
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Please take the food in your mouth.

398
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Of course it's delicious because you made it.

399
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Then call me if you need anything.

400
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I'll go.

401
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Enjoy your meal, honey.

402
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I thought we were seeing each other today.

403
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
You two were together.

404
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Just...

405
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Just a little bit.

406
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Why did you meet that guy's mom?

407
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I don't think you'll be able to tell me the difference.

408
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Look at him.

409
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
What's important in the world these days?

410
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
We meet each other when we're happy.

411
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Aren't you tired of it?

412
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I'm tired of it?

413
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I'm tired of it.

414
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
What's important in living with love?

415
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat.

416
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Where are you going?

417
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I ate a lot of what you made, and my mouth is running out.

418
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Open it.

419
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Open it.

420
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Open it.

421
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Hey, open it.

422
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
You're going to eat dinner, right?

423
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I'm going to eat with my mom today.

424
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
What?

425
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Mom, I'm done.

426
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Son, what do we do?

427
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I don't think we can eat dinner together because of work today.

428
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Okay.

429
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I'm sorry, son.

430
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And mom's late today, so don't wait and go to sleep.

431
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Okay.

432
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Do you want to go to school?

433
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Yes.

434
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
How can I do this?

435
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Call?

436
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Yes, let's go.

437
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Let's go to a new place today.

438
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Okay.

439
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Over there.

440
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Isn't that your mother?

441
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Do you want to eat?

442
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Yes.

443
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Did I do something wrong?

444
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Let's go eat pork cutlet.

445
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Wow.

446
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
The writer of the studio is coming in at night.

447
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
What's that smell?

448
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
It's the writer of the lyrics.

449
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
It's really nice.

450
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
It's the writer of the studio.

451
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
It's cool.

452
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
But why aren't Yeori and Donga coming?

453
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
What?

454
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Why are the seniors coming out of here?

455
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Because this is our room.

456
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Oh, are the seniors next to the writer?

457
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Yes.

458
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I'm ready.

459
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Shall we start?

460
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
You're the first person in Korea to be here.

461
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
You're doing a personal exhibition.

462
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Did anything happen to you?

463
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Most people talk about the main work.

464
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I actually like the work called destiny.

465
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,000
It could be good or bad to be called destiny.

466
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I wanted to be on both sides, but there was a fan who recognized it.

467
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
It was the most impressive time.

468
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I was happy.

469
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
If you're resting for a while, I'll go to the studio.

470
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Tell me.

471
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I have a question.

472
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
What program did you listen to when you were in college?

473
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Me?

474
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Hey, Ban Heejin.

475
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Help me set up the set.

476
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Me?

477
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
You're good at this.

478
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Come in.

479
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
What are you doing?

480
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Come in.

481
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Come in.

482
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
The shoot is over, right?

483
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Yes.

484
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I'll take out the microphone.

485
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Oh, is it over?

486
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Then I'll go and organize it first.

487
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Thank you for your hard work today.

488
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Enjoy your meal.

489
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Wow, thank you, sir.

490
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
You've worked hard, too.

491
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Then I'll go first because I have a meeting outside.

492
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Ban Heejin, thank you for your hard work today.

493
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Yes.

494
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Hurry up.

495
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Oh, my.

496
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
What's going on?

497
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Sir.

498
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Thank you for the interview today.

499
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I think you'll be very happy.

500
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
That's a relief.

501
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Next time,

502
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
do you want to come to the studio alone?

503
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Alone?

504
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Yes.

505
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Thank you for the food.

506
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Hey, I'm in a hurry,

507
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
can I organize it by myself?

508
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Alone?

509
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I have an important part-time job.

510
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I have a family meeting, but it's a must-have.

511
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Then I'll organize it.

512
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Okay.

513
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Ban Heejin, thank you.

514
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Yes.

515
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Where do you get this?

516
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
In the first box.

517
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Oh.

518
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
What's this?

519
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
It's a box.

520
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Oh, it's a box.

521
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Oh, it's a box.

522
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Oh, it's a box.

523
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Oh, it's a box.

524
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Oh, it's a box.

525
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Oh, it's a box.

526
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Hey, come out.

527
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
If it's all over, should we stop?

528
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Yes.

529
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Okay.

530
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Why doesn't the door open?

531
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
What are you talking about?

532
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Come out.

533
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
What's wrong with you?

534
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
What's wrong with you?

535
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
What's wrong with you?

536
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Hey.

537
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Excuse me.

538
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
There's someone in here.

539
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Wait.

540
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I don't know what time it is.

541
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Hey, don't you have anything fun to talk about?

542
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Well, all I know is scary stairs.

543
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
In the past, there was a woman whose ears were torn.

544
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

545
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I'm sorry.

546
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I'm sorry.

547
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I'm sorry.

548
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I'm sorry.

549
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I'm sorry.

550
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I'm sorry.

551
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I'm sorry.

552
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I'm sorry.

553
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I'm sorry.

554
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I'm sorry.

555
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

556
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I'm sorry.

557
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
No, I'm sorry.

558
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I'm sorry.

559
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
What is this woman's ghost?

560
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Oh, that's enough.

561
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Don't do it.

562
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I can't hear you.

563
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I was going to draw out ghosts, but you're a lot more timid than I thought.

564
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
What?

565
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I'm suddenly full.

566
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,000
But aren't you worried about me at home?

567
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
It's okay.

568
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
You can say I'm being too nice.

569
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Why is the timing in front of me?

570
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I can't do it right now.

571
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I wouldn't have been worried if I had.

572
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
What are you doing here?

573
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I have to hold it in.

574
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
First, calm down.

575
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Breathe.

576
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
No.

577
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I can't stand it anymore.

578
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Why?

579
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I'm hungry.

580
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Are you hungry?

581
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Hey, you.

582
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
No way.

583
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I was so hungry that I ate rice cake.

584
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
What should I do?

585
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I'm hungry.

586
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Oh, my God.

587
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Oh, my God.

588
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,900
What a relief.

589
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,960
This is so amazing.

590
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:31,220
It's your marriage and all Because of you, nothing must be so nice about you.

591
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:31,880
Don't even ask aTake for harm.

592
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,680
Really, ever.

593
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,800
See what you do.

594
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,360
Oh, wounds.

595
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:45,360
Oh, I didn't know you were hurt.

596
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:50,360
Wait a minute.

597
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,360
It's potato.

598
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:20,360
I really lived because of you.

599
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:29,360
Go away.

600
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:32,360
Do you date that writer?

601
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,360
Why?

602
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,360
No?

603
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:38,360
No, not that.

604
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:43,360
But why?

605
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:48,360
He's not that good.

606
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,360
I don't like him.

607
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,360
Just look at him.

608
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:56,360
What's wrong with you? Why are you suddenly being so cold?

609
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,360
I know people like that.

610
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,360
What do you mean you can't see?

611
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,360
You're not like that?

612
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,360
What are you saying?

613
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:14,360
It's not that.

614
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,360
Hwanhee.

615
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:23,360
Oh, oppa.

616
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,360
Do you want to buy this?

617
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,360
Yes.

618
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,360
As expected.

619
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,360
What are you doing after school today?

620
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,360
Shall we have a taxi together?

621
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:37,360
Today, we're going to have a pajama party with Eddie.

622
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,360
Pajama party?

623
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,360
Yes.

624
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:44,360
If you don't have anything today, do you want to come today?

625
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,360
Can I go?

626
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,360
Of course you can.

627
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,360
Okay.

628
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,360
Then.

629
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:59,360
Let's go.

630
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,360
Wait a minute.

631
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,360
I don't think it's good to be a class model today.

632
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,360
I shouldn't do this.

633
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,360
Why?

634
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:09,360
He's going to be our class model today.

635
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,360
He said he was sick and couldn't come.

636
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:17,360
He hates being a model punk.

637
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,360
Then I'll...

638
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:22,360
You have to listen to the class.

639
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:28,360
Then what are you going to do?

640
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:38,360
I'm going to get a big hair.

641
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,360
What?

642
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:46,360
Are you looking at me?

643
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:53,360
Are you busy right now?

644
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,360
Why am I here?

645
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:59,360
There's nothing hard to do. You can sit there and stay still.

646
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,360
Really?

647
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,360
It's not easy.

648
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,360
I've done it a few times and I know it.

649
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:09,360
It's not easy to be a model.

650
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,360
It's hard to be a self-made product.

651
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,360
You have to be patient.

652
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:16,360
Especially.

653
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:21,360
I have to like this visual.

654
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:26,360
I think it's better if I do it.

655
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:37,360
I'm going to get a hair cut.

656
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:43,360
I'm going to get a hair cut.

657
00:42:43,360 --> 00:43:05,360
What?

658
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,360
What is it?

659
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,360
What is it?

660
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:16,360
In Korean.

661
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:46,360
I'm going to get a hair cut.

662
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:56,360
I'm going to get a hair cut.

663
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:09,360
I knew it.

664
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,360
I got my bangs.

665
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:19,360
I got a great model.

666
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:25,360
But why am I the only one looking at it?

667
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:28,360
I can't even see it.

668
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:31,360
Why are you looking at me like that?

669
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:35,360
It's not a avoidance.

670
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:44,360
This is like a scene where the heroine and Namjoo fall into each other's eyes.

671
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,360
You're so mean.

672
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,360
It's not Namjoo, it's Billon.

673
00:44:47,360 --> 00:45:01,360
You can't get rid of that devil's gaze.

674
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:09,360
Thank you for helping me today.

675
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,360
Do you have any conscience?

676
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,360
You're so mean.

677
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,360
I wish the universe was in a hurry.

678
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:29,360
That's why I'm so sincere right now.

679
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,360
Yes, writer.

680
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,360
Hey, Bunny.

681
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,360
Are you okay with the call?

682
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,360
Yes.

683
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:37,360
Are you going to the studio tomorrow if you're okay?

684
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,360
Tomorrow?

685
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:43,360
I think it'll be hard tomorrow because of the exhibition.

686
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:47,360
Uh...

687
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,360
Yes, I like it.

688
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:50,360
Then see you tomorrow.

689
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,360
Yes.

690
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:54,360
You're going to do that tomorrow?

691
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,360
Why?

692
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:58,360
Are you going to have a weird humbun?

693
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:03,360
Anyway, thank you so much for today.

694
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,360
Okay.

695
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,360
Oh my god.

696
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,360
I guess it's a punishment.

697
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:40,360
I didn't know what everyone would like, so I bought this and that.

698
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,360
Are you okay?

699
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,360
It's so good.

700
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:45,360
It looks delicious.

701
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:49,360
Anyway, I'm going to see my mom and dad today, so I'm going to have a good time.

702
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:54,360
But I can't match the dress codes today because I'm in a hurry.

703
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:57,360
I'll prepare a silk pajamas next time.

704
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:00,360
You're a silk.

705
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:04,360
Oh, did you do a good job yesterday?

706
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,360
Yes.

707
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:10,360
What's that face?

708
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:16,360
Oh, actually, I was invited to the studio by the writer tomorrow.

709
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,360
Alone?

710
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,360
Yes.

711
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:19,360
I'm a total addict, right?

712
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:22,360
Hey, this is not an addict, it's a complete date.

713
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,360
I'm not sleeping alone right now.

714
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,360
In the private studio.

715
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,360
Date?

716
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:31,360
But isn't it more normal to have a date in a movie theater?

717
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,360
That's why I'm more excited.

718
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,360
You're a little sensitive.

719
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,360
It's a little vague.

720
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,360
Is it really a date?

721
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:41,360
Isn't it just for the singer?

722
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:44,360
What do you think of when you go to a man?

723
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:49,360
Well, it's more important who's with whom rather than where.

724
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:52,360
It could be sensitive when you start work.

725
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:57,360
Yes, sensitive.

726
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,360
You'll know when you go.

727
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:06,360
Whether it's really a date or not.

728
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,360
What is it?

729
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:13,360
I thought it was an audition.

730
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,360
This person is doing this again.

731
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,360
Why?

732
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,360
What is it?

733
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,360
If I post a letter at a cafe, someone will keep calling me.

734
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:39,360
This is no joke.

735
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,360
Fighting, Pan Heejin!

736
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,360
An audition for this song.

737
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,360
Is he here?

738
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,360
Yeah.

739
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,360
Did you get in?

740
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,360
Hold on.

741
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,360
I've been waiting and fell asleep for a long time.

742
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,360
Hmm.

743
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,360
Did you get in?

744
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,360
I'm sorry.

745
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:13,360
I'm sorry.

746
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,360
Okay. See you later.

747
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,360
Hey.

748
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,360
It's better to untie my hair.

749
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,360
Is it better to tie it?

750
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,360
Yes.

751
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:41,360
I think I can go with a more lively look today.

752
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,360
Like that...

753
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,360
Like a bun?

754
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,360
Oh, I can tie it with this.

755
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,360
Oh, that's good.

756
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,360
Oh, you're so good.

757
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,360
Are you done?

758
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,360
Yes.

759
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,360
I'm done.

760
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:11,360
Wow, is this a picture or a picture?

761
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,360
The queen's face is exactly the same.

762
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:16,360
Why are you so clumsy?

763
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:19,360
No, I'm really good at drawing.

764
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:21,360
I'm good at drawing.

765
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,360
Why? It's good.

766
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:25,360
How should I put it?

767
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:28,360
Do you feel the love for pizza?

768
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,360
It's not love.

769
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,360
Hey, how important is this?

770
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:48,360
Hey, look at this.

771
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,360
What is this?

772
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,360
If you don't have love, this is what happens.

773
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,360
What a mess.

774
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,360
Oh, Bani.

775
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:00,360
I was looking at your picture.

776
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:02,360
Oh, yes.

777
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:05,360
But is something important important today?

778
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:09,360
It's a little bit more than usual.

779
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,360
I have to go. I'll see you next time.

780
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,360
Goodbye.

781
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,360
Oh, go.

782
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:22,360
Hey, let's go to the palace.

783
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,360
Hey, are you watching the movie?

784
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:38,360
I'll get the pizza.

785
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,360
Come on.

786
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:44,360
Why do you always drag this?

787
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,360
You're embarrassing me.

788
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,360
Hey.

789
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,360
Hello.

790
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:03,360
You can order from there.

791
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:10,360
I'm not a human being to order from Kiosk.

792
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:16,360
I'm going to make a short-term order, so I'll order it myself.

793
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,360
Yes.

794
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,360
What would you like to order?

795
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:31,360
A warm Americano.

796
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,360
Yes.

797
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,360
This isn't mine.

798
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,360
What is it?

799
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,360
This isn't mine.

800
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,360
I don't know.

801
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,360
Oh, my.

802
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:52,360
Have a nice day.

803
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:55,360
Half-time.

804
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,360
What?

805
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:57,360
Half-time.

806
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:02,360
Send him a good day.

807
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:03,360
Hello.

808
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:06,360
Why aren't you coming out?

809
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:08,360
You keep looking at me.

810
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:11,360
Oh, it's a UI design.

811
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,360
I checked it out.

812
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:16,360
I'm so excited to touch it.

813
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:19,360
I think I should keep it a little more diverse.

814
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,360
What are you saying?

815
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,360
What are you talking about?

816
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:24,360
Yes, let's meet later and talk.

817
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,360
Hello.

818
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:30,360
I have a schedule.

819
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,360
I'll see you tomorrow.

820
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:37,360
What's wrong?

821
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:38,360
Get off.

822
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,360
I'm out of my mind.

823
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:41,360
I'm scared.

824
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,360
I'm out of my mind.

825
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,360
Did he go somewhere?

826
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:06,360
Hey, you're so long.

827
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:09,360
Oh, my.

828
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:12,360
Hey, I guess I didn't find the kids at the snack bar with Hodong.

829
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:14,360
Stay there first. I'll bring them here.

830
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:15,360
Okay.

831
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,360
Why are you here?

832
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,360
Excuse me.

833
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,360
I heard you were going somewhere.

834
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:45,360
Yes, that's here.

835
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,360
You decided to see me here?

836
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,360
Yes.

837
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:52,360
Why?

838
00:54:52,360 --> 00:55:03,360
No.

839
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:05,360
You'll call me if you come. Let's go in.

840
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:06,360
Okay.

841
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:13,360
These papersesian books weird to be puh....

842
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:24,820
In-guk pretends that he's

843
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:33,080
so weird.

844
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,080
What is this?

845
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:37,080
Oh, it just started.

846
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:39,080
I'm still sleeping.

847
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:41,080
Oh, that's interesting.

848
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,080
Do you want to try it?

849
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,080
Can I?

850
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:47,080
Of course.

851
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:51,080
If you want to go back to the past, I think you have to finish the shoot until this day.

852
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,080
Is it a little hard?

853
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,080
Hey, brother.

854
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,080
There's a little bit of fun.

855
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,080
That's not it.

856
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:01,080
Of course.

857
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,080
What are you doing?

858
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,080
What are you doing?

859
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,080
I'm not here.

860
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:19,080
Go and get it.

861
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,080
Bani.

862
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,080
Yes.

863
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:33,080
Bani.

864
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,080
Bani.

865
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:37,080
Bani.

866
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:39,080
Bani.

867
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,080
Bani.

868
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,080
Bani.

869
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,080
Bani.

870
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,080
Bani.

871
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:49,080
What's wrong with you?

872
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,080
Didn't you eat?

873
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:53,080
Do you want me to order something?

874
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,080
Hey, that.

875
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,080
I'll order it.

876
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,080
The dish is being cooked.

877
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:11,080
Is it because the ingredients are good?

878
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,080
It's so soft.

879
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:15,080
It's because you're good at it.

880
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:17,080
Just think about cutting it off.

881
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:29,080
Here too.

882
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:31,080
Here.

883
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:33,080
Here's the boss.

884
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:35,080
Here.

885
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:37,080
Here.

886
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,080
Here.

887
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,080
Here.

888
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:45,080
Here's the boss.

889
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,080
Oh, boss.

890
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:51,080
Here.

891
00:57:55,080 --> 00:58:01,080
I must have mistaken the address.

892
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:03,080
Then, good job.

893
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:05,080
Good job.

894
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,080
It's good.

895
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,080
This house is really good.

896
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,080
Have some sweet and sour pork.

897
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,080
Really?

898
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:29,080
Really?

899
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:31,080
But don't you eat sweet and sour pork?

900
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:33,080
This house is really not normal.

901
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:35,080
You guys eat a lot.

902
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:39,080
There's a park in front of here.

903
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:41,080
Do you want to go for a walk?

904
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:43,080
Yes, I like it.

905
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:55,080
The weather is really good today.

906
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:57,080
The gelato is good too.

907
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,080
I know.

908
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,080
I've never had a good gelato like this before.

909
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:03,080
Really?

910
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:05,080
Yes.

911
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:07,080
It's the first time I've done it after meeting you.

912
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:09,080
Interview.

913
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:27,080
The first interview.

914
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:29,080
The first interview.

915
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:31,080
The first interview.

916
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:33,080
The first interview.

917
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:35,080
The first interview.

918
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:37,080
The first interview.

919
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,080
The first interview.

920
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:41,080
The first interview.

921
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:43,080
The first interview.

922
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,080
The first interview.

923
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:47,080
The first interview.

924
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:49,080
The first interview.

925
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:51,080
The first interview.

926
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:53,080
The first interview.

927
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:55,080
The first interview.

928
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:57,080
I'll take off my mic.

929
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:25,080
I'll take off my microphone.

930
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:29,080
This is good.

931
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:33,080
Too excited.

932
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:39,080
It's not delicious.

933
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:41,080
Wait.

934
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:55,080
I'm sorry.

935
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:01,080
I'm glad to hear that.

936
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:03,080
Thank you.

937
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:29,080
No, let's go home.

938
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:56,080
Let's go home.

939
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:25,080
I'm sorry.

940
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:57,080
What's wrong with him?

941
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:59,080
He must be a bit dizzy.

942
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:01,080
What about you? Are you worried about Ban Hee-jin?

943
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:04,080
Did you fall in love with Ban Hee-jin?

944
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,080
I came to see you.

945
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:09,080
What's our relationship?

946
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:14,080
You can't date Ban Hee-jin and Jo Ha-ra.

947
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:17,080
You and Ban Hee-jin are not close.

948
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:22,080
Hey, Ban Hee-jin, do you want to keep on talking?

949
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:25,080
I'm sorry.
