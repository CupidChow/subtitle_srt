00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:16,060
I few thank you

3
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:28,960
Thanks

태어

9
00:00:51,960 --> 00:01:01,960
Don't go.

10
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:17,960
What is it?

11
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:31,960
Don't go.

12
00:01:52,960 --> 00:02:01,960
Don't you have something to say?

13
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:11,960
That's...

14
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,960
You haven't talked about this before.

15
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:25,960
I missed you so much that I missed you so much.

16
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,960
Did you come back safely?

17
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:38,960
Yes, I came back safely.

18
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:48,960
After you left, I was busy with the opportunity.

19
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:57,960
And then I realized how much you liked me.

20
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:07,960
In the end, I think you made the right choice.

21
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:17,960
If you go back to that time, I think you can send me better.

22
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:39,960
Well, that's already over.

23
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:45,960
Okay, I understand your feelings.

24
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:51,960
It's all over anyway.

25
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,960
Let's just forget about each other and look at each other comfortably.

26
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,960
What?

27
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,960
I'll do that from now on.

28
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,960
Then I'll go.

29
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,960
Han Yeop.

30
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:08,960
I've been waiting for you.

31
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:18,960
Let's put that hand down.

32
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:48,960
I heard you had something to say because you came to the museum like that.

33
00:04:48,960 --> 00:05:04,960
In fact, I was looking forward to seeing you again.

34
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,960
But I guess it wasn't.

35
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,960
I guess it was really over.

36
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,960
We broke up really well.

37
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:28,960
I think it's really over.

38
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,960
Then I don't like it.

39
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:43,960
What do you think about me after that man is over?

40
00:05:43,960 --> 00:06:02,960
The first love I told you was actually you.

41
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:18,960
I don't know why I really did this after we met again.

42
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,960
If I just met you, I would have been in a daze.

43
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,960
I think so.

44
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,960
If you went there and ruined it, you would have said it all.

45
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,960
What are you doing?

46
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,960
What are you doing?

47
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,960
I thought you'd be really comfortable.

48
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,960
I'm here.

49
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,960
Hey, I didn't come.

50
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:47,960
You brought that heat wave and something to get on it.

51
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:05,960
You don't drink.

52
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:15,960
You said you wanted to comfort me.

53
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,960
I didn't mean that.

54
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:42,960
Now I understand your heart.

55
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,960
I'm sorry.

56
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:57,960
I wanted to start over.

57
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:27,960
I think I can send you back better if I go back to that time.

58
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,960
What.

59
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:37,960
That's already over.

60
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:47,960
I'm sorry.

61
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:17,960
I'm sorry.

62
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:47,960
What are you doing here?

63
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:57,960
It's my house, so give it to me.

64
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,960
Then, brother.

65
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:18,960
Hey, aren't you the one who brought me here?

66
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:30,960
Hey, my friend, come here with me.

67
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,960
Hey, leave me alone.

68
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,960
I'll take you with me, too.

69
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,960
Hey, Dong-ah, don't take me.

70
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,960
I'll change it for you.

71
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,960
Dong-ah.

72
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,960
Yeah.

73
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,960
You know me, right?

74
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:49,960
I want to be handsome.

75
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,960
Dong-ah.

76
00:10:51,960 --> 00:11:01,960
When I first saw you, you were standing in front of the table.

77
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,960
I don't know if it's a table or a table.

78
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:15,960
Hey, I don't have any cheap things, but honestly, I thought it was a good thing.

79
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,960
Really.

80
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:24,960
I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing.

81
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,960
Correct.

82
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,960
Good.

83
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,960
Let's go home.

84
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,960
Dong-ah.

85
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,960
Dong-ah.

86
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,960
Wake up, wake up.

87
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,960
Dong-ah.

88
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:42,960
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

89
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,960
I'm so heavy.

90
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,960
When did you two get close?

91
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:54,960
You're drinking and going crazy together.

92
00:11:54,960 --> 00:12:04,960
How did you get here?

93
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:14,960
Hye-joon.

94
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,960
Do you guys play?

95
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:25,960
Of course.

96
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,960
The timing is amazing.

97
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:34,960
As soon as I got to know my ex-boyfriend, I confessed my first love.

98
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:39,960
Then did you drink like that because it was over with you?

99
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,960
Huh?

100
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:50,960
Um, no, I went to take Dong-ah to my brother-in-law's house yesterday.

101
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,960
It doesn't matter what he drank at the end of the day.

102
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,960
I'm not looking at my ex-boyfriend.

103
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,960
You can do well with your first love now.

104
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,960
It's like a dream to be with your first love.

105
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,960
You're both my first love.

106
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,960
I envy you.

107
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:21,960
First love.

108
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:26,960
Huh?

109
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:31,960
Hey, what are you doing? Hurry up and get it. Hurry up.

110
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,960
Hello?

111
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,960
No, Hong Jae-hye.

112
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,960
Why are you drinking so much?

113
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,960
Thank you.

114
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,960
Do you know how hard I was yesterday?

115
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,960
I don't know how long it's been.

116
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,960
I really thought about throwing it away a few times in the middle.

117
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,960
Okay, you can use something delicious.

118
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,960
When?

119
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,960
When the foreign letter is over.

120
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,960
Okay, I remember.

121
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,960
Oh, right.

122
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,960
I should have done it when I only put in the insert, right?

123
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:10,960
Yeah, I should go to the studio and do it now.

124
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,960
What?

125
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,960
Where did you go?

126
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,960
What?

127
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,960
The president's son.

128
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,960
What?

129
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,960
Is there an insert in it?

130
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,960
Yes.

131
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,960
Oh, look for it well.

132
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,960
Why is there so much shit?

133
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:34,960
Are you sure you put it in this room?

134
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:44,960
You can put it down here.

135
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:50,960
Oh, shit.

136
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:57,960
Oh, here you are.

137
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,960
Oh, yes, my friends.

138
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,960
Oh, hello.

139
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,960
See you again.

140
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,960
Hello.

141
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,960
Oh, my God.

142
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,960
We're screwed.

143
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,960
What do you mean?

144
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,960
I lost it in the warehouse.

145
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,960
Oh, I'm done with the ad.

146
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,960
Oh, my God.

147
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,960
It's okay.

148
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,960
It's okay.

149
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,960
I left it in the taxi.

150
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,960
The driver can't contact me.

151
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,960
Oh, if I can't find it, the concept is completely ruined.

152
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,960
Oh, my God.

153
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,960
I'm screwed.

154
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,960
I should go.

155
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,960
I'm sorry.

156
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:39,960
I should go.

157
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,960
I didn't know there was such a place.

158
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:51,960
Do you come here often?

159
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,960
What do you think?

160
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,960
Oh, no.

161
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:08,960
No, I'm thinking about something else.

162
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,960
I'm really sorry, but I think I have to go.

163
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:32,960
I'm sorry for what happened in a hurry.

164
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,960
Please, please.

165
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,960
Oh, my God.

166
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,960
Oh, my God.

167
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:47,960
Hey.

168
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,960
No.

169
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:58,960
Go with me.

170
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,960
I left my bag in the taxi.

171
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,960
I checked it with this machine and it said it was a ghost driver, but I couldn't get a call.

172
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,960
Oh, that bag.

173
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,960
I went to the police station to dance.

174
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:14,960
I couldn't contact you because I was out of my phone when I was dancing.

175
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,960
Where's the driver's bag?

176
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,960
Where did he say?

177
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:30,960
Oh, where's the game?

178
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,960
I think I'm here.

179
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:43,960
Wait a minute.

180
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,960
Hello?

181
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,960
Jae-yeol, it's because of our E-onpik ad.

182
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,960
Yes.

183
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,960
You know that tomorrow is the last day of the O.

184
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,960
Tomorrow is the last day?

185
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,960
Why?

186
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,960
Isn't there anything wrong?

187
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,960
No, it's not that there's nothing wrong.

188
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,960
Me too.

189
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,960
Yes, yes.

190
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,960
Then until tomorrow?

191
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,960
Yes, I can.

192
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,960
Then I'll be in your care, Jae-yeol.

193
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:08,960
Yes.

194
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,960
Are you okay?

195
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,960
Yeah.

196
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:27,960
Let's go over there and ask.

197
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:37,960
Excuse me.

198
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,960
Are you okay?

199
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,960
Oh, my, my, my.

200
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,960
Oh, I'm sorry.

201
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,960
What should I do?

202
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,960
I don't want to clean the water.

203
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,960
It's okay.

204
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,960
Oh, I'm so tired.

205
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,960
No, come in.

206
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,960
Come in.

207
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:16,960
Come on in.

208
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,960
It's cold, isn't it?

209
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
No, you're more tired than me.

210
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,960
You're on your side.

211
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,960
Are you okay?

212
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:33,960
Look.

213
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,960
No, I'm okay.

214
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,960
I was just surprised.

215
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:51,960
Yes.

216
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,960
Teacher, wear this and come here.

217
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:06,960
I'll dry it for you.

218
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,960
Teacher, you look better than me.

219
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,960
Yes.

220
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,960
Oh, my.

221
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,960
I just saw it.

222
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,960
I think I'm in Seoul.

223
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,960
What's going on here?

224
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,960
Oh, right.

225
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,960
Do you know who's the boss?

226
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,960
Oh, the taxi driver?

227
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,960
The old lady's son?

228
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,960
Yes.

229
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,960
Do you know?

230
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,960
Where do you live?

231
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,960
This is the third house here.

232
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,960
I'm sure he's not home today.

233
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,960
Why?

234
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,960
I went out with my grandma this morning.

235
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,960
I told her I was going to the beach.

236
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,960
Where?

237
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:53,960
I don't know.

238
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,960
Oh, my.

239
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,960
You're hungry.

240
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,960
I'm hungry.

241
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:06,960
Do you want some ramen?

242
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:16,960
Then, two bowls.

243
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,960
Wow, the ramen here was a good place.

244
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:30,960
Awesome.

245
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,960
I got it from the old lady.

246
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,960
Give me your hand.

247
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,960
Yes.

248
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,960
It's okay.

249
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:53,960
Give me.

250
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,960
You can't get caught by the water.

251
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,960
Yes.

252
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,960
Thank you.

253
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,960
What are you going to do now?

254
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,960
I couldn't find the foreign card.

255
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,960
There's nothing we can do.

256
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:24,960
I'll go to the airport tomorrow and see the rain.

257
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,960
But why did you come today?

258
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,960
That's because I have work to do.

259
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:41,960
I was worried.

260
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,960
Oh, it didn't mean anything.

261
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,960
It's just that I'm not the one you don't know.

262
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,960
We should help each other out.

263
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,960
Don't you think so?

264
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:02,960
It's okay to be somewhere else.

265
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,960
What?

266
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,960
You know, Pan.

267
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:17,960
I've been weird since I was a kid.

268
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:35,960
I didn't go to school and even the summer school.

269
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:47,960
So what I wanted to say was...

270
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,960
I missed you so much.

271
00:23:52,960 --> 00:24:16,960
It's not.

272
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,960
Oh, my.

273
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,960
It was the green text you wrote.

274
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:28,960
Come out.

275
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,960
I almost fell asleep.

276
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:44,960
Don't laugh.

277
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,960
Thank you.

278
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,960
But are the students going to Seoul now?

279
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,960
Yes.

280
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,960
Then let's go together.

281
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,960
It's free.

282
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,960
Come on.

283
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:09,960
I'm here.

284
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:17,960
Thank you.

285
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,960
Thank you.

286
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,960
Pan.

287
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:31,960
Thank you for today.

288
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,960
Take care.

289
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,960
Goodbye.

290
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:48,960
Okay.

291
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,960
I missed you so much.

292
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:27,960
Pan.

293
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,960
I'm sorry I went out of the blue yesterday.

294
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,960
No.

295
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,960
Did you do well?

296
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,960
Yes.

297
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,960
That's a relief.

298
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,960
The guy you talked about last time...

299
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,960
That ex-boyfriend.

300
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:57,960
You still like him, right?

301
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:04,960
Yes.

302
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,960
I thought he was my first love.

303
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:23,960
But I think my first love is now.

304
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,960
You did too much.

305
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,960
What?

306
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:34,960
Do you have to take your first love and title?

307
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:42,960
I don't know anything else, but that's a little sad.

308
00:27:42,960 --> 00:28:11,960
I'm really sad right now.

309
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,960
But did anything happen to Pan yesterday?

310
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,960
No, it's just a guy.

311
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,960
I'm out of my place.

312
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:31,960
I'm not looking for a real ex-boyfriend.

313
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,960
Did you see everything I said?

314
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,960
When did I do that?

315
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,960
When?

316
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,960
Yes.

317
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,960
It's going up.

318
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,960
Oh, no.

319
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,960
It's going up again.

320
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,960
How far are you going?

321
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,960
No way.

322
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,960
We're dating again.

323
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,960
I didn't mean that.

324
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,960
What?

325
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,960
Then we're not dating again.

326
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,960
Who's been telling you to date these days?

327
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,960
It's obvious when you look at the mood.

328
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,960
No, they're not the first time they've met.

329
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,960
We're going to break up and meet again.

330
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,960
You have to be clear.

331
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,960
If you said you wanted to see him, you would have been reaction.

332
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,960
You didn't hear anything?

333
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,960
Hey, does that make sense?

334
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,960
I missed you so much.

335
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:38,960
No.

336
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,960
Hey, students, it was the green text you read earlier.

337
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,960
Come out quickly.

338
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,960
Oh, my God.

339
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,960
They're not the first time they've met after taking a dump.

340
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,960
We're going to meet again after breaking up.

341
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:17,960
You have to be clear.

342
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,960
You're not home yet?

343
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,960
It's almost time.

344
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,960
Oh, I'm going to move out.

345
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,960
Then can you put this on the way out?

346
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,960
Yes.

347
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,960
Thank you.

348
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:35,960
Why aren't you dating?

349
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,960
It's the yellow moon you interviewed earlier.

350
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:46,960
I don't think I was honest in the interview.

351
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:56,960
I'm still waiting for my girlfriend who left a year ago.

352
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:11,960
I was lacking at that time, so I lost that friend, but I know now.

353
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:21,960
I really like you.

354
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:51,960
I think I've seen you for a while.

355
00:32:51,960 --> 00:33:01,960
You are the forward star.

356
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:11,960
I'm looking for your traces in the light of my heart.

357
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:17,960
I'm searching for your skyline.

358
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:41,960
I'm looking for you.

359
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:51,960
I'm looking for your skyline.

360
00:33:51,960 --> 00:34:01,960
I'm looking for you.

361
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:11,960
Bani, it's me.

362
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,960
Where are you now?

363
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,960
I'm in front of the library.

364
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,960
Library?

365
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,960
I'll be right there.

366
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:25,960
Wait there.

367
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:55,960
I'm sorry.

368
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:05,960
I'm sorry.

369
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:15,960
I'm sorry.

370
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:25,960
I'm sorry.

371
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:35,960
I'm sorry.

372
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:45,960
I'm sorry.

373
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,960
I'm sorry.

374
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,960
I've been waiting for the day you came back.

375
00:35:53,960 --> 00:36:03,960
I'm doing well with my clothes.

376
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:13,960
I'll make it harder.

377
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:23,960
I didn't say it right, but I still like you.

378
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:33,960
I've never liked you for a moment.

379
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:41,960
I like you more, Bani.

380
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:49,960
I missed you so much, too.

381
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:55,960
No, I missed you more.

382
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:21,960
I'm sorry.

383
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:31,960
I'm sorry.

384
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:41,960
I'm sorry.

385
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:51,960
I'm sorry.

386
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:55,960
It's been a long time since I've been going to class holding hands like this.

387
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,960
So don't think about coming here all day long.

388
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,960
I was so surprised when Bo-bae and Dong-ah saw me.

389
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,960
I'm going to be surprised and surprised.

390
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,960
You have to handle that.

391
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,960
It would be so fun if you and Bo-bae had a double date.

392
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:21,960
I really wanted to do a double date.

393
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:31,960
Hello, Bani.

394
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,960
Why are you two like this?

395
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,960
Ask your friend.

396
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,960
Why are you telling me?

397
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,960
Did you two fight?

398
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,960
What?

399
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,960
That hand?

400
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,960
Let's date again.

401
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,960
Really?

402
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,960
It's a total cut.

403
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,960
Don't do that.

404
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,960
Why are you so good at it?

405
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,960
What's the reason?

406
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,960
You're my woman.

407
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,960
I can't go anywhere without my permission.

408
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,960
I can't even take a step.

409
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:20,960
We were not in a relationship from the beginning.

410
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:26,960
Who decided that?

411
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,960
What's the problem with me liking you?

412
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:42,960
You know, I can't do it without you.

413
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,960
Kiss?

414
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,960
What?

415
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,960
You didn't tell me you had a kiss scene.

416
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,960
No, never.

417
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,960
What's wrong with you?

418
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,960
I mean, I've been learning how to date a girlfriend for a few years.

419
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,960
Congratulations can't be done.

420
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,960
Do you do the opposite because of the kiss scene?

421
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,960
Kiss scene?

422
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,960
No matter how much you act, it's nonsense to talk to your boyfriend about the kiss scene in advance.

423
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,960
I have to understand you.

424
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,960
Why are you so considerate?

425
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,960
Haoh is a princess.

426
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,960
A princess?

427
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,960
You said you were a princess to me.

428
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,960
Do you think I'm sensitive?

429
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,960
I'm sensitive to my work, too.

430
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,960
Stop it.

431
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,960
What are you guys doing?

432
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,960
What are you doing?

433
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,960
Are you okay?

434
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,960
Are you okay?

435
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,960
You're so careful.

436
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,960
I told you not to carry anything with such a weak wrist.

437
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,960
Are you going to do that again?

438
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,960
No.

439
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,960
Hand.

440
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,960
Oh, my.

441
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,960
Why are you fighting when you're going to be so angry?

442
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,960
What do you mean?

443
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,960
You're cute.

444
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,960
You two are.

445
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,960
It's not cute, it's amazing.

446
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,960
Why? I'm cute.

447
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,960
If we fight like that, let's get angry right away.

448
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,960
I don't want to.

449
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,960
I'm not going to fight.

450
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,960
Okay.

451
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,960
I'll go in, too.

452
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,960
Just.

453
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,960
What a waste of time.

454
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,960
Father.

455
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,960
No, they're not even kids.

456
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,960
They're adults, but they can do this much.

457
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,960
I don't think so.

458
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,960
Oh, my.

459
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,960
I'm so happy to see you.

460
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,960
I'm so happy to see you.

461
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,960
Oh, my.

462
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,960
I'm so sorry.

463
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,960
I'm so sorry.

464
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,960
Hey, Yeon-ah.

465
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,960
I'm so happy to see you again.

466
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,960
Me, too.

467
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,960
Father.

468
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,960
Mother, too.

469
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,960
I'll get in the car.

470
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,960
Thank you.

471
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,960
Oh, my.

472
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,960
That's what you did, right?

473
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:58,960
It's the first day without us.

474
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,960
I'm not in touch with you yet.

475
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,960
Yes.

476
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,960
Yes.

477
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,960
What's this?

478
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,960
What's this?

479
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,960
Oh, my.

480
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,960
Hey, didn't Bani order this in advance?

481
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,960
Oh, my.

482
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:32,960
Oh, my daughter must be so pretty.

483
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:40,960
I didn't ask Bani later, so I thought you'd be hot.

484
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,960
It's late, but thank you.

485
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:48,960
No, it's not.

486
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,960
You're surprised, right?

487
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:58,960
I haven't forgotten the taste of the car, so I practiced a little bit, but drink it.

488
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,960
Yes.

489
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,960
How is it?

490
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,960
It's similar to the original.

491
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,960
It's more delicious.

492
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,960
Really?

493
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,960
But what's the taste?

494
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,960
You don't have to know yet.

495
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,960
Oh, my.

496
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,960
Oh, my.

497
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,960
Okay.

498
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:46,960
Son, let's clean up and live.

499
00:44:46,960 --> 00:45:14,960
Mom, can I have some time tomorrow?

500
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,960
Thank you.

501
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,960
Enjoy your meal.

502
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,960
What's wrong?

503
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,960
Why are you suddenly asking me to eat all of a sudden?

504
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:30,960
I made an advertisement contract this time.

505
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,960
What's this?

506
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,960
So you're shooting one side for your mom?

507
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,960
Yes.

508
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,960
Oh, my son.

509
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:50,960
When did your son grow up so well and bought you a meal with money?

510
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,960
You're alive.

511
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,960
Eat my food.

512
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,960
I'll eat it deliciously.

513
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:06,960
By the way, you're going to meet Bani again, right?

514
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,960
How did you know?

515
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:18,960
Your face is completely red.

516
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,960
Take it.

517
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,960
No, no, no.

518
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,960
I'll take it later.

519
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,960
You can take it.

520
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:42,960
You're a boyfriend.

521
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:58,960
Well, eat your meal at 3 o'clock next time.

522
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:06,960
I just didn't want you to meet two people.

523
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:16,960
I always felt like I was a legend to you.

524
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:22,960
I think that was a bit of a shame.

525
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:28,960
Is that possible?

526
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,960
Mom just...

527
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:36,960
I was just loyal to my feelings every moment.

528
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,960
I didn't know it would hurt you.

529
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,960
I'm sorry.

530
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:48,960
No, it was my mom.

531
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:54,960
I know now.

532
00:47:54,960 --> 00:48:16,960
I'm being honest about how much I like you.

533
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:24,960
I'm sorry.

534
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,960
You said you're doing great these days.

535
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,960
The students are already here.

536
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,960
I'm jealous.

537
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,960
I should've gone to the CD store because I got a good job.

538
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,960
But Bani went to the preschool, so you're going to prepare for it, right?

539
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,960
No, I'm going to get a job.

540
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:49,960
I knew it when I went there.

541
00:48:49,960 --> 00:49:03,960
I don't know where to start, but I'll think about it slowly.

542
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:04,960
You're here?

543
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:05,960
Yes.

544
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,960
Let's finish this and go out.

545
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:09,960
Slowly.

546
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:24,960
Why?

547
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,960
Do you look cool when you work?

548
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:30,960
Yes.

549
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,960
I'm cool and I'm jealous.

550
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,960
You're jealous?

551
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:45,960
It's embarrassing to hear that from a talented student who went to the preschool.

552
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:50,960
But you're sure you want to do it.

553
00:49:50,960 --> 00:50:00,960
I don't know yet what I want to do.

554
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,960
You can find it now.

555
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,960
You're going to find it for sure.

556
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,960
I know.

557
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,960
What do you believe in?

558
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:10,960
That's it.

559
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,960
Because you're my girlfriend.

560
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:18,960
Enjoy your meal.

561
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,960
Thank you.

562
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,960
Are you ready to go to the US?

563
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,960
Do you want to go to the US in two months?

564
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,960
Oppa, I'll go alone this time.

565
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,960
You're going alone?

566
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,960
Why?

567
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:42,960
You've been taking care of me a lot.

568
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,960
I also went to school and I got to know that I was dating my friends.

569
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:53,960
I'm sure you have friends like this at school, but you've always been by my side when I needed you.

570
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:58,960
I'm sure you've given up on a lot of things.

571
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:03,960
No, I don't have that.

572
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:07,960
I have a lot of friends there and I have my parents, so it's okay.

573
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:16,960
I can do it well without you.

574
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:28,960
Looking at it today, I've been in an accident for 10 years already.

575
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:40,960
Thank you for playing with me for 10 years.

576
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,960
Did you get in well?

577
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,960
Yeah, I got there a little while ago.

578
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,960
I should have brought you home.

579
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,960
No, you're busy.

580
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:55,960
But you're going on a date with me on the weekend?

581
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:59,960
Of course. I'll definitely finish it before the weekend. Don't worry.

582
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:03,960
Okay, I'll work on it and call you before I go to bed.

583
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,960
Okay.

584
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,960
Wow, you drew so well.

585
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:23,960
I was in the set for a while, but I almost got in trouble.

586
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:24,960
Thank you.

587
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,960
No, it's a relief that it helped.

588
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,960
But did you call me a assistant?

589
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:30,960
Yes.

590
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:35,960
Next time, if you have any thoughts, please contact me.

591
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:38,960
Yes, thank you.

592
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:51,960
It's been a while since we've had a date, so I like it so much.

593
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,960
That's right. This is a date for a long time.

594
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,960
I wrote everything I wanted to do with you.

595
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:58,960
Is that a lot?

596
00:52:58,960 --> 00:52:59,960
Yes.

597
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:07,960
The first one is this.

598
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:08,960
Coupling?

599
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,960
Yeah, I wanted to do this hook.

600
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,960
Why?

601
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,960
Isn't it sudden?

602
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:23,960
Let's do the ring next time.

603
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:24,960
Okay?

604
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,960
Yeah.

605
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,960
Let's go.

606
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:35,960
Ugh, I'm not even cleaning up.

607
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:39,960
Why?

608
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:45,960
Did I call you?

609
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,960
I guess I'm right.

610
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:53,960
I'm here.

611
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:56,960
Who's there?

612
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:01,960
No, don't come over here.

613
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:05,960
Don't come over here.

614
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:11,960
Don't come over here.

615
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:15,960
Don't come over here.

616
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:18,960
It's not that.

617
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,960
Mom.

618
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,960
Dad?

619
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:29,960
Mom?

620
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:33,960
What's wrong with you while you're parking?

621
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,960
I'm really sorry.

622
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:37,960
You must have been so surprised.

623
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:38,960
No, no.

624
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,960
I'm sorry.

625
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:47,960
There were a lot of misunderstandings and apologies at the beginning.

626
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,960
No, no, no.

627
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:53,960
We came so suddenly because we were so embarrassed.

628
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:57,960
I came to bring some side dishes, but I didn't have any at home.

629
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,960
I told you the password.

630
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,960
Oh, I see.

631
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:02,960
Oh, my.

632
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,960
You're taking care of all that stuff.

633
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:12,960
I guess it's all because of your parents that Bani grew up as a warm and warm child.

634
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,960
Oh, what a nice word.

635
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:18,960
He's so nice and polite.

636
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,960
He raised his son very well.

637
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,960
No, I didn't raise him well.

638
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:29,960
He grew up well because he was young.

639
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:33,960
Was our daughter eight years old?

640
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:40,960
He's smaller than his friends, so I was worried.

641
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:44,960
But he saw me and said,

642
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:50,960
I'll grow up quickly and protect my mom.

643
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:57,960
I'm doing this to not worry about anything.

644
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,960
Oh, that's so nice.

645
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,960
I'm so relieved.

646
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:06,960
Oh, my.

647
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:07,960
Oh, my.

648
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:08,960
Oh, my.

649
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,960
I'm the host.

650
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,960
Oh, my.

651
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,960
No, I'm not the host.

652
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:15,960
What?

653
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,960
Why are you crying?

654
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:21,960
I thought about it when we were growing up.

655
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,960
Our Bani.

656
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:29,960
I told her that if she was a father, she would take all the people who were bullied.

657
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:30,960
Oh, my.

658
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,960
This is how he is.

659
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,960
He's so famous.

660
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,960
Oh, my.

661
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:37,960
Oh, my.

662
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,960
I'm so happy.

663
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:40,960
Oh, my.

664
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:41,960
Oh, my.

665
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:42,960
Oh, my.

666
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:43,960
Oh, my.

667
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:44,960
Oh, my.

668
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:45,960
Oh, my.

669
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:46,960
Oh, my.

670
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,960
I'm so happy.

671
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,960
What are you doing?

672
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,960
I'm talking to Yeoreu.

673
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:11,960
I'm watching a movie with Dong-ah.

674
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,960
Kkotnim.

675
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:22,960
Oh.

676
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:28,960
At first, the boys said they liked it because they were all funny and funny.

677
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:33,960
After the meeting, they all got out of the group and left.

678
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:39,960
I'm the only one left.

679
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:43,960
What's my problem?

680
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:48,960
Why do you have a problem?

681
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,960
Kkotnim is so bright and nice to you.

682
00:57:51,960 --> 00:58:00,960
If it's a problem, it's probably the problem that no one knows you.

683
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:14,960
There must be someone who will know you well.

684
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,960
Have a good time.

685
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,960
Why can't you eat?

686
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,960
I'm done with the star.

687
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:21,960
Have a good time.

688
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:22,960
I'll see you soon.

689
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:23,960
Have a good day.

690
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:24,960
Bye.

691
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:34,960
Oh, my dad can't stop me.

692
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,960
My mom.

693
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:40,960
Banyang.

694
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,960
I'm sorry.

695
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:47,960
I was very upset.

696
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:52,960
Just look at me once.

697
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:53,960
Okay.

698
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:57,960
No, I think I'm still upset.

699
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,960
No, I'm not.

700
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:04,960
I think I'm right.

701
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:05,960
Yeah, right.

702
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:06,960
I was a little upset.

703
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,960
Are you done?

704
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:17,960
Really.

705
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,960
Hand.

706
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,960
No.

707
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:22,960
Give it to me.

708
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:23,960
No.

709
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:34,960
Give it to me.

710
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:41,960
What?

711
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:58,960
What?

712
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:04,960
I wanted to give you a present when I get my first contract.

713
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:09,960
Then, because of this...

714
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:10,960
Yeah.

715
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,960
It's so pretty.

716
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:17,960
Then, I'll put it on.

717
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:38,960
I don't think there's a perfect relationship in the world,

718
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:55,960
but I think I can do it as much as a relationship without regrets.

719
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:56,960
Yeah, Banyang.

720
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:57,960
Yeah, Banyang.

721
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:58,960
What?

722
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,960
Hey, you woke up so early.

723
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,960
I was going to give you a present.

724
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,960
You're already up.

725
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:07,960
I'm going to meet you earlier than I thought.

726
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:10,960
Okay, see you later.

727
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:11,960
Call me when you're done.

728
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:12,960
I'll take you there.

729
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,960
Okay, see you later.

730
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:24,960
Okay.

731
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:25,960
Oh, yes, art director.

732
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:26,960
Are you going to the cafe?

733
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,960
Oh, yes, I'm going to go now.

734
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,960
Okay, see you later.

735
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:44,960
Okay, see you at the cafe.

736
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,960
Before you love someone,

737
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:53,960
you have to love yourself first.

738
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:58,960
Bona.

739
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:04,960
Congratulations on your debut.

740
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:05,960
Thank you.

741
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:10,960
If you can show me your talent without hiding your lacking self.

742
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,960
There will be a big event today on the top floor of the Chaon Foundation.

743
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:17,960
It's going to be noisy, so please tell me the heat and heat fairy to use as much as possible.

744
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:18,960
Yes, sir.

745
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,960
Don't worry about it.

746
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:25,960
But Chaon Foundation is different from the third generation.

747
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:27,960
You're going to be an intern like this.

748
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:31,960
I'm also an intern.

749
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:32,960
Oh, my.

750
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,960
You're so good at this.

751
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:35,960
Oh, my.

752
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:39,960
You're so good at physical strength.

753
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:40,960
Oh, my.

754
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,960
That's why I'm saying this.

755
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:46,960
Can you come out with us for a meeting?

756
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:47,960
Once.

757
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:48,960
Meeting?

758
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:50,960
Sir, there's nothing difficult.

759
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:55,960
If you just sit still, we'll take care of you from the beginning to the end.

760
01:02:55,960 --> 01:03:06,960
No.

761
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:11,960
You're precious to me.

762
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,960
Thank you.

763
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:18,960
Have a sweet bite.

764
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:45,960
If you know my feelings and be honest with me.

765
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:55,960
Bani.

766
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:05,960
I'll show you the light of love that you'll recognize.

767
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:24,960
Wow, it's a little bit of a flower bloom in the middle.

768
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:25,960
That's right.

769
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:30,960
It was a wish to make a relationship with the person you love.

770
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:33,960
Then I made a wish.

771
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:36,960
No, I did this.

772
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:42,960
I came to you.

773
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:54,960
That's how we love each other without regrets.

774
01:05:42,960 --> 01:06:07,960
Thank you.
