1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,100
D.C.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,720
聽.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:16,080
D.C.

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,680
2nd shoot

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,160
at the entrance 3rdality

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,620
Was it still pois disgusting?

7
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:30,620
Yes.

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,620
I'm not a pasta lover, am I?

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,760
Then,

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,360
should we go eat with me?

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,380
No, we're on our way.

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,680
Thank you for taking me home.

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,680
See you tomorrow.

14
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,380
Goodbye.

15
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,620
Ha.

16
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,460
Even now, what's going on?

17
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,380
But...

18
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,960
what is going on right now?

19
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,600
He purposely started this.

20
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:06,460
No, it's not like that.

21
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:12,460
I don't want to say anything right now.

22
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:22,460
I'm sorry.

23
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:30,460
Did you come?

24
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,460
Didn't you say you had a dinner appointment?

25
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,460
Wait a minute.

26
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,460
You said you were going to eat pasta, so we're all going to eat pasta.

27
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,460
Let's go eat together.

28
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:49,460
Oh, right.

29
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:19,460
I'm sorry.

30
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:27,460
You have to do that.

31
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:37,460
I'm sorry.

32
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:25,460
I'll tell you one more time.

33
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:45,460
I'll talk to you.

34
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:51,460
How can I accept it yesterday?

35
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,460
What?

36
00:06:52,460 --> 00:07:01,460
You kissed me without saying anything, but how can I accept it?

37
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,460
No, yesterday I...

38
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:14,460
Then are we dating now?

39
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,460
That's right.

40
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,460
Our used one.

41
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,460
What's that?

42
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,460
What's that?

43
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:26,460
But I thought you'd be different.

44
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:36,460
It's the same as before.

45
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:06,460
I'm sorry.

46
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:36,460
I'm sorry.

47
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:46,460
I'm sorry.

48
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:56,460
You're here early.

49
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:02,460
Yeah.

50
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,460
Wasn't there a meeting today?

51
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:14,460
Yes, I'm just going to leave my bag.

52
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,460
Why?

53
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,460
Oh, that...

54
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,460
I left this yesterday.

55
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,460
I thought you lost it.

56
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:34,460
Thank you.

57
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,460
I couldn't eat pasta yesterday.

58
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:45,460
I couldn't come because I had something urgent.

59
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,460
Then call me.

60
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:52,460
I'm sure you went right away.

61
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,460
I guess so.

62
00:09:54,460 --> 00:10:00,460
Then you can eat with me next time.

63
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,460
I have to go.

64
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:10,460
I'll be right back.

65
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:25,460
If you don't have any ideas, I'll organize each role like this.

66
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:29,460
Oh, and we have a festival exhibition.

67
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,460
I think we're going to have a festival today.

68
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:43,460
Do you want to wear a mask?

69
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,460
Do you want to do it?

70
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,460
Okay.

71
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,460
I'm going to do it.

72
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:56,460
I'm going to do it.

73
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:06,460
I'm going to do it.

74
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:10,460
Thank you.

75
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,460
The CD is different.

76
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,460
You're so smart.

77
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,460
I know what you're saying.

78
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:27,460
I'm not here right now.

79
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,460
No.

80
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,460
Hey, what's going on?

81
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,460
I think you're busy. I came to cheer you on.

82
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,460
Everyone, please have some coffee here.

83
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,460
You're here.

84
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,460
I'm glad you're doing well. Thank you.

85
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:47,460
I'll drink well.

86
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,460
Are you still here?

87
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,460
Yes, a little.

88
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,460
I just started.

89
00:11:55,460 --> 00:12:00,460
Then do you want me to help you?

90
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,460
Come to the entertainment festival.

91
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,460
I'm sorry.

92
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,460
See you again.

93
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,460
Come to the entertainment festival.

94
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,460
Yes, I'll be there.

95
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,460
See you again.

96
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,460
Come to the entertainment festival.

97
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:21,460
I'll bring you the electronic button.

98
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:31,460
Yes.

99
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:36,460
Hwang Jae-woo.

100
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:43,460
Tell me after this.

101
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,460
You said that.

102
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,460
I'm serious.

103
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,460
What?

104
00:12:51,460 --> 00:13:05,460
Are you serious about Hwang Jae-woo?

105
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:15,460
You're right.

106
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,460
Bani, I...

107
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:45,460
Then are we dating now?

108
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,460
That's right.

109
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:58,460
Our used one.

110
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:08,460
Bani, should we stop organizing?

111
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,460
Oh, yes.

112
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:18,460
Let's go have a cup of coffee.

113
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,460
Cheers.

114
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,460
Thank you.

115
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,460
You're really done with your part-time job here.

116
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,460
Then how many times do you have to do the big part-time job?

117
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,460
Tomorrow is the day of the treasure hunt.

118
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,460
Yes.

119
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:36,460
Then do you want to do the treasure hunt after the free-hack?

120
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,460
Can I?

121
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,460
What about your sister?

122
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,460
It's okay.

123
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,460
Hye-won went to see her today.

124
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,460
She'll be here in a few days.

125
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,460
Of course, I'll go.

126
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,460
Then I'll go.

127
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,460
Well, then...

128
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,460
Call?

129
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:54,460
Then I'll do the preparation, so just put it on your body.

130
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,460
Wow, is this the result of the treasure hunt?

131
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,460
How do you do it?

132
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,460
Can we wear a dress?

133
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:11,460
Silk, silk.

134
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:17,460
Rome.

135
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,460
How did you...

136
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:33,460
How did you not leave any poison for me?

137
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:39,460
There's a knife here.

138
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:43,460
Now we're meeting again.

139
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:15,460
It was really nice to be a real woman who saw Juliet in the original work.

140
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:19,460
Especially the face of Juliet who was caught in the prison.

141
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,460
Okay, that's it.

142
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,460
You did a good job.

143
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,460
It's good that you have a good boyfriend.

144
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,460
You're all relaxed.

145
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,460
You did a great job.

146
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,460
Let's go.

147
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,460
Let's go.

148
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,460
Come to the festival for the Arts Festival.

149
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,460
Come to the Festival for the Arts Festival.

150
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:51,460
Hello.

151
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,460
I'm here to see you.

152
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,460
I'm here to see you.

153
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,460
Come to the festival for the Arts Festival.

154
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:03,460
Hello.

155
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,460
Oh, you're promoting the festival.

156
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,460
But why are you alone?

157
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:13,460
Oh, that's just...

158
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,460
Do you want me to help you?

159
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,460
I think we'll do it together.

160
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:20,460
I think the 500th performance will be over.

161
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,460
Shouldn't we go?

162
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:29,460
We have to take a group photo, so let's take a moment.

163
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,460
Or should we go first like you and me?

164
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,460
Hey, what are you talking about?

165
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,460
Why? You're a student.

166
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,460
It's better to help you than us.

167
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,460
Oh, it's okay.

168
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,460
How can you do this alone?

169
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,460
You're so good.

170
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,460
I'll let you two talk.

171
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:57,460
It's okay.

172
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:07,460
I'm sorry.

173
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,460
What's wrong with you?

174
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,460
Open it.

175
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:27,460
Oh, my God.

176
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:33,460
Hey.

177
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,460
Cheers.

178
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:40,460
Cheers.

179
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,460
Thank you.

180
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:45,460
I'm so grateful for all the great memories on your back.

181
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,460
I'm so grateful for coming.

182
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,460
Actually, it's my first time inviting someone to my house.

183
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,460
Please invite me anytime in the future.

184
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,460
I'll be right back.

185
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,460
You again?

186
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,460
Hurry up and eat.

187
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,460
I'll talk when I'm not full.

188
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,460
No way.

189
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,460
I think I'll be full even if I eat just one bite.

190
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,460
Then I'll eat well.

191
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,460
I'll eat well.

192
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:12,460
I'll eat well.

193
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:22,460
I'll eat this too.

194
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,460
Hey, this is a secret of D-Prem.

195
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,460
Didn't you call me to eat half?

196
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:30,460
Of course, what do you want?

197
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,460
You're a boyfriend.

198
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,460
You're not a boy, you're a boyfriend.

199
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:41,460
Hey, I didn't know that and bought flowers.

200
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:51,460
Hey, have you ever made a mistake without even confessing?

201
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:56,460
I have.

202
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:05,460
I want to confess and cry at least.

203
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,460
What?

204
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:14,460
Do you know what kind of expression I have when a person confesses to this person?

205
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,460
I know.

206
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:22,460
And I've been lying down for a few days.

207
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:28,460
So I can't talk and I can't even look at it.

208
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,460
But how can you apologize?

209
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:35,460
No, do you have the right to apologize?

210
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,460
I don't have anything to say because I'm 100 years old.

211
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:43,460
What are you talking about?

212
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:48,460
I saw it wrong.

213
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,460
It's easy to get close to you.

214
00:20:51,460 --> 00:21:00,460
It's selfish and always ruined.

215
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:04,460
Hey, that's not enough.

216
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:14,460
Really, stop eating.

217
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:18,460
What's wrong with you?

218
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,460
I'm so full.

219
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,460
Me too.

220
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:27,460
Wait, did you have a relationship with Yeori?

221
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,460
Huh?

222
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,460
Why?

223
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:35,460
I met you two a while ago and you two were in a bad mood.

224
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:40,460
Oh, just...

225
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,460
It's over.

226
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:49,460
I don't think it's all organized yet.

227
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:53,460
It won't work.

228
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,460
Hwang Jae-yeol.

229
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:01,460
I was much more sorry in the first place.

230
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,460
I agree.

231
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,460
We're okay with the person who said he was pushing his ex-girlfriend.

232
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:09,460
There's not just one guy in the world.

233
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,460
It's over.

234
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,460
It's over.

235
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:24,460
One.

236
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,460
What?

237
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,460
It's all delicious.

238
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,460
Hey, stop eating.

239
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,460
I'm not cold.

240
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,460
I'm not cold.

241
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:39,460
Don't go to sleep.

242
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:44,460
Hey,

243
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:56,460
You know what I'm most worried about?

244
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,460
I...

245
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:04,460
I got hurt.

246
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:08,460
Because of me.

247
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:17,460
I got hurt because of you.

248
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:29,460
That's what I'm most worried about.

249
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:33,460
What are you doing?

250
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:39,460
What are you doing?

251
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,460
What are you doing?

252
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,460
What are you doing?

253
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,460
What are you doing?

254
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:47,460
I knew it.

255
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:54,460
You two would fall asleep like that all night.

256
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,460
Aren't you tired?

257
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,460
Yes, I'm really fine.

258
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:05,460
I'm full of energy.

259
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,460
Wait a minute.

260
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:17,460
Thank you.

261
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,460
It's done.

262
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:27,460
Hey, isn't it a real foul if you don't do this to yourself with that face?

263
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,460
What?

264
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,460
No, I won't think that way.

265
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:36,460
Other women are mistaken.

266
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:40,460
Why are you not?

267
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,460
What?

268
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:54,460
And I'm not like that to any woman.

269
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,460
Wow, you're killing me.

270
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,460
You're not?

271
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,460
Yes.

272
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:12,460
I don't know if it's because I saw it on the tag team.

273
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:18,460
It's really pretty.

274
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:23,460
I know.

275
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:33,460
It's pretty.

276
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:43,460
I'm so tired.

277
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:13,460
I'm always on your side.

278
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,460
Cheer up, friend.

279
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:26,460
I'm still cute.

280
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:31,460
That's right.

281
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:36,460
Our used one.

282
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,460
What's that?

283
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:40,460
But I thought you'd be different.

284
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:50,460
It's the same.

285
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,460
But aren't we getting too much?

286
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:09,460
It's a book highlight, so we should do this much.

287
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:12,460
Hayoung, people are amazing when they see it in person.

288
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:15,460
I think I'd hate it if I got an air confession.

289
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,460
Why? Aren't you touched?

290
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:21,460
You like it as much as you want to talk in the neighborhood.

291
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,460
So why are you talking?

292
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,460
I should have told you secretly.

293
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:49,460
Hey.

294
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:59,460
When are you coming?

295
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,460
I'm going now.

296
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,460
You know it's late.

297
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,460
Okay.

298
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,460
See you later.

299
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:13,460
Okay.

300
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:23,460
Hey.

301
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,460
Oh, my.

302
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,460
You're crazy.

303
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,460
My husband and I are crazy.

304
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,460
I don't have anything to do with my old fox.

305
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,460
I'm going to sleep with my husband.

306
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,460
What do you think?

307
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,460
Let go of me.

308
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,460
What do you think?

309
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,460
Let go of me.

310
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,460
Are you crazy?

311
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,460
Who's going to be the one who's going to be the one who's going to be the one who's crazy?

312
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:47,460
Why are you lying to me about your husband being nice first?

313
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,460
Yes.

314
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:51,460
You should come out so bluntly.

315
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,460
I'm going to get that much ironing iron.

316
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,460
Don't you get angry?

317
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,460
No?

318
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,460
You can't live in school!

319
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,560
Are you stupid?

320
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:06,320
Incept for being a third grade student, did you do a good job?

321
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:10,300
A person lying capable of doing better actually made it.

322
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:14,040
Oh, no, no, don't say like that.

323
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,060
What is bad Queensland?

324
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,300
I'm sorry.

325
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,460
What are you doing now?

326
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,460
Why are you apologizing?

327
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,460
Why are you apologizing?

328
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:42,460
Stop following me.

329
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:45,460
Are you a person?

330
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,460
What?

331
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:53,460
I'm going to ask you a question.

332
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,460
What are you doing?

333
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,460
Are you crazy?

334
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,460
What is this?

335
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:03,460
What are you talking about?

336
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,460
Why are you apologizing to him?

337
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,460
Get your hands off me.

338
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:11,460
I don't know what the problem is.

339
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,460
What did I do wrong?

340
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:16,460
It's me who's the most unfair here.

341
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:20,460
I'm going to tell the parents and catch the child's head.

342
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:24,460
But why are you apologizing here?

343
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:29,460
That's why you're really apologizing.

344
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:42,460
Mom, don't you feel ashamed?

345
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:45,460
Don't you have any shame?

346
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:48,460
I'm really embarrassed because of my mom.

347
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,460
I'm going crazy.

348
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:56,460
You're embarrassed?

349
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:00,460
You really don't know me?

350
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:07,460
I've never heard such a thing from you.

351
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:12,460
I'm the one who's stupid because of the first humans.

352
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,460
Is this the wrong person you trust?

353
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:18,460
Is this the wrong person you trust?

354
00:32:44,460 --> 00:33:00,460
Thank you.

355
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:04,460
I'm busy today, but you didn't bring it to us, did you?

356
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,460
No, and no matter how busy I am, I have to come.

357
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:12,460
Who's this?

358
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:18,460
I had dinner and I'm going to start now.

359
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:23,460
Why are you so excited and answering?

360
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,460
I'm just curious about the night shift.

361
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:31,460
I'm not curious, I'm sure you want to see me.

362
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:35,460
Shall we go out and drink after the treatment?

363
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,460
Look at him talking.

364
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,460
He's not even going to stop.

365
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,460
What's up, Cha Jiwon?

366
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:45,460
Did you really start with your first love?

367
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:48,460
What?

368
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,460
You're the one who's drunk.

369
00:33:50,460 --> 00:34:06,460
Did you forget anything?

370
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,460
Is this the wrong person you trust?

371
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:35,460
Isn't it the wrong person you have a heart to mess with?

372
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,460
It's not that.

373
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:45,460
Don't do this.

374
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:55,460
I'm sorry.

375
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:23,460
Don't touch me.

376
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:33,460
Thank you.

377
00:35:54,460 --> 00:36:03,460
Do you want to go to the 63 building with me?

378
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:13,460
Now?

379
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:18,460
Why is this the 63 building?

380
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:28,460
The stairs that come up to here are 63.

381
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:36,460
It's a place where you can dry your clothes or clothes.

382
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,460
Sometimes it feels good to come up like this.

383
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:43,460
It's refreshing.

384
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:50,460
That's right.

385
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:58,460
You were a lot surprised earlier, right?

386
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:07,460
I think you were more surprised than I was.

387
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:13,460
Honestly, it's not even twice that I've been like this for a long time.

388
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:16,460
But I'm not used to it.

389
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:26,460
I'm sure it's changed now. I'm disappointed again.

390
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:34,460
But I don't think I have the right to say that.

391
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:57,460
I think you felt that way too.

392
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:01,460
I'm sorry.

393
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:07,460
I was too disappointed.

394
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:16,460
I moved to you selfishly because I didn't like it.

395
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:22,460
But that's not what you think.

396
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:31,460
I really didn't know you were going to use it.

397
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:50,460
I know I did something wrong, but I just wanted to catch you at that moment.

398
00:38:50,460 --> 00:39:02,460
But I think you can feel it enough in your mouth.

399
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:12,460
I'm really sorry.

400
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:26,460
Oh, is there someone here?

401
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:30,460
Oh, this is the opposite.

402
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,460
I have to close the door.

403
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,460
Go down quickly.

404
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:36,460
Yes, I'm sorry. I'll go down now.

405
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:38,460
Hurry up and go down.

406
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:45,460
Yes.

407
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,460
Shall we stop going down?

408
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:58,460
Yes.

409
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:08,460
What should I do?

410
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:12,460
I can't see this.

411
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,460
I'm so surprised.

412
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:17,460
Whose idea is this?

413
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,460
My idea.

414
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,460
Hello, hello.

415
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,460
Oh, you're here.

416
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,460
Yes.

417
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,460
Your mom did an interview?

418
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:27,460
Yes, I know.

419
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:30,460
Isn't it amazing?

420
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:36,460
But this interview came out too short.

421
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:39,460
You're here again.

422
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,460
What?

423
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,460
Who is it?

424
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:45,460
Your mom's ex-boyfriend.

425
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,460
What?

426
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,460
It was very famous.

427
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:51,460
World's Sports Star Couple.

428
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:54,460
When are you going to say that?

429
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:57,460
Your mom is a mother, too.

430
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:02,460
She was not a child, but a celebrity.

431
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:07,460
I told you that I wouldn't be able to beat her.

432
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:12,460
But I never gave up.

433
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,460
Why?

434
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:16,460
Isn't love only for brave people?

435
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:19,460
I thought I could have you like this.

436
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,460
You're my girl.

437
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:24,460
You're my girl.

438
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:27,460
Look, you won all the games.

439
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:30,460
Always be brave.

440
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,460
I'm telling you the truth.

441
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:41,460
Come here.

442
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:55,460
When did Yeon-hee come?

443
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:59,460
You went through that yesterday.

444
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,460
It's a bit hard to come out right away.

445
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:04,460
I was a little bit like that.

446
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,460
How are you?

447
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:09,460
It's okay.

448
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:14,460
I heard that you were sick today.

449
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:17,460
How do you get sick?

450
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:21,460
I'm just a cold.

451
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:25,460
I can't eat or sleep.

452
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:30,460
I guess I'm just talking to myself.

453
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,460
That's why I'm saying this.

454
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:35,460
Are you busy today?

455
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,460
Then I'll ask you to do this.

456
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,460
Just tell me this.

457
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:44,460
I think this is okay.

458
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:54,460
Oh, I guess that's it.

459
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:24,460
What's going on here?

460
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:30,460
Yeon-hee...

461
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:32,460
Yeon-hee is sleeping.

462
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:41,460
Can you wake her up?

463
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:45,460
No.

464
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:46,460
Then...

465
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:56,460
Can you tell me this instead?

466
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:57,460
And...

467
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:04,460
Please tell me that you're half here.

468
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:42,460
What's wrong?

469
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:44,460
How did you get in?

470
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:51,460
I didn't change my password.

471
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,460
Don't get me wrong.

472
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:58,460
I called you, but I heard the phone ringing. You didn't answer.

473
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:07,460
That's why I came here worried.

474
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:20,460
My friend gave it to me.

475
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:22,460
I'm not going.

476
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:25,460
You're sick.

477
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:28,460
I was feverish.

478
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,460
I told you.

479
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:35,460
I don't have any more trouble with you.

480
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:37,460
I'm begging you.

481
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:40,460
Just go quietly.

482
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:46,460
It's hard to see you.

483
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:49,460
How long are you going to do that?

484
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:53,460
It wasn't just you. I was tired too.

485
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:58,460
There was something called love at that time.

486
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:04,460
So?

487
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:05,460
What?

488
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:09,460
Don't say that you couldn't help it.

489
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:30,460
In the end, it's all your choice.

490
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:34,460
I bought you a meal.

491
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:39,460
Eat your meal and take your medicine.

492
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:10,460
I'm so sorry.

493
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:22,460
I'm sorry.

494
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:24,460
Hello.

495
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:26,460
Oh.

496
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:29,460
I'm home.

497
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:34,460
Have some delicious and sweet fruits.

498
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:36,460
Enjoy your meal.

499
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:37,460
Dad.

500
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:39,460
Huh?

501
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:42,460
Did you really not care about dad?

502
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:48,460
He was a great guy.

503
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:52,460
I'm worried.

504
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:53,460
I did.

505
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:56,460
How can I not care about him?

506
00:47:56,460 --> 00:48:01,460
I think he was the one who suited your mom more.

507
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:08,460
How could you think that way?

508
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:11,460
What should I say?

509
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:15,460
I thought your mom wouldn't be able to do it.

510
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,460
I'm already happy. What should I do?

511
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:25,460
If you're in the heart of the king, shouldn't I go to the end?

512
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:35,460
Dad.

513
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:38,460
It's delicious.

514
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:40,460
Dad.

515
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:41,460
I'll eat well.

516
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:50,460
Okay.

517
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,460
I'll be back. If anything happens, call me.

518
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:54,460
What?

519
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:58,460
I had a exhibition I wanted to go to, but it was until today. Let's go together if you don't want to.

520
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:03,460
Oh, what should I do?

521
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:07,460
I don't think I can do it today.

522
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:11,460
Did you reject him for the first time?

523
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:12,460
I'm sorry.

524
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:16,460
I decided to go to the school festival today.

525
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:19,460
I'll be back next time.

526
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:24,460
I'm sorry.

527
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:28,460
School festival?

528
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:32,460
Did you get it from Bani?

529
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,460
What did you just say?

530
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:36,460
Did you get the tablet well yesterday?

531
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:37,460
Before that.

532
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:40,460
Who are you asking for it?

533
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:42,460
Bani.

534
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:46,460
Did you two not meet?

535
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:51,460
My friend gave it to me.

536
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:53,460
Hey, hey, hey.

537
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:54,460
Hey, hey, hey.

538
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:55,460
Where are you going?

539
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:57,460
I'm rehearsing right now.

540
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:01,460
You have to hold the camera.

541
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:11,460
There are so many people at the festival.

542
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:12,460
Of course.

543
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:16,460
There are usually the most popular festivals.

544
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:19,460
But what's that?

545
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:20,460
Do you know this?

546
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:22,460
I've done it every time.

547
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:27,460
If you write a confession on it, read it one by one.

548
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:31,460
In other words, it's an air confession.

549
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:33,460
What do you do?

550
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:34,460
Do you want to write one too?

551
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:37,460
I really worked hard on that.

552
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:42,460
Oh, I guess they're here.

553
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:43,460
We're going to the festival.

554
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:44,460
Okay.

555
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:22,460
Bani, here, here, here.

556
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:48,460
Bani, here, here, here.

557
00:51:48,460 --> 00:52:16,460
Hello, everyone.

558
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:21,460
I'm the announcer Han Yeoreum, who is in charge of the performance of the artist's night.

559
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:29,460
Nice to meet you.

560
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:34,460
Wow, I feel very new to be back at the graduation school.

561
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:41,460
It's an honor to be the MC of the MBC festival, and I'm a little nervous.

562
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:45,460
Are you going to understand me even if I make a mistake?

563
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:47,460
Yes.

564
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:53,460
Then let's start the night of the artist's night.

565
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:21,460
I love you.

566
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:31,460
I love you.

567
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:33,460
How is it?

568
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,460
It's good.

569
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,460
It's so good.

570
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:53,460
I can't get a microphone.

571
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,460
Do it again.

572
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:03,460
I can't get a microphone.

573
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:33,460
Is it okay?

574
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:35,460
Of course it's okay.

575
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:37,460
There's nothing wrong with it.

576
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:41,460
Thank you.

577
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:03,460
I'm so free.

578
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:05,460
I won't regret it.

579
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:07,460
I'll show you clearly and remember it.

580
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:09,460
I'll show you clearly and remember it.

581
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:11,460
I'll say give it up.

582
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:13,460
Pop-pop.

583
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:15,460
It's time to stand down.

584
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:17,460
I'll say give it up.

585
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:19,460
Pop-pop.

586
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:21,460
It's like crazy.

587
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:23,460
It's like crazy.

588
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:25,460
Pop-pop.

589
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:27,460
It's like crazy.

590
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:29,460
Pop-pop.

591
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:31,460
It's like crazy.

592
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:33,460
Pop-pop.

593
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:35,460
It's time to stand down.

594
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:37,460
Pop-pop.

595
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:39,460
It's time to scream out.

596
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:41,460
Pop-pop.

597
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:43,460
Pop-pop.

598
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:45,460
Pop-pop.

599
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:47,460
Pop-pop.

600
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,460
Pop-pop.

601
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:51,460
Pop-pop.

602
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:53,460
Pop-pop.

603
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:55,460
Pop-pop.

604
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:57,460
Pop-pop.

605
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:59,460
Pop-pop.

606
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:03,460
Two, three.

607
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:13,460
Okay.

608
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:17,460
This is an event you can't miss anymore.

609
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:19,460
It's time for a confession.

610
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,460
The confession is...

611
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:23,460
I was very famous for being the first couple

612
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:25,460
who gave birth to so many couples.

613
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:30,300
I'll make a decision

614
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:36,540
and add again what sounds good when I play it.

615
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:52,420
She sco Resistance

616
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:54,420
Seungmin!

617
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:58,420
After the festival, you want to go eat dinner with me?

618
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:04,420
Wow, I love the night floating.

619
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:10,420
Then, Seungmin, who will go to eat dinner, please come up on the stage.

620
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:20,420
Hello.

621
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:26,420
Hello. I'm Hyun Seungmin, the director and director.

622
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:31,420
Nice to meet you.

623
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:37,420
Seungmin, do you expect someone to write a confession card?

624
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:38,420
Ah...

625
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:40,420
Yes.

626
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:47,420
Then, is it the person Seungmin is expecting?

627
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:51,420
The female lead who wrote a confession card.

628
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:52,420
Who is it?

629
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:55,420
It's me.

630
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:58,420
Please come up on the stage.

631
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:00,420
Thank you.

632
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:10,420
Now, let's do a 10-second eye contact.

633
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:11,420
How about it?

634
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:18,420
Are you all counting together?

635
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:20,420
Start!

636
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:30,420
7, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

637
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:57,060
重

638
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:09,420
Taeyeon

639
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:29,020
Bani, I want to spend Christmas with you.

640
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:39,620
Wow, you're already excited to hear about Christmas.

641
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:46,020
Then, Bani, would you come up to the stage?

642
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:56,020
Bani, come out.

643
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:19,620
Hello, I'm Bani Jin, the second grader.

644
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:23,420
Thank you.

645
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:28,420
You've become the main character of the story.

646
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:31,420
Did you expect it?

647
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:34,420
No.

648
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:35,420
Yes.

649
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:40,420
Then, you must be very confused and surprised.

650
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:44,420
Maybe you're more nervous than Heejin.

651
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:47,420
You can't meet her, can you?

652
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:49,420
Yes.

653
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:55,420
I'm really curious about who you are.

654
01:00:55,420 --> 01:01:02,420
Then, the male lead who left the story, please come up to the stage.

655
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:17,420
What's wrong? Why is no one coming out?

656
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:22,420
Come out.

657
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:36,420
Isn't he a prankster?

658
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:52,420
Bani, you're so cute.

659
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:16,420
Come out.

660
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:22,420
Bani, you're so cute.

661
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:52,420
Bani, you're so cute.

662
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:22,420
Bani, you're so cute.

663
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:52,420
I think I'm just too close to you.

664
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:58,420
I'm looking at you, and I can't be a prankster.

665
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:03,420
Hey, Heejin, we broke up.

666
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:05,420
We'll know.

667
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:09,420
Don't meet a man who's confused.

668
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:11,420
I'm so sorry.

669
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:14,420
So, I'm going to go.

670
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:18,420
I'm going crazy because of you.
