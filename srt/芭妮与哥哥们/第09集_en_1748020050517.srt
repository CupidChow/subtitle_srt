1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,220
As if only for you

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,760
This night

3
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,480
It's over here, my house

4
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,480
Oh, that...

5
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,480
Oh, that...

6
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,480
That's right.

7
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,480
Oh, what time is school tomorrow?

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,480
Uh, that's 5 or 2 in the afternoon.

9
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,480
Then let's go to school together.

10
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,480
I'll be back from home.

11
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,480
Yes.

12
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,480
Then go to bed early.

13
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,480
Good night.

14
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,480
Yes.

15
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,480
You too.

16
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,480
Goodbye.

17
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:21,480
Wow.

18
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:31,480
I almost got heart attack.

19
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:49,480
What is it?

20
00:01:49,480 --> 00:02:03,480
Is it a dream?

21
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,480
No.

22
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,480
Did you wait long?

23
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,480
No, I just came.

24
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,480
Did you sleep well last night?

25
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,480
Yes.

26
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,480
I slept really tight after a long time.

27
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,480
Really?

28
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,480
I didn't sleep well.

29
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,480
I miss you.

30
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,480
Let's go.

31
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,480
Yes.

32
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,480
Are you going to class today?

33
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,480
Yes. How about you?

34
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,480
I'm in the air today.

35
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,480
Oh, then it's because of me.

36
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,480
Yes.

37
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,480
I want to be with you.

38
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,480
Hey, what?

39
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,480
Are you two holding hands?

40
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,480
Oh, I'm watching you.

41
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,480
Is it a hidden camera?

42
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,480
Say hello to my girlfriend.

43
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,480
Wow, awesome.

44
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,480
But there should be a little bit of a secret.

45
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,480
I know it's not.

46
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,480
I'm going first.

47
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,480
I'll see you next time.

48
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,480
Let's go.

49
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,480
My son.

50
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,480
It's finally done.

51
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,480
Chang-ah, you're awesome.

52
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,480
Oh, but why are you crying?

53
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,480
You didn't drink.

54
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,480
It's okay.

55
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,480
It's not a couple of times.

56
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,480
You have us.

57
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,480
Yes.

58
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,480
Dook, shall we go eat?

59
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,480
Yes.

60
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,480
If I knew this would happen, I would have just come to the library.

61
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,480
Are you here?

62
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,480
Yes.

63
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,480
Then see you after class.

64
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,480
Okay, I'll call you.

65
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,480
Okay.

66
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,480
Hey.

67
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,480
Can you talk to me for a minute?

68
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,480
I decided to meet Yeori.

69
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:48,480
I know you worried about me, but now I know Yeori's true feelings.

70
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,480
And I want to meet her pretty.

71
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,480
Okay.

72
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,480
I don't have to worry anymore.

73
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,480
Congratulations.

74
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,480
Then, let's go first.

75
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,480
See you tomorrow.

76
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,480
Okay.

77
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,480
Okay.

78
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,480
Oh, you're so cute.

79
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:22,480
I'll be by your side

80
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,480
Do you want a mocha cc set?

81
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,480
I'll take this one

82
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:44,480
Are you not used to this 2-shot?

83
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,480
I can't do this, but I'm getting excited

84
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,480
People are happy ending

85
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,480
I'm a big fan of you

86
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,480
Please take care of me

87
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,480
Oh, my coupon

88
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,480
Yes, I'll take it

89
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,480
Beneath the endless sea of stars

90
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,480
Lost in the glow of the light

91
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,480
I'm in the clouds

92
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,480
I feel like I've seen you for a while

93
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,480
You are the forward star

94
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,480
I'm in the clouds

95
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,480
I feel like I've seen you for a while

96
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,480
I turn around the dark clouds

97
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,480
I'm in the clouds

98
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,480
The moment time stops

99
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,480
I feel like I've seen you for a while

100
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,480
Oh, my god

101
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,480
Oh, my god

102
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,480
I'm in the clouds

103
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,480
Like a meteor that covers the darkness

104
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,480
Your traces that hide in my heart

105
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,480
In the light that finds you

106
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,480
I'm searching for your starlight

107
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,480
And here we are lost in the trail

108
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,480
Smiles are far within the dark

109
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,480
You are always trying for me

110
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,480
We're always meant to be together

111
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,480
I'm flying into the sky

112
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,480
So I just stay in for you

113
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,480
Even in the warm eyes

114
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,480
Even if I live another time

115
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,480
I'll be your starlight

116
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,480
And you will be my starlight

117
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,480
It's good that you came in time

118
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,480
Right?

119
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,480
I didn't even sleep

120
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,480
Did you have a girlfriend?

121
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,480
No, I had a friend

122
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,480
I was so happy

123
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,480
I'm kidding

124
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,480
Of course, I didn't sleep because I was with you

125
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,480
Come here

126
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,480
Wow, I collected a lot

127
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,480
How many are these?

128
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,480
Maybe about 100

129
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,480
You almost took a picture every day except for the school

130
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,480
Aren't you tired?

131
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,480
What are you saying? What are you tired of?

132
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,480
You can't be so nice every day

133
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,480
Me too

134
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,480
Not two people

135
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,480
Couple set

136
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,480
Oh, hey

137
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,480
I'm...

138
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,480
I'm so happy

139
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,480
There's a sense of unity and a good sense of emotion

140
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,480
This team is definitely a lot more complete

141
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,480
The result is different

142
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,480
Thank you

143
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,480
There's no other part to be rewarded

144
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,480
Just finish it like this

145
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,480
Yes, sir

146
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,480
If you really get through the assignment,

147
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,480
this semester is really over

148
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,480
We really worked hard this year

149
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,480
I'll clean up and come back

150
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,480
Okay

151
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,480
That Bani

152
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:07,480
Can you make a seat with me and Wonhee before the assignment?

153
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,480
Oh, I'm sorry

154
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,480
Oh, why?

155
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,480
I thought about it

156
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,480
We never talked

157
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,480
I wanted to get closer, but I didn't have a chance

158
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,480
Okay, I'll try

159
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,480
Thank you

160
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,480
Why are you looking at me like that?

161
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,480
No, nothing

162
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,480
Wow, there's something like this

163
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,480
I'm going to have a hard time with the competition

164
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,480
I know

165
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,480
Hey, it's been a while since we've done early

166
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,480
Should we eat and go in?

167
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,480
Oh, I think...

168
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,480
I don't think that's going to work

169
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,480
Hey

170
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,480
Are you going to eat dinner with me tonight?

171
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,480
Or should we go together?

172
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,480
I can't even feel the sincerity and the eyes

173
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,480
You're so smart

174
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,480
Then have dinner and go

175
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,480
See you tomorrow, brother

176
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,480
I'll have this

177
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,480
It tastes a little...

178
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,480
It's a little burnt

179
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,480
I'm sorry

180
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,480
Myung-bruhjeon

181
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,480
Are you Italian?

182
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,480
It's like the whole of Bonggu

183
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,480
You're so cute

184
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,480
Oh, right

185
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,480
See, I can be a little excited

186
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,480
But I think I can do the main job this time

187
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,480
Did you get the final evaluation next week?

188
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,480
Yes

189
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,480
I hope the exam ends soon

190
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,480
I've decided everything I want to do with you

191
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,480
What is it?

192
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,480
First, ice-cream shop

193
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,480
And eating fish cake and fish cake in the street

194
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,480
Lastly,

195
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,480
spending Christmas with you

196
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,480
I had a dream to spend Christmas with my boyfriend

197
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,480
I'm so happy

198
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,480
Okay, let's spend it together

199
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,480
Okay, I like it

200
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,480
I thought my dad's pasta was the best in the world

201
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,480
But he won

202
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,480
Really?

203
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,480
Yes, it's a secret from my dad

204
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,480
But if my dad doesn't make me delicious food,

205
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,480
I'll make it until he makes me delicious food

206
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,480
It's so funny

207
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,480
I always feel it

208
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,480
How can I be so close to my dad?

209
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,480
We have a lot of similarities

210
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,480
We're always together

211
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,480
It's nice to see you get along well with your parents

212
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,480
I'm so sorry

213
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,480
Are you busy? I forgot to bring my face

214
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,480
Come home and listen to me

215
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,480
Mother?

216
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,480
Yes

217
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,480
Have you never seen her since that day?

218
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,480
I think you miss her too

219
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,480
I'll show you

220
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,480
I just want to try

221
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,480
But it's not easy

222
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,480
You don't feel the same way

223
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,480
I don't know

224
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,480
How to get along with her

225
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,480
I've never been close to her

226
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,480
Well...

227
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,480
How about you get closer to her?

228
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,480
Or...

229
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,480
Do you want me to help you?

230
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,480
Huh?

231
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,480
Wait!

232
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,480
What if I let you go? What's the point of having a heart?

233
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,480
Trust me

234
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,480
You'll like her a lot

235
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,480
Give it to me

236
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,480
I'll give it to you

237
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,480
Why are you saying that?

238
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,480
You're so sweet

239
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,480
I'm happy

240
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,480
I told you I'll like her

241
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,480
What should I do?

242
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,480
I'll give you a heart attack

243
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,480
No

244
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
I can't

245
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,480
Why? You like her

246
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,480
I can't

247
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,480
I'll give you a heart attack

248
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,480
I'll give you a heart attack

249
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,480
I'll give you a heart attack

250
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,480
I'll give you a heart attack

251
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,480
I'll give you a heart attack

252
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,480
I'll give you a heart attack

253
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,480
I'll give you a heart attack

254
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,480
I'll give you a heart attack

255
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,480
I'll give you a heart attack

256
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,480
I'll give you a heart attack

257
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,480
I'll give you a heart attack

258
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,480
I'll give you a heart attack

259
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,480
I'll give you a heart attack

260
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,480
I'll give you a heart attack

261
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,480
No

262
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,480
Give it to me

263
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,480
I promise

264
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,480
Fold your card

265
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,480
What the...

266
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,480
I broke his card

267
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,360
I told you not to do this.

268
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,720
I'm sorry.

269
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,120
I told you to just come outside.

270
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,860
I'm sorry.

271
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,560
When will you organize the people?

272
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,600
But...

273
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,640
I guess you're doing well.

274
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,400
I'm doing well.

275
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,200
Unlike you.

276
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,480
Who's this?

277
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,680
Him?

278
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,240
He's Cha Eung-gu's grandson.

279
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,080
Cha Eung-gu?

280
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,640
Why is he with him?

281
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,280
When he was in the soccer team,

282
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,920
this guy told him about the attack.

283
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,420
He said he was a bit upset

284
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,920
because he was in the team.

285
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,520
Here.

286
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,820
This is the tea.

287
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,060
You know Go Bong-soo, right?

288
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,020
Go Bong-soo.

289
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,260
Tea.

290
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,800
This is...

291
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,440
Wait.

292
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,080
I was going to organize the people.

293
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,080
Shall we have dinner together?

294
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,080
Shall we?

295
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,520
I'm not hungry today.

296
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,680
Let's eat together.

297
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,480
You haven't had dinner yet.

298
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,520
I had a hard time with my mouth full.

299
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,460
I have a lot to work on.

300
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,360
Let's eat together.

301
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,860
Okay.

302
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,280
Okay.

303
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,420
See you tomorrow.

304
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:20,160
It's my first time having dinner with you.

305
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,700
I wish I could go eat something better

306
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,140
than the food I had.

307
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,700
No.

308
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,040
I like the food.

309
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,440
Oh.

310
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,980
That's a relief.

311
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,880
But...

312
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,260
Why don't you date him?

313
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,960
There are a lot of people who like him.

314
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,460
But I wonder why he doesn't.

315
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,320
Me?

316
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:10,780
There are people who like him.

317
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,960
izz.

318
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,320
Go Bong-soo?

319
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,960
How could you...

320
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,720
It's a bit unfair for you to think about here.

321
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,860
I'm going so far this life.

322
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,560
It's just because having sex alone is very annoying.

323
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,600
What?

324
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,660
I don't know.

325
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,540
Why aren't you minha stirs showed that

326
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:08,540
Why did you have to rush like that?

327
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:12,540
Was it your purpose to make me pay for your crime?

328
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:16,540
Did you think you'd be alive if you only had me as your back?

329
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,540
What are you talking about?

330
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,540
But what should I do?

331
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,540
I can't watch that even if I die.

332
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,540
I can't watch it.

333
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,540
I think I know what's wrong.

334
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,540
I'm not the one who ruined your life.

335
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,540
It's you.

336
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,540
You're the one who ruined it.

337
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,540
Yes, I did everything wrong.

338
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,540
You're right.

339
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,540
It's all my fault.

340
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,540
Yes, it is.

341
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,540
I'm sorry.

342
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,540
Jin.

343
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:12,540
You should say hello to me too.

344
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,540
What are you doing?

345
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,540
Hey, you should've been here!

346
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,540
No.

347
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,540
Hey, what's wrong?

348
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,540
Hey!

349
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,540
You...

350
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,540
What do you mean by this?

351
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,540
What?

352
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,540
What do you want me to do?

353
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,540
What do you want me to do?

354
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,540
Are you okay?

355
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,540
First, the police report.

356
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,540
Again?

357
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,540
What's wrong with you?

358
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,540
It hurts!

359
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,540
Wait a minute.

360
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:44,540
We can ask the police later.

361
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,540
Haneul!

362
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,540
Are you okay?

363
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,540
Are you hurt?

364
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,540
Are you hurt?

365
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,540
I'm sorry.

366
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,540
I was just talking.

367
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,540
You bastard.

368
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,540
Why are you always like this?

369
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,540
Be quiet.

370
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,540
Haneul!

371
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,540
I'm sorry.

372
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,540
I'm late.

373
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:37,540
I told you I was going right away.

374
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,540
Why are you sorry?

375
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,540
I'm sorry.

376
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,540
I must've scared you.

377
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,540
It's me.

378
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,540
You're the one who's worried.

379
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,540
I'm sorry.

380
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,540
I'm sorry.

381
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,540
I'm sorry.

382
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,540
Go back to your room.

383
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,540
You must've been really tired.

384
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,540
I'll be going.

385
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,540
Okay.

386
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,540
Goodbye.

387
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,540
Be careful.

388
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,540
Okay.

389
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,540
Are you here?

390
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,540
Uncle.

391
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,540
Are you okay?

392
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,540
What?

393
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,540
Oh, this?

394
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,540
I'm sorry.

395
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,540
I'm sorry.

396
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,540
I'm sorry.

397
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,540
I'm sorry.

398
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,540
I'm sorry.

399
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,540
I'm sorry.

400
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,540
I'm sorry.

401
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,540
I'm sorry.

402
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,540
It's my fault.

403
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,540
Why are you sorry?

404
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,540
And I didn't get hurt.

405
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,540
I just put it on because I didn't know.

406
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,540
Are you okay?

407
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,540
You must've been really surprised yesterday.

408
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:19,540
Honestly, I don't know what happened yet.

409
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:24,540
I don't know what to do.

410
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,540
Let's do anything.

411
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,540
I'll help you.

412
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,540
No.

413
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,540
Are you okay?

414
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:45,540
Anyway, you're really serious.

415
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,540
You're even doing other people's work.

416
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,540
Don't we have anything to help?

417
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,540
Yes.

418
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,540
It's okay.

419
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,540
I'll ask if you need anything.

420
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,540
You must tell me.

421
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,540
Okay.

422
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,540
What's this?

423
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,540
Why?

424
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:09,540
It's a community.

425
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,540
You can't use that.

426
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,540
You should've done it.

427
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,540
I don't know who it is.

428
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,540
You're lying.

429
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,540
I'm not lying.

430
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,540
What are you doing?

431
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,540
What's wrong?

432
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,540
What's wrong?

433
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,540
I didn't press it.

434
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,540
What is it?

435
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,540
No, no.

436
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,540
Give it to me.

437
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,540
No, no.

438
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,540
Give it to me.

439
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,540
Give it to me.

440
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,540
Give it to me.

441
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,540
Give it to me.

442
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,540
Give it to me.

443
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,540
You said you didn't have a boyfriend.

444
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,540
You're crazy.

445
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,540
People are...

446
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,540
What's wrong with her?

447
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,540
She's crazy.

448
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,540
What should I do?

449
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:24,540
She's even getting mad at you because of me.

450
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,540
She'll get mad at you soon.

451
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:29,540
But your boyfriend is not like that.

452
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,540
What?

453
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:33,540
Everyone thinks you're his boyfriend.

454
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,540
I think it's better if you do it.

455
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,540
I'm sorry.

456
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,540
You're a bastard.

457
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:53,540
What's wrong with you?

458
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,540
Call me.

459
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,540
Yes, Bani.

460
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,540
Do you...

461
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,540
Have you...

462
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,540
seen...

463
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:16,540
the postcard?

464
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,540
Isn't it funny?

465
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:21,540
Why are you saying that nonsense?

466
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:25,540
I'm thinking about uploading the video to the beach.

467
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,540
Bani.

468
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,540
What?

469
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,540
It's okay.

470
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,540
It's not true anyway.

471
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,540
So don't worry too much.

472
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:40,540
I'm sure you're worried about me.

473
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,540
Okay.

474
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,540
Thank you.

475
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,540
Bani.

476
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:51,540
I think I should go on a trip from now on.

477
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,540
Okay.

478
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,540
If anything happens, call me.

479
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,540
Okay.

480
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,540
Dongha.

481
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,540
Yes?

482
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,540
Help me out.

483
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:24,540
What are you doing here?

484
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,540
I'm sure you're not satisfied.

485
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,540
What?

486
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,540
Are you trying to kill me with a boat?

487
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,540
If you do this, I'll send you to the restaurant.

488
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,540
I should have.

489
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,540
Why are you saying that now?

490
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,540
What?

491
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,540
Are Bani and Wonhee working together?

492
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,540
I'm glad that I didn't break down too much.

493
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,540
I'm not sure.

494
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:07,540
I think I might misunderstand someone who's not aware of this.

495
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,540
You go first.

496
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,540
What?

497
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,540
Hey, hey, hey.

498
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,540
Bani.

499
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,540
Let's have some snacks.

500
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,540
Wow, I'm so hungry right now.

501
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,540
Eat more.

502
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,540
You should work harder.

503
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,540
Okay.

504
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:35,540
Did you really buy us a lot of food?

505
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,540
Not us, Bani.

506
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,540
You should just eat.

507
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,540
I'm asking you.

508
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,540
Be careful.

509
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,540
I'm afraid you might get more.

510
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,540
Who said that?

511
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,540
I'll go get some water.

512
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,540
Okay.

513
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,540
Hey.

514
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,540
Do you have any plans to study abroad?

515
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,540
I like Lee Min-yoo better.

516
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,540
Suddenly?

517
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,540
Why do you have so many money?

518
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,540
How about the U.S.?

519
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,540
It's a long flight time.

520
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,540
It suits you well.

521
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,540
Is that why?

522
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,540
Yes, it's a global problem.

523
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,540
It's perfect.

524
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,540
If you're not going to the U.S., let's have some distance.

525
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,540
Okay?

526
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,540
Thank you for helping Bani.

527
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:43,540
But it's a 30-cent limit.

528
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,540
I'm not joking.

529
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,540
Hey.

530
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,540
I'm sorry.

531
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,540
I'm sorry.

532
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,540
I'm sorry.

533
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,540
There's a dog that's 20 years old.

534
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,540
Okay.

535
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,540
You're late.

536
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,540
How about the food?

537
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,540
I ate it.

538
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,540
What?

539
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,540
Did something happen?

540
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,540
Mom and dad.

541
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,540
I'm going to the next semester.

542
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,540
I don't know if I can't get my scholarship.

543
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,540
What?

544
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,540
Well...

545
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,540
Do you think you can't get your scholarship?

546
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,540
Well...

547
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,540
It's okay if you can't get it.

548
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,540
Yes.

549
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,540
You didn't get it until now.

550
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,540
What did I say?

551
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:07,540
I don't think your parents can even get your scholarship.

552
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,540
Okay.

553
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,540
I'll take care of it.

554
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,540
Don't worry about it.

555
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,540
Okay?

556
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,540
Excuse me.

557
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:18,540
I didn't know you were near the scholarship.

558
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,540
What's that?

559
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,540
I don't know.

560
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,540
Don't worry.

561
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,540
The scholarship...

562
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,540
Okay.

563
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,540
Let's do it, Ban.

564
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,540
Let's do this.

565
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,540
Ban is the best.

566
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,540
Let's do this.

567
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,540
Let's do this.

568
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,540
Let's do this.

569
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,540
Let's do this.

570
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,540
Let's do this.

571
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,540
Let's do this.

572
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,540
Let's do this.

573
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,540
Let's do this.

574
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,540
You're going to do it again, aren't you?

575
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,540
Yes.

576
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,540
I think I need to do that.

577
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:35,540
Can I learn it from the inside?

578
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,540
I think I need to learn the first song from the inside.

579
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,540
Ban!

580
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,540
Ban.

581
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,540
I'll get some more water.

582
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,540
Okay.

583
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,540
Ban.

584
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,540
Ban.

585
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,540
Ban.

586
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,540
Did you finish your homework?

587
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,540
Call me when you go home.

588
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,540
Okay.

589
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,540
Ban.

590
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,540
I'm so tired.

591
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,540
Ban.

592
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,540
I'm home.

593
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,540
I'm home.

594
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,540
Ban.

595
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,540
What?

596
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,540
You're home.

597
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,540
Ban.

598
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,540
Get up.

599
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,540
When did you come back?

600
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,540
Please.

601
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,540
Get up.

602
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,540
You have to go to school.

603
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,540
Hurry up.

604
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:06,540
Who is it?

605
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:08,540
I'm Ban's boyfriend.

606
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:12,540
I mean, he's your friend.

607
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,540
Your friend?

608
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,540
Yes.

609
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,540
You're so handsome.

610
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,540
I've heard a lot about you.

611
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:22,540
I didn't know you were this handsome.

612
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:25,540
I'm not that handsome.

613
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,540
I'm glad to see you.

614
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,540
I'm Ban's dad.

615
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,540
I'm Ban's dad.

616
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:33,540
I'm Ban's dad.

617
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,540
Okay.

618
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,540
I'm Hwang Jae-yeol.

619
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,540
Nice to meet you.

620
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,540
I said hello earlier.

621
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,540
I have a class.

622
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,540
Are you tired?

623
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,540
No.

624
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:50,540
What's the matter with you since this morning?

625
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,540
What's the matter with you?

626
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,540
You're here to take me to school, right?

627
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,540
Yes.

628
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,540
Did you get up?

629
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,540
How much did you eat?

630
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,540
Sit down.

631
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,540
Why are you here?

632
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,540
Come in.

633
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,540
Okay.

634
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,540
Thank you for the food.

635
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:24,540
It's been a while since I've had such a delicious meal.

636
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,540
Right?

637
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,540
It's hard to eat alone.

638
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:30,540
Would you like to buy something for me?

639
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:31,540
Wait.

640
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,540
I don't ask about the person who made it.

641
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,540
Do you have anything special?

642
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:36,540
I like egg rolls.

643
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,540
I like the green onions and carrots.

644
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:44,540
I like soybean paste stew with tofu and chicken breast.

645
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,540
Chicken breast and chicken breast.

646
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:51,540
Ban is very detailed.

647
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:55,540
Do you know what he likes?

648
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:59,540
He said he likes all the food that his father made for him.

649
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:02,540
So I really wanted to try it.

650
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,540
It's really good.

651
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,540
Is it good?

652
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:06,540
Yes.

653
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:09,540
Then how delicious is it?

654
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,540
I'll eat it one by one.

655
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,540
What are you so good at?

656
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,540
Let's go eat.

657
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:15,540
Eat.

658
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,540
Eat comfortably.

659
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:17,540
Here.

660
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:19,540
Is it bulgogi?

661
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:20,540
Yes.

662
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:22,540
Is it bulgogi?

663
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:23,540
Yes.

664
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:34,540
He's eating like he's giving it to me.

665
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:36,540
Is it good?

666
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:40,540
I like bulgogi too.

667
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:41,540
Don't spill it.

668
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:43,540
I'm getting full.

669
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,540
Thank you for the delicious meal.

670
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,540
You're welcome.

671
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:49,540
If you want to eat breakfast next time, when do you like it?

672
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:52,540
I don't like people who make it.

673
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:54,540
Come again next time.

674
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:55,540
You should go home safely.

675
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:56,540
Okay.

676
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:58,540
Bye.

677
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:00,540
I'll be back.

678
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:01,540
Okay.

679
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,540
Go home.

680
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:09,540
Go home.

681
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:10,540
Okay.

682
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:24,540
It's been a long time since I've seen my mom smile so lively.

683
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:27,540
My dad has a lot of words,

684
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,540
but he's good at holding it in.

685
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:37,540
Hey.

686
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,540
Did you get angry?

687
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,540
I was worried.

688
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:50,540
I was worried because I couldn't reach you.

689
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:51,540
I'm sorry.

690
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:55,540
I worked until dawn and I fell asleep as soon as I came home.

691
00:44:56,540 --> 00:45:00,540
Next time, you can call me later.

692
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:02,540
Okay?

693
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:04,540
Okay.

694
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:06,540
I'll do that for real.

695
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,540
I'm sorry.

696
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:19,540
Since last time

697
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,540
I kissed you successfully and now

698
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:25,780
I'm sorry because I failed

699
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:34,540
Because only if you turn me down

700
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,540
Somehow it was quiet.

701
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,540
I...

702
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:52,540
I have someone I like.

703
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:57,540
Have you ever confessed?

704
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,540
No.

705
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:03,540
Why?

706
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:08,540
You can't do it.

707
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:11,540
Just...

708
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:14,540
I can't do it.

709
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,540
Just...

710
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:20,540
I'm just next to you.

711
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:47,540
I'm just next to you.

712
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:17,540
I'm just next to you.

713
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:47,540
I'm just next to you.

714
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:40,540
No.

715
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,540
Did you finish your work?

716
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:44,540
Did you finish your work?

717
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:46,540
Yes.

718
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:48,540
Then let's go.

719
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:58,540
It's late now.

720
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:05,540
Yes.

721
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:08,540
I think there were more people.

722
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:11,540
I think I've been sleeping for a long time.

723
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:14,540
Hey.

724
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:20,540
What?

725
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,540
Oh, sorry.

726
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:25,540
What did you say?

727
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:31,540
No.

728
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:33,540
Did you make a final assessment tomorrow?

729
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:45,540
Yes.

730
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:59,540
It's going to be all right.

731
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:04,540
I heard that you will be a security guard through the business.

732
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:07,540
The investment fund was attached to the police.

733
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:14,540
The company has been investing in environmental businesses without real estate to 28 victims.

734
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:17,540
The investment is about 300 million won per month.

735
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:21,540
Is there anyone who has such a fraud these days?

736
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:24,540
At first, I was careful.

737
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:25,540
But...

738
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:26,540
Already?

739
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:28,540
Go eat.

740
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:31,540
I'm so sleepy. I'm not hungry.

741
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:32,540
What about you?

742
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:34,540
I've been out early in the morning.

743
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:36,540
Really?

744
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:37,540
Okay.

745
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:39,540
Bye.

746
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:41,540
I'm going home.

747
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:46,540
I thought this was a real deal because I was in the business.

748
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:50,540
I was told by the owner of the house that the whole world would be in trouble.

749
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:53,540
I thought I could solve this problem.

750
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:57,540
I only believed in him and put in the money I had.

751
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:59,540
How do you see your family now?

752
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:03,540
The police are investigating the possibility of additional victims.

753
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:08,540
They are also investigating the possibility of removing the amount of damage.

754
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:11,540
Everyone worked hard for a year.

755
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:14,540
The main project was decided to be a glass.

756
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:16,540
Thank you.

757
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:20,540
Thank you.

758
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:24,540
Then prepare for the assignment and go home early today.

759
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:26,540
Thank you.

760
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:29,540
Thank you.

761
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:34,540
I don't know what you mean.

762
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:38,540
But I know what you mean.

763
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:40,540
Okay.

764
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:52,540
You should have been the main project.

765
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:54,540
No, I'm not.

766
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:56,540
I'm the one who will be the main project.

767
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:57,540
Congratulations.

768
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:58,540
Thank you.

769
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:00,540
Yoonhee, let's go.

770
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:15,540
Are you okay?

771
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,540
Yes, I can't help it.

772
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:20,540
I've finished it somehow.

773
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:26,540
Honestly, I'm worried about my scholarship now.

774
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:34,540
Mom.

775
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:35,540
Banhee.

776
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:38,540
What should I do?

777
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:39,540
What's wrong?

778
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:40,540
What's wrong?

779
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:44,540
Mom, the police are...

780
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:47,540
The police?

781
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:55,540
Oh, my.

782
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:58,540
I can't help it.

783
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:00,540
How can I put that big money in one night?

784
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:02,540
How can I put it in $5,000?

785
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:05,540
I should have enough money to be a mother.

786
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:07,540
That's...

787
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:10,540
You don't have any physical situation these days, do you?

788
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:16,540
Banhee is upset that she missed the scholarship.

789
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:19,540
I tried to help you out.

790
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:22,540
I was a reliable friend.

791
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:29,540
That's why you got hit.

792
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,540
I'm sorry.

793
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:41,540
I'm sorry, Banhee.

794
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:47,540
Oh, yes.

795
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:52,540
I understand.

796
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:54,540
What's wrong?

797
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:55,540
What's wrong with you?

798
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:58,540
Are you that serious?

799
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:04,540
Our police officer.

800
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:06,540
He said he went up the main line.

801
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:07,540
What?

802
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:09,540
Did you already go to the airport?

803
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:11,540
I thought I was going to fall off the main line.

804
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:14,540
If it's the main line, the award is definitely a final.

805
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:24,540
What?

806
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:25,540
Oh, Banhee.

807
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:26,540
Yes, oppa.

808
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:28,540
I was on the air before.

809
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:30,540
He said he went up the main line.

810
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:32,540
Oh, really?

811
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:33,540
Yeah.

812
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:35,540
The award is already confirmed.

813
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:37,540
I think the award will be released next month.

814
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,540
I just got a call from the additional income.

815
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:41,540
It's good.

816
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:43,540
Congratulations, oppa.

817
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:47,540
What about you?

818
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:50,540
What's your final assessment?

819
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:55,540
Oh...

820
00:54:55,540 --> 00:55:00,540
I couldn't go to the main line.

821
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:02,540
But it's okay.

822
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:04,540
It's not something I didn't expect.

823
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:05,540
Hey, bro.

824
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,540
Oh, the back of the head.

825
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:08,540
You have to do that.

826
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:12,540
You have to do it.

827
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:15,540
I'm going to have to do it too much today.

828
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:20,540
No, it's not that much.

829
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:21,540
Do you want to come too?

830
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:25,540
No, I have to congratulate the main characters.

831
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:29,540
I was tired all night for a few days.

832
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:31,540
I just wanted to rest at home.

833
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:33,540
Okay.

834
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:35,540
Congratulations, oppa.

835
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,540
Yeah.

836
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:38,540
Thank you.

837
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:40,540
Okay.

838
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:01,540
Baniya.

839
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:03,540
What?

840
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:05,540
What's wrong with you?

841
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:10,540
I knew you'd be like this.

842
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:12,540
Get up. Let's go.

843
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:13,540
Bye.

844
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:15,540
I'm going to rest at that house today.

845
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:17,540
Hey, what are you doing?

846
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,540
You have to use this air conditioner at this time.

847
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:21,540
Drink some alcohol.

848
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:23,540
Oh, hurry up.

849
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:24,540
Hurry up.

850
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:26,540
Let's go.

851
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:39,540
How are you feeling?

852
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:42,540
I keep saying sorry.

853
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:45,540
I should apologize to the head.

854
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:47,540
What are you saying?

855
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:51,540
I feel like I'm only making my parents suffer.

856
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:58,540
I wouldn't have done that if my dad was a bad guy.

857
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:01,540
This time, I'm going to be a good guy.

858
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:07,540
This time, I just didn't get lucky.

859
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:11,540
I'll be good next time, so I can get a scholarship.

860
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:18,540
That's not certain either.

861
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:27,540
Honestly, I don't know if it's right for me to keep doing art.

862
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:32,540
I just want to be a writer.

863
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:35,540
I just want to be greedy now.

864
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:40,540
I want to comfort you, but I don't have anything to say because I'm a normal person.

865
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,540
I know.

866
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:45,540
Is this the reality of my talent?

867
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:00,540
I'm not looking forward to it.

868
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:06,540
Guys, I'm sorry, but I'm just going to be with Ban today.

869
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:08,540
What if the main character falls out?

870
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:12,540
I'll join you later, so you guys go first.

871
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:13,540
Okay.

872
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:16,540
Come back late.

873
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:18,540
Come back soon.

874
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:21,540
I have to come.

875
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:33,540
Ban, let's just eat something delicious today.

876
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:51,540
Hey, isn't that Ban?

877
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:52,540
What?

878
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:53,540
I don't know.

879
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:55,540
Isn't it a cooking class?

880
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:57,540
I don't know.

881
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:18,540
Hey, Yola.

882
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:22,540
Can I say this?

883
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:25,540
I heard you're going to be with Ban today.

884
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:35,540
But Ban is drinking here right now.

885
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:39,540
Where is that?

886
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:41,540
Hey, you have to run away.

887
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:44,540
Let's go.

888
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:47,540
We've been calling a taxi here.

889
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:48,540
Where's Ban?

890
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:49,540
I'm going to catch him.

891
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:50,540
Go ahead.

892
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:52,540
Call me when you get there.

893
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:55,540
Then we're going.

894
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:57,540
I'll go first.

895
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:58,540
Be careful.

896
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:23,540
Are you okay?

897
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:25,540
Yes, of course.

898
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:27,540
I'm okay.

899
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:37,540
No, I'm sleepy.

900
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:21,540
I'm sleepy.

901
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:59,540
What are you doing?

902
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:27,540
I understand the same thing and the same thing.

903
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:39,540
Now, let's be good friends and keep our hands up.

904
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:27,540
Hey, what's up with you?

905
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:31,540
You know how he feels about you.

906
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:33,540
I'm going to the States.

907
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:35,540
I passed.

908
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:36,540
Congratulations.

909
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:38,540
No, this is an auto accident.

910
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:41,540
Don't worry about Jin-ri first.

911
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:44,540
First of all, you're going to your heart right now.

912
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:46,540
I'll go to the States with you.

913
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:56,540
If that's the case, I can't let you go either.
