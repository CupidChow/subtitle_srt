1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,560
Are you okay ?

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,860
Cheng each of us

3
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,600
Theiv

4
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,940
I didn't call you

5
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,100
Unlike what you said

6
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,780
I can't see it

7
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,780
We are too far away.

8
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:57,940
Drink something.

9
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,140
Take a drink to my struggle.

10
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,180
Just a year later,

11
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,180
Soon

12
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:33,820
Traveling

13
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,340
Fang Ni.

14
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,540
Fang Ni.

15
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,660
inviting us

16
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,860
I'm so tired

17
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,860
I worked so hard to play with my parents while I was away.

18
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,860
You worked so hard to come here.

19
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,860
I didn't feel anything until yesterday.

20
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,860
You really came here.

21
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,860
My daughter, you were so hard on your own.

22
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,860
My parents are all gone.

23
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,860
I'm so sorry.

24
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,860
Why are you crying so much? Stop crying.

25
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,860
I thought you were going to bed.

26
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,860
Okay, sir. Let's go to the welcome ceremony.

27
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,860
Let's go. I'll make you feel better.

28
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,860
Let's go.

29
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,860
Let's go.

30
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,860
Nice timing.

31
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,860
I was about to have dinner.

32
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,860
What?

33
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,860
You're still working in the studio?

34
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,860
Aren't you going on a date today?

35
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,860
I'm not.

36
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,860
I'm not.

37
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,860
Why?

38
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,860
I'm going to the welcome ceremony at the house of Ban.

39
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,860
Ban came to Korea today.

40
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,860
I think he's going to return to school this semester.

41
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,860
I've been working for a year.

42
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,860
Why is Ban working so hard?

43
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,860
Me too.

44
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,860
I think I'm working too hard.

45
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,860
I think it's better to go to school.

46
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,860
I think it's better to work for a different reason.

47
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,860
You're the third year of my life now.

48
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,860
Hey!

49
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,860
Wonhee said he came last week.

50
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,860
Yes.

51
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,860
When he comes to Korea, we'll all come together.

52
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,860
Of course.

53
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,860
I'll catch up with you soon.

54
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,860
You're doing well in the relationship.

55
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,860
What?

56
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,860
You're going to be a good brother.

57
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,860
Of course.

58
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,860
We're all getting along well after we meet.

59
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,860
I mean, recently, you've been...

60
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,860
I've made a creative tip-down.

61
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,860
But it's already been a long time.

62
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,860
You've never contacted me in the US, right?

63
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,860
Yes.

64
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,860
You'll meet me often after you return.

65
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,860
Are you okay?

66
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,860
It's not the same thing anyway.

67
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,860
I don't have time to worry about other things to get used to in school.

68
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,860
I applied for a scholarship this time.

69
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,860
When did you do that?

70
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,860
I have to apply for a scholarship.

71
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,860
Do you have any recommendations?

72
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,860
Do you want to listen to it with me?

73
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,860
It's a great song.

74
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,860
What is it?

75
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,860
It's a popular song.

76
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,860
But I can't find a place to sit.

77
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,860
Oh, it's empty.

78
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,860
I'm done.

79
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,860
I like the feeling of starting.

80
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,860
So, I'll go back to school.

81
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,860
Cheers!

82
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,860
You're good at making time.

83
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,860
Right?

84
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,860
I'm not good at making time.

85
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,860
Do you have a girlfriend?

86
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,860
No, I have a school contract.

87
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,860
I'm kidding.

88
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,860
Of course, I'm not good because I have a boyfriend.

89
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,860
Come here.

90
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,860
How is your class today?

91
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,860
I think you're going back to school this semester.

92
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,860
Free time

93
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:15,860
Free 가볍chuckles

94
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,860
Airsoft

95
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,860
Hello, guys.

96
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,860
I'm inspiration of Y hacking.

97
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,860
It's zupełniepl.

98
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,860
This is pretty much a flower.

99
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,860
From winter to Summer.

100
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,860
We can finally go back to study.

101
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,860
I feel excited to begin my studies,

102
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,860
What do you think?

103
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,860
I think of the flower of college life, C.C.

104
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,860
Some people still have a sweet and sweet time in their high school.

105
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,860
What?

106
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,860
Do you want a sweet and sweet C.C.C. set?

107
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,860
Okay.

108
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,860
One is the most beautiful one in the world.

109
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,860
Please give me a special one.

110
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,860
Okay.

111
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,860
I'll give you a special one.

112
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,860
Okay.

113
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,860
But everyone will have a sweet and sweet day.

114
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,860
If you are going to be a C.C.C. date,

115
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,860
you will have a bad day.

116
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,860
But I hope you will have a good day.

117
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,860
Teacher.

118
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,860
Are you okay?

119
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,860
Yes.

120
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,860
Oh Yul.

121
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,860
Yes.

122
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,860
Jung.

123
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,860
Oh Yul.

124
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,860
Yes.

125
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,860
Dan Hee Jin.

126
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,860
Dan Hee Jin is a bad guy.

127
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,860
It's hard to pick a house in the morning.

128
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,860
It's a street house.

129
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,860
Where are you going?

130
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,860
To the shoulder?

131
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,860
To the knee?

132
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,860
Yes.

133
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,860
Okay.

134
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,860
You must be tired.

135
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,860
Let's rest for a while.

136
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,860
I'm resting.

137
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,860
You're sleeping with your hands.

138
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,860
What?

139
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,860
You're so cute.

140
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,860
You're so cute.

141
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,860
Oh, why?

142
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,860
I don't think you were that kind of character.

143
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,860
I'm the kind of person who does everything properly.

144
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,860
Right?

145
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,860
What are you looking at?

146
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,860
I need to ask you for another lesson.

147
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,860
I heard about it last night.

148
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,860
Just ask me for it.

149
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,860
I don't have anything.

150
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,860
I'm so sad.

151
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,860
I'm so sorry.

152
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,860
I'm sorry.

153
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,860
I'm sorry.

154
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,860
Be nice to me.

155
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,860
Thank you.

156
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,860
Thank you.

157
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,860
What?

158
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,860
I didn't mean to do that.

159
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,860
I'm sorry.

160
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:05,860
I'm sorry.

161
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,860
I'm sorry.

162
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,860
I'm sorry.

163
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,860
I'm sorry.

164
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,860
I'm sorry.

165
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,860
It's okay.

166
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,860
It's okay.

167
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,860
I'm sorry.

168
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,860
I'm sorry.

169
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,860
Don't say that.

170
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,300
But what about you?

171
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,900
Are you not going to study abroad?

172
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,100
Yes, I am in Korea now.

173
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,100
But I'm going back to America soon.

174
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,900
I'm sorry.

175
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,900
That's not good.

176
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,700
How was I?

177
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,700
You should have a study abroad.

178
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,100
I want to do that too.

179
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,100
I'm going to the training class.

180
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,700
I'll tell you in detail next time.

181
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,300
You're a fish.

182
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:45,900
Okay.

183
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,900
I'll go first. See you next time.

184
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,860
Okay.

185
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,860
I'll go first.

186
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,860
Okay.

187
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,860
I'll go first.

188
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,860
Okay.

189
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,860
I'm done.

190
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,860
Bani.

191
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,860
Yes.

192
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,860
Did you eat?

193
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,860
No.

194
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,860
The professor is full.

195
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,860
I can't eat.

196
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,860
Then bring some sandwiches.

197
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,860
No, it's okay.

198
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,860
Dongha is listening to this too.

199
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,860
It's okay.

200
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,860
Of course it's okay.

201
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,860
It's not like you don't know.

202
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,860
Bani.

203
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,860
Dongha.

204
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,860
Bani was here too.

205
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,860
Hey, Dongha.

206
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,860
What are you doing here?

207
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,860
I just caught Lee Sob.

208
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,860
Let's go in.

209
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,860
What's wrong?

210
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,860
I heard it somewhere.

211
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,860
Lee Sob is really weird.

212
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,860
The professor is very strict.

213
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,860
He doesn't even have time to rest.

214
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,860
So we just listen to other things.

215
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,860
What are you talking about?

216
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,860
I caught him this time too.

217
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,860
Please.

218
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,860
If you go in now, you'll regret it.

219
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,860
Trust me, please.

220
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,860
Why didn't you come in?

221
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,860
I know.

222
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,860
I'll go to a better class.

223
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,860
100 times?

224
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,860
No, 1000 times better.

225
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,860
You said it's okay.

226
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,860
Listen to what you heard.

227
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,860
Why are you crying?

228
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,860
It's the first time I feel sorry for him.

229
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:30,220
9code

230
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,740
Music

231
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,780
I'm okay.

232
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:47,180
My sis is sick, that's why she's not breathing.

233
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,020
Gosh, this isn't a marriage.

234
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:03,180
If you can't promise to forget after you got married,

235
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:07,420
you should tell what you feel about that.

236
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,420
I'm sorry.

237
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,420
It's okay.

238
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:21,420
Do you like to ride a round car?

239
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,420
Brother.

240
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,420
I'm sorry.

241
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,420
Wow.

242
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,420
I think I can live now.

243
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:56,420
I really don't know how long I've been in Korea because of this.

244
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,420
No, no.

245
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,420
I don't have anyone who's been with me because of my school.

246
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,420
Not school, but a taxi.

247
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:08,420
I don't think I have time to spend with you.

248
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,420
Me too.

249
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,420
How long have you been in Korea?

250
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,420
I think I'll be with Haewon for a month.

251
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,420
You're in a hurry.

252
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,420
Haewon seems to be doing well.

253
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,420
She's going to parties on social media.

254
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,420
I'm not good at studying, and I'm not busy at all.

255
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,420
Did you meet Haewon?

256
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,420
Yes.

257
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,420
I saw him,

258
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,420
and I thought he was done with it.

259
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:54,420
I thought he might go back to the way he was when he met Haewon.

260
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,420
He was just greedy.

261
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:07,420
I think it would be nice to see him and the flower.

262
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,420
Are you all busy?

263
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,420
I didn't know you were here.

264
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,420
Oh, there he is.

265
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,420
Brother.

266
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,420
Are you having fun?

267
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,420
Yes.

268
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,420
Sit down.

269
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,420
Brother.

270
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,420
You're so good at drinking.

271
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,420
You're doing this for me.

272
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,420
Why are you still in school?

273
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,420
Did you just not go to the military?

274
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,420
I liked the house so much.

275
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,420
Brother.

276
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,420
I'm going to the next school.

277
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,420
Don't be sad.

278
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:46,420
You don't know how I feel.

279
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,420
I know.

280
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,420
I'm not sad.

281
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,420
Brother.

282
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,420
What's the matter?

283
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,420
I think you're feeling a little deeper.

284
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,420
Really?

285
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,420
Brother.

286
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:01,420
I thought you were just a girl from the first class.

287
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,420
I'm so lucky.

288
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,420
Brother.

289
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,420
Sit down.

290
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,420
Sit down?

291
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,420
Are you really okay?

292
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,420
Brother.

293
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,420
I heard you were in the same class as Dan.

294
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,420
What should I do?

295
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,420
I should just cancel the class.

296
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,420
We'll just be uncomfortable.

297
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,420
What's the point of being uncomfortable?

298
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,420
And you said you didn't even look at me.

299
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,420
Don't just ignore me and care about me.

300
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,420
Maybe it's because I was so flustered.

301
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,420
I think it's different when we meet again.

302
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:00,420
Who doesn't get flustered?

303
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:04,420
And you said you've been with me for a long time.

304
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,420
Can't you say hello?

305
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,420
I heard you were a little flustered.

306
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:11,420
I heard you were a little flustered.

307
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,420
I heard you didn't even shed tears.

308
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:23,420
You can do that in your position.

309
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:27,420
Honestly, I think I was selfish.

310
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,420
It's all over.

311
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,420
I'm fine now.

312
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:44,420
But it's a little different when we're in the same class.

313
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,420
It's okay.

314
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,420
Hey.

315
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,420
Hey.

316
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,420
Hey, why are you so drunk?

317
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,420
Did you drink too much?

318
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,420
Hey, where are you going?

319
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,420
I'm just going to sleep.

320
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,420
I'm going to sleep.

321
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,420
I didn't do that.

322
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:53,420
I was so drunk that I couldn't even look at you.

323
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,420
Hey, where are you going?

324
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,420
I'm so drunk.

325
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,420
Why are you so good at sports?

326
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,420
I was a basketball player until I was in high school.

327
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,420
That's why you said you were a basketball player.

328
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,420
I was so fooled.

329
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,420
Anyway, it's a fact.

330
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,420
I'm going to drink and drink.

331
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:37,420
Okay, then I'll drink.

332
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,420
I'll drink something cool.

333
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,420
Okay.

334
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,420
I'll go and do this one more night.

335
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,420
Wait a minute.

336
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,420
Okay.

337
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,420
I'll go and drink.

338
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,420
Thank you.

339
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:19,420
Oh, you're here to buy some drinks.

340
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,420
This is really good.

341
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:31,420
Yeah, I thought so.

342
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,420
Do you want to drink alone?

343
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,420
Huh?

344
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:43,420
No, with friends.

345
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,420
Do you want to drink alone?

346
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,420
No, I'm a drinker.

347
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:54,420
No, I drank a lot of water.

348
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,420
Okay.

349
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,420
Then go carefully.

350
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,420
You...

351
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,420
Huh?

352
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,420
That...

353
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,420
Oh, sorry.

354
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,420
I'll get you some water.

355
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,420
No.

356
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,420
Are you okay?

357
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,420
Yes, I'm okay.

358
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:39,420
I'll throw this away.

359
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,420
Okay.

360
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,420
As expected.

361
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,420
I think this is a little salty.

362
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,420
Try it.

363
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,420
Okay.

364
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,420
It's good.

365
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:14,420
No, you should eat it too.

366
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,420
Okay.

367
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:21,420
I'm glad to say hello to my friends.

368
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,420
Okay.

369
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,420
I'm glad to hear that.

370
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,420
Okay.

371
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,420
Okay.

372
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,420
I'm here to buy some drinks,

373
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,420
but didn't take a conclusion.

374
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,920
You don't need to say YOUR sorry.

375
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,920
I'll leave this alone.

376
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,920
Then...

377
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,920
I didn't mean it.

378
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,920
What?

379
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,920
Nothing.

380
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,920
You're a good writer.

381
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,920
From today?

382
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,920
Yes.

383
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,920
I'm going to be crazy as soon as I get back.

384
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,600
Suлад

385
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,940
He Pls,

386
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,940
Hey Year,

387
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,920
You're working...

388
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,660
Yes

389
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,120
What are you doing?

390
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,200
I am at a department store.

391
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,260
You're having a bad timing.

392
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,240
Why are you so upset...

393
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,780
What's this?

394
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:47,500
I try to make it up,り supermarket house.

395
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,560
I see you had quite a caliber.

396
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,460
Was he in the same class as you?

397
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,920
No, he is.

398
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,920
Stop trying to make up.

399
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:59,000
I don't think the�apping is a bad idea

400
00:27:59,060 --> 00:27:59,180
What?

401
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:03,960
Hope is

402
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,520
I think Esteemed moniture was cancelled

403
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:13,560
Actually, I was comfortable when half is about to come

404
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,420
Hyung Haeng, that's how things were

405
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,020
It depended on the past

406
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,700
Let's hang out for a meeting

407
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,900
This is the time

408
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,720
I think it's the right time

409
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,440
You can just sit still.

410
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,440
We'll do everything we can.

411
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,560
Just give up?

412
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,280
Are you going to go to the meeting because of this?

413
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,760
And then we'll have a meeting with C.C.?

414
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,120
What do you think?

415
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,440
We're still young and young.

416
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,040
Young and young.

417
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,320
Please do it once.

418
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:39,960
Just once.

419
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,040
Come on.

420
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,160
I'm not going to have a meeting with C.C. anymore.

421
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,880
So please say that to me once more.

422
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,880
Hey.

423
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,840
What?

424
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,640
Are you two holding hands?

425
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,960
Say hello.

426
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,960
My girlfriend.

427
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,960
Look.

428
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,360
Hey, are you going to class?

429
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,880
Why are you so mean?

430
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,400
Why are you so mean?

431
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,240
I didn't want to do this.

432
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,080
I'm going to do it for you.

433
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,840
I don't know what to do.

434
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,160
I'll let you know the code registration later.

435
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:32,320
And today, I'll be here to organize the book and buy a book.

436
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,120
Please.

437
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,120
Okay.

438
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,120
Okay.

439
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,440
Okay.

440
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,640
I'll do my job when I'm busy.

441
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,520
I'll be there.

442
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,720
I'm sorry.

443
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,520
Okay.

444
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,120
I'm sorry.

445
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,920
Why am I like this?

446
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,520
I thought you were going to cancel the class.

447
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,520
Honestly, you must be uncomfortable.

448
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,320
I'm uncomfortable to see you like this.

449
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,120
I...

450
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,120
I...

451
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,120
I'm broken.

452
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,120
I...

453
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,520
I think I like you.

454
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,120
I...

455
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,120
Thank you.

456
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,720
I...

457
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,520
Su.

458
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,920
Don't cancel it.

459
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,120
I'll cancel it.

460
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,520
I'm leaving.

461
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,720
Su.

462
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,720
Su.

463
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,120
What a fool.

464
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,520
I didn't expect this.

465
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,720
Su.

466
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,520
I'm done.

467
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,520
I'm done.

468
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,520
I don't need to go.

469
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,920
I'm fine.

470
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,520
What's wrong with you?

471
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,720
I know. I'm fine.

472
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,720
What?

473
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,720
Su.

474
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,120
So you want to do my interview?

475
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,520
Yes.

476
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,120
Shin A-gi's concept is

477
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,920
the handsome and the handsome guy.

478
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,520
I'm sure you think

479
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,920
he's the most suitable for that concept.

480
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,120
For your information,

481
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,320
the oldest student

482
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,320
is a middle school student.

483
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,320
He's very famous,

484
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,920
but he's already in class.

485
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,720
Come on.

486
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,520
Hyun-yu!

487
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,520
Thank you.

488
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,720
He was my first love.

489
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,520
It's been a while.

490
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,520
Why are you here?

491
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,520
I'm reading the book of the opening of the new book.

492
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,520
But someone seems to be talented here.

493
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:08,520
It's been a long time. How long has it been?

494
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:13,520
It's been six years since you moved.

495
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,520
I'm not six years old.

496
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,520
Just like that.

497
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,520
Can you give me a star star?

498
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,520
Oh.

499
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,520
He must be really famous.

500
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,520
He's handsome.

501
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,520
Why are you looking for that?

502
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,520
I'm curious.

503
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,520
But you're much more handsome.

504
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,520
You're going to do it, right?

505
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,520
No, I'm not.

506
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,520
It's okay.

507
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,520
It's not easy to have this opportunity.

508
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,520
You should promote Handsome Dolphin.

509
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,520
You should be the leader.

510
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,520
Oh, my.

511
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,520
But why don't you tell me anything?

512
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,520
Why don't you tell me?

513
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,520
Is it because I'm too young?

514
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,520
Is it because I'm a baby face?

515
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,520
Hey, give me some feedback.

516
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,520
It's been a long time.

517
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,520
Really?

518
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,520
Did you come back?

519
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,520
No, I just came back from the office.

520
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,520
What?

521
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,520
Then, shall we go?

522
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,520
Can you tell me something?

523
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:10,520
I was curious about how you were in America.

524
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,520
I don't think we were close enough to ask each other.

525
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,520
I guess I heard about it when I was young.

526
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,520
I think I heard about it when I was young.

527
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,520
I think I heard about it when I was young.

528
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,520
Actually, I've been in a lot of trouble.

529
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,520
I felt like I was getting away from you because of me.

530
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:58,520
But I don't have any other feelings for you anymore.

531
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,520
I've been serious about it.

532
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:08,520
And now I'm not the real brother anymore.

533
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:14,520
Why do you keep telling me that?

534
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,520
I always told you.

535
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,520
Here and there.

536
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,520
I'm sorry.

537
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,520
Excuse me.

538
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,520
Where is the address?

539
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,520
You can go to the left.

540
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,520
You're here.

541
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,520
You're here.

542
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,520
You're here.

543
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,520
You're here?

544
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,520
Yes.

545
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,520
Hello?

546
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,520
No.

547
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,520
I'm here.

548
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,520
What?

549
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,520
It smells like a spring.

550
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,520
Why are you wearing your hair?

551
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,520
It's spring.

552
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,520
We're not dating.

553
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,520
Guys, I'll go first.

554
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,520
What's wrong with him?

555
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,520
Who?

556
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,520
He's from the middle school.

557
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,520
He's a senior.

558
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,520
He was very famous since high school.

559
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,520
He was playing basketball in our school.

560
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,520
Jin Hyeon Ho, you've been in the school recently.

561
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,520
He's the one.

562
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,520
Jin Hyeon.

563
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,520
That's right.

564
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,520
Why are you with Yeol Yong?

565
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,520
Don't do that.

566
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,520
You look very close.

567
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,520
What's wrong with him?

568
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,520
He's the next-door brother.

569
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,520
He's not just an older brother.

570
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,520
He looks suspicious.

571
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,520
Why are you so detailed?

572
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,520
You look more suspicious.

573
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:11,520
Next, are you not the first love?

574
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,520
No, I'm not.

575
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,520
First love?

576
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,520
First love?

577
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,520
Where are you?

578
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,520
What's going on in our school?

579
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,520
I'm playing basketball with my friends.

580
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,520
I'm here to see you.

581
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,520
Do you come to play basketball often?

582
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:41,520
Yes.

583
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,520
But I'm not here to play basketball.

584
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,520
I just come here sometimes.

585
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,520
I came here when I was in the festival last year.

586
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,520
Festival?

587
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,520
I would be here, too.

588
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,520
If you're good, you might have hit me.

589
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,520
I wrote that to you.

590
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,520
What?

591
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,520
500TRIP.

592
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:21,520
500TRIP.

593
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,520
500TRIP.

594
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,520
500TRIP.

595
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,520
500TRIP.

596
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,520
500TRIP.

597
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,520
500TRIP.

598
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,520
500TRIP.

599
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,520
500TRIP.

600
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,520
You wrote that to me?

601
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,520
Yes.

602
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,520
I didn't think of it as you.

603
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,520
I thought of having a party with you

604
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:45,520
on Christmas.

605
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:49,520
I couldn't spend it with you.

606
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:51,520
I'm sorry.

607
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:57,520
You're not perfect.

608
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,520
You're the same as when you were young.

609
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,520
No, I'm 1cm taller.

610
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,520
What are you doing this weekend?

611
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,520
Me?

612
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,520
Nothing.

613
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,520
Why?

614
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,520
I'm so tired.

615
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:27,520
Where are you going?

616
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,520
My gosh.

617
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,520
I've never been in this kind of place.

618
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,520
I guess you're famous for being on this kind of interview.

619
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:45,520
Okay.

620
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,520
Bani.

621
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,520
Why are you here?

622
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,520
I was in the middle of the class until I was in the middle of the class.

623
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,520
I was following you because you were going to interview me.

624
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,520
Then, the first...

625
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,520
You two can say hello.

626
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,520
Hello, I'm Nanko, the best friend of Bani.

627
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:07,520
Please take good care of the shoot today.

628
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,520
Please take good care of Bani.

629
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,520
Yes.

630
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,520
I'll start shooting now.

631
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,520
But the other person...

632
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,520
I'll be here.

633
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,520
I'll be here.

634
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,520
I'll be here.

635
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,520
I'm a little better at this store.

636
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,520
Wow.

637
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,520
Why are you coming here?

638
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,520
I'll be in the middle of the class.

639
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,520
I'll be here.

640
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,520
Business is good.

641
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,520
Business is good.

642
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,520
I heard that you're already receiving a lot of love calls

643
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,520
in the famous production.

644
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,520
How is it?

645
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:09,520
I heard that many of you are doing well in our work.

646
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,520
I'm grateful that you're here.

647
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,520
I'm curious about your goal of graduating

648
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,520
as you're already doing your career.

649
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,520
I think I'll focus on getting a team.

650
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:21,520
I want to be a self-produced person, not a foreign producer.

651
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:27,520
I want to be a single producer, not a single producer.

652
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,520
Yes, this is the last question.

653
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,520
Are you two...

654
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,520
Are you two dating?

655
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,520
First, Jae-hyeon.

656
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,520
No.

657
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:12,520
I think you're popular at school.

658
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,520
Why don't you date?

659
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:19,520
I just want to focus on my work.

660
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,520
Then, Hyun-joo.

661
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,520
I'll go first.

662
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,520
What about you, Hyun-ho?

663
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,520
I've never dated anyone.

664
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,520
That's a bit unexpected.

665
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:43,520
I've never liked anyone besides working out.

666
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,520
Just one person.

667
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,520
Except for the first love.

668
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:00,520
First love.

669
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,520
First love.

670
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,520
First love.

671
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,520
You've worked hard today.

672
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,520
I'll pay for the pay this week.

673
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,520
Yes.

674
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:33,520
And this.

675
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,520
It's a ticket to the Han River.

676
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:39,520
If you have a good person, go to the date.

677
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:41,520
Thank you.

678
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:50,520
Do you want to go with me tomorrow?

679
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:07,520
I don't think so.

680
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:41,520
Just one person.

681
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,520
Except for the first love.

682
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,520
Do you want to go with me tomorrow?

683
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,520
I don't think so.

684
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,520
I want to go.

685
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,520
You can come down here.

686
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:15,520
Yes.

687
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,520
Okay.

688
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:27,520
Thank you.

689
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:41,520
I'm sorry.

690
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,520
Dong-ha, where are you going with me tomorrow?

691
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,520
I'm sorry, but I'm going to the mountain tomorrow.

692
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,520
The movie is starting.

693
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:17,520
I'm hanging up.

694
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:41,520
Dong-ha.

695
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,520
Dong-ha.

696
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,520
Dong-ha.

697
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,520
Hello.

698
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:06,520
Do you like playing cards?

699
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:15,300
Click clickこの

700
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,640
Shouldn't you eat me?

701
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:42,620
Online meals aren't as Sisters mentioned!

702
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,600
We're still eating like that.

703
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,720
Why do I have to eat this part?

704
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,520
Eat as soon as possible.

705
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,420
It's exactly like how when you ate it at her place.

706
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,600
Is it the same?

707
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,160
Yeah, very different.

708
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,520
Are you in a relationship?

709
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,520
First, Jaeyeol.

710
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,200
No.

711
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,400
I still have feelings for you.

712
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:35,080
Did you change your mind?

713
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:37,040
What?

714
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,640
You have a very different style.

715
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:43,840
You used to be my ideal type.

716
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:48,760
What do you mean?

717
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,480
You were born with that?

718
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,480
You like me.

719
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,800
I was just young.

720
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,600
Eat slowly.

721
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:06,520
Eat slowly.

722
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,800
Hey.

723
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,400
Why do I have to be with you in the middle of the day?

724
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,720
I told you.

725
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:15,720
Let's get on the train.

726
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,520
I didn't know it was true.

727
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:22,960
It's not like we're really on the train together.

728
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:23,960
It's okay.

729
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,080
If you follow me, I'll stop talking and get on the train.

730
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,080
Fry's delicious.

731
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:52,960
Well.

732
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:56,080
Your intentions were different.

733
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:09,240
Strange, you scream the same way you did in the first contract.

734
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,160
You give us three minutes to finish everything.

735
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:13,080
I'm making sure we're at just in time.

736
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:15,760
And we should not loose hahaha.

737
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:30,300
There are 3 of max점, are you sure?

738
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:31,780
The rest of them.

739
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:34,380
I can see that you were trying to help.

740
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:36,500
as a woman,

741
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:39,140
of course,

742
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:48,420
nyaa

743
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:51,700
Wearsa

744
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:53,100
wearsa

745
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:54,860
wearsa

746
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:05,940
If you're the black one,

747
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:07,400
I will soon find another.

748
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,520
I already forgot.

749
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:14,180
progressing

750
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:16,180
interpret

751
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:17,680
that

752
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:19,560
everything

753
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:20,380
happened

754
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:23,020
Thank you day and night, dear.

755
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:35,380
