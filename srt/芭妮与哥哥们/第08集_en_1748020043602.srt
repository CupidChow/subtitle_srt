00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,780
September 20!

00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,820
Our living room Xила

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,340
The websites and videos that filled my sleeping Storage

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,460
Album which 139g

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,340

аем Cruz

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,400
Remarkable ver.

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,140
The way I went to you

11
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,980
The cool breeze

12
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,580
And the clear sky

13
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,420
I'm feeling a little nervous

14
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,180
I can feel it

15
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:57,220
Every moment is so hard

16
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:03,220
The male lead came up

17
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,220
Please introduce yourself

18
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:10,220
Hello, I'm Cha Ji-won, the assistant and workman

19
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:18,220
Are you the one who used to know?

20
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,220
Yes, I'm the half-jjak-hub

21
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:26,220
Ji-won came up like this

22
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,220
You can't just let it go, right?

23
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,220
Yes

24
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,220
Ji-won's sincerity

25
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,220
I hope it's a good gift for you

26
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,220
10 seconds i-contact

27
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,220
How about it?

28
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,220
Yes

29
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,220
Then shall we count together for 10 seconds?

30
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,220
10 seconds

31
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,220
10 seconds

32
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,220
10 seconds

33
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:02,220
The shining, the beautiful memory

34
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,220
What's up?

35
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,220
Then are we going to be together from today?

36
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,220
Oh, no, we're going to be together from the beginning of the month

37
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,220
It's weird to not be together

38
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,220
We're late, so let's just organize it briefly

39
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,220
Let's do the rest tomorrow

40
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,220
Oppa

41
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,220
But why are you on the stage?

42
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:34,220
That's because I wrote it

43
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,220
Really, you wrote it?

44
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,220
You keep looking bad from before

45
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,220
What's the big deal?

46
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,220
I left it at home when I was sleeping

47
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,220
Why didn't you tell me?

48
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,220
I told you

49
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,220
That friend

50
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,220
Where was it?

51
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,220
Eun-young

52
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,220
Oh, the taxi

53
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,220
I heard you came

54
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,220
Yes, I'll be right there

55
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,220
Yes, I'll be right there

56
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,220
I'll be right there

57
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,220
Why are you here?

58
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,220
You're not even a student?

59
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,220
I'm here to help you

60
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,220
Why did you go up on the stage?

61
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,220
That card

62
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,220
You didn't write it

63
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,220
Why do you think it's not?

64
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,220
Or

65
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,220
Did you write it?

66
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,220
Yes

67
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,220
You don't have to listen to me

68
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,220
If you wrote a deep confession

69
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,220
And you can't appear in front of me

70
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,220
At least that's where you're sincere

71
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,220
I'm sorry

72
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,220
You seem to have changed

73
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,220
You seem to have crossed the line

74
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,220
To be a good friend

75
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:46,220
Yes, crossing the line

76
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,220
I was looking at you

77
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,220
But I couldn't let you meet a guy like that

78
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,220
So

79
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,220
I'm going to go

80
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,220
To you

81
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,220
I'm going to go

82
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,220
Bani

83
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,220
Let's talk

84
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,220
What are you talking about?

85
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,220
I don't think I have anything to say

86
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,220
Call me when you have time

87
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,220
I'll be waiting

88
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,220
I'm going to go

89
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,220
Hello

90
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,220
Can you find me like this?

91
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,220
You picked me like this

92
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,220
You can't be attracted to me

93
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,220
Yes

94
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,220
I'm serious

95
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,220
I'm going to be a good friend

96
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,220
I'm going to be a good friend

97
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,220
How about 10 seconds?

98
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,220
Start

99
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,220
9

100
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,220
8

101
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,220
I'm looking at you

102
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:34,220
But I couldn't let you meet a guy like that

103
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,220
I couldn't let you meet a guy like that

104
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,220
So

105
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,220
I'm going to go

106
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,220
To Bani

107
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,220
5

108
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,220
6

109
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,220
7

110
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,220
8

111
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,220
9

112
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,220
10

113
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,220
11

114
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,220
12

115
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,220
13

116
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,220
14

117
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,220
15

118
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,220
16

119
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,220
17

120
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,220
18

121
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,220
19

122
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,220
20

123
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,220
21

124
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,220
21

125
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,220
21

126
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,220
Yes

127
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,220
I'm going to be a good friend

128
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,220
I'm going to be a good friend

129
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,220
I'm going to be a good friend

130
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,220
Thank you

131
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,220
Please come back soon

132
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,220
Thank you

133
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,220
Thank you

134
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,220
Thank you

135
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,220
It took two hours to get it all organized

136
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,220
I know

137
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,220
I'm sure it took longer if you didn't help me

138
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,220
Thank you

139
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,220
No, thank you

140
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,220
Thank you

141
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,220
Thank you

142
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,220
What?

143
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,220
Where did the equipment camera we had here go?

144
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,220
I took it yesterday because Yori said she'd transfer the data

145
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,220
Really?

146
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,220
No

147
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,220
Why?

148
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,220
Oh, the camera we took for our SNS photo shoot

149
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,220
I'll call Yori and tell her to bring it

150
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,220
I'll go get it

151
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,220
Didn't Yori say she'll transfer the data she took for the festival?

152
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,220
She'll be so proud of it

153
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,220
But it's not like she'll be able to make it

154
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,220
Oh, then I'll ask her to do it

155
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,220
No

156
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,220
But

157
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,220
Do you have to go?

158
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,220
What?

159
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,220
With the camera

160
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,220
You can go with someone else

161
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,220
Oh

162
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,220
I heard there's something to talk about while I'm going to the camera

163
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,220
I think I should go and listen to it

164
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,220
Bani

165
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,220
Don't meet a man who makes you confused

166
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,220
Bani

167
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,220
Bani

168
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,220
Bani

169
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,220
Bani

170
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,220
Bani

171
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,220
Bani

172
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,220
Bani

173
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,220
Bani

174
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,220
Bani

175
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,220
Bani

176
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,220
Bani

177
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,220
Bani

178
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,220
I was so upset yesterday

179
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,220
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

180
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,220
Wow

181
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,220
The studio is better than I thought

182
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,220
How did you come here?

183
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,220
I heard from Ho-dong

184
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:05,220
I think it's over

185
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,220
I'm the only one who's at the right timing

186
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,220
I have nothing to do with you

187
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,220
Just go

188
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,220
Why?

189
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,220
I'll just eat this

190
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,220
It was hard because of the festival

191
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,220
We just thought we'd just be free

192
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,220
If you don't go, I'll go out

193
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,220
Open up

194
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,220
Okay

195
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,220
Let's just listen to it since you're here again

196
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,220
What's your private matter?

197
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,220
Huh?

198
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,220
You said I'm not good

199
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,220
You said you don't like me

200
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,220
I don't know what you mean

201
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,220
While I was thinking about the stars

202
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,220
You've changed your mind

203
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,220
I knew it

204
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,220
You wanted to break up with me

205
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,220
I didn't know that

206
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,220
I was in the studio all day

207
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,220
Okay

208
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,220
Let's not talk about it

209
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,220
Why did I do that to you?

210
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,220
What did I do wrong to you?

211
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,220
I think I'll live on my own

212
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,220
Why are you so stubborn?

213
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,220
I'm sorry

214
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,220
I didn't know you'd be so hard

215
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,220
I just...

216
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,220
I just thought it was our business

217
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,220
So tell me

218
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,220
What's your private matter?

219
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,220
Look

220
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,220
You don't want to tell me anyway

221
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,220
You're still thinking about me like this

222
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,220
You wanted to break up with me

223
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,220
Don't laugh

224
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,220
I won't

225
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,220
go back to the beginning

226
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:56,220
Let's talk

227
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,220
I don't think I'll talk to you here

228
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,220
Call me when you have time

229
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,220
I'll be waiting

230
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,220
Are you here to see Yeol?

231
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,220
I'm looking for something

232
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,220
I'm going

233
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,220
Oh

234
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,220
Are you here to see Yeol?

235
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,220
I'm looking for something

236
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,220
I'm looking for this

237
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,220
I'm going to find it

238
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,220
Excuse me, Heejin

239
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,220
Do you...

240
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,220
Do you like Yeol?

241
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,220
What?

242
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:20,220
We were apart for a while because of a love affair

243
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,220
We broke up completely

244
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,220
Yeol

245
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,220
She'll come back to me soon

246
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:37,220
I think it would be good for you to be sure

247
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,220
What if she doesn't come back?

248
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,220
What?

249
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,220
That's just a lie

250
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,220
I'll tell you what I think

251
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,220
I'll tell you what I think

252
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,220
I'll tell you what I think

253
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:39,220
We were apart for a while because of a love affair

254
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,220
We broke up completely

255
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,220
Yeol

256
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,220
She'll come back to me soon

257
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,220
Yeol

258
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,220
She'll come back to me soon

259
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,220
Yeol

260
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,220
She'll come back to me soon

261
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,220
Yeol

262
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,220
She'll come back to me soon

263
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,220
Yeol

264
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,220
She'll come back to me soon

265
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,220
Yeol

266
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,220
She'll come back to me soon

267
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,220
Yeol

268
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,220
She'll come back to me soon

269
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,220
Yeol

270
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,220
Haneul

271
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,220
Oh?

272
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,220
Hey

273
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,220
What brings you here?

274
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,220
I came to pick you up

275
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,220
Up to here?

276
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,220
Yes

277
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,220
I want to go to school with you

278
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,220
What?

279
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,220
Did you have a perfume?

280
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,220
Uh...

281
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,220
Why?

282
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,220
Don't you like it?

283
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,220
No

284
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,220
It's so good

285
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,220
I'm glad

286
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,220
I came here because I was curious

287
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,220
Did you talk well yesterday?

288
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,220
Ah...

289
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,220
I was a little angry

290
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,220
Ah...

291
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,220
I was angry

292
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,220
I didn't meet you

293
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,220
Wait

294
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,220
I'm leaving

295
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,220
Thank you

296
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,220
Let's go

297
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,220
Oh?

298
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,220
Hello

299
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,220
Yes

300
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,220
Yes

301
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,220
Did you borrow this book?

302
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,220
I was looking for this book too

303
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,220
Oh, I see

304
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:29,220
But unfortunately, you can only borrow one book

305
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:33,220
Unlike people, you can't let go of your work at the same time

306
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,220
Pardon?

307
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:38,220
I think it'll be hard to take care of this book for a second

308
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,220
I don't think I can afford to take care of this

309
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,220
Then

310
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,220
Uh...

311
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,220
But

312
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,220
Don't worry too much

313
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,220
I'm good at reading

314
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,220
I'll read it quickly and let you go

315
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,220
This time, I'll read it quickly

316
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:16,220
Oh, this time, I think I really liked the response from the staff

317
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,220
Thank you

318
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:22,220
If you're okay, I'd like to treat you to a meal

319
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,220
Oh

320
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,220
I like it too

321
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,220
But I have someone to see today

322
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,220
Then I'll have a meal next time

323
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,220
Yes

324
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,220
Then take care of yourself

325
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,220
Yes

326
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,220
What if you leave yesterday?

327
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,220
It's school

328
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,220
I'll wait

329
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,220
Hey, hey

330
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,220
Hey, hey

331
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,220
Hey, hey

332
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,220
Hey, hey

333
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,220
Hey, hey

334
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,220
Hey, hey

335
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,220
Hey, hey

336
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,220
Hey, hey

337
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,220
Hey, hey

338
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,220
Hey

339
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,220
Did you see this?

340
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,220
I got a visa

341
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,220
Hey, hey

342
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,220
Wait a minute

343
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,220
Really

344
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,220
Thank you

345
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,220
Hey

346
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,220
Did you see this article?

347
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,220
What should I do?

348
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,220
What should I do?

349
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,220
I'm sorry

350
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,220
I just...

351
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:16,220
I just thought that was just a matter of our lives

352
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,220
So tell me

353
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,220
What's the situation?

354
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,220
Is it over?

355
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,220
Here?

356
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,220
It's over

357
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,220
Where are you, Yeoreum?

358
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,220
Are you okay?

359
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,220
The company is in a mess

360
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,220
They're all looking for you

361
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,220
I'm sorry

362
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,220
Yeoreum

363
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,220
Yeoreum

364
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,220
I knew that

365
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,220
I saw you

366
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,220
How can you not open it?

367
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,220
Really?

368
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,220
Really

369
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,220
It's really amazing

370
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,220
I guess I saw you

371
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,220
Yeoreum

372
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,220
Let's go

373
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,220
Yeoreum

374
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,220
What should I do with Yeoreum?

375
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,220
She's in a big trouble

376
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,220
Why?

377
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,220
Didn't you see the article?

378
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,220
Yeoreum

379
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,220
was in a big mess

380
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,220
She's in a mess because of that

381
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,220
Can we broadcast this?

382
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,220
We should watch it after it's over

383
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,220
Our assignment is not over

384
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:55,220
We were apart for a while because of our relationship

385
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,220
We broke up completely

386
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,220
Yeoreum

387
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,220
will come back to me

388
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,220
Yeoreum

389
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,220
Let's go

390
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,220
Yeoreum

391
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,220
Are you okay?

392
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,220
Hane

393
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,220
Are you okay?

394
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,220
Are you okay?

395
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,220
Are you okay?

396
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,220
Are you okay?

397
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,220
Yes

398
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,220
I'm okay

399
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,220
Are you okay?

400
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,220
Are you okay?

401
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,220
Are you okay?

402
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,220
I'm not okay

403
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,220
Look

404
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,220
Did you get a headache?

405
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,220
I didn't get a headache

406
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,220
That's a relief

407
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,220
You're really okay, right?

408
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,220
Yes

409
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,220
I'm not okay

410
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,220
I'm okay

411
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,220
You're not going to come to the press conference

412
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,220
Stay here

413
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,220
So it turned out to be like this

414
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,220
to you

415
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,220
I thought you could hide it

416
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,220
I'm sorry

417
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,220
The test is over

418
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,220
Let's eat more

419
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,220
What do you want to eat?

420
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,220
And

421
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,220
This

422
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,220
What is this?

423
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,220
Open it

424
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,220
Open it

425
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,220
What's wrong?

426
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,220
Are you not feeling well?

427
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,220
No

428
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,220
I'm fine

429
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,220
What?

430
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,220
You thought you didn't like it

431
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,220
and you were surprised

432
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,220
But, Yeol

433
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,220
What should I do?

434
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,220
I forgot the present

435
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,220
I'll give it to you when we meet again

436
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,220
Okay

437
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,220
Please take care of it

438
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,220
Are you here to talk about that?

439
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,220
Then what should I do?

440
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,220
I don't have a hole to make money

441
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,220
I've been working for a year

442
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,220
and my mom took care of it

443
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,220
I really don't have money

444
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,220
I don't have money

445
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,220
You have a boyfriend

446
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,220
and Yeol is a good friend of yours

447
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,220
Mom!

448
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,220
Just try it

449
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,220
What do you want to do with a person?

450
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,220
Please take care of it

451
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,220
Please

452
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,220
Please

453
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,220
How can I take care of it?

454
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,220
Please

455
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,220
Please

456
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,220
Mom

457
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,220
I'm sorry

458
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,220
Come here

459
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,220
Are you crazy?

460
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,220
You said you just did it

461
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,220
Mom

462
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,220
I'm going to break up with Yeol

463
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,220
So

464
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,220
I'll lend you one more time

465
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,220
and make money from you

466
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,220
It's really the same as me

467
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,220
Okay?

468
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,220
You

469
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,220
Don't contact me again

470
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,220
I'll tell you

471
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,220
It's not like you're doing this all of a sudden

472
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,220
Just

473
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:07,220
You're too mean to me

474
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,220
What?

475
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,220
I don't like

476
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,220
you being with me

477
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,220
I went to the countryside

478
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,220
and studied for an exam

479
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,220
I only did part-time job

480
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,220
Then what about the exchange student?

481
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,220
That was a excuse

482
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,220
You were having a hard time

483
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,220
I was having a hard time

484
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,220
and you never told me

485
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,220
I didn't want to

486
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,220
be the one to be

487
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,220
I didn't want to see you

488
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,220
as much as I did

489
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,220
Then

490
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,220
I thought I wouldn't be able to endure it

491
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,220
I was going to be the one to be

492
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,220
the one to be

493
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,220
the one to be

494
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,220
the one to be

495
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,220
Don't look so pitiful

496
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,220
I'm really okay now

497
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,220
I didn't do anything wrong

498
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,220
I'm going to go to the beach

499
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,220
and most importantly

500
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:55,220
You came to me like this

501
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,220
I'm different from back then

502
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,220
I'm not leaving you again

503
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,220
with this kind of thing

504
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,220
I'm frustrated

505
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,220
Yeol

506
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:26,220
Shall we go to the windmill?

507
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,220
Just once

508
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,220
I'm sorry

509
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,220
7

510
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,220
9

511
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,220
8

512
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,220
7

513
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,220
6

514
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,220
7

515
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,220
8

516
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,220
9

517
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,220
10

518
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,220
11

519
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,220
10

520
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,220
Why?

521
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,220
What?

522
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,220
What are you doing?

523
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,220
You

524
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,220
I was looking at you

525
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,220
I'm sorry

526
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,220
for hurting you

527
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,220
and I'm thankful

528
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,220
If you're so thankful

529
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,220
let's eat together

530
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,220
What?

531
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,220
Let's go

532
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,220
to eat something delicious on the weekend

533
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,220
Bani

534
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,220
Bani

535
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,220
We were so cute

536
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,220
Right?

537
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,220
Bani

538
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,220
Yeol

539
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,220
Can I just listen to you?

540
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,220
What do you think?

541
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,220
We're going to go to school from now on

542
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,220
Oh, over there

543
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,220
Let's take classes together

544
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,220
and eat together after class

545
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,220
It's not the same thing

546
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,220
but can you stick to it?

547
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,220
What?

548
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:55,220
Didn't you ask me to follow you?

549
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,220
It's like a drama

550
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,220
and you're like a cc

551
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,220
I saw you doing it

552
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,220
Really?

553
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,220
I can't do it

554
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,220
I can't do it

555
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,220
I should beat him

556
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,220
How is it?

557
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,220
It's pretty

558
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:38,220
Eat it

559
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,220
Eat it

560
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,220
It's late

561
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,220
Let's go

562
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:13,220
Let's go

563
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,220
Let's go

564
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,220
Bani

565
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,220
Bani

566
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,220
Let's go

567
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,220
Let's go again

568
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,220
Bani

569
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,220
Go to bed here today

570
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,220
I have to eat something simple

571
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,220
with the ice cream

572
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,220
What about you?

573
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,220
I have to go to the studio

574
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,220
and go to bed

575
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,220
Oh, nice

576
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,220
Bani, you're here?

577
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,220
Yes

578
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,220
Bani

579
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,220
What?

580
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,220
Why are you so sad today?

581
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:46,220
It's my wedding anniversary

582
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:49,220
I always said that I'll make a good wedding

583
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,220
but I have to do something on this day

584
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,220
I'll make some broth

585
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,220
I'm sure you'll like it

586
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,220
What?

587
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,220
Yes

588
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,220
What?

589
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,220
What?

590
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,220
What?

591
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,220
What's wrong?

592
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,220
What?

593
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:22,220
Your voice and

594
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,220
your bad tone

595
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,220
Are you okay?

596
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,220
Bani

597
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,220
Bani

598
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,220
Bani

599
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,220
Bani

600
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,220
I'm not feeling well

601
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,220
I'm so sad

602
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,220
I can't take it anymore

603
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:04,220
I can only watch you

604
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:08,220
I can't put my memories in

605
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:11,220
The glass in the water

606
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:15,220
is breaking

607
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:24,220
The wind is blowing

608
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,220
Bani

609
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,220
Did you sleep so comfortably?

610
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,220
Sorry

611
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,220
We had breakfast together

612
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,220
and we had a fight

613
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:57,220
I'll go home and sleep

614
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,220
Are you okay?

615
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,220
Yes

616
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,220
The beach doctor is out

617
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:08,220
and I'm feeling a bit sleepy

618
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,220
So

619
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,220
you should go home

620
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:31,220
I wanted to go somewhere after dinner

621
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,220
Let's go after dinner

622
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,220
I wanted to go somewhere after dinner

623
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,220
Let's go after dinner

624
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:01,220
Why are you here?

625
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,220
I wanted to leave the turntable

626
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,220
I thought I didn't have it

627
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:11,220
It's okay

628
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:12,220
Why?

629
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:14,220
I wanted to buy you a birthday present

630
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,220
but I couldn't

631
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,220
I was so upset

632
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,220
Excuse me

633
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:30,220
Can I have a package?

634
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,220
Yes, you can

635
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,220
It's nice to be out in the weekend

636
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,220
You can talk anytime

637
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:56,220
So cute

638
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:00,220
Oh, I bought it

639
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:09,220
Bani, what are you going to do?

640
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:10,220
This?

641
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,220
Can I buy only one?

642
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:14,220
I think it'll be over soon

643
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:16,220
Okay, then

644
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,220
With this?

645
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,220
Yes

646
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,220
I'll pay for it

647
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:20,220
Okay

648
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:30,220
Bani

649
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:37,220
It's raining a lot

650
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:39,220
Wait a minute

651
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:41,220
I'll buy you a umbrella

652
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:00,220
I'm hungry

653
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:02,220
Let's go for dinner

654
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:24,220
You must be hungry

655
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:26,220
Let's go eat

656
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,220
Okay, I like it

657
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:31,220
Let's go

658
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:47,220
Is the cake good?

659
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:49,220
I made a reservation

660
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:51,220
to go to the place we went every time

661
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:55,220
What are you thinking about?

662
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:00,220
Bani

663
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:24,220
It's so pretty here

664
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:26,220
It's so nice here

665
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:27,220
Really?

666
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:35,220
Hello

667
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:39,220
We meet again

668
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:44,220
I'm sorry

669
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:46,220
I think we made a mistake

670
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:48,220
Now that I checked

671
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:52,220
There's only 4 people left

672
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:56,220
Would you mind

673
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:59,220
if I were your friend?

674
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:05,220
Do you want to go somewhere else?

675
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,220
No

676
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:09,220
I'm fine

677
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,220
I'll be there

678
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:20,220
Bani

679
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:29,220
Enjoy your meal

680
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:31,220
Bani, try this too

681
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:34,220
Okay, thank you

682
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:36,220
Heejin

683
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:38,220
I think it'll be nice

684
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:41,220
You're a good boyfriend

685
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:43,220
because you're so kind

686
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:52,220
I've felt this before

687
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,220
I think you two

688
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:56,220
look good together

689
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:59,220
You're a couple

690
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,220
I'm proud of you

691
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:04,220
because you're my couple

692
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:10,220
I think you two

693
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:14,220
meet when you first meet

694
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:16,220
me and Yeori

695
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:18,220
I think we meet

696
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:27,220
Hold on

697
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:29,220
Wash this first

698
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:40,220
I need to go to the bathroom

699
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:48,220
Let's go to the bathroom

700
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:01,220
What is this?

701
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:06,220
Bani

702
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:11,220
I'm so bad

703
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:18,220
Bani

704
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,220
Are you dating her?

705
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:28,220
Don't

706
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:30,220
I don't want you to date her

707
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:35,220
You know you're over the line

708
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:38,220
No matter how much I'm dating her

709
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:40,220
It doesn't matter

710
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:45,220
Why are you so caring?

711
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:48,220
Why do you keep running

712
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:50,220
and keep being like this?

713
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:52,220
Why do you keep getting upset?

714
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:57,220
I'm really

715
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:00,220
going crazy because of you

716
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:10,220
So

717
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:14,220
let's stop caring about each other

718
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:17,220
Let's not get into each other's business

719
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:39,220
Are you okay?

720
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:40,220
Yes

721
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:42,220
I think I can take it off

722
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:47,220
I'm sorry

723
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,220
It's okay

724
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:01,220
Bani

725
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:03,220
Let's go first

726
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:05,220
This is what you should wear

727
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,220
Yes, let's go

728
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:17,220
Let's go first

729
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:40,220
Are you going to eat?

730
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:43,220
It's going to be cold

731
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:46,220
I'm going to eat

732
00:52:57,220 --> 00:53:00,220
I told you to eat

733
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:02,220
It's not good

734
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:04,220
Why?

735
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:08,220
Because of Heejin?

736
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:10,220
Bani

737
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:14,220
Bani

738
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:20,220
You've been thinking about her

739
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:22,220
all day long

740
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:24,220
and you've been

741
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:26,220
feeling bad

742
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:28,220
because of her

743
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:30,220
I'm sorry

744
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:40,220
I'm really

745
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:46,220
Why are you making people so childish?

746
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:50,220
If you're going to do this

747
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:55,220
Don't ever come back

748
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:00,220
I know

749
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:05,220
I was wrong

750
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:10,220
I shouldn't have gone to you

751
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:21,220
You're right

752
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:26,220
I was next to you

753
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:29,220
I kept thinking about her

754
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:33,220
I thought about her

755
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:38,220
and I noticed

756
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:41,220
that she was more concerned

757
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,220
So

758
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:51,220
I'm going to be honest with her

759
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:53,220
Hey, Jaehyun

760
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:54,220
Me

761
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:59,220
I can't

762
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:02,220
feel anything

763
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:06,220
If you go like this

764
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:10,220
You know it's really over, right?

765
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:18,220
You know it too

766
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:21,220
You know it too

767
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:27,220
That we really ended

768
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:42,220
Yorim

769
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:50,220
One summer

770
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:00,220
I'm sorry

771
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:06,220
I didn't know it was that hard

772
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:11,220
and I was in danger

773
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:16,220
But

774
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:21,220
I can't go back to you anymore

775
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:29,220
So now we

776
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:37,220
really end

777
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:51,220
I'm sorry

778
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:21,220
I'm sorry

779
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:23,220
I'm sorry

780
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:49,220
There's a arcade near here

781
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:52,220
I'm going to play the game that Bani is good at

782
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,220
No

783
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:57,220
I haven't played it in a while

784
00:57:58,220 --> 00:57:59,220
Bani

785
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:21,220
Bani

786
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:43,220
Bani

787
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:47,220
Don't go

788
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:51,220
Bani

789
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:06,220
I'm sorry

790
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:08,220
I have to go

791
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:20,220
Bani

792
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:50,220
Bani

793
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:21,220
Earlier

794
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:26,220
I'm sorry I put you in that way

795
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:31,220
I said it with a lot of hesitation

796
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:35,220
But I really wanted to tell you

797
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:37,220
from the beginning to now

798
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:40,220
It was just one

799
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,220
Bani

800
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:48,220
I'm sorry

801
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:12,220
Bani

802
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:42,220
Bani

803
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:11,220
Bani

804
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:42,220
Bani

805
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:52,220
Okay

806
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:58,220
Say hello to my girlfriend

807
01:02:58,220 --> 01:03:01,220
There are a lot of people who look like us

808
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:03,220
So we're really good at playing games

809
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:04,220
How can you be here?

810
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:05,220
Bani

811
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:07,220
You should say hello to her like me too

812
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:09,220
What do you mean by this?

813
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:11,220
Bani

814
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:13,220
Bani is your boyfriend

815
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:15,220
Everyone thinks you're boyfriend

816
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:17,220
Why don't you date him?

817
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:20,220
Actually, I have a crush on him

818
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:21,220
Isn't he Bani?

819
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:23,220
Where is he?
