1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,180
Listen.

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:05,020
I'm going to meet the most handsome person now!

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,940
Did you say that?

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,260
You fool

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,560
that was starting to blend with a壦水

6
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:39,800
I promise.

7
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,640
You're taking on the life of people.

8
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,620
Search!

9
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,100
I'm passing through you.

10
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,560
Hey!

11
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,560
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,560
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,560
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,560
I'm really sorry.

15
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,560
Hey, stand there.

16
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,560
Don't stand there.

17
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,560
Are you okay?

18
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,560
What's the relationship between him and me?

19
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,560
Well, that's...

20
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,560
Should I call it a relationship between a couple?

21
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,560
I broke that person's tablet.

22
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,560
Anyway, it's not that nice of a relationship.

23
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,560
But me?

24
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,560
Do you know that person?

25
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,560
Oh.

26
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,560
Hey.

27
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,560
I was going to put it in first.

28
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,560
The person who put it in first is Lim Ja-an.

29
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,560
I'm similar to him.

30
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,560
I don't like it.

31
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,560
I'm hungry all of a sudden.

32
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,560
Shall we go to eat the special food we talked about?

33
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,560
This is a special food?

34
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,560
This is a special food?

35
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,560
It's delicious.

36
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,560
What's this?

37
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,560
It's different from the rice we ate together.

38
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,560
Of course.

39
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,560
If I were to tell you the rice,

40
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,560
should I collaborate with Lim's innocent hands and ears?

41
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,560
There was a place like this in school.

42
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,560
I've never eaten this delicious food before.

43
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,560
It's really unfair.

44
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,560
This is a school office, so you can come with the teachers.

45
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,560
I'm so good at making water-based food.

46
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,560
Lim gives me a little.

47
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,560
Let's be really close.

48
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,560
Yes.

49
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,560
Wow, you ate so deliciously.

50
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,560
I'll buy you coffee.

51
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,560
Hey, the coffee and rice are a set.

52
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,560
I'll drink coffee today.

53
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,560
Then I'll buy it next time.

54
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,560
Nice.

55
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,560
You did this, right?

56
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,560
Yes.

57
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,560
Then I'll buy you coffee.

58
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,560
Did you do this?

59
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,560
Yes, that's right.

60
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,560
Bani, how is it?

61
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,560
What?

62
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,560
Correct!

63
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,560
Model pose.

64
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,560
Model pose.

65
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,560
Ah, correct!

66
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,560
Advertising?

67
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,560
No, not that.

68
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,560
Don't you think this sculpture looks like me?

69
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,560
Are you trying to say that you look like me?

70
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,560
How can you say that?

71
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,560
It's so funny.

72
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,560
Let's go.

73
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,560
Why do you know that you're Cho Kangmin?

74
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,560
Don't you usually pretend to know?

75
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,560
You don't look good in real life.

76
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,560
You're just like a car.

77
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,560
I just ate.

78
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,560
Really?

79
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,560
Okay, I'll be right there.

80
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,560
Okay.

81
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,560
Bani, what should I do?

82
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,560
I think I should go right now.

83
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,560
I'll buy you coffee next time.

84
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,560
Sorry.

85
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,560
It's okay.

86
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,560
Hurry up and go.

87
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,560
I think you'll be in a hurry.

88
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,560
Is he your girlfriend

89
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,560
if he's your first love?

90
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,560
He's so mean.

91
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,560
It's easy to call me.

92
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,560
I've been looking for you for a long time.

93
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,560
It's not that I'm busy.

94
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,560
I'm not in the mood for the wrong thing.

95
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,560
Why?

96
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,560
Are you sorry for my back?

97
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,560
Yes.

98
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,560
Follow me.

99
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,560
I don't have a tablet.

100
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,560
I can't write.

101
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,560
Yes.

102
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,560
Right?

103
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,560
But

104
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,560
it's better to write

105
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,560
than to write my own writing.

106
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,560
I'm not the same person.

107
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,560
I'm the one who's the best at writing.

108
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,560
I'll write it carefully.

109
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,560
You know?

110
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,560
Yes, carefully.

111
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,560
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,560
I'm so sad.

113
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,560
Come in, Lee Su-up.

114
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,560
What's this?

115
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,560
Se-ra.

116
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,560
You want me to come in?

117
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,560
You can't do that.

118
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,560
I'm so dirty that I'm going to go home.

119
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,560
Wait.

120
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,560
Wasn't the pre-workout training until tomorrow?

121
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,560
What are you talking about?

122
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,560
It's until tomorrow.

123
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,560
Did I?

124
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,560
The food.

125
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,560
You eat well, right?

126
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,560
Of course.

127
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,560
The food here is really good.

128
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,560
Hello.

129
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,560
I'm going to go.

130
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,560
Yes, yes.

131
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,560
Go in.

132
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,560
Go in.

133
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,560
And this heart.

134
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,560
Heart, heart, heart.

135
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,560
I'm going to hide it.

136
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,560
Mom?

137
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,560
I guess you're busy.

138
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,560
I think I'm busier than the player.

139
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,560
I'm not even a coach.

140
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,560
I know.

141
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,560
I can't do that.

142
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,560
I have to go to the market tomorrow

143
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,560
and buy some food for you.

144
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,560
Bani, do you have anything you want to eat?

145
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,560
Me?

146
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,560
Yes.

147
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,560
I'm...

148
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,560
Dad.

149
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,560
Yes.

150
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,560
I...

151
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,560
Money...

152
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,560
Wait, wait.

153
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,560
Hello, hello.

154
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,560
Hey, there you are.

155
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,560
Yes, yes, yes.

156
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,560
I think we should raise our deposit.

157
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,560
How much?

158
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,560
I've been in debt for a long time.

159
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,560
About 3,000 won?

160
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,560
About 3,000 won?

161
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,560
By the way,

162
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,560
if you say that all of a sudden,

163
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,560
we have to save some money.

164
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,560
I'll discuss it with my wife.

165
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,560
I'll call you back this week.

166
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,560
Okay, okay.

167
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,560
Call me, Hee-jin.

168
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,560
Okay, bye.

169
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,560
Ms. Kim,

170
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,560
can you send me the deposit?

171
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,560
Yes.

172
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,560
What are you talking about?

173
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,560
It's not your house's name.

174
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,560
What are you going to do if you talk like this?

175
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,560
What were you talking about?

176
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,560
Money...

177
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,560
Gas!

178
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,560
Money gas!

179
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,560
What do you want to eat?

180
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,560
I want to eat money gas.

181
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,560
My mouth is watering.

182
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,560
What should I do?

183
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,560
I don't have a tablet.

184
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,560
I can't write.

185
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,560
I can't write.

186
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,560
I can't write.

187
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,560
You know that?

188
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,560
About 200,000 won?

189
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,560
You're a exhibitionist?

190
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,560
Then you'll see the exhibition and have a good life.

191
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,560
You have a lot of money.

192
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,560
I'll write it.

193
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,560
Han-il!

194
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,560
Are you okay?

195
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,560
Thank you.

196
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,560
Are you okay?

197
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,560
I'm fine.

198
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,560
Excuse me?

199
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,560
Yes?

200
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,560
What is it?

201
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,560
Why are you talking about the work?

202
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,560
Yes.

203
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,560
This is an exhibition.

204
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,560
It's because of your face that I can't breathe.

205
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,560
Excuse me?

206
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,560
Yes?

207
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,560
Can I take a picture of the work?

208
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,560
Oh, yes.

209
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,560
You can hold the flash.

210
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,560
If you take a picture of me,

211
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,560
you'll see a work that's more next to me than this work.

212
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,560
Oh,

213
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,560
I think this isn't the main work.

214
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,560
What?

215
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,560
No, no.

216
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,560
It's not like that.

217
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,560
This artist is different from the revolution.

218
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,560
I think there are many different works in one work.

219
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,560
I think you made it so that you can feel various emotions in one work.

220
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,560
It's very bright in some ways,

221
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,560
but in some ways,

222
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,560
it's very sad.

223
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,560
But I don't really take pictures of it.

224
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,560
You know about the work well.

225
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,560
Not like that.

226
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,560
I'm a fan of this artist.

227
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,560
You're a fan of the work well.

228
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,560
This artist will be an honor.

229
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,560
I'll take a lot of pictures with my eyes.

230
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,560
Thank you.

231
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,560
Yes.

232
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,560
Excuse me.

233
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,560
Yes.

234
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,560
I thought it would be too bad if I just went.

235
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,560
The coffee at the coffee shop in front of the stationery is delicious.

236
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,560
I'll be waiting.

237
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,560
What?

238
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,560
Is this a one-tip?

239
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,560
He really came here.

240
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,560
Oh?

241
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,560
Are you here?

242
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,560
Enjoy your meal.

243
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,560
Yes, thank you.

244
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,560
You're 26 years old, and your name is Jo Haram.

245
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,560
Oh, Jo Haram.

246
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,560
You were so sudden earlier.

247
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,560
I've never done this before.

248
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,560
No.

249
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,560
But the coffee here is really good.

250
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,560
That's a relief.

251
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,560
You were an assistant artist when you were an entertainer.

252
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,560
I was.

253
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,560
I was doing a great job explaining earlier.

254
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,560
No.

255
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,560
I'm a fan of your artist, so I don't know.

256
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,560
I was going to go to your school to recommend you this time, but I applied to go see it.

257
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,560
You must really like it.

258
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,560
Do you remember the work we saw earlier?

259
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,560
The title...

260
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,560
It was The Fate.

261
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,560
The money you ordered is here.

262
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,560
Today's main dish is the money.

263
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,560
I'll have a sandwich, bread, and salad.

264
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,560
Welcome back.

265
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,560
Welcome.

266
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,560
Welcome.

267
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,560
My daughter is here at such a great timing.

268
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,560
You said you wanted to have a pork cutlet.

269
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,560
Didn't you just do this?

270
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,560
Wow, I was really hungry.

271
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,560
Really? Hurry up and wash your hands and sit down.

272
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,560
Thank you for the food.

273
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,560
Enjoy your meal.

274
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,560
It looks delicious.

275
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,560
I'll start right away.

276
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,560
It's okay.

277
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,560
I'll do it.

278
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,560
Okay.

279
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,560
Dad, you're much stronger than me.

280
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,560
Why are you cutting it for me?

281
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,560
Baby, this is not a matter of strength, but a matter of love.

282
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,560
I decided on the moment I saw your mom.

283
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,560
I'll cut this woman's money forever.

284
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,560
Me?

285
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,560
You're the only one who's crying.

286
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,560
Oh, my.

287
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,560
I've never heard of it before.

288
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,560
How did you meet your parents?

289
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,560
My parents were...

290
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,560
very destined.

291
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,560
That's another fate.

292
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,560
Your dad has a lot of meaning.

293
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,560
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

294
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,560
I said I'd meet you.

295
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,560
I was waiting for you.

296
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,560
What a girlfriend.

297
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,560
You're not even talking.

298
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,560
Come here. I'm waiting for you.

299
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,560
Hey, hey.

300
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,560
You bastard.

301
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,560
Be careful.

302
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,560
I'm sorry.

303
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,560
I couldn't control my strength while I was in the service.

304
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,560
Oh, no.

305
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,560
I'm actually grateful.

306
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,560
Okay, then.

307
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,560
What?

308
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,560
What's wrong?

309
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,560
I'm sorry.

310
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,560
I'm sorry.

311
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,560
I like you.

312
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,560
What kind of fate is that?

313
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,560
What? It's not just a coincidence.

314
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,560
Listen.

315
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,560
I was passing by that moment, and you were practicing.

316
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,560
I got a ball that you hit wrong again.

317
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,560
The probability of all these coincidences falling down is...

318
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,560
How much will it be?

319
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,560
Hey.

320
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,560
I think it's right.

321
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,560
I don't know.

322
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,560
Let's eat pork cutlet.

323
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,560
I'll cut it for you.

324
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,560
Stay still.

325
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,560
What are you doing?

326
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,560
You did a good job.

327
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,560
It was a fate.

328
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,560
The title of that work.

329
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,560
Fate?

330
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,560
I wanted to talk to you in front of this work that made us meet.

331
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,560
Will you be my destiny forever?

332
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,560
No.

333
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,560
So?

334
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,560
When will I be sick?

335
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:24,560
How much did I have to suffer to have this dream?

336
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,560
I can't.

337
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,560
I'll be sick on purpose.

338
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,560
I'll be sick on purpose.

339
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,560
I'll be sick on purpose.

340
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,560
I'll be sick on purpose.

341
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,560
Was that the first time?

342
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,560
I'm sick on purpose.

343
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,560
I'll be sick on purpose.

344
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,560
I'll be sick on purpose.

345
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,560
I'll be sick on purpose.

346
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,560
I'll be sick on purpose.

347
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,560
You're pretty as you said.

348
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,560
But where's your class?

349
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,560
Can I go?

350
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,560
You're better off first than your class.

351
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,560
Damn.

352
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,560
I can't dry my hair.

353
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,560
You can't?

354
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,560
Oh, wait.

355
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,560
I'll be back.

356
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,560
Do you have a plate here?

357
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,560
I'll be back soon.

358
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,560
Come quickly.

359
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,560
The school is nice.

360
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,560
What's this?

361
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,560
Seriously.

362
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,560
Please get out of here.

363
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,560
Let's try this.

364
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,560
Are you okay?

365
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,560
Oh, yes.

366
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,560
It rained a lot last week, so it was a mess.

367
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,560
Thank you.

368
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,560
But the dust is all over my face.

369
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,560
Oh, it's okay.

370
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,560
I'm used to being excited.

371
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,560
Hyewon.

372
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,560
I'm sorry.

373
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,560
It's all new.

374
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,560
So who's going around like this?

375
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,560
But it's a relief that you're not all healed.

376
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,560
Are you close to my brother?

377
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,560
Why are you asking me that all of a sudden?

378
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,560
Why?

379
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,560
Can't I ask my brother's friend that?

380
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,560
Oh, right.

381
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,560
When did you change your name to your heart again?

382
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,560
Why?

383
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,560
You're the first person.

384
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,560
The woman you loved for the first time in your life.

385
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,560
Cha Hyewon can't stop her.

386
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,560
Why are you looking at me like that?

387
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,560
Huh?

388
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:54,560
No, it's just that you two are really close friends.

389
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,560
That's how it is.

390
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,560
As you can see, he's a lot more beautiful than me.

391
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,560
You got the time ticket, right?

392
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,560
I got it.

393
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,560
I'm sorry.

394
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,560
I'm sorry.

395
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,560
I'm sorry.

396
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,560
I'm sorry.

397
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,560
I'm sorry.

398
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,560
I'm sorry.

399
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,560
I'm sorry.

400
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,560
I'm sorry.

401
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,560
I'm sorry.

402
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,560
You got the time ticket, right?

403
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,560
It's three o'clock.

404
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:24,560
Brother, can you really go out with me just once?

405
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,560
I said I wouldn't do a meeting.

406
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,560
I knew you'd be suspicious.

407
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,560
Brother, it's a free price.

408
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,560
If you don't come in, the free price won't let you have a meeting.

409
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,560
Just once.

410
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,560
Brother, I'm really going to ask you this again.

411
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,560
So this time, just once.

412
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,560
What's wrong with you?

413
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,560
Did you even get your knees pulled?

414
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:53,560
No matter how handsome you are, you have to be a person like that.

415
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,560
Just once.

416
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,560
What?

417
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,560
I'm talking to you.

418
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,560
Where are you going?

419
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,560
Brother.

420
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,560
I'm not going.

421
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,560
Brother.

422
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,560
Where are you going?

423
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,560
Brother.

424
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,560
Hey, you.

425
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,560
Hey.

426
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,560
Why are you so surprised?

427
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,560
You're like a beggar or a thief.

428
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,560
Is it the right way to tell me something?

429
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,560
Did it get caught on me?

430
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,560
What?

431
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,560
No.

432
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,560
It was the way to go home.

433
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,560
I sent you $200 in the morning.

434
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,560
Did you check it?

435
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,560
It's been a 10-minute break.

436
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,560
I'm going to pay the rest of it.

437
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,560
What's wrong with your knees?

438
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,560
What?

439
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:44,560
Uh, this?

440
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,560
At least put this on.

441
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,560
Han Yong, it's okay.

442
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,560
It's okay.

443
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,560
Just wear it.

444
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,560
Oh, my.

445
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,560
It's really okay.

446
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,560
Then if you get dirty, you'll get a lot of money.

447
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,560
So you're going to wear that?

448
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,560
Yes.

449
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,560
I'm more handsome, so I'd rather wear this.

450
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,560
Hey, I won't get the money you can't throw away.

451
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:29,560
It's okay, right?

452
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:39,560
I'm just a big brother.

453
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:09,560
I'm sorry.

454
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,560
You too, fighting.

455
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:36,560
Fighting.

456
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,560
Hey, hey, you.

457
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,560
You.

458
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:48,560
Okay, okay.

459
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:09,560
I'm sorry.

460
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:19,560
I'm sorry.

461
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:49,560
Why is the sunlight breaking on top of that eyelashes?

462
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:59,560
Why are you touching that hair if you want it to be in front of you?

463
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:04,560
It's a mental disorder.

464
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:22,560
Let's not hide from that woman.

465
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,560
Here you go.

466
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,560
I'm going to close the door.

467
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:36,560
Yeah, take a look at the class.

468
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:42,560
But it's true that you're calling because of the break.

469
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,560
What are you talking about?

470
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:55,560
It just looks so fun.

471
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,560
What?

472
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,560
What's that for tomorrow's class?

473
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:11,560
Then you have to read this tomorrow?

474
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,560
Oh, Bo-bae.

475
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,560
Hey, what's wrong?

476
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,560
Did you get your arm hurt?

477
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,560
Oh, this?

478
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,560
A little bit ago.

479
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,560
The lab.

480
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,560
I thought I was really hurt.

481
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,560
Are you on your way to work?

482
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,560
Yeah, I'm not going to work today.

483
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,560
Hey, hold on a minute.

484
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,560
I'll go to the bathroom.

485
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,560
Okay, go ahead.

486
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,560
Thank you.

487
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,560
Okay.

488
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,560
What is this?

489
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,560
This is really...

490
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,560
What?

491
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,560
Did you hurt your arm?

492
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,560
What?

493
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:55,560
Oh.

494
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,560
The one who was a little bit impulsive.

495
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,560
When did you get like this?

496
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,560
Oh, that's...

497
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,560
I think I got hurt a lot.

498
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:10,560
I can't even breathe now.

499
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,560
I know.

500
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,560
I can't think of that.

501
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,560
I'm sorry.

502
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,560
No, it's not important to me.

503
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,560
Take care of yourself.

504
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,560
Yes.

505
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,560
It's good.

506
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,560
Last year, the art school students

507
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,560
drew such a beautiful wall.

508
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,560
Our students really liked it.

509
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,560
Please take care of yourself this time.

510
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,560
Yes.

511
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,560
I think you can work on the two of you

512
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,560
in one group.

513
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,560
Shall we start?

514
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,560
Yes.

515
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,560
With me.

516
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,560
Hey, you and I.

517
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,560
What?

518
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,560
I'm not going to be able to do it properly because I hurt my arm.

519
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,560
I'll do it.

520
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,560
I'll do it.

521
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,560
Oh, no, I can do it.

522
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,560
I'm doing this because I'm hurt.

523
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,560
It's going to be a lot easier.

524
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,560
What?

525
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,560
Why are you suddenly doing it well?

526
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:50,560
I'm not going to be responsible for it.

527
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,560
It's good.

528
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,560
I just said sit down.

529
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,560
I can do it with my two hands.

530
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,560
But what if you get hurt with your two arms?

531
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,560
Just sit down.

532
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:19,560
But you're too hard on your senior.

533
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,560
You've been doing a lot of my work.

534
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,560
I can do this much.

535
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:38,560
I'm going to be in trouble if I get hurt with my arm.

536
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,560
Should I just be honest with you now?

537
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,560
Oh, no.

538
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,560
I can't talk.

539
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,560
I can't talk.

540
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,560
Black.

541
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,560
Yes.

542
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,560
Hey, are you okay?

543
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,560
Are you okay?

544
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,560
Yeah, I'm okay.

545
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,560
What about you?

546
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:44,560
I'm totally okay.

547
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,560
You're okay, too?

548
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,560
Yes, I'm totally fine.

549
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,560
I'm totally fine.

550
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,560
Are you okay, too?

551
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,560
Yes, I'm totally fine.

552
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:30,560
So you must have lied.

553
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,560
You said you didn't want to compare yourself to me.

554
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,560
No, it's not that.

555
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,560
I wasn't trying to lie from the beginning.

556
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:47,560
But...

557
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,560
Of course.

558
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,560
But this...

559
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,560
Yeah, your arms are fine, but you have to work hard.

560
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:07,560
Hey, hey, hey, let's get out of here.

561
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,560
This place is too cramped.

562
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,560
Hurry up.

563
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,560
Oh, my.

564
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,560
Hey, Ani.

565
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,560
Hey, oppa.

566
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,560
Here.

567
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,560
Thank you.

568
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,560
Thank you so much back then.

569
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,560
If it weren't for you, Hye-won would have been in trouble.

570
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,560
Come on, it's fine if there's nothing.

571
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,560
I just pulled out a cup of coffee, but it's fine.

572
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,560
Are you a coffee too?

573
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,560
Oh, I can't drink coffee, so I'll have a round cup of tea.

574
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,560
You're like a lotus root.

575
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,560
Why?

576
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,560
How good round cup of tea is.

577
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:03,560
Oh, do you have that debt?

578
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,560
Oh, my.

579
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,560
I'm sure you'll pay for it.

580
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:15,560
I still have $180,000 left.

581
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,560
When will it be?

582
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,560
If I'm in a hurry, I'll...

583
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,560
I think I found it.

584
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,560
How to solve it.

585
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,560
You're going to go out with that?

586
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,560
Let's go.

587
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,560
Let's go.

588
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,560
Let's go.

589
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,560
Let's go.

590
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,560
Let's go.

591
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,560
Let's go.

592
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,560
Let's go.

593
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,560
Ani, it must be hard.

594
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:09,560
That's because you don't know about Bunny.

595
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,560
What's Bunny like?

596
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,560
pizzeria.

597
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,560
Yeah!

598
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,560
Yeah!

599
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,560
Yeah!

600
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,560
Yeah!

601
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,560
Yeah!

602
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,560
Yeah!

603
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,560
Yeah!

604
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,560
Yeah!

605
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,560
Yeah!

606
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,560
Yeah!

607
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,560
The power of the people of the tribe!

608
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,560
Power of the tribe.

609
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,560
Power of the tribe.

610
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,560
Do you want to hear it?

611
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,560
Half of it is...

612
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,560
Maybe it will be in the earth.

613
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,560
Oh, that's right.

614
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,560
Oh, it's because I don't know.

615
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,560
Look, look, look.

616
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,560
What is it?

617
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,560
Oh, hey, isn't that the blood...

618
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,560
Half?

619
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,560
Half?

620
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,560
What are you doing?

621
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,560
Yes, I'm passing the intersection.

622
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,560
I'm passing the intersection.

623
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,560
Oh, yeah!

624
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,560
Punch, punch.

625
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,560
I'm good at punching.

626
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,560
Oh, this is...

627
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,560
No, really, this is...

628
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,560
Oh, this is...

629
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,560
It's a good one.

There were so many fire�ores.

643
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,560
I really got this!

644
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,560
Are you a debt collector now?

645
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,560
Yes.

646
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,560
Then, what about you?

647
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,560
Hey,

648
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,560
the faster you clean the house, the better it will be.

649
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,560
Wait here for a moment.

650
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,560
We need to prepare the soup.

651
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,560
Excuse me!

652
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,560
Yeoreu!

653
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,560
What are you doing?

654
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,560
What is it?

655
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,560
Here.

656
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,560
What is this?

657
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,560
It's a tablet.

658
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,560
I paid for it, so it's not 2 million won anymore.

659
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,560
I don't need to pay for it.

660
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,560
Then,

661
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,560
I'm sorry for the time being.

662
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,560
Thank you.

663
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,560
Yes?

664
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,560
Shall we go?

665
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,560
Yes.

666
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,560
You were really cool earlier.

667
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,560
When you were on the phone.

668
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,560
Okay.

669
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,560
Eat.

670
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,560
Is this how you do it?

671
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,560
Wow,

672
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,560
the car is so different.

673
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,560
I've never driven a car before.

674
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,560
Again?

675
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,560
I won't be surprised.

676
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,560
I'll give you a ride if you have time.

677
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,560
I like driving.

678
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,560
Really?

679
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,560
Awesome.

680
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,560
You can go home.

681
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,560
What about the address?

682
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,560
Oh,

683
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,560
I heard that there are some friends nearby,

684
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,560
so you can come down there.

685
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,560
Okay.

686
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,560
I'll be back.

687
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,560
Okay.

688
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,560
Thank you.

689
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,560
I think you can come down there.

690
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,560
No.

691
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,560
If you're okay today,

692
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,560
do you want to eat with my friends?

693
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,560
Thank you.

694
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,560
What?

695
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,560
That amazing visual?

696
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:02,560
What?

697
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,560
Who?

698
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,560
He's handsome.

699
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,560
You're here.

700
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,560
This is my friend,

701
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,560
Bo-bae and Ho-nim.

702
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,560
Won-hee,

703
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,560
he's my junior.

704
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,560
Don't you know me?

705
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,560
Don't be a model.

706
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,560
You're so handsome,

707
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:24,560
so I don't know you.

708
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,560
I'm sorry.

709
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:26,560
I understand.

710
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,560
My friends are very excited.

711
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,560
It's okay.

712
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,560
It's just Ho-nim's business.

713
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,560
Ha-ri,

714
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:38,560
you're so handsome

715
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,560
that you don't know you're handsome.

716
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,560
I agree.

717
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,560
Okay.

718
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,560
I'll order food.

719
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,560
I was so hungry today.

720
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,560
I'm hungry.

721
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,560
Did you go out to get the tablet?

722
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,560
Did you think you could get it so fast?

723
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,560
How long did it take you to get it?

724
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,560
I was a little too much.

725
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,560
I was too much.

726
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:18,560
You've been working so hard.

727
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,560
What?

728
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,560
Do you want this?

729
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,560
Okay, eat a lot.

730
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,560
Why are you eating that?

731
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,560
I told you to eat it earlier.

732
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,560
You're making me eat it.

733
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,560
I'm not eating it.

734
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,560
It's six times.

735
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,560
Your ears are very sharp.

736
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,560
Wow.

737
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,560
It's turning.

738
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,560
What's this new face?

739
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,560
Are there two of them?

740
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:26,560
I think I've seen a lot of things.

741
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,560
I think I skipped everything.

742
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,560
No, it's not like that.

743
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,560
Who is it?

744
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:39,560
I'm the boss of the power station today.

745
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,560
I'm the boss of the power station.

746
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,560
I'm the boss of the power station.

747
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,560
Hey.

748
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:51,560
I broke the tablet that I saw.

749
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:54,560
Then, what about this person?

750
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,560
This person is...

751
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:04,560
I was a part-timer at the exhibition and I was on the phone.

752
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,560
I drank a cup of coffee.

753
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,560
What? Then you're a friend.

754
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:11,560
Then did your boyfriend appear?

755
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:12,560
What boyfriend?

756
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,560
Hey, you're going out again.

757
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,560
Why? You said you'd meet a handsome guy.

758
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,560
You're both handsome.

759
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:21,560
Then I became a boyfriend by myself.

760
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,560
I was handsome.

761
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:28,560
First of all, this person is a human divorcee.

762
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:32,560
My ten-year-old is a crazy guy, but he's a face that's been eliminated at once.

763
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,560
I can do it at once even if I'm going to date.

764
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,560
But now the tablets are all gone.

765
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,560
There's no way I can see it.

766
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,560
There's nothing cheaper than that.

767
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:48,560
Then this person is a very human campaign.

768
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:55,560
If you see that person's face while sleeping, you can live like coffee.

769
00:48:55,560 --> 00:49:00,560
But I think we should meet more carefully that day.

770
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:02,560
I'm sure.

771
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:06,560
I'm still only old with my name.

772
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,560
But...

773
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:14,560
Isn't it just the two of us who don't know each other well and love each other at the same time?

774
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:19,560
No one knows where fate will lead.

775
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:23,560
So, see your ex-boyfriend again.

776
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,560
What is this?

777
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:31,560
You're so handsome.

778
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:35,560
You're handsome.

779
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,560
You're pretty too.

780
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,560
Stop it.

781
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,560
Hey.

782
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,560
Hey.

783
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:49,560
By the way, was it enough for me to make Ban Hee-jin so annoying?

784
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:50,560
Half and half?

785
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,560
Yeah.

786
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,560
Tell me.

787
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:58,560
It wasn't enough to make her annoying, but it was a little bit of a pain in the ass.

788
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,560
If she was a five-star, she would have done all the show.

789
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:06,560
I know you're a bit stingy, but this time, you were more serious.

790
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:08,560
Mr. Hwang Jae-hyeol?

791
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,560
Mr. Hwang Jae-hyeol?

792
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:10,560
What's wrong?

793
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:15,560
I'm a nice person, so I'm going to get you all right, but I've never seen a nice person before.

794
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:18,560
If you were a different friend, you'd be really good at taking a break.

795
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,560
Just...

796
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:20,560
Just...

797
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:21,560
Just...

798
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,560
Just...

799
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:23,560
Just...

800
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:24,560
Just...

801
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,560
Just...

802
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:26,560
Just...

803
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:27,560
Just...

804
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,560
Just...

805
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,560
Just...

806
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:30,560
Just...

807
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,560
Just...

808
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,560
Just go to sleep.

809
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:34,560
Go to sleep.

810
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,560
Go to sleep.

811
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,560
I'm going to sleep.

812
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,560
I'm going to sleep.

813
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,560
I'm going to sleep.

814
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:15,440
Nothing can overtake u

815
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:20,060
сот written in vain

816
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:30,060
would u conversations make mistakes

817
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:32,200
okay

818
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:33,740
excuse me pork

819
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:39,200
like the lock

820
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:43,400
Oh, it's beautiful.

821
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:44,900
Pardon?

822
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:46,600
Pardon?

823
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:52,400
Oh, it's a problem that can't be solved without this world.

824
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:57,100
The battery of the structure?

825
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:04,000
I'm sorry, but I'm a little busy right now.

826
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,600
And I'm really envious of my personality.

827
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,000
You must be tired.

828
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,200
Oh, it's okay.

829
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,800
I like my personality.

830
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,800
My friend is also a personality, but I'm very good at it.

831
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,500
Won't you order?

832
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:19,500
Oh!

833
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:22,100
Two iced americano.

834
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,200
Please wait a minute.

835
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:28,200
Yes, do it slowly.

836
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:32,400
But it's always easy to think about it.

837
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Oh, Bae!

838
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Oh, you're here?

839
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
My dad made a lot of sweet potatoes.

840
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Tell them to go.

841
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
One of these is for you.

842
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
As expected, my dad.

843
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
You have to know that it's sweet.

844
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Do you look happy today?

845
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
It's the day of the show.

846
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I waited for this day so much.

847
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
It must be nice.

848
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Come back.

849
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
I'll be back.

850
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I think they were friends.

851
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I thought they were friends.

852
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Hey, Ban Hee-ji.

853
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Why are you taking my talk?

854
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I didn't answer you.

855
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
That's what you took.

856
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
I have nothing to say.

857
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Hey, did you really go out to get some strength yesterday?

858
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Yes.

859
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Why?

860
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
I thought it was a bit of a challenge.

861
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
I thought it was a bit of a challenge.

862
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
It's better to be comfortable.

863
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
What do I have to do?

864
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
What?

865
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
I'll go.

866
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
The rain is all clear.

867
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I don't think we'll see each other again.

868
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
I mean, who kept looking at me?

869
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
I don't even have to look at you anymore.

870
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I'm getting cold.

871
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Ban Hee-ji.

872
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Ban Hee-ji.

873
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I knew it.

874
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I almost cried if you didn't admit it in advance.

875
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
I really missed the two real writers.

876
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
You're a big fan of this exhibition.

877
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
I'm sorry.

878
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
You've been waiting for this, right?

879
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:21,000
We'll introduce the most famous artist and the artist of our school,

880
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Jae Hee.

881
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
The first artist to be introduced is Jae Hee.

882
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
He's a great artist.

883
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
He's a great artist.

884
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
He's a great artist.

885
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
He's a great artist.

886
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
He's a great artist.

887
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
He's a great artist.

888
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
He's a great artist.

889
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
He's a great artist.

890
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
He's a great artist.

891
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
He's a great artist.

892
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
He's a great artist.

893
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
He's a great artist.

894
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
He's a great artist.

895
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
He's a great artist.

896
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Do you remember the work we saw earlier?

897
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
The title.

898
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
It was the title of the work.

899
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
No one knows where the destiny will lead from.

900
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:38,000
How much will the probability of all these coincidences fall?

901
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Hello.

902
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I'm your senior and the author of today's lecture.

903
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
I'm Jae Hee.

904
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
The first step is to measure the range of the first step.

905
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
If the first step is short,

906
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,000
you'll have to put in the angle and the first step is long.

907
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
The first step is to measure the first step.

908
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
The first step is to measure the first step.

909
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
I'm getting goosebumps.

910
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
I'll go now.

911
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
The rain is all over.

912
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
I don't think we'll see each other again.

913
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
I'm getting goosebumps.

914
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Hey, open your eyes.

915
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
I'm getting goosebumps.

916
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Younger brother.

917
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
I'm getting goosebumps.

918
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Are you surprised?

919
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
I didn't ask you to surprise me.

920
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
It's the artist Jae Hee.

921
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Are you disappointed?

922
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Because of me?

923
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
No, because you're amazing.

924
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
I feel a little bit of distance.

925
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Really?

926
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
I think I'm a little closer.

927
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Yes.

928
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Wait a minute.

929
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Hey, Ban Hee Jae.

930
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
What should I do?

931
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
What?

932
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
What do you mean?

933
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
I...

934
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I...

935
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
I have to keep looking at you.

936
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,000
The first step is to measure the first step.

937
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,000
The first step is to measure the first step.

938
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
The first step is to measure the first step.

939
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
