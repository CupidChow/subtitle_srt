1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Let's go to another place.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Let's go somewhere else.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Okay.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm going with you.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:34,000
When I was young, the standard of choosing a fairy tale was the face of a handsome man.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's the most important thing to get a good understanding of the story.

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I think it's easy to think that you're getting darker depending on the bright spot.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I realized that in college.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I just said that if you're a handsome man, you're the one who reacts first.

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I succeeded with art in closing this feeling.

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That would be enough.

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Wow, you're amazing.

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
How good is your boyfriend who has such a high wrist?

14
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Bani!

15
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So, my first boyfriend I chose is...

16
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Bani's boyfriend is...

17
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Bani!

18
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Guys, say hello. He's my boyfriend.

19
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
He's called Go Bong Soo.

20
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Bani, you should look at your boyfriend's face.

21
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Bani, you should look at your four sisters.

22
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You're missing him. Why is he here?

23
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Bani!

24
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I like you.

25
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Really?

26
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I like you.

27
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I like you!

28
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Bani!

29
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Why are you doing this to me?

30
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Because you like me so much.

31
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I like you.

32
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What's more important than your heart?

33
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Is this really right?

34
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What do I do?

35
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
If Bani likes you, that's enough.

36
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
How can I end this?

37
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's so late, I'm not with you.

38
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's finally calm, and we're starting a new day.

39
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Even the rain will end tonight, and the sun will rise.

40
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Bani, my friend.

41
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Hello!

42
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Perfect.

43
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Perfect.

44
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I feel better today.

45
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I keep smiling.

46
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I like this feeling.

47
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm in a good mood.

48
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm proud of my heart.

49
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm happy.

50
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The fresh air without any dust.

51
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The bright sunlight.

52
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The fresh wind.

53
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Everything is perfect.

54
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Of course, the perfect one among them is Bani!

55
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Bani!

56
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Bani!

57
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Happy without any dust?

58
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Yes, dating.

59
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Bani, should we go on a trip this weekend?

60
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The weather is nice.

61
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
A trip? I love traveling.

62
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
When should we go? Saturday? Sunday?

63
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
If you like it, you can come on Saturday and Sunday.

64
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
On Sunday?

65
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Yes, why?

66
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And this.

67
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Tada.

68
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What? Is it mine?

69
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yes, I bought it because it would look good on you.

70
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Isn't it pretty?

71
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's so pretty.

72
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'll do it for you.

73
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's coming.

74
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'll draw it for you.

75
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Bani!

76
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Are you done?

78
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm sorry?

79
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You're a human.

80
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
What are you doing?

82
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm going to school.

83
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Bani, don't drop this.

84
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yes, I'm so nervous.

85
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Let's take a look at the front.

86
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Enjoy your meal.

87
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Are you here?

88
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yes.

89
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Bani!

90
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I've got a glass of mocha latte.

91
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Enjoy your meal.

92
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Excuse me.

93
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
This is my ideal type.

94
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's really pretty.

95
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I see.

96
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
But I'm not good at choosing.

97
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Pardon?

98
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Enjoy your meal.

99
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yes, thank you.

100
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Hey, isn't this so pretty?

101
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You're so sensitive.

102
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's not that big of a deal.

103
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's just a little.

104
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Just a little?

105
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Is this just a little?

106
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Why are you so hard on my boyfriend?

107
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You're so pretty.

108
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Then let's ask him.

109
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Why don't you look at your boyfriend's face

110
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
when you have such high eyes?

111
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Why would I?

112
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Of course.

113
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Be quiet.

114
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
What?

115
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Why did you come here?

116
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I was saying I needed you.

117
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Thank you.

118
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Your name is Bani...

119
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Bani Jin.

120
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I told you last time.

121
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Really?

122
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'll be going now.

123
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Bye.

124
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Look at that.

125
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Those handsome guys like that

126
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
don't care about me.

127
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Hey.

128
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You're not looking at your boyfriend's face because of that?

129
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You're so funny.

130
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You don't even look at your face that much.

131
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What are you talking about?

132
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Even if you meet a really handsome guy,

133
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
can you really say that?

134
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Bani Jin.

135
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Where is the library office?

136
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
This is the library office.

137
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Thank you.

138
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm going to apply for a review of the library office.

139
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
When will you be able to get it done?

140
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
What?

141
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Oh.

142
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Oh, that...

143
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I think I'll be able to get it done today.

144
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You can apply for the library office at the next home page.

145
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Okay.

146
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Thank you.

147
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm grateful.

148
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Oh, can you help me with the library office?

149
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Hey, did you see the new student this time?

150
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
He was so pretty.

151
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I saw him. He was so pretty.

152
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
He was so pretty.

153
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I especially saw him with his short hair.

154
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Oh, he was so pretty.

155
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
What?

156
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I mean...

157
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Tell me.

158
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I mean, I mean, what?

159
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Hey.

160
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Did you see him?

161
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Hello.

162
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Don't say anything you can't say in front of you.

163
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm sorry.

164
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm not even a drinker.

165
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I mean, I'm going to sit down.

166
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I can't say anything in front of me.

167
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I can't even...

168
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I can't.

169
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Hey,

170
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
why don't you kill them on the first day of the return?

171
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You should properly protect the roots from the beginning.

172
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
If you do something,

173
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
you'll get a lot of them.

174
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You're a fruit.

175
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm a little lazy because I'm a fruit.

176
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm a fruit.

177
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Hey, fruit.

178
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Let's go together.

179
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Oh, fruit.

180
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Fruit.

181
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
What?

182
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You're so busy.

183
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Hello?

184
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Yes, mom.

185
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
What did you say?

186
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I said, I'm going to go home soon.

187
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'll be right back when I go on a trip.

188
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You've already been away for a night and a day.

189
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You know how much I've been dreaming to sleep with half of the eggs.

190
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
What?

191
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Are you crazy?

192
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yeah, it's half of the habit.

193
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I was so excited to sleep with eggs when I first met him.

194
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
But I've never seen him sleeping with eggs so expensive.

195
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I mean, is he quick or not?

196
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Hey, I'm tired, so let's take a break and get some snacks.

197
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
What are you talking about?

198
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm going to eat once.

199
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So when I go on a trip this time, I'm going to start by drinking.

200
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Hey, this is half of the story, right?

201
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm going to kill this bastard today.

202
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
No, just go and get drunk.

203
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
If you get the atmosphere while you're making a little secret, you'll know what it is.

204
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Hey, are you really a bad guy?

205
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Why are you saying that?

206
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm going to kill you.

207
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Honestly, where do you think you're going to meet a guy like me?

208
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Just show me what you're really good at.

209
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You're bad and you're bad again.

210
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
But why are you meeting him?

211
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm just meeting him to sleep.

212
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I told you, he's a good girl.

213
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I think I've been through this time because I was wrong about meeting him.

214
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
What?

215
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Oh, that necklace?

216
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm going to put it on the bottom of the travel bag.

217
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's a jjabi anyway.

218
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Wow, you really did a great job finding something similar.

219
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Hey, you crazy guy.

220
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
What?

221
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Mic.

222
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Pahun.

223
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Pahun.

224
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Where, where, where.

225
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Hey, you.

226
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Oh, my God.

227
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm sorry to apologize to the students.

228
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Oh, Heejin.

229
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
So that's.

230
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I did everything wrong.

231
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
But what you heard was all wrong.

232
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I wasn't being honest.

233
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You're making a mistake again?

234
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I was going to call my friend and I overreacted.

235
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Do you think that makes sense?

236
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Oh, really.

237
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You know it well.

238
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Believe me how much you like me.

239
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You son of a bitch.

240
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Hey, you're not even human.

241
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I can't do it anymore.

242
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Hey, stop breathing.

243
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Did you really not know my intentions?

244
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I was so stupid that I almost got into a fight.

245
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
What, what are you doing?

246
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
When did you say you liked me?

247
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Do you think you're going to get kicked out in front of people?

248
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm not even a kid.

249
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I just want to hold it in and meet you.

250
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Hey, stop breathing.

251
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Did you really not know my intentions?

252
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I just wanted to hold it in and meet you.

253
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I just wanted to hold it in and meet you.

254
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Hey, I'll tell you just once, so listen to me.

255
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You did it and you're giving me attention.

256
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Hey, I can meet a handsome guy.

257
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
From now on, you're the only one in front of me.

258
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Do you know what's good about you today?

259
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
You bastard.

260
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Hey, stop breathing.

261
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Hey, stop breathing.

262
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Hey, stop breathing.

263
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Hey, stop breathing.

264
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'm not going to answer your phone.

265
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You're crazy.

266
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Hey, I just want to say it once.

267
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Aren't people really crazy?

268
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
You're so calm after taking a house arrest.

269
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,500
It's getting nice and quiet.

270
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,000
I know it.

271
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Even the waterowers are scary, but we need to get on it.

272
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
How nice.

273
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Is it good?

274
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You're crazy too.

275
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,500
Let's go and study together.

276
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,500
Hyunhee.

277
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I'm sorry.

278
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,520
It's all my fault.

279
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,520
My fault.

280
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,520
What are you talking about?

281
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,520
What's wrong with you?

282
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,520
That bastard is a bad guy.

283
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,880
No.

284
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,380
I told you I like you.

285
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,280
I sold it forever.

286
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,280
I like you.

287
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,280
I like you.

288
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,280
I like you.

289
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,120
Just...

290
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,620
I just regret it.

291
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,620
I regret something the most.

292
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:44,220
I thought I could do it if I just liked me.

293
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,520
What's most important is...

294
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,520
I felt it.

295
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,520
I know what you mean.

296
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,520
What's important is the future.

297
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,520
The future?

298
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,520
Yes.

299
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,520
The future...

300
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,520
I've made up my mind.

301
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,520
Listen carefully.

302
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:28,520
I'm going to meet a handsome guy now!

303
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,520
I'm so happy.

304
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,520
I think I've been here for 10 years.

305
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,520
Yes.

306
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,520
Meet him.

307
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,520
Please meet him.

308
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,520
I'm not a good person.

309
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,520
Let's meet a good guy.

310
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,520
I'm a trash.

311
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,520
I'm going to be a good guy.

312
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,520
I'm going to be a good guy.

313
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,520
He's so quiet.

314
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,520
He's dead.

315
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,520
He's breathing.

316
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,520
He's breathing.

317
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,520
Hey, get up and wash up and eat.

318
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,520
I made it cool and boiled it.

319
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,520
What about the kids?

320
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,520
It's morning and the liver is coming.

321
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,520
You should get up and get up.

322
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,520
You should go to school.

323
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,520
I should go to school.

324
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,520
I should go to study.

325
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,520
You should go to school.

326
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,520
Honey.

327
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:47,520
Can you ask Bani if she's really going to take a break?

328
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,520
I'm going to.

329
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,520
What are you saying?

330
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,520
She's taking a break as soon as she's strong.

331
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,520
Again?

332
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:04,520
Why did you say you'd call me as soon as you made a contract?

333
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,520
Oh, I remember.

334
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,520
I asked you to send me a call.

335
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,520
Send me a call.

336
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:22,520
Bani, how can you call me as a teacher?

337
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,520
How do you do that?

338
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,520
I feel good.

339
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,520
How do you do that?

340
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,520
Just send me a call.

341
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,520
Okay.

342
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,520
Hello.

343
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,520
I moved in next door.

344
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,520
I'm going to tell my mother to send me a message.

345
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,520
You mean you moved in today?

346
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,520
What's wrong with you?

347
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,520
Thank you.

348
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,520
Bani.

349
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,520
She was Bani's first love.

350
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,520
I almost went to Gangwon-do without a single trace.

351
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,520
No, that's not why I didn't go.

352
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,520
Anyway, I'm serious this time, so don't let anyone stop me.

353
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,520
I'm going.

354
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,520
Okay.

355
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:36,520
I'm sure you'll be able to talk about the great-looking young man who appeared this time.

356
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,520
It's like you.

357
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,520
What?

358
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,520
What? Is it a sign?

359
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,520
Shall we go in?

360
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,520
I'm ready.

361
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,520
Bani.

362
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,520
Excuse me.

363
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,520
Yes?

364
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,520
I'm a little confused.

365
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,520
Where should I go to get the library?

366
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,520
What's this?

367
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,520
It looks like this is a beautiful book.

368
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,520
This is the Renaissance that was made of words?

369
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,520
What's wrong with you?

370
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,520
I'm sorry.

371
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,520
I'm sorry.

372
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,520
I'm sorry.

373
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,520
I'm sorry.

374
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,520
I'm sorry.

375
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,520
I'm sorry.

376
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,520
I'm sorry.

377
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,520
I'm sorry.

378
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,520
I'm sorry.

379
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,520
I'm sorry.

380
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,520
I'm sorry.

381
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,520
Or is it the golden ratio of the Greek sculpture?

382
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,520
It's a good atmosphere.

383
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,520
It's a really good atmosphere.

384
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,520
I'm sorry.

385
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:26,520
I think this person is choosing flowers after making a sad look.

386
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,520
Then?

387
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,520
The flower shop owner comes and asks.

388
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,520
Are you going to give it to your girlfriend?

389
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,520
Then smile without saying anything.

390
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,520
I don't know why.

391
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,520
I just have to do it.

392
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,520
Then,

393
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,520
the flower shop owner looks pretty.

394
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,520
But where is it?

395
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,520
The girl's sick.

396
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,520
How about today?

397
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,520
Then?

398
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,520
I wonder if the girl who is young and thin will answer like this.

399
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,520
What's the same?

400
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,520
Crazy.

401
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,520
What's the same?

402
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,520
Crazy.

403
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,520
Why is my face popping out?

404
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,520
It's a mental disorder.

405
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,520
I'm sorry.

406
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,520
I was thinking about something else.

407
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,520
Where did you tell me you were going?

408
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,520
Where is the sculpture?

409
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,520
This...

410
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,520
Is this...

411
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,520
Is this a new student of the sculpture?

412
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,520
No, it's not.

413
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,520
Mom and dad, I made up my mind.

414
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,520
I'm going to tie a bone to this one.

415
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,520
Let's go.

416
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,520
I'll give you a hug.

417
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,520
Why were you alone?

418
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,520
Are you not close with your friends?

419
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,520
I was a little shy.

420
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,520
Oh, I see.

421
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,520
It's okay. It's awkward.

422
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,520
But you met me because of me.

423
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,520
I'm actually a student of this semester.

424
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:18,520
If you don't know anything, ask me anytime. I'll tell you everything.

425
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,520
What?

426
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,520
How about the math application?

427
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,520
You did well.

428
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,520
It must have been hard because you were a new student.

429
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,520
I just filled it with the remaining classes because it was a bit late.

430
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,520
Really? Then you won't have any health.

431
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,520
I'm sorry.

432
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,520
I was fast a week, but I think I'm getting all the blame.

433
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,520
Have you tried our school's specialties?

434
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,520
I really have to try that.

435
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,520
Actually, that's a bit of a price tag.

436
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,520
Next time, we can eat together.

437
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,520
Okay, let's do that.

438
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,520
Thank you for taking me.

439
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,520
Of course, thank you.

440
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,520
If you really don't know anything,

441
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,520
I'll call you back with the number I told you about.

442
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,520
I have a lot of requests.

443
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,520
Okay.

444
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,520
Then I'll go first.

445
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,520
Let's meet again next time.

446
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,520
Okay.

447
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,520
Bye.

448
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,520
I can't believe it.

449
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,520
What's that fake look again?

450
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,520
Cold eyes with a sharp jawline.

451
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,520
A sharp lips.

452
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,520
It feels like...

453
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,520
It feels like...

454
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,520
It feels like...

455
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:21,520
It feels like a wedding drink commercial that will cool off the mood of the summer.

456
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,520
Let's see.

457
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:27,520
It's probably a girlfriend who has been dating since high school.

458
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:31,520
Why is that girl with black hair...

459
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,520
with black eyes?

460
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,520
Me?

461
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,520
Why is it on my face again?

462
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,520
I told you not to take a photo.

463
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,520
You're good at taking a break.

464
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,520
This is a new kind of house that keeps going to school.

465
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,420
What are you doing?

466
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,520
You're going to spray the perfume on me?

467
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,520
Okay.

468
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,080
Here, this way.

469
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:43,380
Wow, what a bold Sunday.

470
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,820
Our second year in high school...

471
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:48,480
We got the almost the highest score this time.

472
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,840
I think this will be the most famous one at our store.

473
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,840
I'm sorry.

474
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,840
I'm sorry.

475
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,840
Oh, I think I look like you.

476
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,840
You look more like me.

477
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:08,840
What are you going to do?

478
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:32,840
I'm sorry.

479
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,840
What is this?

480
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:02,840
What the hell.

481
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,840
Excuse me.

482
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,840
I was going to put it in first.

483
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,840
By the way?

484
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:20,840
Isn't the person who put it in first a pregnant woman?

485
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:30,840
Is it a woman?

486
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:36,840
I'm going to live now.

487
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,840
The president is a cream bread.

488
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:44,840
So you met a handsome man.

489
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,840
I've never known that my school is so beautiful.

490
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,840
The shape is bright.

491
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,840
Bright?

492
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,840
I'm jealous.

493
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,840
I want to see a handsome man.

494
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,840
I know.

495
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,840
It wasn't time to make this.

496
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,840
What is the new semester event?

497
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,840
I can't even do eye-catching.

498
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,840
Why are you so pretty?

499
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,840
What is the cherry blossom?

500
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,840
I love you, too.

501
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,840
I want to be a cherry blossom that flies.

502
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,840
Why would you wake me up?

503
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,840
Why not?

504
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,840
You're eating.

505
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,840
You said you'd meet a handsome man.

506
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,840
I'll get you out of here.

507
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,840
I'll get you out of here.

508
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,840
What do you mean?

509
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,840
I'm going to be a baby.

510
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,840
I'm going to be a baby.

511
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,840
I'm going to be a baby.

512
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,840
I'm going to be a baby.

513
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,840
I'm going to be a baby.

514
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,840
I'm going to be a baby.

515
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,840
I'm going to be a baby.

516
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,840
I'm going to be a baby.

517
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,840
I'm going to be a baby.

518
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,840
I'm going to be a baby.

519
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,840
I'm going to be a baby.

520
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,840
I'm going to be a baby.

521
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,840
I'm going to be a baby.

522
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,840
I'm going to be a baby.

523
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,840
Oh, the youth art creation.

524
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,840
We have to do this.

525
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,840
You can re-create it tomorrow, right?

526
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,840
It's almost done.

527
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,840
Okay.

528
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,840
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

529
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,840
I'm done.

530
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,840
I hope it's really done.

531
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,840
Then we'll use the studio as a envelope.

532
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,840
I heard the other support is also bread.

533
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,840
It's going to be okay. I've been working on it for a few days.

534
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:26,840
Take this.

535
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:32,840
Oh, thank you.

536
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:36,840
You're so cool.

537
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,840
As expected, my role model.

538
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:42,840
Who is the person who has been working hard since the beginning of school?

539
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,840
It's my son and your son.

540
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,840
My son and the CD player.

541
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,840
Hey, hey, be quiet.

542
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:54,840
If you're going to keep talking, take this and turn it off.

543
00:36:54,840 --> 00:37:00,840
No, even if we eat this precious thing, it's a big deal.

544
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,840
Thank you for the food.

545
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:10,840
Thank you.

546
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:30,840
I can do this.

547
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:40,840
I'm sorry.

548
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,840
Wow, the air purifier is different.

549
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,840
It's so big.

550
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,840
Give me one of these.

551
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,840
It's okay.

552
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,840
I'm sorry.

553
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:58,840
I'm sorry.

554
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:08,840
Oh, my God.

555
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:34,840
Are you okay?

556
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,840
You're not hurt, are you?

557
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,840
Oh, thank God.

558
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:48,840
Oh, hey.

559
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,840
Hey, did you break it?

560
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,840
Hurry up and check it.

561
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,840
What?

562
00:38:54,840 --> 00:39:02,840
What's going on?

563
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:32,840
Oh, my God.

564
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,840
How can you...

565
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,840
All of our blood and sweat is in here.

566
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:46,840
I thought you were in a dangerous situation.

567
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:54,840
It was never a problem.

568
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,840
It's my fault.

569
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,840
I'm sorry.

570
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:02,840
Please forgive me.

571
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,840
It's okay.

572
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,840
What are you going to do with this?

573
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:10,840
Of course, I have to reward you.

574
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,840
Do you know how much this is?

575
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:22,840
I'm going to reward you.

576
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,840
200?

577
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:28,840
200?

578
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,840
200?

579
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,840
200?

580
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,840
200?

581
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,840
200?

582
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,840
200?

583
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,840
200?

584
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,840
I'll reward you in a quick time.

585
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:56,840
I'm really sorry.

586
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:00,840
Oh, my God.

587
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:10,840
I'll give you the number.

588
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:18,840
Hey, you.

589
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,840
Bani.

590
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,840
Yeah, you're here.

591
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,840
Sit here.

592
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,840
Are you okay?

593
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,840
What?

594
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:32,840
When did you think you'd be embarrassed because you thought people would be embarrassed?

595
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,840
I didn't mean it. I kept holding back and met you.

596
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:38,840
That's right. I'm an old man now, but I was a hot girl.

597
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,840
Of course, it's okay.

598
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:48,840
It's okay.

599
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,840
That's a relief.

600
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:56,840
I'm worried you might even take a break.

601
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,840
I know.

602
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:06,840
Now I'm a hot girl.

603
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:16,840
Wow.

604
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:20,840
What are you doing? It's so beautiful.

605
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,840
Did you see it?

606
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:30,840
Sit here.

607
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,840
Everyone, please sit down.

608
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,840
I'll start with the A-SOUL.

609
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:38,840
I'll start with the big sound from here.

610
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,840
Finally, we have a handsome man in our department.

611
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,840
Right?

612
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:46,840
But how did Bani and the first group get along?

613
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,840
I was really surprised.

614
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:54,840
Actually, it was on the way to school in the morning.

615
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,840
Wait a minute.

616
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,840
What?

617
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,840
The first group.

618
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,840
That guy is a real hand.

619
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,840
Did you not know?

620
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,840
Hello.

621
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:12,840
This time, I'm the returning car, Ji Won.

622
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:22,840
Wow.

623
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:30,840
Now, everyone.

624
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:36,840
The people sitting in front of you are the juniors and juniors.

625
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:40,840
Say hello to each other.

626
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:44,840
Should I drink for you?

627
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,840
What do you mean?

628
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,840
I'll pour you a drink.

629
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,840
No, no, no.

630
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,840
I have to pour you a drink first.

631
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,840
Please.

632
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,840
I'm kidding.

633
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,840
I can't even drink.

634
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,840
I think you're too uncomfortable.

635
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,840
Just relax.

636
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,840
Relax.

637
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:08,840
I found out a lot.

638
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,840
I'm a hand-made person.

639
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,840
I'm the best.

640
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:18,840
Can I be a detective?

641
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:22,840
You're really fun.

642
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:26,840
Oh, just call me Bani comfortably.

643
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,840
Bani.

644
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,840
Bani?

645
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:36,840
Yes.

646
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,840
How about we have a conversation with the juniors?

647
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,840
Yes.

648
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,840
Then we'll have a good mood.

649
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:52,840
Let's start the new year's ceremony.

650
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,840
Fighting, guys.

651
00:44:54,840 --> 00:45:02,840
Wow.

652
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:12,840
I heard you can't drink.

653
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:22,840
Cha Jiwon.

654
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,840
Wait a minute.

655
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:30,840
I'll be a lawyer.

656
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,840
I'm a senior.

657
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:40,840
I'll drink.

658
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:50,840
Oh, my God.

659
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:58,840
Are you okay?

660
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,840
Oh, yes.

661
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:04,840
Thank you for everything.

662
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:08,840
I'm glad I could do this.

663
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,840
Do you have a wish?

664
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,840
You have to give me a wish if you buy a cookie.

665
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,840
Oh, you don't have to.

666
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:18,840
I'm just saying that I'm comfortable.

667
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:22,840
Or do you have time tomorrow?

668
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,840
I'll buy the taxi you told me.

669
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,840
Oh, I was going to buy that.

670
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:30,840
I have to pay for it, too.

671
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:34,840
Well, if you say so, I won't refuse.

672
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:46,840
Then please do a great job from now on, senior.

673
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:50,840
Huh?

674
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,840
Good luck to you, too.

675
00:46:52,840 --> 00:47:00,840
Yes, High Sir.

676
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:19,840
What should we order?

677
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:22,840
I'm so sorry.

678
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,840
I'm so sorry.

679
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:29,840
I think one of the two will die.

680
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:32,840
Oh, good job, Shin-sik.

681
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,840
Come on.

682
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,840
Everyone, attention!

683
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:42,840
Our host, who gave us the food we need to use.

684
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,840
Let's see who it is.

685
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,840
Hwang Jae-hyun!

686
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,840
Your voice is too small. Who is it?

687
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,840
Hwang Jae-hyun!

688
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:55,840
Let's hear it from Hwang Jae-hyun's confeser!

689
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,840
Hwang Jae-hyun!

690
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,840
Just do it once.

691
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,840
Hwang Jae-hyun!

692
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:13,840
Choi.

693
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:14,840
Choi!

694
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:15,840
Go!

695
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:16,840
Go!

696
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,840
Choi Hwang's CD!

697
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,840
Hey, it's hot that day.

698
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,840
I think the shopping mall is really big.

699
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,840
From the beginning, we have to order a gold medal.

700
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,840
Can we order whatever we want?

701
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,840
You guys do it.

702
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:44,840
Shall we order the meat first?

703
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,840
It's really hot.

704
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:54,840
Hyo-dong, eat a lot.

705
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:57,840
I'm so full.

706
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,840
How do you feel?

707
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,840
I think I'm full.

708
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,840
You're good.

709
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,840
You're a player.

710
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,840
I'm a player.

711
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:44,840
Drink, drink, drink, drink.

712
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:46,840
I'm excited.

713
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,840
I'm suffering because of someone.

714
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,840
Are you okay?

715
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,840
I think I'm drunk.

716
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,840
What are you saying?

717
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:58,840
I'm drunk because of you.

718
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,840
What are you doing?

719
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,840
Hey!

720
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,840
Choi!

721
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:20,840
Are you trying to teach me?

722
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:24,840
What are you doing?

723
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:28,840
You're the best.

724
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,840
You're the best.

725
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,840
You're the best.

726
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:39,840
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

727
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,840
Hey, stop.

728
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,840
Hey, stop.

729
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:53,840
Hey, stop.

730
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,840
What are you doing?

731
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,840
Yeah.

732
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,840
His eyes.

733
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:02,840
This tone.

734
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,840
It's cold.

735
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:10,840
You have to be so scared to get into the water.

736
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:13,840
You're a fool.

737
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:14,840
What?

738
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:15,840
I'm a fool.

739
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,840
I'm going to get a cold.

740
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,840
You can get a cold.

741
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,840
What? Hey, hey, hey.

742
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,840
Let me say something good.

743
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:42,840
One, two, three.

744
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:45,840
What the hell is this?

745
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,840
Hey, let's play.

746
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,840
Hey, you.

747
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:53,840
It's unfair.

748
00:51:54,840 --> 00:52:03,840
I just said I was going to get a handsome face.

749
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:06,840
What?

750
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,840
Oh, my God.

751
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:09,840
You're so handsome.

752
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:18,840
I'm not that cute.

753
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:28,840
I'm a face of a million people.

754
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:48,840
I looked closer and I was handsome.

755
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,840
Hey, hey.

756
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:54,840
You're not that.

757
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,840
Hey, hey, hey, don't open your mouth.

758
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,840
Next.

759
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,840
I'm going to kill you.

760
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,840
I'm going to kill you.

761
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:26,840
Oh, my God.

762
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:29,840
How much did you drink yesterday?

763
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:34,840
How did you do that?

764
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,840
Why is my hand so cold?

765
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:41,840
Who did you drink it from?

766
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:46,840
Hey, you.

767
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:47,840
Oh, my God.

768
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,840
You're so handsome.

769
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,840
You're more than a million people.

770
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,840
Where did you get the poison?

771
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:55,840
Hey, don't open your mouth.

772
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:56,840
Next.

773
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:59,840
I'm going to kill you.

774
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:02,840
Crazy.

775
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,840
I'm crazy.

776
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:33,840
Hey, hey, hey.

777
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:43,840
Hey.

778
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:53,840
What's wrong?

779
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:58,840
I'm really...

780
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:08,840
I'm not afraid.

781
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:18,840
Oh, my God.

782
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:28,840
Ban Heejin.

783
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,840
Oh, my God.

784
00:55:51,840 --> 00:56:01,840
I was just going to take a break.

785
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,840
No, it's over anyway.

786
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,840
I have to run away.

787
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:28,840
Oh, my God.

788
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:38,840
Hey, Ban Heejin.

789
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:48,840
Oh, my God.

790
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,840
Excuse me.

791
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:56,840
Can I talk to you?

792
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:06,840
Oh, my God.

793
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,840
Try the drone.

794
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,840
Try the drone.

795
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,840
Oh, it's a ghost.

796
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:27,840
Where?

797
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,840
Can't you see the person running?

798
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,840
Oh, there's a ghost.

799
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,840
But why are you running like that?

800
00:57:54,840 --> 00:58:04,840
Oh, Ban Heejin.

801
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:05,840
Oh, Ban Heejin.

802
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:06,840
Hey, hey, hey.

803
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:10,840
I'll get you out of here.

804
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:20,840
Ban Heejin, come out.

805
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:25,840
Hey, I think this is too much.

806
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:26,840
What are you doing?

807
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,840
Hey, what's wrong with you?

808
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,840
Hey, you're going to get in trouble.

809
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:35,840
Hey, you're going to get in trouble.

810
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:45,840
Hey, hey.

811
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:15,840
Oh, my God.

812
00:59:35,840 --> 01:00:03,840
But that cherry blossom ending will wake me up.

813
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:13,840
What is it?

814
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:43,840
Hey, hey, hey.

815
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:53,840
Hey, hey, hey.

816
01:00:53,840 --> 01:01:03,840
Hey, hey, hey.

817
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:11,840
Isn't it just a relationship that only two people know in a relationship that people can live in a relationship that people don't know?

818
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:12,840
Let's be really close.

819
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,840
Why are you suddenly doing well?

820
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,840
Are you sleeping at the office?

821
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:17,840
Excuse me?

822
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:18,840
What is it?

823
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,840
Why are you talking to me?

824
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:22,840
Don't you think you look like me?

825
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:25,840
I'm not going to let Ban Heejin get away like that.

826
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:26,840
Do you have any idea?

827
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:29,840
No one knows where the fate will lead.

828
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:31,840
Do you want to be my destiny?

829
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,840
Hey, Ban Heejin.

830
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:43,840
Is this fate?
