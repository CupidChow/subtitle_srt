1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The End

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
How have you been?

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yura?

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm a little tired, maybe?

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Add nosso

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Ã¬

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,500
Tipping

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,300
You accidentally Burned the immeasurable

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yes, wait a minute.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I sent you a text.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Didn't you see it?

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I don't think we're going to sign it after we've done the text.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
But I guess you didn't block it.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What do you mean?

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's the same.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Check.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's been two years since then.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I think it's been a long time.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Didn't you miss me?

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's funny.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's funny.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You're saying that.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I heard I'm going to the festival this time.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's been a long time since I came to school.

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But I think I had a good time as a student.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
How about you go back to school and live in school?

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Did you get used to it?

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Did you get along with your juniors?

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
If you're going to say that again, I'll go.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I haven't had a cup of coffee yet.

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I haven't seen you in a long time.

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Don't you have any questions for me?

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
There was.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
In the past.

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But now.

36
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's class soon, isn't it?

39
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yes, it's a class. I'll go to the classroom after class.

40
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Okay.

41
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Did you see it?

42
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
They said they were drunk.

43
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I saw it earlier.

44
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
They came here and had coffee.

45
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Then this is real.

46
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I didn't know my ex-boyfriend's celebrity was a second-hand man.

47
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I didn't know he was a second-hand man.

48
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Are you okay?

49
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm not a girlfriend. I'm just a ex-girlfriend.

50
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Don't mind me.

51
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What's wrong with you? Why do I care about this?

52
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You two are getting along well.

53
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I was just a kid when I ate meat.

54
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I can't live because of your excitement.

55
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I didn't say anything at that time.

56
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Don't worry about me. I don't care at all.

57
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Really.

58
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What?

59
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
No, this is real?

60
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I heard that our ex-girlfriend and you were dating.

61
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
If you don't want to win, aren't you going to class?

62
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's not important. Look at this.

63
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
As expected. As expected.

64
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
To meet this girl, you have to be a student of the CD price.

65
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's a little bit sad, but I respect your decision.

66
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What's wrong with you?

67
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:14,000
No.

69
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Oh.

70
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Are you on your way to class?

71
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yes.

72
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Oh.

73
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
How have you been?

74
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Open up.

75
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yeah.

76
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,000
There must be a girl who likes men like this.

77
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm so excited again like a fool.

78
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm really bored.

79
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I have something to do.

80
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'll go first.

81
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Are you okay?

82
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Does it hurt? Do you think you have to go to the hospital?

83
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
No, no, no, what hospital?

84
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's just a little bit.

85
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's not even a day or two of getting hurt.

86
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What are you thinking about?

87
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Oh, I got a job today.

88
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I didn't have to focus, but it's going to be fine anyway.

89
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'll take a break with my fingers and do it hard from tomorrow.

90
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Then shall we call the class together?

91
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Yes, I like it.

92
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Hey, I'm in front of school right now. You haven't eaten yet, have you?

93
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
What's wrong?

94
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Hye-won wants to eat with me.

95
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm in front of school right now.

96
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Then shall we go eat together?

97
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What if your sister is okay?

98
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Did you go already?

99
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Oppa, is this the place?

100
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's not a hotel, but a restaurant.

101
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You don't know anything.

102
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
There's only one bread here.

103
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
This place is a good place.

104
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm really looking forward to seeing you say it's good.

105
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
That's right.

106
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Come out.

107
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Enjoy your meal.

108
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Thank you.

109
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
First of all, try one and add it to it.

110
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's okay, right?

111
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Yes.

112
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
But I'll tell you comfortably.

113
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm not sure if I can eat it.

114
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm not sure.

115
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm not sure.

116
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm not sure.

117
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yes, but please tell me comfortably.

118
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's older than me.

119
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Shall we?

120
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Hurry up and try it.

121
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Try it.

122
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Like that, in the middle.

123
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Oppa.

124
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Wait a minute.

125
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's done.

126
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
How can I not eat this big one?

127
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Do you want me to tell you how to eat it?

128
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Look.

129
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's easier than you think.

130
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
This is how it looks like.

131
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
If you put it vertically like this and bite it in one bite.

132
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's not scary.

133
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's fun.

134
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Try it.

135
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Try it vertically like this.

136
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Look, it's not going to stick.

137
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's really my special skill.

138
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm teaching you a special skill.

139
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'll teach you how to eat it without eating hamburgers next time.

140
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:11,000
No, you looked very educated just now.

141
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Right?

142
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm a little learned to eat.

143
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Try it, too.

144
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Go home and eat.

145
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's okay.

146
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Then I'll share it with my parents.

147
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Sorry, I pressed the wrong button.

148
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Aren't you going?

149
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yeah.

150
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'll go then.

151
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Call me when you get home.

152
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Yes.

153
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Go in.

154
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Hye-won, good bye.

155
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,000
See you next time.

156
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What's so good about it?

157
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Oh, don't you think your feet are fun?

158
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Is it fun?

159
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You don't like it?

160
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I went to the classroom earlier, but I didn't have it.

161
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I guess I didn't do the night job today.

162
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Hye-won.

163
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You're beautiful.

164
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
What are you doing?

165
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Wait a minute.

166
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
What are you doing?

167
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Look, look.

168
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Yes.

169
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Hey, I'm so blind.

170
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Can't you see I'm not interested in you?

171
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
What are you talking about?

172
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You told me to come to see that precious English ticket.

173
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That's just a lie.

174
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Look at this.

175
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Answer is a sin.

176
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It's a answer.

177
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's not.

178
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:29,000
What?

179
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Yes.

180
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
What is it?

181
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:47,000
This cold feeling is like that.

182
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm sorry.

183
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Yeah, this smell is like a man's soup.

184
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Really?

185
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I can see the woman's eyes.

186
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm back.

187
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Yes, I'm back.

188
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
What?

189
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Why are you so big?

190
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I bought a lot.

191
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I didn't buy it.

192
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
What?

193
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Then is it that brother?

194
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Brother?

195
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
No, it's not like that.

196
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
What is it?

197
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
What brother?

198
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You don't know me, do you?

199
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Honey, this is not a joke.

200
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
He must be a handsome guy because he looks like him.

201
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I saw it yesterday.

202
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
The guy took the woman in front of the house.

203
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
But he's just shining on his face from afar.

204
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
He's just looking at me when I was young.

205
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
What?

206
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
And he's just tall and tall.

207
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It's a big deal that the ear is flowing well.

208
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's a big deal.

209
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Then agree.

210
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I agree.

211
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I agree.

212
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You must be tired.

213
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Eat this.

214
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm sleepy now.

215
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Thank you.

216
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Wow, I think I'm going to live.

217
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Oh, Hye Won said that she was going to talk about that bread at home yesterday.

218
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Right.

219
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I've never seen anyone who doesn't like that bread.

220
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Next time, let's go again with Hye Won.

221
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Yes, good.

222
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
But, brother.

223
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I felt it yesterday.

224
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I think you're really nice to your brother.

225
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Me?

226
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Did I?

227
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Don't all the other brothers do the same?

228
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I don't know because I don't have siblings.

229
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I don't usually do that.

230
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:15,000
That bright flower is also very depressed when it's with your brother.

231
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm worried because the situation with Hye Won is different from the other kids.

232
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm a little over-confident, right?

233
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Why? No, no, I'm over-confident.

234
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm just jealous of a brother like you.

235
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
But when are you going to make this?

236
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
You have to do the first cast.

237
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
When are you really going to do it?

238
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
So, you have to do another assignment.

239
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's a assignment.

240
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It's also an assignment.

241
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm more worried about the ingredients.

242
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You've never been that worried, right?

243
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
What?

244
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
The eyes that can't lie?

245
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I can't do the assignment to do the part-time job.

246
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I can't do the ingredients to do the assignment.

247
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I don't have a answer.

248
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Here's the drink.

249
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Thank you.

250
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Thank you.

251
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Wow, I can't get used to the Dungul-raechi.

252
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
The only person who makes Dungul-raechi in our cafe is you.

253
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Really?

254
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Then it's a custom menu for me.

255
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Can't you not have it?

256
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Pass?

257
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Who wants to have a meeting?

258
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I don't have time to practice the pass.

259
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
What about Bani?

260
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I don't do it either.

261
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm going to have a meeting and I'm going to be on the run.

262
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I'm worried about my kids.

263
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I have to run even if I have to do the part-time job right now.

264
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I got an offer. Do you want to do it with me?

265
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Of course, I have it right away.

266
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Really?

267
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I really want to do it.

268
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Okay.

269
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I wanted to do it.

270
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'm going to have a meeting.

271
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Study or do it.

272
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Okay.

273
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It's not an everyday part-time job, it's a regular part-time job.

274
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
And I'm going to do it on the day after tomorrow.

275
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You're going again.

276
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Be careful.

277
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm going to have a meeting.

278
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Are you okay?

279
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm sorry.

280
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Let's be careful.

281
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Thank God.

282
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I almost got hurt.

283
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
But I don't think you're a criminal.

284
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I was right next to you.

285
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I should have caught you.

286
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I guess you're not a criminal.

287
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Sang Seul.

288
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Are you going to class?

289
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Yes.

290
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm on this side too.

291
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Let's go together.

292
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Okay.

293
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
That's how it is.

294
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Which way are you going?

295
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm going this way.

296
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
This way.

297
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Let's go this way.

298
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Okay.

299
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Goodbye.

300
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
When will you be back?

301
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
What should I do?

302
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Bani, come out.

303
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Come out quickly.

304
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Your mom is on TV today.

305
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
You were on TV?

306
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Yes.

307
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Over there.

308
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
She's coming out.

309
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
She's coming out.

310
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
She's coming out.

311
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
She's coming out.

312
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It's a woman's story.

313
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
We started a new season with the opening match.

314
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Today, we have the first winner of the opening match,

315
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Coach Kim Young Kyung, the main character of the team.

316
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
She's a special guest.

317
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Hello, Coach.

318
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Hello.

319
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I'm Coach Kim Young Kyung, the coach of the Daewoonhan Gong The Challengers.

320
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Nice to meet you, Coach.

321
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Congratulations on the opening match.

322
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Please tell us how you feel.

323
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Our players have been training really hard.

324
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Even though it was a big game,

325
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
we weren't nervous and we did what we usually did.

326
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Thanks to you, we were able to get good results.

327
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I don't know how you speak so nicely.

328
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
It's just that the show is a reality.

329
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Well, that's not all.

330
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
But I was in the middle of summer.

331
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Before summer started,

332
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
you really relaxed me.

333
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
You're a really good person.

334
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Really?

335
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
How are you okay?

336
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I only thought it was pretty.

337
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I wanted to have a son

338
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
if I had a son.

339
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Wait a minute.

340
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Son?

341
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
You said you're a son now?

342
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
You're a son again?

343
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Son, you're a son.

344
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
You're a son.

345
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
You're a son.

346
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
You don't have anything to say.

347
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
You're ready?

348
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Okay.

349
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
You're my son again.

350
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Thank you.

351
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Now, we'll move on to the next match

352
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
of the next match of the next match.

353
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
We're ready.

354
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
You have to do well.

355
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
We're running out of time.

356
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I'll do my best.

357
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Okay.

358
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Are you done?

359
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I think I'm almost there.

360
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Go ahead.

361
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Okay.

362
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
What is he doing?

363
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Are you going to be a trainee?

364
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Only that day?

365
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I was going to go to an apartment

366
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
that was half-dressed and half-pressed.

367
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Go ahead.

368
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I'll do it.

369
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Go ahead.

370
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Are you a trainee?

371
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Yes.

372
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I'm here for the advertisement.

373
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
It's from Hwang Jae-yeol.

374
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Yes.

375
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Sir, we're here.

376
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
We're here.

377
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Let's go to the couple.

378
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
What?

379
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Couple?

380
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Yes.

381
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I'm confident.

382
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Yes, you're in the mood.

383
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Now, sir.

384
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
One, two, action!

385
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Now, we're going to

386
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
finish the pictures we're drawing.

387
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Let's finish them off well

388
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
and come back here in two hours.

389
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Yes.

390
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Yes, sir.

391
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I'm here for the first time today.

392
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
It's amazing.

393
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
By the way,

394
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
why are you here?

395
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Because you said you'd do it.

396
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Did you come to the community school?

397
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Oh, yes.

398
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I didn't say anything.

399
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
What should I say?

400
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
We're not even going to say that.

401
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Is that so?

402
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I thought you'd be curious.

403
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I thought you'd be curious.

404
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Anyway,

405
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I thought you'd have to say it.

406
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
It's not a relationship right now.

407
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
So,

408
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I hope you don't misunderstand.

409
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I'm here to say this.

410
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Go, go, go!

411
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
That couple!

412
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
How did you get here if you went and didn't come?

413
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I'm sorry.

414
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
That was great.

415
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Let's go. Let's go again.

416
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I'll take care of it.

417
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Please come back soon.

418
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I don't have time.

419
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I'm sorry.

420
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
It was great.

421
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Let's go. Let's go again.

422
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I'll take care of it.

423
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Please come back soon.

424
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I don't have time.

425
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I don't have time.

426
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Yeji!

427
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Yeji!

428
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
It's a couple.

429
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
One, two, action!

430
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Yeji!

431
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Why don't you move?

432
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I'm sorry.

433
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I'm sorry.

434
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Please don't be so quick.

435
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Let's go again.

436
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I'm sorry, but it's raining.

437
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
What?

438
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I'm sorry.

439
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I'm sorry.

440
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
You did great today.

441
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
We don't have much time left until the holidays,

442
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
so let's all work harder.

443
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Yes.

444
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
There are a lot of people who are coming to the holidays.

445
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
You know that, right?

446
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
You should be nervous and practice.

447
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Yes.

448
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
This bastard again?

449
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Bo-bae?

450
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Bo-bae?

451
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
What do you have to say?

452
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
No, I'll work hard.

453
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Okay.

454
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I like to watch you do your homework.

455
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Then, the meeting is over.

456
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Yes, thank you.

457
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Well,

458
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
you're so impressed by the movie that you're so weak.

459
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Do you usually like a movie with a lot of fear

460
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
without a bad name?

461
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
What?

462
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Fear?

463
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
It's a bit too much.

464
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
It's a shame.

465
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I think you don't understand

466
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
the movie storytelling.

467
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
How about raising your wrist a bit?

468
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
What?

469
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
How about raising your wrist?

470
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Look at Bo-bae.

471
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I'm a very tall person.

472
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I like to watch movies with a good score

473
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
and I like to watch movies with a good score.

474
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I think you're more suspicious of the movie.

475
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Wow, you're more suspicious?

476
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I'll bring you a drink.

477
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Director!

478
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
What should I do?

479
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
What?

480
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
What's wrong with this?

481
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I can't connect this.

482
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Director Mi-soo keeps not answering the phone.

483
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
What?

484
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Do it until the end!

485
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I think I've done more than 10 times.

486
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
You're talking nonsense.

487
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Do it until the end!

488
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Oh, my.

489
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
If you're okay with it,

490
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I think I can do it.

491
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Wow, you drew so well.

492
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
This is nice.

493
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I had a set for a while,

494
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
but I almost got a big one.

495
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Thank you.

496
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
No, it's a relief that I got help.

497
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Thank you.

498
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I'll see you later.

499
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I'll see you later.

500
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Bye.

501
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Bye.

502
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Bye.

503
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Bye.

504
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Bye.

505
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Bye.

506
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
No, I'm glad I got help.

507
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Did I say I'm a good girl?

508
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Yes.

509
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
If you have any questions,

510
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
please let me know.

511
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Yes, thank you.

512
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
You're so good at drawing.

513
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
You're so good at drawing.

514
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
You're talented.

515
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Are you interested in acting?

516
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Why did you drink coffee

517
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
when you said you were not interested?

518
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
It's a coffee shop.

519
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I'm also in contact with my ex-boyfriends.

520
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
They're all still in contact with you.

521
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
My ex-girlfriend is in the middle of summer.

522
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I'm so worried.

523
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
What's the matter?

524
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
It's the past anyway.

525
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
And you said you're not in a relationship right now.

526
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Right.

527
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
But...

528
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Why did you two start dating

529
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
when you were in high school?

530
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
How would you know if you were in a relationship

531
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
and then met again?

532
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
What do you think?

533
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Do you want to be good to him?

534
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
You believe what you want to believe.

535
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
But you don't seem to care.

536
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
You're not.

537
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Oh, Romeo.

538
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Why is your name Romeo?

539
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I'm not.

540
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
What's wrong with you?

541
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Are you going to be good to him?

542
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
You believe what you want to believe.

543
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
But you don't seem to care.

544
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Anyway,

545
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I think I should tell you.

546
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I'm not in a relationship right now.

547
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
You're not in a relationship right now.

548
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I'm not in a relationship.

549
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
So,

550
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I hope you don't get it.

551
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I thought it was true.

552
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Is it a warm-hearted car?

553
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Let's have a cup of iced americano.

554
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
What about coffee?

555
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Do you want a half?

556
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Yes.

557
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I'll buy it for you because I'm going to do a night shift.

558
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Oh.

559
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
There's something you eat when you're having a hard night shift.

560
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Do you want that?

561
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Really?

562
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Then, please do that.

563
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
When you're having a night shift,

564
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
you have to eat this much to get your hair back.

565
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Oh.

566
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
What?

567
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I even gave you a special menu.

568
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Did I put it in the car?

569
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
No, but I'm sure I took care of it.

570
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Wait a minute.

571
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Then, I'll give you a special gift.

572
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
First of all, thank you.

573
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I'll pay you back.

574
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Bani.

575
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Did you go to bed well yesterday?

576
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Yes.

577
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
What about you?

578
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Me, too.

579
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I guess I was too much of a actor yesterday.

580
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I got it.

581
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Bani, do you like pasta?

582
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Pasta?

583
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I like pasta.

584
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I like pasta.

585
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I like pasta.

586
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Pasta?

587
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
There was a pasta restaurant nearby.

588
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Do you want to go eat pasta with me?

589
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
The two of us?

590
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Yes, the two of us.

591
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
How about you?

592
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Do you want to be good to him?

593
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I believe in what you want to believe.

594
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
But I don't think you'll care about him.

595
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I just want to believe in him now.

596
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Then think about it and let me know.

597
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Let's go.

598
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Pasta.

599
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Pasta.

600
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
When should we go?

601
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Tomorrow?

602
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Yes, tomorrow is fine.

603
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Okay.

604
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
See you tomorrow.

605
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I'll call you tomorrow.

606
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Okay.

607
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Oh, this?

608
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
It's a special coffee you drink when you're late.

609
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I don't know if it's coffee or cream.

610
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I'm going to be late, so I need to drink this.

611
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I'll drink it up.

612
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Thanks to this coffee, I have a lot of energy to work today.

613
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
What is it?

614
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
What?

615
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
You were talking to me earlier.

616
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
No?

617
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Well...

618
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:03,000
You know, men usually go to women to eat pasta.

619
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Why?

620
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Who's going to eat pasta with you?

621
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Jae-yeol.

622
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
He told me that he and his female announcer are not related.

623
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
And he wants to eat pasta with me.

624
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I don't know what's going on.

625
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
But it seems like they don't like eating pasta.

626
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Why?

627
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Do you want to go on a date?

628
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
What?

629
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
No, no.

630
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
That's not true.

631
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I don't think it's right to compare.

632
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Right?

633
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Is this a little bit cute?

634
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Oh, the work is over?

635
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Yes.

636
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
But what's that?

637
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:17,980
Ah, school

638
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
What is this?

639
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
One-hee's wallet.

640
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I have too much to do.

641
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I'll ask you.

642
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Okay.

643
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Good job.

644
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Thank you.

645
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Look at this.

646
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Don't you think it's okay now?

647
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Why?

648
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
No, it's not okay.

649
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Really?

650
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Is it weird?

651
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Oh, I think it's a little bit wrong.

652
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
No, this, this.

653
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Oh, something's on your face?

654
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Stay here.

655
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Danyang.

656
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I'm sorry.

657
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
One night job?

658
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
What?

659
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Is it over late?

660
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Yes.

661
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I think I have to do it a little more today.

662
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:03,000
You two?

663
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Don't overdo it.

664
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I'll call you when I get home.

665
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Yes.

666
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Go home safely.

667
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I'll talk to you for a minute.

668
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I wanted to be sure of something with you.

669
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
What?

670
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I told you I wasn't kidding.

671
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
What's your brother?

672
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Tell me a few times.

673
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
He's my close friend's brother.

674
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I wanted to believe that, too.

675
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
But...

676
00:43:50,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Do you know that you don't know your heart?

677
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Anyway, I told you for sure that I like Bani.

678
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Please take care of Bani.

679
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Don't wipe it off again.

680
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:34,000
What?

681
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Are you here already?

682
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
How long have you been sleeping?

683
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I have to wake up.

684
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
How much did you sleep?

685
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
It's okay.

686
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,000
You didn't even close your nose and didn't even get a bed.

687
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Really.

688
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Thank you for taking me home today.

689
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Go home safely.

690
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I'll see you when I get home.

691
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Okay.

692
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Go home safely.

693
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Sorry. I pressed the wrong button.

694
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I'm sorry.

695
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Hello?

696
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Did you go in?

697
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Yes, I came in a while ago.

698
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
You did a good job.

699
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Oh, no.

700
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Let's eat something more delicious tomorrow.

701
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
What time should we meet tomorrow?

702
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
I'm done at 6 o'clock.

703
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
You?

704
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Me, too.

705
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
It's good.

706
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
That's near the market.

707
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Then...

708
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Let's see at 7 o'clock.

709
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Okay.

710
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I'll call you back tomorrow.

711
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Good night, Hanya.

712
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Okay.

713
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:37,000
You, too.

714
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Oh, my.

715
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Oh?

716
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Oh, my.

717
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Oh, my.

718
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
What should I do?

719
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Oh, my.

720
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Oh, my.

721
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Is this really a summit?

722
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
See you at 7 o'clock.

723
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
I need to hold your hand.

724
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Every time girl, I see you.

725
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I'm only selling one meal a day.

726
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
I can't eat.

727
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I can't eat.

728
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Really?

729
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Oh?

730
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Dong-ah.

731
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
It's been a while.

732
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Oh, it's been a while.

733
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
I'm watching TV well.

734
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,000
I think I'm getting better.

735
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Is that so?

736
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:59,000
I came to say hello to the professors during the meeting.

737
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Do you want to have dinner with me after the meeting?

738
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:15,000
What time is the class today?

739
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I'm sorry.

740
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:55,000
I'm sorry.

741
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Let's go.

742
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Let's go.

743
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,000
What does that mean?

744
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Let's take some time.

745
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,000
So what does that mean?

746
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Just like I said.

747
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I don't want to meet you now.

748
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I'll tell you later.

749
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Do you think it's worth it to meet me yesterday?

750
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
No.

751
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:49,000
You're too heavy for me.

752
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:54,000
What?

753
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I don't like my appearance with you.

754
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I've been thinking about it for a few days, but I don't think it's like this.

755
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
I don't know what's going on, but let's talk about it in the meeting.

756
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Hey, Hyewon.

757
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:37,000
If you were like a teacher, how could you come to me?

758
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
A teacher?

759
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
What?

760
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Did you know?

761
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Hey, hey.

762
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Hey, why are you so early?

763
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Hey, what do you want to do?

764
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
What should we do?

765
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Should we go see a movie?

766
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I saw it yesterday.

767
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
It's a little lower than 9 years old.

768
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Hello, Weekly Sports 24th.

769
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I'm the announcer, Hyewon.

770
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
It's my first time.

771
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I'm honored to be the MC of the 24th Weekly Sports, which I was a fan of.

772
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I'll do my best to not be embarrassed by the title of the title of the NBA Sports Chaeyeon.

773
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Please look forward to it.

774
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Hello?

775
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Hello?

776
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Hey, are you listening?

777
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Hello?

778
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Hello?

779
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Hello?

780
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Hello?

781
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Hello?

782
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Hello?

783
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Hello?

784
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Hello?

785
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Hello?

786
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Hello?

787
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Hello?

788
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Hello?

789
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Hello?

790
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Hello?

791
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Hello?

792
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Hello?

793
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Hello?

794
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Hello?

795
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Hello?

796
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,000
When are you going?

797
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Oh, at 7 o'clock.

798
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
I'm on my way to the viewing area, too.

799
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Do you want me to take you down?

800
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Where are you going?

801
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Let's eat together.

802
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I have a promise.

803
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Who?

804
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
A friend?

805
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
You're not a girlfriend, are you?

806
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
It's the same in the afternoon and in the cafe.

807
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
You're going first.

808
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
What are you doing?

809
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,000
When did you stop breaking up with me?

810
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Why are you crying so much now?

811
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:14,000
I never broke up. I told you to go.

812
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Are you kidding me?

813
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I didn't mean to end it.

814
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:26,000
I meant to come back.

815
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
You're amazing.

816
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Han Yura.

817
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:41,000
You're still in the viewing area.

818
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
I'm begging you.

819
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Please don't come back.

820
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Don't pretend you know me.

821
00:57:52,000 --> 00:58:02,000
I don't have any connections to you.

822
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Hanyang.

823
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Hwang Jaeyeol.

824
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
If you're this good, that's enough.

825
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
I'll accept you for getting angry.

826
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
So stop it now.

827
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Didn't you hear what I said earlier?

828
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Why are you doing this to me again?

829
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I miss you.

830
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,000
You missed me, too.

831
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
That's why you're angry like this.

832
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,000
You didn't have any feelings for me.

833
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
There's no reason to be angry like this.

834
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:20,000
No?

835
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:30,000
You can't forget me.

836
00:59:50,000 --> 01:00:00,000
I'm begging you.

837
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:30,000
I'm begging you.

838
01:00:50,000 --> 01:01:00,000
I'm begging you.

839
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I'm begging you.

840
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:20,000
I'm begging you.

841
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:50,000
I miss you.

842
01:01:50,000 --> 01:02:00,000
I miss you.

843
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:10,000
I think I've seen you before.

844
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:22,000
You are the shining star.

845
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:32,000
You are the shining star.

846
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
What do you mean?

847
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
What do you mean?

848
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
What do you mean?

849
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
What?

850
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
What do you mean?

851
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
You're not a real bandit.

852
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
You're pretty.

853
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Hurry up.

854
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:54,000
I heard you were sick today.

855
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,000
To tell you that it's a confession, it's like an air confession.

856
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Did you really start love at first?

857
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Then would you come up on the stage?
