"Peng"!

17

- There you "peng" again! - My God!

18

"Penging" every tile!

Two of "bings".

20
00:01:51,848 --> 00:01:54,152
- Do it quickly! - Easy, boy.

21

Two of "bings".

22

- "Gang"! - Again?

25
00:02:10,257 --> 00:02:11,335
You got it?

26
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,575
"Chi", "peng", "gang". You did everything!

27
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,474
Four of "tiaos".

28
00:02:15,896 --> 00:02:18,567
Can't believe it. Now, will you "peng" again?

29
00:02:21,005 --> 00:02:21,997
Too difficult.

30
00:02:23,606 --> 00:02:25,613
- Throw it out! - Don't rush me.

31
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:28,081
- Seven of "tiaos". - "Hu"!

32
00:02:28,862 --> 00:02:31,291
- You win again? – How did he win?

33
00:02:32,243 --> 00:02:33,555
He's won seven times.

34
00:02:34,102 --> 00:02:35,680
- Let's shuffle them. - Okay.

35
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,126
- Five of "tiaos". - "Chi"!

36
00:02:44,151 --> 00:02:44,869
"Peng"!

37
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:48,165
Sorry, I have to "peng".

00:02:52,626 --> 00:02:53,516
Three of "bings".

39
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,743

Whiteboard.

00:03:08,896 --> 00:03:10,880
- Win by myself. "A Dragon". - What?

43
00:03:13,104 --> 00:03:15,416
- You've won again?! - I can't play it!

44
00:03:15,619 --> 00:03:16,642
What a game!

45
00:03:18,212 --> 00:03:20,102
- Is it okay? - Should be.

46
00:03:20,126 --> 00:03:21,251
It's okay.

47
00:03:21,524 --> 00:03:23,539
- You're a master of mahjong. - Hey.

48
00:03:23,773 --> 00:03:25,851
There was no cheating, was there?

49
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,138
He needn't cheat.

50
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,403
- He has a good memory. - Really?

51
00:03:30,427 --> 00:03:31,020
Yes.

52
00:03:31,864 --> 00:03:33,465
Can he remember all his tiles?

53
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,996
Not only his own tiles,

54
00:03:35,332 --> 00:03:38,324
but all your discarded tiles.

55
00:03:38,348 --> 00:03:39,566
- Really? - Sure.

56
00:03:39,707 --> 00:03:41,910
We depend on luck when we play mahjong.

57
00:03:42,371 --> 00:03:43,628
He doesn't.

58
00:03:44,581 --> 00:03:45,917
He depends on his memory.

59
00:03:46,144 --> 00:03:48,198
- Incredible! - Gosh!

60
00:03:50,168 --> 00:03:52,863
He's got a photographic memory. Do you believe it?

61
00:03:55,496 --> 00:03:56,824
It's not true.

62
00:03:57,628 --> 00:03:59,143
I depend on luck too.

63
00:03:59,245 --> 00:04:01,065
I was very lucky today.

64
00:04:01,089 --> 00:04:02,690
You were too lucky today!

65
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:04,892
I'll never play it with you.

66
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:07,783
Let's eat!

67
00:04:08,471 --> 00:04:10,166
I've won a lot of money.

68
00:04:17,955 --> 00:04:18,931
Twelve thousand.

69
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,860
What a wife I have!

70
00:04:26,284 --> 00:04:29,284
If you say that word again, I'll castrate you.

71
00:04:29,526 --> 00:04:30,322
Castrate me?

72
00:04:30,736 --> 00:04:33,314
Then you need a huge box to place my thing.

73
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:39,518
You slap me?

74
00:04:41,065 --> 00:04:42,815
Help me, Yinzi.

75
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:46,938
- Leave my back. - I won't leave until you help me.

76
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,914
Leave my back. Let's talk.

77
00:04:49,242 --> 00:04:51,046
You'll run away when I release you.

78
00:04:51,218 --> 00:04:53,960
Why should I run away? Release me, please.

79
00:04:57,368 --> 00:04:58,055
Talk now.

80
00:04:58,313 --> 00:05:01,344
- Is You Qi crazy now? - What?

81
00:05:01,547 --> 00:05:03,414
He's been fastening on me lately.

82
00:05:03,968 --> 00:05:06,452
But he treated me badly,

83
00:05:06,882 --> 00:05:09,202
- and made fun of me every time. - Really?

84
00:05:09,732 --> 00:05:10,966
If I fall out with him,

85
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:13,560
it's too extreme.

86
00:05:14,521 --> 00:05:15,864
If I don't stop him,

87
00:05:16,653 --> 00:05:17,927
he'll be relentless.

88
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,066
- Has You Qi been fastening on you? - Yes.

89
00:05:22,168 --> 00:05:24,746
He may even come to me at break.

90
00:05:24,871 --> 00:05:26,480
Look, look.

91
00:05:27,917 --> 00:05:30,049
He's staring at me unkindly.

92
00:05:30,299 --> 00:05:32,939
- I think he's not. - Help me, Yinzi.

93
00:05:41,815 --> 00:05:43,471
For a long time without ice-cream.

94
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:45,415
And I miss it.

95
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,493
Is it delicious?

96
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:52,051
Wait, I can taste it for you.

97
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:01,439
Yes, it's delicious.

98
00:06:07,063 --> 00:06:07,883
May I...

99
00:06:08,555 --> 00:06:10,414
...take one bite? Okay?

100
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:12,960
It's yours now.

101
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:14,233
Great.

102
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,248
There's Yinzi's saliva in the ice-cream,

103
00:06:17,951 --> 00:06:19,443
and you're eating it.

104
00:06:19,467 --> 00:06:20,170
Delicious.

105
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,550
You're eating it!

106
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,898
Listen, why did you give it to him?

107
00:06:31,718 --> 00:06:33,718
No big deal. You ate it, too.

108
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,287
I'm different from him.

109
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:38,419
Gu Hai, don't fuss about it.

110

= Class 27 of Senior Two =

111
00:06:44,167 --> 00:06:45,346
He can't see us now.

112
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:49,487
You said You Qi had been ridiculing you lately,

113
00:06:50,581 --> 00:06:53,666
- Did you offend him? - I didn't.

114
00:06:54,182 --> 00:06:56,689
- You've been with us lately, haven't you? - Yes.

115
00:06:57,431 --> 00:06:58,954
I don't know what's wrong with him.

116
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,360
I have to run away hurriedly after school now…

117
00:07:01,656 --> 00:07:04,452
…to avoid being stopped by him at the gate.

118
00:07:05,436 --> 00:07:07,771
If he just wants to beat me up, it's okay.

119
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:08,928
But he doesn't.

120
00:07:10,443 --> 00:07:12,146
He just likes to keep scolding me.

121
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,505
It's awkward...

122
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:16,442
I can't describe it.

123
00:07:18,465 --> 00:07:19,207
Look,

124
00:07:19,746 --> 00:07:21,542
he's scolding me again...

125
00:07:22,284 --> 00:07:23,417
He isn't.

126
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:26,080
What happened?

127
00:07:27,971 --> 00:07:29,260
Why isn't he scolding me?

128
00:07:29,923 --> 00:07:31,712
Forget it. Back to the classroom.

129
00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:34,079
Class begins now, everyone.

130
00:07:35,352 --> 00:07:38,992
Take out yesterday's paper. I'll explain it.

131
00:07:42,524 --> 00:07:43,828
Where's my paper?

132
00:07:46,498 --> 00:07:49,115
- I passed it to you just now. - Passed it?

133
00:07:57,215 --> 00:07:59,035
- Give it to me. - I haven't got it.

134
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:01,386
You've got two of them.

135
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:04,713
Why were you not here just now?

136
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,892
Keep talking outside.

137
00:08:07,322 --> 00:08:08,212
Just talk.

138
00:08:08,736 --> 00:08:09,704
Forget the paper.

139
00:08:26,938 --> 00:08:28,398
Yang Meng, you've got a visitor.

140
00:08:36,922 --> 00:08:37,703
You Qi,

141
00:08:39,242 --> 00:08:40,679
What’s wrong with you and Yang?

142
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,069
- Yang Meng? - Yeah.

143
00:08:44,295 --> 00:08:45,763
What do you mean?

144
00:08:47,036 --> 00:08:49,981
- He said you'd been fastening on him. - Fastening on him?

145
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:53,067
Why am I fastening on him for no reason?

146
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,402
he said you always intercepted him after school.

147
00:08:58,135 --> 00:08:59,299
Intercepted him?

148
00:09:00,337 --> 00:09:02,196
Is he out of his mind?

149
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:03,891
As you can see,

150
00:09:04,383 --> 00:09:05,929
I haven't even talked to him today.

151
00:09:06,062 --> 00:09:07,819
It's him who is always insane.

152
00:09:07,844 --> 00:09:09,000
Gentlemen,

153
00:09:09,421 --> 00:09:10,686
can you keep quiet?

154
00:09:35,482 --> 00:09:38,864
It's okay. He's a boarder who isn't allowed to leave school now.

155
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:40,006
Nothing to worry about.

156
00:09:40,302 --> 00:09:41,153
No.

157
00:09:41,364 --> 00:09:44,315
When I went to your house last time, he followed me all the way.

158
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,199
No, I have to go with you.

159
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,987
It’s not same last time.

160
00:09:48,275 --> 00:09:51,753
Leaving school will let him be punished and stay in a hotel.

161
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:55,102
- He won't do it for scolding you. - I'll go with you anyway.

162
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,860
We've been together since kindergarten.

163
00:09:57,884 --> 00:09:59,587
It's a long time.

164
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,062
Thinking of that makes me sad.

165
00:10:02,086 --> 00:10:04,375
I feel lonely recently.

166
00:10:04,507 --> 00:10:07,046
It's hard for me to walk all the way alone every day.

167
00:10:08,053 --> 00:10:09,545
Okay, let's go together.

168
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:11,965
Will you go with us?

169
00:10:18,254 --> 00:10:20,066
What's wrong with him?

170
00:10:20,925 --> 00:10:23,057
- Why is he always upset? - Never mind.

171
00:10:25,104 --> 00:10:26,846
Leave him alone. Let's go.

172
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:48,912
Go inside.

173
00:10:53,341 --> 00:10:54,645
It's enough.

174
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,481
Okay, stand here.

175
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,903
Hi, my boy. Where's Gu Hai?

176
00:11:26,627 --> 00:11:27,931
Yinzi, come out.

177
00:11:36,355 --> 00:11:37,355
What's problem?

178
00:11:38,261 --> 00:11:39,917
Why didn't you ask Hai in?

179
00:11:40,511 --> 00:11:42,136
Did he offend you?

180
00:11:42,948 --> 00:11:47,112
As I said, you have always been a stubborn boy.

181
00:11:48,783 --> 00:11:50,525
Gu Hai is a good boy.

182
00:11:50,884 --> 00:11:52,618
I haven't got such a good brother.

183
00:11:52,993 --> 00:11:55,039
- If I... - I did ask him in.

184
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:56,757
But he refused.

185
00:11:57,405 --> 00:12:01,382
- You must have upset him. - I haven't.

186
00:12:03,084 --> 00:12:04,919
Anyway, ask him in now.

187
00:12:05,662 --> 00:12:06,435
I won't.

188
00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:09,751
Okay, I'll do it.

189
00:12:10,337 --> 00:12:11,672
No..

190
00:12:15,396 --> 00:12:16,364
Gu Hai,

191
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,099
you're a bastard.

192
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:21,285
Hai,

193
00:12:21,973 --> 00:12:22,832
come in.

194
00:12:23,027 --> 00:12:25,659
Forgive my stubborn boy.

195
00:12:25,683 --> 00:12:27,245
Dad, leave him alone.

196
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:29,831
- Let him stand here. - You should be standing here.

197
00:12:30,112 --> 00:12:32,385
Don't worry about me, sir,

198
00:12:32,822 --> 00:12:33,970
It's very cool...

199
00:12:34,681 --> 00:12:35,477
...to stand here.

200
00:12:35,884 --> 00:12:37,016
Aren't you coming in?

201
00:12:37,555 --> 00:12:38,953
But you told me to stand here.

202
00:12:39,398 --> 00:12:42,374
Leave him alone, dad. Let's go back to the house.

203
00:12:42,866 --> 00:12:45,217
- Ask him in... - Don't worry, dad.

204
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:05,288
Come in.

205
00:13:11,012 --> 00:13:12,254
How long do you want to stand?

206
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:14,901
Get inside.

207
00:13:31,925 --> 00:13:34,018
When did you plug it in?

208
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:36,253
Use it, or give back to me.

209
00:13:36,979 --> 00:13:38,275
Your hand is so cold.

210
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:43,181
You were standing outside and my dad was upset.

211
00:13:43,206 --> 00:13:44,534
How could I stay in my room?

212
00:13:49,713 --> 00:13:51,056
- Don't move. - I'm fine.

213
00:13:51,523 --> 00:13:52,195
Don't move.

214
00:14:03,656 --> 00:14:05,491
Yinzi, what happened to your foot?

215
00:14:06,991 --> 00:14:07,858
You don't know?

216
00:14:08,678 --> 00:14:10,842
Someone went crazy and gave me a kick.

217
00:14:12,805 --> 00:14:15,312
- Does it hurt? - Of course it hurts.

218
00:14:16,859 --> 00:14:18,226
Stop! My dad is there.

219
00:14:19,219 --> 00:14:21,094
I don't care. I want to kiss it.

220
00:14:21,586 --> 00:14:22,769
I feel guilty.

221
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:27,451
I'm just kidding. It doesn't hurt at all.

222
00:14:28,162 --> 00:14:29,685
It's normal for me.

223
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:32,176
I'm fine. Leave it alone.

224
00:14:33,621 --> 00:14:34,527
Gu Hai!

225
00:14:42,378 --> 00:14:43,798
It was my fault.

226
00:14:44,276 --> 00:14:45,190
I know it.

227
00:14:46,979 --> 00:14:48,650
I shouldn't have offended your buddy.

228
00:14:49,713 --> 00:14:50,869
But, Yinzi,

229
00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:55,956
It's true that I could hardly control myself.

230
00:14:57,613 --> 00:14:59,183
I'm extremely insecure.

231
00:15:02,107 --> 00:15:03,972
If you can give me a clear answer,

232
00:15:04,724 --> 00:15:05,974
I won't mess around like this.

233
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:07,692
Insecure?

234
00:15:08,434 --> 00:15:10,691
We provide you with free food every day.

235
00:15:11,215 --> 00:15:12,691
What else do you want?

236
00:15:20,659 --> 00:15:21,909
You know what I want.

237
00:15:22,331 --> 00:15:23,073
Yinzi.

238
00:15:24,237 --> 00:15:24,987
Gu Hai.

239
00:15:25,526 --> 00:15:26,658
Stop! Gu Hai.

240
00:15:33,151 --> 00:15:34,127
Gu Hai.

241
00:15:36,627 --> 00:15:38,806
I want you, really.

242
00:15:40,298 --> 00:15:41,657
Please stop.

243
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,137
I really want you.

244
00:15:48,816 --> 00:15:49,808
Never again!

245
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,877
If you want to have the feeling of security from here,

246
00:15:54,424 --> 00:15:55,736
you'll never get it.

247
00:15:56,502 --> 00:15:57,244
Yinzi,

248
00:15:58,486 --> 00:15:59,400
don't get me wrong.

249
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,593
This is not the reason why I want to be with you.

250
00:16:03,617 --> 00:16:05,101
I'm a normal man, too.

251
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,069
If I like to do this,

252
00:16:07,741 --> 00:16:09,232
I could find a girl.

253
00:16:10,444 --> 00:16:11,319
It's just because...

254
00:16:12,123 --> 00:16:13,677
...I like you too much.

255
00:16:14,436 --> 00:16:15,553
So I can't control myself.

256
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:20,366
In fact, you're the purest boy in my eyes.

257
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,912
- So I'm very reluctant to touch you. - Gu Hai,

258
00:16:24,623 --> 00:16:25,966
Both of us are male.

259
00:16:26,716 --> 00:16:28,919
I can't do that with you.

260
00:16:29,395 --> 00:16:30,277
Then answer me,

261
00:16:31,512 --> 00:16:32,668
do you like me?

262
00:16:33,816 --> 00:16:35,643
You can't ask another boy like this.

263
00:16:36,175 --> 00:16:37,448
But I have to ask.

264
00:16:39,872 --> 00:16:40,957
Do you like me?

265
00:16:44,221 --> 00:16:45,465
Are you stirred a bit by me?

266
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,181
Good Night!

267
00:16:50,714 --> 00:16:53,128
Why are you not willing to admit it?

268
00:16:54,768 --> 00:16:56,197
You know it. Why bother to ask?

269
00:17:10,628 --> 00:17:11,331
Yinzi!

270
00:17:13,994 --> 00:17:14,900
Yinzi!

271
00:17:16,025 --> 00:17:18,306
- Yinzi! - Hurry up. Yang Meng's here.

272
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,736
Him again!

273
00:17:20,978 --> 00:17:24,017
- Listen, be nice to him. - Got it.

274
00:17:24,282 --> 00:17:25,922
- Hurry up. - Yinzi!

275
00:17:27,281 --> 00:17:28,546
Bai Luoyin.

276
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:31,820
Yinzi...

277
00:17:33,413 --> 00:17:34,092
Hi.

278
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:37,908
What're you looking at?

279
00:17:54,544 --> 00:17:56,583
Hey, you two have been living together?

280
00:17:56,973 --> 00:17:58,871
Yeah, almost two months.

281
00:17:58,896 --> 00:18:00,771
But you don't like sleeping with others.

282
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,700
He hasn't got a place to sleep. How can I do?

283
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:06,403
- I have to accept him. - What?

284
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:07,746
Is he...

285
00:18:09,144 --> 00:18:10,573
...the son of your stepfather?

286
00:18:11,447 --> 00:18:13,150
The son of the general?

287
00:18:15,822 --> 00:18:19,564
Has your mom married his dad, or his mom married your dad?

288
00:18:20,251 --> 00:18:21,047
What you think?

289
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,493
My mom has married his dad.

290
00:18:24,055 --> 00:18:27,289
Then why does he live in your house? It's not logical.

291
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:30,429
He can't get along with his dad.

292
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:32,467
I'm mad at my mom.

293
00:18:32,834 --> 00:18:35,568
- So, that's all. - What?

294
00:18:37,443 --> 00:18:38,208
I see.

295
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,408
It's getting colder.

296
00:18:49,018 --> 00:18:51,213
Our dog is getting bigger.

297
00:18:51,471 --> 00:18:52,924
It's time to take a bath for him.

298
00:18:54,275 --> 00:18:55,446
You’ll do it later.

299
00:18:56,775 --> 00:18:58,157
He's dirty.

300
00:18:59,095 --> 00:18:59,915
Alang.

301
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,664
We'll give you a big meal.

302
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:03,961
Look at him.

303
00:19:05,523 --> 00:19:06,429
Alang.

304
00:19:11,137 --> 00:19:11,762
Yinzi.

305
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,183
- What? - Look.

306
00:19:23,552 --> 00:19:25,607
I think they should get married.

307
00:19:27,923 --> 00:19:29,360
Do you think it's very easy?

308
00:19:31,141 --> 00:19:32,617
I hope they'll marry soon.

309
00:19:33,546 --> 00:19:34,678
Why?

310
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,234
If they get married,

311
00:19:36,756 --> 00:19:37,944
you'll become The Extra Man.

312
00:19:39,186 --> 00:19:42,568
Then we can live together in the small house. It'll be great.

313
00:19:46,146 --> 00:19:47,980
Let's go, Alang. Leave the fool alone.

314
00:19:48,231 --> 00:19:49,098
Come on, Alang.

315
00:20:18,622 --> 00:20:19,270
Dad.

316
00:20:21,426 --> 00:20:22,347
Marry her.

317
00:20:23,433 --> 00:20:24,050
What?

318
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:27,572
Marry her.

319
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,494
Yinzi...

320
00:20:36,571 --> 00:20:38,547
Is it a right time to get married now?

321
00:20:44,071 --> 00:20:46,360
We've got through a dozen years of hard life.

322
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:49,203
If I get married now,

323
00:20:51,008 --> 00:20:52,367
I'll feel bad for you.

324
00:20:53,968 --> 00:20:56,639
Nothing will make you feel bad, dad.

325
00:20:58,499 --> 00:21:00,670
You've sacrificed a lot for me all these years.

326
00:21:02,154 --> 00:21:05,005
It's time for you to start a new life now.

327
00:21:08,841 --> 00:21:09,575
Yinzi.

328
00:21:17,452 --> 00:21:18,545
You're the one...

329
00:21:19,209 --> 00:21:20,209
...I love most...

330
00:21:21,138 --> 00:21:22,278
...in my life.

331
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:27,051
Come on, dad.

332
00:21:27,441 --> 00:21:29,495
In fact, I want you to get married.

333
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,018
If you get married,

334
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:34,776
I'll get my freedom.

335
00:21:47,497 --> 00:21:48,684
Help yourselves.

336
00:21:49,168 --> 00:21:51,027
Take care of the guests inside, girl.

337
00:21:54,863 --> 00:21:56,941
Here we are. The last dish.

- Tongtian, call him dad. - Call him dad.

345
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:12,910
It's time to give him a red pocket.

346
00:22:13,871 --> 00:22:15,699
- Call me dad. - Is the money enough?

347
00:22:15,785 --> 00:22:18,809
Does he need more? Then I’ll give him all.

355
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:54,128
No money, no drinking.

358
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:03,988
Come on. Bite it! Bite it...

359
00:23:04,012 --> 00:23:07,215
Bite it! Bite it...

360
00:23:38,642 --> 00:23:41,774
# You carried me on your back, recollecting the past, #

361
00:23:42,461 --> 00:23:45,671
# And stalling for time on your own. #

362
00:23:46,165 --> 00:23:49,766
# I was smiling while listening to you. #

363
00:23:49,985 --> 00:23:53,750
# But a tear-blurred vision faded in. #

364
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:57,422
# You held my hand... #

365
00:23:58,615 --> 00:24:01,185
# ...that had been wavering, #

366
00:24:01,755 --> 00:24:05,208
# Slowly moving forward... #

367
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:09,832
# Slowly moving forward with me... #

368
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:14,040
# Don't say I'd never understand. #

369
00:24:14,183 --> 00:24:17,964
# Don't say I'd never feel the pain. #

370
00:24:18,073 --> 00:24:20,721
# As the wind was blowing over, #

371
00:24:21,151 --> 00:24:26,096
# It left some warmth on my lips. #

372
00:24:26,752 --> 00:24:30,359
# Don't tell me you'll be here with me. #

373
00:24:30,384 --> 00:24:34,266
# I didn't say it because I was stuck in silence. #

374
00:24:34,751 --> 00:24:38,086
# You held my hands too tightly... #

375
00:24:38,532 --> 00:24:41,280
# ...to hear what I was saying. #

376
00:24:41,305 --> 00:24:45,123
# Don't say I'd never feel the pain. #

377
00:24:45,148 --> 00:24:49,030
# Don't say I'd never feel the pain. #

378
00:24:49,055 --> 00:24:51,726
# As the wind was blowing over, #

379
00:24:52,101 --> 00:24:57,038
# It left some warmth on my lips. #

380
00:24:57,694 --> 00:25:01,325
# Don't tell me you'll be here with me. #

381
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:05,467
# I didn't say it because I was stuck in silence. #

382
00:25:05,709 --> 00:25:09,279
# You held my hands too tightly... #

383
00:25:09,568 --> 00:25:13,175
# ...to hear what I was saying: #

384
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,903
# Please, don't go... #
