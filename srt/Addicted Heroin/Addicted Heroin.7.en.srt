Please give me a bunch of them, Sir.

Do you want the hawthorn or yam?

21

How about the hawthorn?

Alright.

Thanks.

Goodbye.

26
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,400
Take it and just eat.

27
00:01:59,955 --> 00:02:01,080
Why did you just get one?

28
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,680
I'm riding the bicycle and I can't eat it.

29
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,760
It's super sweet.

30
00:02:11,376 --> 00:02:12,280
Don't you wanna have a taste?

31
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,680
Taste it.

32
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,200
Give me a bite.

33
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,160
No way.

34
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,600
Go push the car and don't eat.

35
00:02:27,784 --> 00:02:28,840
Come on, let me have a bite.

36
00:02:36,405 --> 00:02:36,880
Is it sweet?

37
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,000
It is.

38
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,000
It's really sweet.

39
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,200
And no seeds at all.

40
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,440
Have another one.

41
00:02:47,757 --> 00:02:48,967
- Just push the bike. - You want to play me again?

42
00:02:48,992 --> 00:02:49,764
Give me one.

43
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,200
Give me one.

44
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,040
No more.

45
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,240
I want to eat it.

46
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,040
Not for you.

47
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,360
Yinzi! Yinzi!

48
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,040
I didn't understand the question.

49
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,120
Could you explain it to me?

50
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,800
This question

51
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,215
needs to solve for all known factors,

52
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,360
then you could get the answer.

53
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,680
I did, but I still can't get it.

54
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,800
Help me out, please.

55
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,240
Firstly, you need to work out the coordinates of E,

56
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,846
M and M minus, AKE equals...

57
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:28,040
Wait, wait. Go slower, please.

58
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,000
Come on. I'll teach you. Come on.

59
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,720
Let me tell you.

60
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,160
Come on.

61
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:37,335
Oh, I understand. I got it.

62
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,020
Thanks, Yinzi.

63
00:03:38,045 --> 00:03:39,135
No, you don't.

64
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,360
You don't get it, I'll help you.

65
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,615
I'm sure you won't get it wrong again.

66
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,379
Come on. You get it?

67
00:03:43,404 --> 00:03:44,440
I get it, I understand.

68
00:03:44,465 --> 00:03:45,135
Can you understand?

69
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:45,387
Yes, I can.

70
00:03:45,412 --> 00:03:45,855
Can you solve it?

71
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,415
Yes, I can, I can.

72
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,074
Will you get it wrong again?

73
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,400
Will you get it wrong again?

74
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,440
Have some more of this.

75
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,120
It helps get rid of toxins.

76
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,640
Okay.

77
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,920
Hai still doesn't agree to come back, dose he?

78
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,040
Don't talk about that lad.

79
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,120
I'm telling you,

80
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,240
if I don't teach him a lesson,

81
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,040
he'll never know how good he has it.

82
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,600
How about this? I'll go talk to him.

83
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,440
Don't do that.

84
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,760
He won't be nice to you.

85
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,600
It's because he isn't nice to me,

86
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,440
that I want to speak with him.

87
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,920
That's how you can settle this matter between you two.

88
00:04:27,945 --> 00:04:29,720
Forget it, don't worry about him.

89
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,135
Worry about your own son.

90
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,858
He's been living

91
00:04:33,883 --> 00:04:34,880
under hard conditions.

92
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,440
It's only proper to have him move in.

93
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,840
If he doesn't want to live in our house,

94
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,040
we can arrange an apartment for him.

95
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:46,493
Isn't our place over by Guomao bridge empty?

96
00:04:46,641 --> 00:04:48,360
If there's no other option, he can move into that one.

97
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,800
We can't do that.

98
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,640
That apartment is for Hai.

99
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,320
If you let Luoyin live into it,

100
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,200
Hai would fight you to the death.

101
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,640
Forget it.

102
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,774
He is not going to come back to live in that way,

103
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,159
why should I keep an apartment for him?

104
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,760
I'd better talk to him.

105
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,329
Fine.

106
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,480
What about Luoyin?

107
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,160
I'm at the end of my rope with that child.

108
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,800
He won't even meet with me.

109
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,720
How about I speak with him?

110
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,040
I'll talk with him.

111
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,920
The child is extremely stubborn.

112
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,080
Please don't get tough with him.

113
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,080
Don't worry. I got it.

114
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,440
I'll peel you a crab.

115
00:05:44,563 --> 00:05:44,880
Alright.

116
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,788
Where's the cheapest place to get clothes in Beijing?

117
00:05:53,813 --> 00:05:54,533
Near the zoo.

118
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,570
Come to get some clothes with me tomorrow.

119
00:05:57,865 --> 00:05:58,280
Okay.

120
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,280
Can you bargain? Teach me.

121
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,200
No need to learn that.

122
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,640
You'll get it naturally once you're there.

123
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,680
How much is this, Lady?

124
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,840
This one? I won't sell it for less than 39.

125
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,040
I'm a vendor.

126
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,670
A vendor?

127
00:06:27,695 --> 00:06:28,935
Vendor price is 20.

128
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,455
Fifteen.

129
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,680
Impossible.

130
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:31,879
Just forget it.

131
00:06:31,904 --> 00:06:34,395
Hey! Don't leave, young man.

132
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,935
If you really want it,

133
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,320
let's talk it over.

134
00:06:37,395 --> 00:06:38,795
No way.  Let's go.

135
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Okay, okay, okay.

136
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,480
Choose whatever you like.

137
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,160
Young man,

138
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,800
you are too good at bargaining.

139
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,560
I'll take that one.

140
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,520
Okay.

141
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,400
Want anything else?

142
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,280
No.

143
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,800
Lady, how much is that?

144
00:07:06,573 --> 00:07:08,600
This? At least two hundred.

145
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,400
Two hundred?

146
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,440
I'm a vendor.

147
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,480
How about 15?

148
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,360
A vendor?

149
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,735
Are you trying to rob me? I'm not selling to you.

150
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,000
15? You must be kidding.

151
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,503
No, if you don't give it to me for 15, I'll leave.

152
00:07:26,528 --> 00:07:28,680
Get out of here.

153
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,135
You're crazy.

154
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,200
Do you think I have grass in my cotton padded jacket?

155
00:07:34,825 --> 00:07:35,934
You don't wanna sell it?

156
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,200
Just forget it.

157
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,480
General, your guest is here.

158
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,960
Come in.

159
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,120
Come on, boy, take a sit.

160
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,455
I think

161
00:08:04,846 --> 00:08:07,475
you've already guessed my purpose of bringing you here today.

162
00:08:13,991 --> 00:08:16,711
I'm your mother's current husband

163
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,280
which means I'm your stepfather.

164
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,160
Your mother went to see you before

165
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,377
and wanted you to move in with us.

166
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,160
You turned her down.

167
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,799
I already guessed this would be the result.

168
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,679
So my main goal today is,

169
00:08:37,135 --> 00:08:38,520
as an elder,

170
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,760
to put forth some views

171
00:08:42,551 --> 00:08:43,671
on your life and studies.

172
00:08:43,696 --> 00:08:46,000
No, I shouldn't call them views.

173
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,440
These're only suggestions.

174
00:08:48,135 --> 00:08:48,760
Thanks.

175
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,640
Come on, have some tea.

176
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:02,640
Right, young man should have some stubbornness in him.

177
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,520
You're like my son in that way.

178
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,740
To be honest,

179
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,760
you're the same age as my son.

180
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,480
He is also very stubborn

181
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,520
and he rarely listens to my suggestions.

182
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,280
But usually, he can calmly come to a conclusion

183
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:21,480
in the face of important matters concerning his well-being,

184
00:09:22,381 --> 00:09:23,320
As men as us,

185
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,040
we shouldn't live

186
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,240
for the trifles, right?

187
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,080
Even if it's for your father,

188
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,833
I think you shouldn't

189
00:09:33,858 --> 00:09:35,960
confine yourself to those circumstances.

190
00:09:36,146 --> 00:09:37,586
You may see it as

191
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,440
a responsibility or loyalty to your loved ones.

192
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,200
But actually, it is a covert deprivation.

193
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,320
It doesn't matter if you disagree on this point.

194
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,400
Let me put it this way,

195
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,880
I can help you

196
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,160
make a better-quality living situation.

197
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,000
You can choose not to accept,

198
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,000
but I think

199
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,480
you shouldn't let such a great opportunity slip by.

200
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,438
If you're smart enough,

201
00:10:12,463 --> 00:10:14,023
you shouldn't hold a grudge against your mother.

202
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,040
You should have all that she has

203
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,120
to make up for all that you lost for the years.

204
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,840
This, of course, isn't a gift,

205
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,450
nor is it pity.

206
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,280
This is something you should have.

207
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,000
If you don't cherish this,

208
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,194
then that means you're not yet mature enough

209
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,160
instead of meaning you have a courageous spirit.

210
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,480
I think you've misunderstood.

211
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,760
What have I misunderstood?

212
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,760
I've never intended to ask Jiang Yuan for anything,

213
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,360
because I've never seen her as my mother.

214
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,600
If there's nothing else,

215
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,745
I'm going back to class.

216
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,331
Luoyin,

217
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,055
you know it deep down

218
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,320
whether you've seen her as your mother or not.

219
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,840
If one day you become successful,

220
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,440
the one who will benefit from it is not me or your mother.

221
00:11:07,651 --> 00:11:08,320
Thank you.

222
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,240
I think I'm a talented person.

223
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,600
Even if I don't take any shortcuts,

224
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,320
I will make something of myself.

225
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,520
How do you feel now?

226
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,760
It's fine, I think.

227
00:11:33,027 --> 00:11:34,987
After all, I'm a little weak since I'm old.

228
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,762
I'm fine.

229
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,320
Your son is back

230
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,520
- Hey, you're back. - Dad

231
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,120
Dahai!

232
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:45,695
Sir!

233
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,208
Don't leave today, just stay for dinner.

234
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,320
Okay. Since you've already said it,

235
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,480
I'll feel embarrassed if I still go.

236
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:52,866
It's fine.

237
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,200
Your auntie is making dinner today. He won't be maltreated.

238
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,440
Today, don't let Auntie make dinner anymore. You should do it.

239
00:12:01,116 --> 00:12:02,600
This child...

240
00:12:07,681 --> 00:12:08,080
Let's eat.

241
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,600
Dahai.

242
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,880
Have a drink with Sir.

243
00:12:15,905 --> 00:12:16,400
Okay.

244
00:12:19,216 --> 00:12:19,576
Come on.

245
00:12:30,432 --> 00:12:32,552
We haven't eaten yet, and you guys are drinking too much already.

246
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,920
Let's stop drinking already.

247
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,525
- Forget it, let's put it away. - Put it away.

248
00:12:36,612 --> 00:12:37,492
Come on.

249
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:40,280
Come on and have more, Dahai.

250
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,564
Why did you drink that much when you haven't eaten anything yet?

251
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:42,640
Just have more.

252
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,040
Get the hell out of here.

253
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:53,520
I'm drunk.

254
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,720
Stop kidding me.

255
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,920
Who are you kidding? Get up.

256
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,494
Don't be shameless when I'm still keeping my cool.

257
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,199
Come on, get up, get up.

258
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:08,664
What the heck?

259
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,360
I'm really drunk.

260
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,600
What do you want?

261
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,880
It's gonna be August 15 soon.

262
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,240
How do you guys celebrate August 15 in your family?

263
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,000
My family doesn't celebrate August 15.

264
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,520
Maybe we'll buy two pieces of moon cake at most.

265
00:13:48,354 --> 00:13:49,240
What about your family?

266
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,560
We're also eating some moon cakes.

267
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,360
What flavor of moon cake do you like to eat?

268
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,480
Egg-yolk lotus seed paste.

269
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,040
Bai Luoyin,

270
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,640
why did the teacher look for you today?

271
00:14:07,665 --> 00:14:09,200
You insisted on staying here tonight

272
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,760
just to ask me this, did you?

273
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,168
Not really. I'm just afraid

274
00:14:12,169 --> 00:14:14,240
that you'll get sick if you don't let it out.

275
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,680
I did tell you before

276
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,920
that my mother has remarried, right?

277
00:14:21,351 --> 00:14:21,951
Yes, you said that.

278
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,920
Today, that guy came to talk with me.

279
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,560
He told me to move back in with them.

280
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,584
Did you say yes to him?

281
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,080
Of course, I didn't.

282
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,375
The thing I cannot accept the most is

283
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,640
the tone of his words.

284
00:14:35,512 --> 00:14:36,952
He compared me to his son.

285
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,080
He praised his son like a golden boy

286
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,600
to make me look like someone who is shortsighted.

287
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,160
I'm telling you, I'm also sick of this kind of people.

288
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,495
I'm telling you, just leave him alone.

289
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,760
If you're annoyed with him, then curse him.

290
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:51,371
Curse that his son who is gonna hit by a car

291
00:14:51,372 --> 00:14:52,824
and become paralyzed tomorrow.

292
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,040
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

293
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,480
I was just sitting here, and that thing fell.

294
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,640
Are you okay?

295
00:15:07,193 --> 00:15:08,280
You're even laughing.

296
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,760
I'm telling you, stop hugging me.

297
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,480
What's wrong with hugging you?

298
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,560
It's gross.

299
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,120
What are you doing?

300
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,610
I just want to warm my hands.

301
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,735
Let go.

302
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,266
I'm not letting go.

303
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:28,969
- Come on, let go. - I won't.

304
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,480
I'll make you fall.

305
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,440
Even if I fall, I won't let go.

306
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,962
= Class 27 of Senior Two =

307
00:15:37,017 --> 00:15:38,657
Gu Hai, someone is asking for you.

308
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,520
I won't help you to go.

309
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,440
Let the one who likes to help you carry you.

310
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,360
I finally found you, my little master.

311
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,880
What are you doing here?

312
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,840
I have something to do with you.

313
00:16:34,102 --> 00:16:35,360
Come on, let's talk inside the car.

314
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,320
Let's talk about it here.

315
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,640
I don't have the time to go out with you.

316
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,326
The problem is it's not me who wants to talk to you.

317
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,320
Then just go back.

318
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:44,920
General  has already said

319
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,800
I should not think of going back anymore if I couldn't get you.

320
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,560
What would you like to drink?

321
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,640
I don't want to drink anything.

322
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,040
Just get to the point.

323
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,319
Here is the thing. Your father and I have decided...

324
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,280
If it's about making me go back home, then you can save it.

325
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,640
I'm not going back with you.

326
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,620
You misunderstood.

327
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,240
What your dad and I have decided is

328
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,560
for you to go back home, while we will move out.

329
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,800
Thus,

330
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,240
it's better than leaving you alone outside.

331
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,839
Even if the outside world is good,

332
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:24,764
it's not as good as home, is it?

333
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,855
Besides this,

334
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,400
your mother lived in that house for so many years.

335
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,880
You surely have feelings for that house.

336
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,022
Does it have anything to do with you

337
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,000
that when and how

338
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,360
I will go back home?

339
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,760
I realized that you are really very similar to my son.

340
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,680
You can choke someone with your words.

341
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,480
Don't get me wrong.

342
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,280
It's just

343
00:17:56,226 --> 00:17:57,405
that I don't know what to say to you

344
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,680
every time I see you.

345
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,560
My relationship with my son is also like this.

346
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,720
Whatever I say,

347
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,240
he always has a hostile attitude.

348
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,120
It looks like I'm not very good at communicating

349
00:18:12,121 --> 00:18:13,080
with your generation.

350
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,760
I will learn diligently

351
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,040
try to understand it more.

352
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:17,880
Have you finished?

353
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,520
If you've  finished, I'm gonna leave.

354
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,077
Please wait a little more.

355
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,200
Even though you've never treated me as a mother,

356
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,480
I've already treated you as a son.

357
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,440
If you still don't like me,

358
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,760
I can move out first.

359
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,000
I could move back after your college entrance examination.

360
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,522
You are ridiculous.

361
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,920
If you really have this sincerity,

362
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,120
then why did you still marry my dad?

363
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,194
= Moon Cake =

364
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,240
I bought you some moon cake.

365
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,840
You can keep it for yourself.

366
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,120
I especially bought it for you.

367
00:19:11,145 --> 00:19:12,225
Don't you really want to taste it?

368
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,000
You could buy it for anyone you like,

369
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,680
I already told you I don't want to eat...

370
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,880
How was it? Delicious, right?

371
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,800
I went to several stores,

372
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,360
but only this store was willing to make it.

373
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,400
There are twelve yolks in it.

374
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,680
You can eat enough at a time.

375
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,480
Are you stupid?

376
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,840
You could just buy several small ones

377
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,000
instead of working so hard to buy this big one.

378
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,920
We can eat like a horse.

379
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,760
I want to have one with you.

380
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,640
This is the most suitable one.

381
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,840
I've been keeping something from you.

382
00:20:08,312 --> 00:20:09,672
Are you gonna say

383
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,280
that the house you're living in is just a rental?

384
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,440
How could you know that?

385
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,168
There's a couple

386
00:20:18,193 --> 00:20:19,680
living beside the house you've rent,

387
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,080
and one is my grand Uncle, the other is my grand aunt.

388
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,000
Do you also want to tell me

389
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,280
that you actually come from a rich family?

390
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,600
Aren't you gonna ask how I knew about it?

391
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,880
How could you know that?

392
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,440
When the school year started,

393
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,360
I had seen your driver pick you up at the gate every day.

394
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:49,320
And when you transferred to the desk behind me,

395
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,400
I saw you

396
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,520
wearing a limited-edition watch.

397
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,202
Laugh? I'll let you laugh.

398
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,398
Laugh? I'll let you laugh.

399
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,720
Don't you dare play dirty with me?

400
00:21:06,247 --> 00:21:07,567
Who lied first?

401
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,226
Fine.

402
00:21:11,023 --> 00:21:13,226
I got to admit my mistake first.

403
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,680
I lied to you first,

404
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,440
but you also did something wrong.

405
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,320
You must not indulge in shielding the prisoner.

406
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,000
How about this?

407
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,240
Don't also be mad about this,

408
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,480
and don't distance yourself from me just because of this.

409
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,200
We're even now.

410
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,600
Are you really mad?

411
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,320
I'm not the person who likes to get mad.

412
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,080
How could you think of me like a girl?

413
00:21:49,922 --> 00:21:51,840
What I said that day when I was drunk

414
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,080
were for her and her family.

415
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,600
I don't hate rich people.

416
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,648
There are so many luxurious cars right on the street,

417
00:22:00,673 --> 00:22:02,320
could I break every single one of them?

418
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,920
Why didn't you say it earlier?

419
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,320
You didn't give me the chance to say it.

420
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,550
# You carried me on your back, recollecting the past, #

421
00:22:18,396 --> 00:22:21,682
# And stalling for time on your own. #

422
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:25,750
# I was smiling while listening to you. #

423
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:29,940
# But a tear-blurred vision faded in. #

424
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:36,920
# You held my hand that had been wavering, #

425
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:41,230
# Slowly moving forward... #

426
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:45,910
# Slowly moving forward with me... #

427
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:49,980
# Don't say I'd never understand. #

428
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,880
# Don't say I'd never feel the pain. #

429
00:22:53,946 --> 00:22:57,056
# As the wind was blowing over, #

430
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:02,240
# It left some warmth on my lips. #

431
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,030
# Don't tell me you'll be here with me. #

432
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:10,160
# I didn't say it because I was stuck in silence. #

433
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:17,150
# You held my hands too tightly to hear what I was saying. #

434
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:20,990
# Don't say I'd never understand. #

435
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:24,860
# Don't say I'd never feel the pain. #

436
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:28,000
# As the wind was blowing over, #

437
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,900
# It left some warmth on my lips. #

438
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,960
# Don't tell me you'll be here with me. #

439
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,160
# I didn't say it because I was stuck in silence. #

440
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:49,070
# You held my hands too tightly to hear what I was saying: #

441
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,790
# Please, don't go... #
