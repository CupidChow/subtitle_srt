It's 5:20 am. It's still early.

17
00:01:58,732 --> 00:01:59,732
It's snowing.

18
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,440
Why did you come outside? It's so cold.

19
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,768
Get your ass back inside!

20
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,979
Why don't you put some more clothes on before you go out?

21
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,848
Come on, let's go.

22
00:02:47,521 --> 00:02:48,121
Sit!

23
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,120
I was almost frozen to death.

00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,200
Why are you sweating?

25
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,640
There was a car accident on the way

26
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,800
which caused a congestion.

27
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,240
I got out of the car and had to run    a bit.

28
00:03:15,602 --> 00:03:17,169
What? Were you moved?

29
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,760
If you are touched, you should let me do it.

30
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,484
Gu Hai, one day your filthy mouth is gonna get you in trouble!

31
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,000
Gu Hai.

32
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,549
Yinzi, you're so nice to me.

33
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,480
Not as nice as the way you treat me.

34
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,600
How nice do I treat you?

35
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,994
You're nice to me in a stupid foolish way.

36
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,520
You're the stupid one.

37

What do you want to eat?

38
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,480
Everything is ok, whatever do you want?

39
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,279
I think it's Christmas Eve.

40
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,440
Seems like it.

41
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,230

42

Thank you.

45
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,560
A girl gave me this scarf

46
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,400
and she said she had knitted it for me.

47
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,280
What do you think she means?

48
00:05:08,385 --> 00:05:09,745
Apparently, she has a crush on you.

49
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,240
So... Should I put it on? Or...

50
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,384
Should I give it back to her?

51
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,960
She made it for me.

52
00:05:16,985 --> 00:05:18,384
Don't you think it would be cruel to return it?

53
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,015
Don't ask me for advice on your own business.

54
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,400
Then I'll wear it then.

55
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,152
Turn around and see if it looks good on me.

56
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,840
I guess I should give it back.

57
00:05:46,344 --> 00:05:49,511
I shouldn't give her false hope if I don't like her.

58
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,240
I couldn't think of something good to give you,

59
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,520
so I got you these gloves.

60
00:06:37,306 --> 00:06:38,440
I have nothing to send.

61
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,960
So how about it? Do you like it?

62
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,519
Yes, I do.

63
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,240
Ok, let's go.

64
00:06:53,464 --> 00:06:54,440
It's quite warm.

65
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,680
What would you like to eat tomorrow?

66
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,680
I want hot pot with lamb.

67
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,560
Want some lamb?

68
00:07:11,245 --> 00:07:14,126
Aren't Li Suo and Huzi coming visit tomorrow?

69
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:16,104
It is the only thing I can think of to offer

70
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,142
that doesn't reveal how bad a cook you are.

71
00:07:18,627 --> 00:07:20,307
Wait a second! What do you mean?

72
00:07:21,197 --> 00:07:22,400
Don't I make good dishes?

73
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,000
Don't you already know whether your cooking is bad or not?

74
00:07:26,891 --> 00:07:28,211
Are the eggs I cooked not good?

75
00:07:29,107 --> 00:07:30,507
Why don't you ask me

76
00:07:30,698 --> 00:07:32,195
whether the water you boil taste good or not?

77
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,640
You...

78
00:07:38,835 --> 00:07:41,075
Are you pissed? You are so sensitive.

79
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,160
All right.

80
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,400
The food you made weren't that bad.

81
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,758
There's still a lot of room for improvement.

82
00:07:52,255 --> 00:07:53,295
Get out of here.

83
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:55,730
Don't go on forever.

84
00:07:56,277 --> 00:07:56,802
I am telling you this

85
00:07:56,803 --> 00:07:57,997
because I wanna encourage you to be a better cook.

86
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,680
Oh, dam!

87
00:08:05,369 --> 00:08:06,400
If you're still mad at me for this,

88
00:08:06,595 --> 00:08:08,783
believe it or not, I will tell Li Suo and Huzi

89
00:08:08,808 --> 00:08:10,353
the story of "Pot Flavor Dick".

90
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,880
You're getting naughty!

91
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,880
Don't you dare hit me?

92
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,560
Come on, let's eat.

93
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,280
Really? No Way!

94
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,080
Are you the son of...

95
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,200
the son of that Jiang?

96
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,360
And you are brother, aren't you?

97
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,120
Yeah.

98
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,670
Do you want to add some sauce?

99
00:08:32,695 --> 00:08:33,440
I'll do it myself.

100
00:08:33,465 --> 00:08:34,235
Let me do it.

101
00:08:40,414 --> 00:08:41,200
It's enough.

102
00:08:42,615 --> 00:08:43,655
I would say

103
00:08:44,361 --> 00:08:47,117
this elder brother really plays his role well.

104
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,937
I'm his elder brother.

105
00:08:55,948 --> 00:08:57,028
What's funny?

106
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,960
Dahai, Dahai,

107
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,280
I have never thought

108
00:09:01,305 --> 00:09:02,600
there's one day someone would have power over you.

109
00:09:03,093 --> 00:09:04,480
Doesn't it feel so good, does it?

110
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,867
You can go to hell.

111
00:09:05,892 --> 00:09:06,875
Don't be always picking on me.

112
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,515
Why don't you pick on your brother for once?

113
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,914
I can pick on him too, so what?

114
00:09:09,939 --> 00:09:10,539
Okay, go ahead!

115
00:09:10,564 --> 00:09:11,539
Pick a fight with your sweet brother if you dare.

116
00:09:11,564 --> 00:09:12,414
Come on.

117
00:09:12,439 --> 00:09:13,718
You're challenging me, huh?

118
00:09:13,849 --> 00:09:14,769
Go ahead, try it!

119
00:09:18,554 --> 00:09:19,920
Come on, let's eat.

120
00:09:20,257 --> 00:09:21,320
I'm admiring you very much

121
00:09:21,345 --> 00:09:22,835
that you can twist Gu Hai around your little finger.

122
00:09:23,054 --> 00:09:25,453
You don't know how many bad things he said about you before.

123
00:09:25,984 --> 00:09:27,400
What bad things did he say about me?

124
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,593
Don't you dare to say a word.

125
00:09:30,492 --> 00:09:31,280
Go ahead.

126
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,960
Come on, let's eat. Let's eat

127
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,080
Hello?

128
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:12,680
Hello?

129
00:10:13,776 --> 00:10:15,136
Bai Luo Yin.

130
00:10:15,802 --> 00:10:16,779
Shi Hui.

131
00:10:17,738 --> 00:10:18,938
How do you know my phone number?

132
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,779
This day last year,

133
00:10:20,956 --> 00:10:22,904
we've been together.

134
00:10:23,216 --> 00:10:25,349
This year, it's just me alone.

135
00:10:26,818 --> 00:10:29,538
Do you know there are so many people out there in the street

136
00:10:29,614 --> 00:10:31,749
who are surrounded by their loved ones?

137
00:10:31,913 --> 00:10:34,160
I'm the only one who is alone.

138
00:10:35,322 --> 00:10:36,802
Didn't you miss me?

139
00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:41,253
Maybe you've already had someone special by your side.

140
00:10:42,254 --> 00:10:44,566
Shi Hui. Don't be like this.

141
00:10:45,058 --> 00:10:46,280
We are already over.

142
00:10:46,836 --> 00:10:48,402
I know.

143
00:10:48,867 --> 00:10:51,187
I have already accepted the fact.

144
00:10:51,795 --> 00:10:53,955
But today is a little special.

145
00:10:55,092 --> 00:10:56,892
There are so many people celebrating here

146
00:10:57,284 --> 00:11:00,477
and I can't control my feelings.

147
00:11:01,365 --> 00:11:02,281
I've never thought about

148
00:11:02,282 --> 00:11:04,079
getting back together with you and start it over.

149
00:11:04,555 --> 00:11:05,783
I'm just...

150
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,920
I just want to tell you

151
00:11:08,555 --> 00:11:10,080
that I miss you so much.

152
00:11:10,423 --> 00:11:13,799
I can't walk out of the memory and got lost in the memories.

153
00:11:13,824 --> 00:11:15,504
The more you do, it's harder for you to get out.

154
00:11:16,446 --> 00:11:17,800
Please don't ask around about me anymore.

155
00:11:18,273 --> 00:11:19,767
Try to delete my number

156
00:11:20,075 --> 00:11:21,774
and delete any information that is related to me,

157
00:11:21,891 --> 00:11:23,032
try to delete me.

158
00:11:23,088 --> 00:11:26,928
I can't delete it, you know.

159
00:11:28,142 --> 00:11:31,274
I can make it till now is only because

160
00:11:32,688 --> 00:11:35,290
I've been dreaming

161
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,180
there will be one day we can finally get back together.

162
00:11:40,493 --> 00:11:41,333
It's impossible.

163
00:12:44,843 --> 00:12:49,080
# I wanna feel your touch #

164
00:12:52,207 --> 00:12:56,480
# It's burning me like an ember #

165
00:12:59,903 --> 00:13:03,680
# Pretending is not enough

166
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,534
# I wanna feel us together #

167
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:13,680
# So I'm giving in #

168
00:13:21,814 --> 00:13:25,280
# So I'm giving in #

169
00:13:28,814 --> 00:13:32,280
# To the trouble I'm in #

170
00:13:36,694 --> 00:13:39,840
# So I'm giving in #

171
00:13:41,748 --> 00:13:42,748
What?

172
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,640
Who called at this time?

173
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,560
Harassing phone call.

174
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,891
# To the trouble I'm in #

175
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:09,560
# You are you are, my favorite medicine #

176
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,120
Gu Hai, you bastard.

177
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:17,461
What are you afraid of, Yinzi?

178
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,320
I am afraid of pain.

179
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,124
You got something to be afraid of, do you?

180
00:14:23,051 --> 00:14:24,091
Or how about letting me give you a try?

181
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,300
Come on, I have no problem.

182
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,280
Hello?

183
00:14:57,619 --> 00:14:58,419
Where's Bai Luo Yin?

184
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:01,293
Who are you?

185
00:15:01,685 --> 00:15:03,139
I'm sorry, I'm looking for Bai Luo Yin.

186
00:15:03,164 --> 00:15:04,964
Would you please give him the cell phone?

187
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,662
If you don't tell me who you are,

188
00:15:06,687 --> 00:15:07,740
then I won't give him the phone.

189
00:15:08,769 --> 00:15:09,889
I'm his girlfriend.

190
00:15:10,531 --> 00:15:11,537
Girlfriend?

191
00:15:12,546 --> 00:15:13,586
I'm his boyfriend!

192
00:15:35,626 --> 00:15:36,906
Are you still admiring this watch?

193
00:15:38,135 --> 00:15:39,255
I have never seen this side of you.

194
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,320
Why?

195
00:15:42,023 --> 00:15:43,101
I was out there for a while

196
00:15:43,196 --> 00:15:45,249
and you've already started missing your past lover in the room.

197
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:48,920
Does it bring back memories?

198
00:15:50,595 --> 00:15:51,755
Can't you control the emotions?

199
00:15:53,316 --> 00:15:55,295
And are you reminiscing

200
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,640
the highlights of your romantic love life?

201
00:15:58,586 --> 00:16:00,866
Gu Hai, are you crazy?

202
00:16:01,859 --> 00:16:03,019
I was just opening the drawer

203
00:16:03,044 --> 00:16:03,804
and unintentionally looked at it few times.

204
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,906
Look at your jealous face.

205
00:16:07,403 --> 00:16:08,403
You are acting like a girl.

206
00:16:08,549 --> 00:16:09,663
Who are you calling a girl?

207
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:10,949
Why take it so seriously!

208
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,929
Why do you react this way

209
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,851
if you are not hiding your true feelings?

210
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,000
Your girlfriend called.

211
00:16:23,588 --> 00:16:24,812
Is she really your girlfriend?

212
00:16:33,133 --> 00:16:35,453
Shi Hui, please don't do this anymore, okay?

213
00:16:36,985 --> 00:16:39,265
I've told you everything I wanted to tell you.

214
00:16:39,745 --> 00:16:41,222
I don't want to repeat it again.

215
00:16:41,507 --> 00:16:43,958
Even after breaking up, we can still be friends.

216
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,990
Is there something wrong with having a chat with a friend?

217
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,802
In my opinion, we are strangers after breaking up.

218
00:16:50,827 --> 00:16:51,627
Bai Luo Yin!

219
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:54,066
If you truly don't care about me,

220
00:16:54,268 --> 00:16:56,400
why would it bother you to have a phone conversation with me?

221
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,960
I don't mind

222
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,350
but someone else will mind.

223
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:07,930
Bai Luo Yin. What... What do you mean?

224
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:11,266
I have already found someone I love.

225
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:13,860
That's all.

226
00:17:24,866 --> 00:17:25,346
You're back!

227
00:17:25,592 --> 00:17:26,308
Yes, I am.

228
00:17:31,198 --> 00:17:31,960
Open it, take a look.

229
00:17:38,612 --> 00:17:39,636
What are you doing?

230
00:17:40,199 --> 00:17:41,237
These are for you.

231
00:17:41,692 --> 00:17:42,667
Gifts for me?

232
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,560
Let me help you put it on.

233
00:17:49,966 --> 00:17:50,758
Is your brain damaged?

234
00:17:50,783 --> 00:17:51,583
I'm a man,

235
00:17:51,858 --> 00:17:52,813
why on earth do I need all these jewelry for?

236
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:54,438
Not only you, I will wear them as well.

237
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:54,980
Come on.

238
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,215
You didn't show up this afternoon

239
00:17:58,267 --> 00:17:59,582
just to buy these stuffs, did you?

240
00:18:00,138 --> 00:18:02,762
Not just these, there's more.

241
00:18:09,236 --> 00:18:09,836
Have a look.

242
00:18:14,105 --> 00:18:15,638
Where did you get so much money from?

243
00:18:16,925 --> 00:18:18,816
When my brother left,

244
00:18:18,841 --> 00:18:19,769
he gave me 200,000 RMB.

245
00:18:21,712 --> 00:18:23,097
Didn't you say you needed the money for your daily expenses?

246
00:18:23,122 --> 00:18:25,699
Yea, I didn't spend it all. There's still some left.

247
00:18:28,217 --> 00:18:28,977
How much left then?

248
00:18:29,574 --> 00:18:31,425
There is still...

249
00:18:34,389 --> 00:18:35,389
This much.

250
00:18:39,769 --> 00:18:40,918
Gu Hai.

251
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,481
Did you do all this just because of that watch? Are you serious?

252
00:18:45,681 --> 00:18:47,618
Even if you don't waste all this money,

253
00:18:47,643 --> 00:18:49,282
there is no way I will get back together with her.

254
00:18:50,111 --> 00:18:50,911
Are you serious?

255
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,220
Why would I lie to you?

256
00:18:52,836 --> 00:18:54,368
Why didn't you say it earlier?

257
00:18:54,393 --> 00:18:55,633
You didn't even let me explain!

258
00:18:56,021 --> 00:18:56,861
Come with me!

259
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,197
= A husband who doesn't want to sleep with wife isn't a good one. =

260
00:19:10,434 --> 00:19:11,074
Hurry!

261
00:19:17,651 --> 00:19:18,975
I bought it on the spur of the moment.

262
00:19:19,288 --> 00:19:20,408
Where did you get so much money?

263
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,014
I've used my mother's passbook.

264
00:19:26,694 --> 00:19:27,686
I don't regret it.

265
00:19:27,711 --> 00:19:29,420
You don't regret? But I do!

266
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,287
What do you regret?

267
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,800
I wouldn't regret all the things that I've bought for you

268
00:19:33,421 --> 00:19:35,541
even if it will make me get broke.

269
00:19:36,606 --> 00:19:38,295
A couple of days ago, I saw the news

270
00:19:38,397 --> 00:19:40,716
that a man had sold his kidney

271
00:19:40,941 --> 00:19:42,998
to buy a necklace for his girlfriend.

272
00:19:43,685 --> 00:19:45,944
Compared with him, I'm pretty reasonable.

273
00:19:46,206 --> 00:19:48,618
At least, all this are affordable to me.

274
00:19:48,643 --> 00:19:51,039
Compared to him?! He is a mental case!

275
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:54,079
Who doesn't have any extremely frivolous moments in their youth?

276
00:19:54,266 --> 00:19:54,946
Right?

277
00:19:56,314 --> 00:19:58,714
You just don't love me that much.

278
00:19:58,909 --> 00:20:00,269
Who knows who you have in your heart?

279
00:20:01,915 --> 00:20:03,219
Are you doing this again?

280
00:20:06,241 --> 00:20:07,001
It's freezing in here.

281
00:20:07,026 --> 00:20:08,480
Let's go sit in the car.

282
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,400
How is it? Is it comfortable?

283
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,080
Yes. It's very comfortable.

284
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,058
What about this?

285
00:20:21,417 --> 00:20:23,464
This is more comfortable.

286
00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:32,240
Gu Hai, do you want me to hit you?

287
00:20:32,507 --> 00:20:34,026
Come and give me a try!

288
00:20:34,225 --> 00:20:35,185
The more you hit, the more I'll come for you.

289
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,490
Come on, come on.

290
00:20:36,515 --> 00:20:37,901
Come and beat me.

291
00:20:40,248 --> 00:20:41,601
This is the garage.

292
00:20:41,803 --> 00:20:43,123
What's wrong with the garage?

293
00:20:43,352 --> 00:20:45,414
There's no one else in the garage, just the two of us.

294
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,400
You are mine.

295
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,810
I could have unlimited patience for you,

296
00:21:19,882 --> 00:21:23,002
I could meet all your requirements,

297
00:21:23,595 --> 00:21:24,715
but there's one thing,

298
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,576
if you really do something to hurt me,

299
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:30,907
I will not be soft on you.

300
00:21:35,207 --> 00:21:36,247
I mean it.

301
00:21:37,524 --> 00:21:39,084
When I, Gu Hai, want to be cruel,

302
00:21:39,925 --> 00:21:41,285
you will live in fear for the rest of your life.

303
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,635
= Class 27 of Senior Two =

304
00:22:41,562 --> 00:22:42,362
Do you have anything to do?

305
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,560
Nothing.

306
00:22:50,805 --> 00:22:53,245
Yinzi, Yinzi, wake up!

307
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,480
Someone is looking for you.

308
00:23:00,922 --> 00:23:01,962
Are you awake yet?

309
00:23:13,946 --> 00:23:17,160
What? Have you forgotten me so soon?

310
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,040
Shi Hui?

311
00:23:25,835 --> 00:23:27,187
How did you come back?

312
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:33,687
# You carried me on your back, recollecting the past, #

313
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,280
# And stalling for time on your own. #

314
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:41,650
# I was smiling while listening to you. #

315
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:45,840
# But a tear-blurred vision faded in. #

316
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:52,820
# You held my hand that had been wavering, #

317
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:57,130
# Slowly moving forward... #

318
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:01,810
# Slowly moving forward with me... #

319
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,880
# Don't say I'd never understand. #

320
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,780
# Don't say I'd never feel the pain. #

321
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,890
# As the wind was blowing over, #

322
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:18,140
# It left some warmth on my lips. #

323
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,930
# Don't tell me you'll be here with me. #

324
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:26,060
# I didn't say it because I was stuck in silence. #

325
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:33,050
# You held my hands too tightly to hear what I was saying. #

326
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:36,890
# Don't say I'd never understand. #
