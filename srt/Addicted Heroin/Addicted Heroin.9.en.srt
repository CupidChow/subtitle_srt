Yinzi,

17
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,156
Look, look,

18
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,440
there are some blisters on my mouth, right?

19
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,396
It is quite painful.

20
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,080
Wait a minute. I have an ointment.

21
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,760
No need for the ointment, OK?

22
00:02:02,436 --> 00:02:03,880
A kiss will heal everything.

23
00:02:05,113 --> 00:02:05,581
Where?

24
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:06,760
Here.

25
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,080
Here. Here.  Yes.

26
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,680
What ointment is it? It works so quickly.

27
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,901
The hemorrhoids ointment.

28
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,643
It's OK. It can be used everywhere.

29
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,800
Last time I had blisters on my mouth,

30
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,040
it cured me of them.

31
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,064
Don't worry.

32
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,978
Really? Is it safe?

33
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,135
If I don't have any blisters,

34
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,320
will it have some side effects on me?

35
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,640
Side effects?

36
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,987
You may have two haemorrhoids.

37
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,464
Oh my God. It smells.

38
00:02:45,495 --> 00:02:46,440
Sleep now.

39
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,800
I need to wash it away.

40
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,720
No need for washing.

41
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,120
I have to...

42
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,190
It is OK. Don't wash it away.

43
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,200
It smells so much that I can't sleep.

44
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,852
It's unbearable.

45
00:02:53,853 --> 00:02:55,747
Hold on and you will be cured tomorrow morning.

46
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,680
I need to wash it away. Let me go.

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,932
Let me go.

48
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,840
You really want to wash it away?

49
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,160
Yes!

50
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,572
Have a try.

51
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,480
That's awesome. You should fix this.

52
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,283
Those old phones like this are very sturdy.

53
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,304
Don't you bring those things with you?

54
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,720
You can take anything you need here.

55
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,264
Look, our handwritings are

56
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,840
kind of similar?

57
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,086
Why not telling me that you are practicing calligraphy ?

58
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,261
Due to the essay this time,

59
00:04:05,415 --> 00:04:06,523
the Chinese teacher has ignored me now.

60
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,436
Then you ignore him as well.

61
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,720
I should ignore you.

62
00:04:10,695 --> 00:04:11,778
Then try it.

63
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:13,975
Give it to me.

64
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,440
I haven't finished it.

65
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,772
That's my paper.

66
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,273
I will continue practicing calligraphy.

67
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:20,375
What calligraphy!

68
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,240
What do you want to do?

69
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,732
You want to have a fight, huh?

70
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,840
So what? Give it to me.

71
00:04:24,516 --> 00:04:25,415
So what?

72
00:04:26,553 --> 00:04:27,532
No.

73
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,590
What?

74
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,024
How come you should come here?

75
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,409
You tell me why I am here.

76
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,984
Today is weekend.

77
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,956
I am moving now.

78
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,273
And I don't have a mobile phone.

79
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,738
So I can't contact you.

80
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,175
No phone?

81
00:04:59,160 --> 00:04:59,920
What is it?

82
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,747
This one,

83
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,781
it has been broken for long.

84
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:07,956
Broken?

85
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,821
it is broken.

86
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,249
Who tells you to throw it?

87
00:05:27,673 --> 00:05:29,421
We have thrown so many phones when we had quarrels before.

88
00:05:29,895 --> 00:05:31,156
You should be angry at me

89
00:05:31,218 --> 00:05:32,104
just for this broken phone.

90
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,609
Yinzi has just fixed it for me.

91
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,938
He fixed it. So what?

92
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,196
I threw it and I stamped it.

93
00:05:38,221 --> 00:05:39,280
Kill me if you can.

94
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,701
Just because of the phone...

95
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,683
Gu Hai, you are not a man.

96
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,498
Chase her now.

97
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,667
Gu Hai,

98
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,040
Why should I chase her?

99
00:06:01,175 --> 00:06:02,360
Because she comes all the way to see you.

100
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,932
Because you have been with her for three years.

101
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,144
Because you slept with her.

102
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,680
Yinzi, you know that

103
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,320
I will only listen to you.

104
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,849
You really want me to chase her?

105
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,621
Sure. You have to.

106
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,320
When a girl goes bananas,

107
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,640
It will make her accident prone.

108
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,950
Move now.

109
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,335
Lulu, Lulu,

110
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,600
Gu Hai, this is the first time that

111
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,440
you chase me after we have quarrels.

112
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,833
It's OK. Stop being so capricious afterwards.

113
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,480
I won't be capricious.

114
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,609
I won't be capricious any more.

115
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,320
You are moving the house, right?

116
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,360
Let's go. I will help you.

117
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,729
My package...

118
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,920
That boy has moved all the things away,

119
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,252
Where are you gonna move?

120
00:08:09,415 --> 00:08:10,326
Move into Yinzi's house.

121
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,396
I've lived in his home during this period.

122
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,538
Gu Hai,

123
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,480
What?

124
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,793
Don't you think

125
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,080
you are being too kind to Bai Luoyin?

126
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,280
Every man has his own buddies.

127
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,652
Why you always find fault with him?

128
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,046
I am telling you,

129
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,003
you don't understand him.

130
00:08:37,926 --> 00:08:39,040
If you understand him,

131
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,301
you will definitely like him.

132
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,120
Although his family condition is not good,

133
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,323
his thoughts are very profound.

134
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,624
His taste is also unique.

135
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,680
He doesn't smile much.

136
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,169
But in his heart,

137
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,080
He is mild on the outside but wild on the inside.

138
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,640
If he wants to be kind to you,

139
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,920
he is too shy to say it out.

140
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,360
Always be furtive.

141
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,126
If you unmask it,

142
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,307
he will be angry at you.

143
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,040
His bark is much worse than his bite.

144
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,040
He is very kindhearted.

145
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,083
I've lived in his house for free for so long.

146
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,760
He pretended to kick me out every day,

147
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,670
but if I don't go back home for half a day,

148
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,280
he will be the first one who worries about me.

149
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,440
By the way,

150
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,615
he is very clever.

151
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,766
The lock of our classroom,

152
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,040
after his modification,

153
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,541
the classroom can be locked from the outside

154
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,556
just by pulling the string from the inside.

155
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,981
And my phone.

156
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,498
It has been in the river for a while.

157
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,080
He should fix it.

158
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,123
Don't tell me,

159
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,110
you will move here for real.

160
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,910
Gosh. It is so cold.

161
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,360
He uses the cold water to wash face.

162
00:09:53,052 --> 00:09:55,280
Will they ask you to wash your face with cold water as well?

163
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:56,910
A Lang.

164
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,190
Gosh. Why there is such a big dog here?

165
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,240
What about going out for diner together?

166
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,947
OK. Let me change my clothes.

167
00:10:06,953 --> 00:10:07,240
OK.

168
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,000
Gu Hai, he is kinder to you than to me.

169
00:10:36,381 --> 00:10:37,360
How can you find it?

170
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,704
He always keeps a poker face in front of me.

171
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,240
But he always wears a smile in front of you.

172
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,464
You said that,

173
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,440
you would feel safe if I was being cold.

174
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,553
This is men.

175
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,000
They have two sides

176
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:53,800
in front of their girlfriend and buddies.

177
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,563
In front of his girlfriend,

178
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,200
he has to manage his charming image.

179
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,560
So he has to pretend and keep a poker face.

180
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,286
So that he could fascinate you.

181
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,286
But it's different in front of his buddy.

182
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,661
He doesn't need to care about his image.

183
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,920
He can be naughty and capricious as he wants.

184
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,560
So you will feel close.

185
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,520
You see,

186
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,369
he is better at persuasion than you.

187
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,520
You give Bai Luoyin a punch.

188
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:19,800
Why should I punch him?

189
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,892
No reason.

190
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,473
I just want to see it.

191
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,486
You guys

192
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,338
always have a fight for fun, huh?

193
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,750
Are you so bored?

194
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,824
Gu Hai, I am just kidding.

195
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,018
Why are you so angry at me?

196
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,172
Are you so reluctant?

197
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,544
He is a man.

198
00:11:37,606 --> 00:11:38,440
A punch is nothing to him.

199
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,049
Just a little touch.

200
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,372
Is that unacceptable?

201
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,276
Yes.

202
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,076
Nobody can touch him, including me.

203
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,852
Gu Hai, you are so disgusting.

204
00:11:47,855 --> 00:11:48,744
Then get out of here.

205
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,667
Don't regret.

206
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,560
How come you drive her off again.

207
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,289
Why you say I drive her off?

208
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,898
Don't you see her bloody behaviors.

209
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,840
I can't spoil her.

210
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,760
I don't know how you guys could

211
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,120
be together.

212
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,000
Clam down.

213
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,873
It can't t continue if the mess can't be solved.

214
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,163
What's this?

215
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,280
It's for me?

216
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,972
Of course. It has been given to you.

217
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,061
Otherwise, who else I am gonna give it to.

218
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,221
Yinzi, you are so kind.

219
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,276
Hug my dad if you want to,

220
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,098
He pays for it,

221
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,360
He insists to buy it for you.

222
00:12:39,587 --> 00:12:40,603
I even can't stop him.

223
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,163
Sir, thank you.

224
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,956
You don't need to say thank you to me.

225
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,966
Without Yinzi today,

226
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,098
I don't even know

227
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,446
the difference between a good phone and bad phone.

228
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,003
I think,

229
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,116
as long as it is sturdy and can call others,

230
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,353
then that is a good phone.

231
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,163
Yinzi said that was not enough.

232
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,196
We had to buy a good one for Dahai.

233
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,495
A fully functional one.

234
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,996
Sir, don't listen to him. That's nonsense.

235
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,400
Don't swagger after gaining it, OK?

236
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,560
What about you? What do you use?

237
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,092
I don't need a phone.

238
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,870
I have no one to contact with.

239
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,387
It's a waste to buy a phone.

240
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,018
You can contact with me.

241
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,184
Come on.

242
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,400
You are staying with me all the time.

243
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,203
Phone is useless to me.

244
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,778
According to you,

245
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,883
I also don't have anyone to contact with.

246
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,120
I don't need it as well.

247
00:13:31,193 --> 00:13:33,840
Come on. I still wish that

248
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,960
this phone can distract your attention.

249
00:13:40,812 --> 00:13:43,720
Then you will hate this phone, huh?

250
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,800
But out of my face.

251
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,596
Sir,

252
00:14:03,544 --> 00:14:04,683
What are you doing?

253
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,406
It rained a few days ago.

254
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,960
And the roof leaked.

255
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,209
The corn that was just sun dried,

256
00:14:10,836 --> 00:14:11,840
has been wet again.

257
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,421
I am climbing up to fix the roof.

258
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,640
Sir, come down. Let me do it for you.

259
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,144
You don't know how to fix it.

260
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:17,920
I can. Give it to me.

261
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,880
Dad,

262
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:19,920
come down.

263
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:20,873
Let him climb to the roof.

264
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,083
Otherwise, he lived in our home for free every day.

265
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,307
How could you say this?

266
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,280
Let me do it.

267
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,369
Are you sure?

268
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,200
Yes. Don't worry.

269
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,793
Sir, hold the coat for me please.

270
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,221
- Be careful. - OK.

271
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,310
The cement has been ready. Just smear it on the hole.

272
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:37,821
OK.

273
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,880
Put the cement on the roof first.

274
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,544
Right. It's there.

275
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,000
Here?

276
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:48,652
Yes. The side.

277
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,080
OK.

278
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,520
Why don't your father open the restaurant with Mrs Zou?

279
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,873
Why should he open it with Mrs Zou?

280
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,406
That is a best location.

281
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,920
They don't need to pay the rent or tax.

282
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,809
And also have government supports.

283
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,476
That's definitely profitable.

284
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,264
Mrs Zou is too busy there.

285
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,621
If your dad goes to help her,

286
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,532
Then the restaurant is owned by them two.

287
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,763
Isn't that better than his salary.

288
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,590
Your thoughts are good.

289
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,920
My father, he won't be willing to do that.

290
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,901
Why not?

291
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:40,400
Come here,

292
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,489
What? Mrs Zou is not

293
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,732
a widow?

294
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,760
Mrs Zou has husband.

295
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,633
He is working outside.

296
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,243
You mean,

297
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,221
they are afraid of those gossips.

298
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,701
I feel that Mrs Zou is lying to my father.

299
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,326
I guess she has divorced her husband.

300
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,920
You see,

301
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,950
she has lived here for so many years.

302
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,480
But her husband never came back during the holidays.

303
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,467
Is that normal?

304
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,760
Do you listen to me?

305
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,686
I hear that.

306
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,501
Don't you say that Mrs Zou is not a widow?

307
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,298
Yes. But my father always denies that.

308
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,972
I guess,

309
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,064
Your dad knows it very well.

310
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,073
Your dad is so close to other woman.

311
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,307
Do you feel a bit of uncomfortable in your heart?

312
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,403
No.

313
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,560
I once persuaded my father to marry her.

314
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,910
As long as I have memory,

315
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,412
he has been a single dad.

316
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,267
I can't let him live lonely all his life.

317
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,587
Have you ever considered to

318
00:16:59,606 --> 00:17:00,960
let your dad remarry your mom?

319
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,643
Never.

320
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,409
I prefer Mrs Zou.

321
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,907
I don't want to see my father experience any sufferings.

322
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,753
In fact, my father,

323
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,360
he doesn't want to open the restaurant with Mrs Zou

324
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,160
not completely because he is afraid of the gossip.

325
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:20,227
You see, the restaurant belongs to Mrs Zou.

326
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,895
my father definitely feels embarrassed to get involved in it.

327
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,581
We are both men.

328
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,880
We can understand that.

329
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,833
If that is another woman,

330
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,212
maybe there is possibilities.

331
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,680
Mrs Zou? Impossible.

332
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,178
Right.

333
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,418
Be carful, man.

334
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,449
Mr. Bai,

335
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,320
Factory director has something to tell you. Go to his office now.

336
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,000
Hurry up.

337
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,833
OK. OK.

338
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,667
Factory director,

339
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,861
- Bai, Bai. Come here. Have a seat. - OK.

340
00:18:12,283 --> 00:18:14,670
- During some tea. - OK. Thank you.

341
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,800
Bai, our factory decides to fire you.

342
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,360
Sit down. Sit down.

343
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,760
Director, you know my situation.

344
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,892
My son just goes to high school.

345
00:18:33,747 --> 00:18:35,181
We need money now.

346
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,193
I also have to look after the elder in my house.

347
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,430
I have to pay for the medicine every month.

348
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,230
If not so,

349
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,784
a veteran worker with over ten-year experience like you,

350
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,673
I am not willing to let you go.

351
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,944
Then why do you fire me?

352
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,086
You are driving our family

353
00:18:54,088 --> 00:18:54,978
to the wall now.

354
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,892
How could you say that?

355
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,886
How could I drive you to the wall?

356
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,689
It seems that they haven't called you yet.

357
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,658
Who?

358
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,720
You indeed don't receive their message.

359
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,640
Then I give them a call now.

360
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,498
Come in please.

361
00:19:16,996 --> 00:19:18,935
You finally come here. Have a seat.

362
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,750
I am about to call you,

363
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,150
No need to call me.

364
00:19:23,489 --> 00:19:24,360
I am coming now.

365
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,113
Who is this?

366
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,510
This is Bai.

367
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,098
This is the one you are looking for,

368
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,720
Mr. Bai, nice to meet you.

369
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,935
Sorry. My hands are not clean.

370
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,160
Bai, this is

371
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,560
the HR manager of Tong Jie Refrigeration Equipment Company.

372
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,400
His name is Miao.

373
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,058
You can call him Manager Miao afterwards.

374
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,067
Then you two have a chat first.

375
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,520
I go out to handle some issues.

376
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:55,833
Please help yourself.

377
00:19:55,852 --> 00:19:56,529
OK. OK.

378
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,778
Mr. Bai, here is the thing,

379
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,280
Our company wants to hire you

380
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,033
as the engineer in our technology department.

381
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,587
20000 yuan per month after tax.

382
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,960
Every month,

383
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,523
we will sponsor a trip

384
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,378
And five thousand housing benefits.

385
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,009
two thousand meal and transportation allowance respectively.

386
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,403
You would work eight hours a day.

387
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,996
As for the holidays and weekends,

388
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,880
Manager Miao,

389
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,344
does your company print fake money?

390
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,913
Mr. Bai, Mr. Bai, you are so humorous.

391
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,809
It's not because I am humorous.

392
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,609
The conditions your company offers are so unreliable.

393
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,289
Mr. Bai,

394
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,400
Mr. Bai, this is my card.

395
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,320
Please take it.

396
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,932
I guess you have worked here for over ten years.

397
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,655
You probably know

398
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,120
the business of this factory.

399
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,800
Half of the components that our company uses are

400
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,600
produced by your factory.

401
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,455
I also know your factory director.

402
00:21:02,627 --> 00:21:03,846
You can trust me.

403
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,969
The point is I know nothing about the technology.

404
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,061
Don't worry.

405
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,227
We'll arrange someone to guide you.

406
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,981
If so,

407
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,498
you can directly hire an engineer.

408
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,135
That is very convenient.

409
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,027
Mr. Bai,

410
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,938
If you are still hesitant,

411
00:21:22,153 --> 00:21:22,849
then,

412
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,760
you can come with me to visit our company now.

413
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,769
The studio,

414
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,480
we have prepared it for you.

415
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,707
What good events do you encounter today?

416
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,793
Dad, you have been drunken without drinking.

417
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,520
I got promoted.

418
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,080
Promoted?

419
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,895
Are there any different positions in that old factory?

420
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,421
Not in our factory.

421
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,600
It's another company.

422
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,064
They invite me to work there as an engineer.

423
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,680
Dad, are you cheated by them?

424
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,655
How could you say that?

425
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,390
I have signed the contract.

426
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,640
The treatment is very good there.

427
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,415
They are afraid that I don't believe them.

428
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,412
They have given me five thousand as the guarantee deposit.

429
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,240
If you are available tomorrow,

430
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,920
I'll take you to see my new studio.

431
00:22:42,707 --> 00:22:43,876
Gu Hai, come here.

432
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,584
What?

433
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,267
You arrange my father's promotion, right?

434
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,880
Your father's what?

435
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,821
Stop pretending.

436
00:22:57,538 --> 00:23:00,683
# You carried me on your back, recollecting the past, #

437
00:23:01,433 --> 00:23:04,633
# And stalling for time on your own. #

438
00:23:05,132 --> 00:23:08,424
# I was smiling while listening to you. #

439
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,763
# But a tear-blurred vision faded in. #

440
00:23:13,581 --> 00:23:20,110
# You held my hand that had been wavering, #

441
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:24,012
# Slowly moving forward... #

442
00:23:24,283 --> 00:23:28,436
# Slowly moving forward with me... #

443
00:23:28,892 --> 00:23:32,941
# Don't say I'd never understand. #

444
00:23:33,015 --> 00:23:36,861
# Don't say I'd never feel the pain. #

445
00:23:36,863 --> 00:23:39,673
# As the wind was blowing over, #

446
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:44,929
# It left some warmth on my lips. #

447
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,984
# Don't tell me you'll be here with me. #

448
00:23:48,985 --> 00:23:53,169
# I didn't say it because I was stuck in silence. #

449
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:59,987
# You held my hands too tightly to hear what I was saying. #

450
00:24:00,135 --> 00:24:03,950
# Don't say I'd never understand. #

451
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:07,778
# Don't say I'd never feel the pain. #

452
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,972
# As the wind was blowing over, #

453
00:24:10,973 --> 00:24:15,938
# It left some warmth on my lips. #

454
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,049
# Don't tell me you'll be here with me. #

455
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:24,184
# I didn't say it because I was stuck in silence. #

456
00:24:24,246 --> 00:24:31,858
# You held my hands too tightly to hear what I was saying: #

457
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:33,581
# Please, don't go... #
