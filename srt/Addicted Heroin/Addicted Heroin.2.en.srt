The one who wears a plaid shirt with headphones on his head.

You can give him a big pack of toilet paper.

Do remember: a big pack, not just a roll of it.

Is it a pack of 12 rolls or 10?

Yes, he does sleep a lot.

Look at the speedometer!

Just follow him.

Are you kidding me?

105

Charges are reckoned by distance.

Not by hour.

107
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,250
You wasted my time to drive a mile only, is it worth it?

Young man, why don't you just walk?

109
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:39,770

It will dry tomorrow.

No. I'd like to sit behind Bai Luoyin.

177
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,290
You wanna sit behind Bai Luoyin?

178
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,340
We are good buddies.

179
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,910
Sitting together will motivate us to work harder.

180
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,450
All right, I'll think about it, ok?

181
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,120
I want to do it now!

182
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,680
OK. You can do it this afternoon.

Pay close attention.

190

Everyone, take out the test paper from yesterday.

191
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,740
Let's go through the exercise.

192
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,720
Why are you still here?

193
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,440
I've changed my seat.

194
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,720
This is my seat now.

195
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,120
Don't talk to him.

196
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,190
Just consider him a pile of shit behind me.

197
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,190
Let's look at question No. 5.

198
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,240
Why would you use black thread

199
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,020
to stitch the hole in your white uniform?

200
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,250
That's called "bull" (awesome).

201
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,240
Bull(awesome)? What kind of bull?

202
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,320
Don't you know there's a kind of bull

203
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,020
covered with black and white patches?

204
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,480
One patch can't make a bull.

205
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,640
There has to be lots of patches.

Hello.

Dahai, are you working out?

210
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,440
I'm threading a needle.

211
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,580
Threading a needle?

212
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,470
After leaving home,

213
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,490
you have no one to help you stitch your clothes.

214
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,690
Life must be hard for you now.

215
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,040
I'm not doing it for myself.

216
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,400
Then for whom?

217
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,310
Don't yell at me. Not for girls.

218
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,260
You wouldn't understand.

219
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,110
Anyway, what's up?

220
00:16:59,020 --> 00:16:59,840
I miss you.

221
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,440
Come to Tianjin and visit me this weekend, OK?

222
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,460
All right.

223
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,240
OK.

224
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,070
Go to sleep, go to sleep.

225
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,300
Yinzi, wake up!

226
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,170
Time for P.E. class.

227
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,510
Come on. Hurry up.

228
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,320
You Qi, time for class.

229
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,370
- Class time? - Time for P.E. class.

230
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,880
Look at you all.

231
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,040
You look like without a spine when sitting or standing.

232
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,840
Still sleepy?

233
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,540
Cheer up!

234
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:46,920
Take your hands out.

235
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,250
A bunch of losers.

236
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,000
If we were in the army, I'd punish you at least 8 times a day!

237
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:01,240
You, step forward. Dress ranks!

238
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,280
Stand at ease! Attention!

239
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,120
Louder!

240
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,160
Stand at ease! Attention!

241
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,760
You didn't eat breakfast?

242
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,140
I did, but I'm still hungry.

243
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:21,720
Go back!

244
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,600
The tall one at the back. Step forward.

245
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:33,800
Shout! Let me hear you!

246
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,130
Orders are not for shouting.

247
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:42,870
Fine. If you can do 60 push-ups in one minute,

248
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,120
I will not punish you for what you just said.

249
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:46,990
Come on!

250
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:54,680
Go!

251
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:58,080
1, 2, 3...

252
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,560
101, 102...

253
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,350

00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,740
105, 106...

255
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,370
Stop!

256
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,820
Sir, would do it for us, too?

257
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,520
We wanna see.

258
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,640
Didn't you just retire from the army?

259
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,360
Show us the demeanor of a military solider.

260
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,040
Exactly, sir.

261
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,430
You're really something.

262
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,530
Please show us what you're capable of.

263
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:36,940
Please, sir.

264
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,930
- Please show us. - Yes, please.

265
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,310
All right. I'll do it.

266
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,370
See the pull-up bar behind me?

267
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,720
Let's do pull-ups together.

268
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:46,800
One by one.

269
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,900
I will outnumber all the pull-ups you all do.

270
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:52,950
How does it sound?

271
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,980
- Cool! - Great!

272
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:54,620
Come on!

273
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,550
- OK. - OK.

274
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,080
I'll demonstrate first. Watch me!

275
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,250
# You carried me on your back, recollecting the past, #

276
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,080
# And stalling for time on your own. #

277
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:22,450

278

# But a tear-blurred vision faded in. #

279
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:33,620

280
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,930
# Slowly moving forward... #

281
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,610
# Slowly moving forward with me... #

282
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,680
# Don't say I'd never understand. #

283
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,580
# Don't say I'd never feel the pain. #

284
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,690
# As the wind was blowing over, #

285
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:58,940
# It left some warmth on my lips. #

286
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,730
# Don't tell me you'll be here with me. #

287
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:06,860
# I didn't say it because I was stuck in silence. #

288
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:13,850
# You held my hands too tightly to hear what I was saying. #

289
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:17,690
# Don't say I'd never understand. #

290
