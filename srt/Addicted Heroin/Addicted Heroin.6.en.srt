16
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,840
What are you doing? It's just a fish.

17
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,720
If I didn't bring it out of water,

18
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,600
you will never talk to me again.

19
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,880
That's not true.

20
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,200
Since we are here to fish,

21
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,320
then we should do it steadfastly.

22
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,320
But you were constantly checking your phone.

23
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,920
I've already turned it off.

24
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,840
See? It's off.

25
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,360
I forgot to take it out when I got into the water.

26
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,000
You should invite me to your home for a dinner

27
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,480
since we've fished so many fish.

28
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,440
I'll send it to your house when it's cooked.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,160
You just need to wait at home.

30
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,680
I prefer to eat at your place.

31
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,080
To be honest, you should invite me on your own.

32
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,360
You are so thoughtless.

33
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,320
No, I am not.

34
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,560
Just wait at home if you want some.

35
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,280
Or you can just forget about it.

36
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,176
We are back.

37
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,240
Sir.

38
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,280
Dahai.

39
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,120
What happened to your pants?

40
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,880
Just go inside and get a new one.

41
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,920
Dad, we have no spare dry clothes.

42
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,000
We have.

43
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,840
I bought a new one the other day.

44
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,400
Sir, can I take a shower in your place?

45
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,800
I am so dirty now.

46
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,160
I don't want to dirty your new pants.

47
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,120
Enough!

48
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,000
Of course you can! Do you know to use the shower head?

49
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,320
Just ask Yinzi to take a shower with you if you don't.

50
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,520
That's great.

51
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,920
What?

52
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,960
Dad, the door of our toilet is broken.

53
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,400
And the shower head too.

54
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,240
How can he take a shower?

55
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,840
Of course I can!

56
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,040
My toilet doesn't even have a shed.

57
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,640
No.

58
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,240
I just take showers with tap water in summer.

59
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,280
There's no hot water at all.

60
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,120
We have hot water. Just help yourself.

61
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,560
Okay, I will.

62
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,600
Dad, what are you doing?

63
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,640
Just take a shower.

64
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,280
Damn it!

65
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,040
Bai Luoyin, I don't know how to use it.

66
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,040
Just go and help him.

67
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:47,983
No. I don't want to.

68
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,400
You should be polite to your guest.

69
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,640
Here. Let me help you.

70
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,960
Hurry up! Go!

71
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,840
Hurry up!

72
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,720
You don't even know how to use it.

73
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,800
Why are you so rushed to get undressed?

74
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,960
We can take a shower together.

75
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,200
You're sweating.

76
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,320
No thanks.

77
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,840
Bai Luoyin, you are so erotic.

78
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,480
Your reaction is quite quick.

79
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,186
Hi.

80
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,800
You bought some fish today.

81
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,120
They went to fish today.

82
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,280
Fishing?

83
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,160
Auntie, just take some home.

84
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,120
Or you can help us to cook.

85
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,200
My dad doesn't know how to cook fish.

86
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,240
Your dad is good at cooking fish.

87
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,240
His cooking skill is improving recently.

88
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,440
You haven't had a chance to taste it yet.

89
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,840
Okay. I just take the fish back to home.

90
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,280
And send it to you when it's cooked.

91
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,428
- Thank you, auntie. - It's fine.

92
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,680
How embarrassing we are!

93
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,760
It's fine!

94
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,720
Yeah.

95
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,862
Dad.

96
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,018
Listen to me.

97
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,520
If he says he'll stay for dinner later,

98
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,480
you must say no.

99
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,920
Just tell him that you are not good at cooking.

100
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,560
How?

101
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,400
Your Mrs Zou is good at cooking.

102
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,240
You went to fish together.

103
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,240
And how can't you share with him?

104
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:11,920
No. No.

105
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,680
I want to send the fish to his place.

106
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,280
His place is not far from ours, right?

107
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,560
Okay. It's up to you.

108
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,291
- Have you finished? - Yeah.

109
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,316
How do you feel?

110
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,120
I feel quite good.

111
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,440
Sir.

112
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,160
I want to have dinner here tonight.

113
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,800
Of course. I won't let you go.

114
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,921
- Just have dinner here tonight. Help yourself. - Okay.

115
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,285
- Let's go. - Let's go.

116
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,207
Dad.

117
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,720
Come on!

118
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,480
Dahai.

119
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,600
Come to my house often when you are free.

120
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,160
Okay.

121
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,080
Yinzi, say goodbye to your classmate.

122
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay.

123
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,680
Sir, just go back inside.

124
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,524
- Just take care. - I will.

125
00:06:07,524 --> 00:06:08,897
- Dad, just go back inside. - Okay. See you!

126
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,588
How far is your home from here?

127
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,880
Why? Do you want to come to my house?

128
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,280
No. I just want to accompany you home.

129
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,760
It's fine. Don't bother.

130
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,720
Just go back inside. It's so cold now.

131
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,600
It just takes me 10 minutes to get home by bike.

132
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,520
Let's go.

133
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,800
Why do you write you name in word-art?

134
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,400
That was my girlfriend had it designed.

135
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,920
She forced me to learn to write it.

136
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,480
And then I just get used to it.

137
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,920
I can't change no more.

138
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,920
This is a bad habit.

139
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,400
Yes, sir.

140
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,080
Do you like dogs?

141
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,720
Normally, fierce dogs will become docile

142
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,960
when they see me.

143
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,960
I will give you one as a gift

144
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,240
if you like.

145
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,840
You can't afford to buy one.

146
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,600
Why does it take so long to get to you home?

147
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,440
Of course. Because I am walking my bike.

148
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,720
I will get home soon if I ride.

149
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,840
Fine. You just go back home.

150
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,760
See you!

151
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,520
- Are you leaving? - See you!

152
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,800
Uncle, I dropped my bike at your place.

153
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,960
Can I go down to pick it up?

154
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,200
Okay. Okay.

155
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,120
How can it dropped from above?

156
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,080
Were you riding bike on wall?

157
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,680
I will throw it back here when I pick it up.

158
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,640
I won't bother you.

159
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,360
It's okay.

160
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,080
It doesn't matter.

161
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,800
Just get out from my door.

162
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,240
That's what I need.

163
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:18,915
Okay.

164
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,200
See you, uncle.

165
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,360
What a good boy!

166
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,000
But he is a fool. What a pity!

167
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:39,800
Are you waiting for me?

168
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,400
Save it.

169
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,720
Are you okay? Let me take your turn.

170
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,280
We are almost there.

171
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,640
It is unnecessary to say so.

172
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,200
Wait. Slow down.

173
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,200
We will be late.

174
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,640
I think the people who is riding bike is Dahai.

175
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,840
It looks like him.

176
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,000
I think it's him.

177
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,240
It's impossible.

178
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,760
That's a poor boy. How could it be him?

179
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,480
Besides, Dahai has several cars.

180
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,080
He doesn't need to ride a bike.

181
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,360
Where is Dahai?

182
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:32,119
= Class 27 of Senior Two =

183
00:11:32,928 --> 00:11:34,663
Excuse me.

184
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,680
Is Gu Hai in this class?

185
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,280
Gu Hai, someone is looking for you.

186
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,160
Why are you here?

187
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,880
What do you think?

188
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,960
You haven't been able to get through for two days.

189
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,200
I thought you'd been kidnapped

190
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,000
if I couldn't reach you anymore.

191
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,560
I am fine.

192
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,960
My phone fell into the river.

193
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,360
I can't afford a new one.

194
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,160
That's why I couldn't get in touch with you.

195
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,320
What's this?

196
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,920
Your dad is way out of line.

197
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,120
He can't do this to you even if...

198
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,080
Keep it down. They can hear you.

199
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,200
What did he do to you?

200
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,520
What happened to you?

201
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,960
Don't! You'll break it.

202
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,840
Okay. Stop.

203
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,520
I'll take you back after school at noon.

204
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,720
I'm not leaving. I asked for three days off.

205
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,480
That's you! Not me!

206
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,320
Are you going to spend three days here alone?

207
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,520
You can skip class.

208
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,640
You used to skip class a lot.

209
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,720
I didn't sleep all night and come here for you.

210
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,600
Can't you just skip one class for me?

211
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,520
Stop it! I have no time for you.

212
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,560
I know.

213
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,640
You have a girlfriend here, right?

214
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,200
Just leave if you say that again.

215
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,960
I have to figure things out before I leave.

216
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,240
If you want me to spend more time with you,

217
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,760
I'll ask my teacher for leave now.

218
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,000
Do whatever you want when we are back.

219
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,320
But not here.

220
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,200
Why?

221
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,240
Do you want a reason for everything?

222
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,600
I want you to be honest with me.

223
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,520
I am not that bitchy.

224
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,040
If you really have a girlfriend here,

225
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,320
I will leave by myself.

226
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,058
Just go.

227
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,040
Have you understood everything your teacher said in this class?

228
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,720
I couldn't understand at all.

229
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,840
Me too.

230
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,640
You know what? I know fortune-telling.

231
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,800
Here. Let me have a look.

232
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,320
It says...

233
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,560
No, thank you. I need to go to the toilet.

234
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,680
Have you finished your homework?

235
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,560
There are too much.

236
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,840
I heard that there was a handsome boy transferred to our school.

237
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,600
I heard that he was called Lin Sai.

238
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,200
Was that your little brother?

239
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,400
Screw you!

240
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,800
Then who's that?

241
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,840
My girlfriend.

242
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,440
What are you doing?

243
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,000
It looks like someone is fighting.

244
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,840
It sounds like Shan Xiaoxuan.

245
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,240
What's wrong?

246
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,360
What's wrong?

247
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,320
You had an affair with my boyfriend. How dare you!

248
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,800
I didn't do that.

249
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,080
How dare you!

250
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,440
I didn't do that.

251
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,120
What are you doing?

252
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,400
- Leave me alone! - Let's go!

253
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,960
Leave me alone! I am gonna beat her to dead.

254
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,160
Leave me alone! Leave me alone!

255
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,520
Leave me alone!

256
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,880
How could he like her?

257
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,960
How do I know?

258
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,200
You are with him every day.

259
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,960
Did he tell you anything about his girlfriend?

260
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,960
No, I am not.

261
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:00,960
Yes, you are.

262
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,200
You used to be enemies.

263
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,640
And now, you stay together every day.

264
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,400
Yang Meng and I are confused.

265
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,280
What's wrong?

266
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,000
You are not in a relationship.

267
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,600
There's no need to be so sensitive.

268
00:15:28,898 --> 00:15:30,360
Tell me what do you want to do.

269
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,920
I just want her know what she will face

270
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,080
if she dares to has an affair with you.

271
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,120
I'm warning you for the last time.

272
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,960
Don't put any false charges on me.

273
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,040
Then why don't you contact me?

274
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,684
Why are you hiding from me?

275
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,400
Are you ashamed of me?

276
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,360
Do you think I don't deserve you?

277
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,880
I hate neurotic girl.

278
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,240
Fine. Since you're starting to hate me,

279
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,160
then I'll make you hate me more and more.

280
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,000
You don't like me to show up here.

281
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,040
Then I will come here every week.

282
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,920
Until you leave here.

283
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,240
What's good here?

284
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,200
What are you doing here?

285
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,840
Nothing good here.

286
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,880
But you are here.

287
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,080
Okay. I promise you.

288
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,640
You can stay here for a few days.

289
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,360
But you have to remember one thing.

290
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,692
Go ahead.

291
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,120
You must treat me as a poor man here.

292
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,040
Remember. I am a poor man.

293
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,045
Don't say anything about my family in front of my classmates.

294
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,311
And you...

295
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,920
Just keep a low profile in front of them.

296
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,720
Poor men. How poor?

297
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,920
As poor as you can be.

298
00:16:50,158 --> 00:16:59,846
= Class 27 of Senior Two =

299
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,119
What's up?

300
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,240
Let's have lunch together.

301
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,520
My girlfriend invites you to join us.

302
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,000
She is here for you.

303
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,200
What am I going to do?

304
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,480
I'm not going to be the third wheel.

305
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:16,040
We've been together for a long time.

306
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,119
It's fine.

307
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,680
Don't be hesitant. Let's join us.

308
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:22,960
Will you come or not?

309
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,920
Will you come or not?

310
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:30,160
Here. Have a try.

311
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,520
It's delicious.

312
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,680
You are a partiality!

313
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,960
I love to eat the tail, too.

314
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,120
It's easy.

315
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,600
Waitress, one potful of lamb's tail.

316
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,160
Hello, sir.

317
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,600
That's a special dish. You need to pay a bit more.

318
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,280
I don't want potful of lamb's tail.

319
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,360
I just want that one.

320
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,480
Here.

321
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,520
I haven't had a bite.

322
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,040
See?

323
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,821
May I ask you something?

324
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,960
He has no new girlfriend at this school.

325
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:12,993
Don't worry.

326
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,080
How do you know what I'm going to ask you?

327
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,960
He had girlfriend before.

328
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,400
Keep an eye on him for me.

329
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,000
I will give my phone number to you later.

330
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,920
Just tell me if you know something.

331
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,302
I will buy you dinner.

332
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,514
Come in.

333
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,640
How can you live in here?

334
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,400
Why not?

335
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,280
I was in the army for so many years.

336
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,400
The environment there isn't better than here.

337
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,320
I could live in there as well.

338
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,800
But it's too rough here.

339
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,000
The houses in this area are all the same.

340
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,920
Do you have to live in this area?

341
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,440
There are many choices near you school.

342
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,080
I like here.

343
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,600
Why?

344
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,680
It's quiet here.

345
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,640
Did your father stop giving you pocket money?

346
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,000
You can tell me if you really don't have any money.

347
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,280
And you can ask help from Li Shuo and Huzi.

348
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,120
Maybe we don't have hundreds of thousands.

349
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,600
But we surely have tens of thousands.

350
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,440
You can choose a better house.

351
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,600
Just treat yourself better.

352
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,280
Besides, a lean camel is bigger than a horse.

353
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,000
You should have some savings of your own

354
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,360
even if your father cuts off your pocket money.

355
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,360
I just want to live in here.

356
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
It has nothing to do with money.

357
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,800
Oh my god. Are you using this phone to contact me?

358
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,200
Yes.

359
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,760
There is noise.

360
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,800
And the signal is not good either.

361
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,200
Why did you elide the name I designed for you?

362
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,080
Come here. Let me show you something.

363
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,320
See?

364
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,720
Do these two fonts look alike?

365
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,280
No. They are different at all.

366
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:31,800
Look closely.

367
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,480
Do they look different at all?

368
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,240
You can't just focus on their outlines.

369
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,200
You need to focus on their typefaces.

370
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,400
They are different at all.

371
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,240
Auntie.

372
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,560
I would like to have one set, too.

373
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,520
Okay.

374
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,360
Why didn't you wait for me?

375
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,280
How did I know you were coming?

376
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,360
I eat breakfast here every day.

377
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,760
You weren't here the other day.

378
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,840
What's wrong? Do you miss me?

379
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,720
Are you kidding me?

380
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,760
Where is your girlfriend?

381
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,680
Finally, she is gone.

382
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,840
Thank you, auntie.

383
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,000
Hey! Watch out!

384
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,840
Your girlfriend asked me to keep an eye on you.

385
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,760
Look at you now.

386
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,520
It seems like it's impossible.

387
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,760
You can't listen to her.

388
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,880
We've been together for three years.

389
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,760
And she's paranoid every day.

390
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:41,960
In fact,

391
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,840
I've never flirted with another girl.

392
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,240
She shouldn't feel safe by her look.

393
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,480
Shut up!

394
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,200
Shan Xiaoxuan was beaten for no reason.

395
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,440
I didn't label her.

396
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,520
She's the one pestering me.

397
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,440
Don't you have any feelings for her?

398
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,520
Shan Xiaoxuan is better than your girlfriend anyway.

399
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,400
She is not my type.

400
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,480
I like the one who has strong character.

401
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,200
I will feel sick

402
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,000
when a girl like her stands by my side.

403
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,640
What kind of girls do you like?

404
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,600
You are the opposite of me.

405
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,880
I like slutty girls.

406
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,840
Then why are you run away so fast every time

407
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:26,800
when Shan Xiaoxuan comes to me?

408
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,120
I am sick of touching her.

409
00:22:34,581 --> 00:22:37,999
# You carried me on your back, recollecting the past, #

410
00:22:38,362 --> 00:22:41,561
# And stalling for time on your own. #

411
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:45,545
# I was smiling while listening to you. #

412
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:49,687
# But a tear-blurred vision faded in. #

413
00:22:50,694 --> 00:22:57,079
# You held my hand that had been wavering, #

414
00:22:57,517 --> 00:23:00,990
# Slowly moving forward... #

415
00:23:01,469 --> 00:23:05,788
# Slowly moving forward with me... #

416
00:23:06,226 --> 00:23:10,117
# Don't say I'd never understand. #

417
00:23:10,141 --> 00:23:13,986
# Don't say I'd never feel the pain. #

418
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:16,620
# As the wind was blowing over, #

419
00:23:17,078 --> 00:23:21,927
# It left some warmth on my lips. #

420
00:23:22,755 --> 00:23:26,313
# Don't tell me you'll be here with me. #

421
00:23:26,337 --> 00:23:30,065
# I didn't say it because I was stuck in silence. #

422
00:23:30,686 --> 00:23:37,248
# You held my hands too tightly to hear what I was saying. #

423
00:23:37,248 --> 00:23:40,854
# Don't say I'd never understand. #

424
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:44,754
# Don't say I'd never feel the pain. #

425
00:23:44,778 --> 00:23:47,659
# As the wind was blowing over, #

426
00:23:48,056 --> 00:23:52,910
# It left some warmth on my lips. #

427
00:23:53,637 --> 00:23:57,229
# Don't tell me you'll be here with me. #

428
00:23:57,253 --> 00:24:01,135
# I didn't say it because I was stuck in silence. #

429
00:24:01,617 --> 00:24:09,111
# You held my hands too tightly to hear what I was saying: #

430
00:24:09,111 --> 00:24:10,395
# Please, don't go... #
