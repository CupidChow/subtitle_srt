Actually, Gu Hai is quite nice to you.

17
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,200
Nice?

18
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,520
Are you kidding me?

19
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,280
How can you know that?

20
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,520
For example, he bought you breakfast this morning.

21
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,600
It's easier to get those bread and cakes.

22
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,600
But...

23
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,600
Baozi, Chinese hamburgers, omelettes and pancakes,

24
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,200
you have to buy them one by one.

25
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,400
Maybe you can buy them in one store.

26
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,840
Have you ever seen such a  diversified breakfast store before?

27
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,160
I wouldn't have that patience

28
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,880
if I were him.

29
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,240
I don't understand.

30
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,680
Why are you always have trouble with Gu Hai?

31
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,200
Me?

32
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,280
He doesn't like me at all.

33
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,000
He always gets me in trouble.

34
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,920
I am so grateful

35
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,400
if someone can make him ignore me.

36
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,520
Oh, come on.

37
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,800
I think he likes you anyway.

38
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,040
Every time I turn around in class,

39
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,160
I can see him staring at you.

40
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,240
Why does he always stare at you

41
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,560
as a man?

42
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,960
How would I know? Maybe he's up to something.

43
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,240
But I saw love in his eyes.

44
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,120
I think he likes you anyway.

45
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,040
Every time I turn around in class,

46
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,080
I can see him staring at you.

47
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,680
Why are you staring at me?

48
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,160
Your head is spinning like a steering wheel.

49
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,080
I have to keep an eye on you.

50
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,760
I think the atmosphere here is too depressing.

51
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,800
You're almost asleep.

52
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:30,720
How about that?

53
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,880
I an going to invite someone to sing an English song.

54
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,680
Who will volunteer?

55
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,920
Bai Luoyin.

56
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,120
Okay. Bai Luoyin.

57
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,000
You are such a versatile person.

58
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,200
You have all the good things in you.

59
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,840
I wish I could have one advantage.

60
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,120
Here, grandma.

61
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,183
Yinzi.

62
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,920
That girl is calling you again.

63
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,040
Dad, you can hang it up.

64
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,720
This...

65
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,840
Forget it. Give the phone to me.

66
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,760
Silly boy.

67
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,360
He is out to answers the phone.

68
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,600
Are you so fed up with me?

69
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,520
Don't call me again.

70
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,520
No! No way!

71
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,920
I will harass your dad all the time if you do that.

72
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,520
That's it.

73
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,320
Have you finished?

74
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,400
Who is that girl?

75
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,080
You don't know her.

76
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:57,957
Right.

77
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,920
How much money do you have in your phone card?

78
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,560
Less than 20 yuan.

79
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,640
I will buy you a new one.

80
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,047
What?

81
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,120
All the contact information is in there.

82
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,960
All gone.

83
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,160
No one's been calling you all day anyway.

84
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,520
You can abandon that phone card.

85
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,440
Grandma, have some meat.

86
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:25,800
Yinzi.

87
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,840
You said you have mouth ulcers the other day. Have you got better?

88
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,120
It's better now.

89
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,720
The unguent you gave me was good.

90
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,523
Yeah?

91
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,520
Where is that unguent?

92
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,240
I put it in the drawer in the room.

93
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,922
- Okay, I'll get it. - The yellow one.

94
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,647
Okay.

95
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,400
Mouth ulcers. Let's eat.

96
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,000
This is hemorrhoids ointment. Not this one.

97
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,040
Dad, where is it?

98
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,040
Isn't it in that drawer?

99
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,760
I can't find it.

100
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,000
Let me help you.

101
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,360
Here it is.

102
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,480
I got mouth ulcers.

103
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,760
This is hemorrhoids ointment.

104
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,400
What's wrong?

105
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,880
Your grandma got beriberi last time.

106
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,880
That's how I cured her.

107
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,320
It's not the same between mouth ulcers and beriberi.

108
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,800
And the glue can be used on the plastics and shoes.

109
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,400
Whatever it is,

110
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,000
it's an effective prescription

111
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,160
if you are cured.

112
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,440
See? You got better.

113
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,800
Come on. Are you cured?

114
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,240
Don't push me.

115
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,360
The character, the site and the time.

116
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,040
So you have to pay attention to it

117
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,600
when you do the reading comprehension.

118
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,640
Bai Luoyin.

119
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,960
When was the Royal Shell established?

120
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,560
In February, 1907.

121
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,320
Good. Sit down.

122
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,760
He can listen to the class while sleeping.

123
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,440
Okay. Let's move to the second question.

124
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,040
What's going on with it?

125
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,040
Please give me a bottle of sleeping pills.

126
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,960
What are you gonna do with it?

127
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,320
It's none of your business. Hurry up!

128
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,520
Our school has regulations.

129
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,200
I can't just give you sleeping pills.

130
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,520
I can't fall asleep.

131
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,560
I only can give you two tablets.

132
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,049
Hand in your homework.

133
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,120
Hand in your homework.

134
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,040
What homework?

135
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:21,960
The mathematic assignment.

136
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,160
You are not the representative of maths lesson.

137
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,120
What are you doing?

138
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,120
The representative said he had something to do.

139
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,240
And asked me to help him.

140
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,600
Had something to do?

141
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,240
He must went to meet girls in the woods.

142
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,080
Just hand in your homework.

143
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,000
No.

144
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,800
I only will hand in my mathematic assignment

145
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,160
to the representative of maths lesson.

146
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,001
You...

147
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,840
Fine. Fine.

148
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,120
Coward.

149
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,640
Yinzi, it's time to hand in you mathematic assignment.

150
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,080
Wake up, Yinzi.

151
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,360
It's time to hand in you mathematic assignment.

152
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,440
The teacher is coming. The teacher is coming.

153
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,440
His face is so pale.

154
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,520
Yinzi. Yinzi.

155
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,600
- Yinzi. Yinzi. - Yinzi.

156
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,720
He is fainted.

157
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,640
Hurry up! Take him to the medical room.

158
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,920
You are so weak.

159
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:15,920
Shut up!

160
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,560
Go away. Leave it to me.

161
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,280
Let's go. Hurry up!

162
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,960
Hurry up!

163
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,880
Doctor! Where's the doctor?

164
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,939
- Doctor! - Hurry up! Come and see how he is doing.

165
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,360
Why are you here again?

166
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,661
- Yinzi. - Do you know him?

167
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,600
Are you You Qi?

168
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,120
You are the most handsome boy in this school.

169
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,720
Don't you know?

170
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,000
There were two girls in here a few days ago...

171
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,000
Stop!

172
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,760
Or I will make your medical room closed.

173
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,080
Let me see.

174
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,160
Did he suddenly faint or...

175
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,080
He take that two sleeping pills.

176
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,480
It's impossible.

177
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,120
That's the normal dose.

178
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,600
He must ate them with other pills.

179
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,616
Right. There seems to be some cold medicine in his drawer.

180
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,360
Bring it to me quickly.

181
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:14,874
Okay.

182
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,200
All the physical signs are quite normal.

183
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,720
It's overdue.

184
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,800
He had a slight fever.

185
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,880
And took those overdue pills with sleeping pills.

186
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,600
He is weak and somnolent now.

187
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,200
He'll be all right when he wakes up.

188
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,440
It's fine. You two just go back to class.

189
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,175
I will take care of him.

190
00:14:55,411 --> 00:14:56,104
Let me do it.

191
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,160
I said I would take care of him.

192
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,280
Let's go. Don't worry.

193
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,400
Dad, I am not thirsty.

194
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,200
You are so welcome.

195
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,040
Why are you here?

196
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,388
You can't recognize you dad so soon.

197
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:31,996
You...

198
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,120
Don't move! You're still taking an injection.

199
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,920
What's going on?

200
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,040
You've took the overdue cold cure.

201
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,720
And then I've put two sleeping pills in your bottle.

202
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,388
You...

203
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,280
You just tell me.

204
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,560
What have I done to you?

205
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,840
I apologize, okay?

206
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,720
Can you just leave me alone?

207
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,640
I can compensate you for all your losses.

208
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,920
But I like to mess with you.

209
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,560
Are you sick?

210
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,920
Yeah.

211
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,200
You should take pills if you are sick.

212
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,400
You are my pills.

213
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,560
What do you mean?

214
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,800
You have to suffer

215
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,720
if you want to cure me.

216
00:16:31,052 --> 00:16:32,788
= Class 27 of Senior Two =

217
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,280
How many points did you get?

218
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:47,960
You mean total points?

219
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:48,901
Yeah.

220
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,480
I got 521. How about you?

221
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,120
I haven't figured out the score yet.

222
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,800
Let me help you.

223
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,960
150 points.

224
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,640
You got 126 points in Chinese.

225
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,240
It's unfair.

226
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,319
If this composition is transcribed by me,

227
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,079
there will be under 40 points.

228
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,760
You got 287 points in integrated science course.

229
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,560
So your total points is 694.

230
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,720
Did you cheat?

231
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,920
You Qi sits in front of me and you sits behind me.

232
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,040
How can I cheat?

233
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,600
Yinzi entered our class with the first place.

He always be the top five in the class.

235
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,640
You are so bad.

236

Why?

237
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,320
You've destroyed my ability to accept genius.

238
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,120
You've destroyed my ability to tolerate fools as well.

239
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,120
Bai Luoyin, get out!

240
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,320
Bai Luoyin, I am telling you.

241

Just keep humble.

242

Or I will expose your secret.

243
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,680
If I do it,

244
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,760
I am afraid that you will drop out of school

245
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,880
You can't get your way

246

with high marks.

247
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,440
If you mess with me,

248
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,480
you're gonna get the hell out of here

249

even if you're the best in the school.

250
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,600
What kind of secret?

251
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,920
Just say it. Share it with me.

252

Are you sure?

253
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,320
I am afraid that...

254
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,360
you will beg me on your knees.

255
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,360
Just say it!

256
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,600
Fine. It's your choice.

257
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,640
Everybody, listen.

258
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,400
I only say it once.

259

Do you know what his mother does?

00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,400
You'll be surprised.

His mother is a...

264
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,200
Wait. I should change another description.

265
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,880
It's called a lost girl now.

Apologize to him!

269
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,800
Why?

270
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:26,760
I will put you in jail

271

if you dare to touch me again.

272

Apologize to him!

No?

I will count to three.
