16
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,000
Gu Hai, come here.

17
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,846
What?

18
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,400
Do you arrange my father's promotion?

19
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,987
Your father's what?

20
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,953
Stop pretending.

21
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,110
Who allows you to make the decision on you own,

22
00:01:56,172 --> 00:01:57,280
and transfer my father to that company.

23
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,200
What do you mean?

24
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,886
Providing relief to us?

25
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,280
Or you only feel comfortable by giving us something in return

26
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,080
just because we buy you a phone?

27
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,760
Bai Luoyin, I don't want to hear you saying something like this.

28
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,892
What means providing relief to your family?

29
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,680
Is anything wrong with your family?

30
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
What can I provide as the relief?

31
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,200
I just see Mr. Bai

32
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,889
working so hard every day to support this family.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,840
I can't bear to see that.

34
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,467
He is your father.

35
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,323
You can't let your father work in that factory,

36
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,101
suffering so much pain,

37
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,461
just because of your pride.

38
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,187
Don't you mind the business of my family.

39
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,541
Say that again.

40
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,166
It's the same no matter how many times I say.

41
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,092
Don't you mind the business of my family.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,569
You think I won't beat you?

43
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,600
Right.

44
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,984
I should have consulted with you in advance.

45
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,283
But I was afraid of your stubbornness.

46
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,996
You would deny my idea when I just told you.

47
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,427
Yinzi, I don't have other intentions.

48
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,920
The company I arrange for Mr. Bai is very formal.

49
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,141
He won't sit there, reading newspaper and drinking tea every day.

50
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,095
Employees have to have real skills there.

51
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,575
I always feel that Mr. Bai is a competent man.

52
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,655
Otherwise, he won't have

53
00:03:13,704 --> 00:03:14,520
such a clever son.

54
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,012
I just want to give Mr. Bai an opportunity

55
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,240
so that he could make full use of

56
00:03:21,286 --> 00:03:22,160
his capability that was wasted over the first half of his life.

57
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,947
Afterwards, in front of the landlady, Mrs Zou,

58
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,046
he can be more confident, right?

59
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,236
When I helped Mrs Zou the other day,

60
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,760
You didn't say anything.

61
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,818
Why it comes to your father,

62
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,492
you can't accept it?

63
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,803
It is different.

64
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,680
What is the difference?

65
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,760
This is how the society works.

66
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,200
Working depends on social relations.

67
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,960
I have so many good social relations that you can use.

68
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,600
What a good thing.

69
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,003
Why you are so stubborn?

70
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,926
It's not because I'm stubborn.

71
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,200
I also have many buddies.

72
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,360
I'll ask them for help if necessary.

73
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,000
But when it comes to you,

74
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,760
Why it is so different?

75
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,800
Yinzi, Yinzi,

76
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,729
So be it.

77
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,480
Dahai,

78
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,046
The luckiest thing

79
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,800
in Yinzi's life is

80
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,313
making friends with you.

81
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,264
I am really grateful to you.

82
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,803
Thank you for being so kind to Yinzi.

83
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,390
Cheers.

84
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,040
Cheers.

85
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,836
Dahai,

86
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,618
I also think of you.

87
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,000
Today, when I just got my salary,

88
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,680
I went to the furniture market at once.

89
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,692
And bought a bed for you.

90
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,061
Sorry that we didn't give you better living conditions.

91
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,550
And let you sleep with Yinzi on one bed.

92
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,240
Now, it's great.

93
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,480
You guys can sleep on your own bed.

94
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,280
Neither of you will feel crowded.

95
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,501
Sir, how about returning the bed?

96
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,824
I sleep very well

97
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,658
when Yinzi and I sleep on one bed.

98
00:05:16,664 --> 00:05:17,643
That is not proper.

99
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,978
Since you have lived in our house,

100
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,338
I can't treat you badly.

101
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,138
Don't be shy.

102
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,356
I was kind of short of money a few days ago.

103
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,664
In fact, I should have bought it for you before.

104
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,680
So the moment I got the salary today,

105
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,800
I went to the furniture market immediately.

106
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,741
Sir, let me tell you,

107
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,489
I won't live for long in your house.

108
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,387
Maybe one day, I will move back.

109
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,240
So the money you speed on the bed is

110
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,784
a waste, right, sir?

111
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,273
Gu Hai, since my father has bought it for you,

112
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,181
don't refuse it any more.

113
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,440
Yes. Cheers.

114
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,772
The room is so small.

115
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,129
Now another bed is put here.

116
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,067
There is no space for walking.

117
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,680
Without any place for walking,

118
00:06:23,704 --> 00:06:24,560
how can you come in?

119
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,012
Flying?

120
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:36,227
It's so good that I can sleep alone.

121
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,953
You will have a cold tomorrow morning.

122
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,104
I don't care that.

123
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,089
Fine. Turn off the light and go to bed.

124
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,516
Go away.

125
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,584
What are you doing? Go away.

126
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,956
Is it necessary to be so cruel?

127
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,975
We cuddled up every night before.

128
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,640
And you slept so well.

129
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,944
Sometimes if I got my hands off you,

130
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,630
you would come to my arms yourself.

131
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,729
Come here again?

132
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,960
Cone here again?

133
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,640
If you come here again, I will change the room with my father.

134
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,458
I won't come.

135
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,363
# If I never met you, #

136
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,040
# Where would I live now? #

137
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,384
# What the days would be? #

138
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,360
# Was the life worth cherishing? #

139
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,680
# Maybe I would meet someone, #

140
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,396
Can you stop singing?

141
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,843
If you think my voice is unpleasant, then you sing to me.

142
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,153
Why should I?

143
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,556
Then I will sing if you don't.

144
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,698
# Maybe I would meet someone, #

145
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,720
# If I never met you, #

146
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,252
# Where would I live now? #

147
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,840
# What the days would be? #

148
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,255
# Was the life worth cherishing? #

149
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,480
# Maybe I would meet someone, #

150
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,720
What's that?

151
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,640
A cactus died in the yard.

152
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,200
Aren't you afraid that you will sleep on it?

153
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,396
Before I sleep on it,

154
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,923
I will let you try first.

155
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,975
You are so ruthless.

156
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,975
Help me pluck the thrones.

157
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,941
So many thrones. How can I sleep?

158
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,569
Help me pluck the thrones.

159
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,390
Why you wear so less?

160
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,910
I always wear like that.

161
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,960
Then when you sleep with me,

162
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,209
Why do you wear so much?

163
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,360
Find out the reasons by yourself. Turn around.

164
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,840
What are you doing? What are you doing?

165
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,870
It aches.

166
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,646
Do you believe that I will kick you out?

167
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,464
Let the thrones prick you.

168
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,461
Damn it.

169
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,741
Why you sleep on my bed again?

170
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,852
Who sleeps on your bed?

171
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,735
Have a close look.

172
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,187
I sleep on my own bed.

173
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,049
How come?

174
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,655
Why I can't separate them?

175
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,676
The beds are glued together with your hemorrhoids ointment.

176
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,960
Don't you say your hemorrhoids ointment is omnipotent?

177
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,680
Yinzi, Yinzi, Yinzi,

178
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,720
when I went back home at the weekend,

179
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,467
I saw Gu Hali's girlfriend

180
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,606
staying with another man.

181
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,852
They seemed very close.

182
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,120
I don't dare to tell Gu Hai.

183
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,596
You tell this thing to him.

184
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,784
Give the note to me.

185
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,489
Why should I give it to you?

186
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,947
You Qi gives it to me.

187
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,209
Let me see it.

188
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,883
Let me see it.

189
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,221
Give it to me.

190
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,818
Give the note to me.

191
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,018
Bai Luoyin, give the note to me.

192
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,080
Jin Lulu, we haven't broken up yet.

193
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,800
We are still couples.

194
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,240
Why I can't feel it?

195
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,720
I just don't like you.

196
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,756
Why you disgust me by such behaviors?

197
00:13:40,781 --> 00:13:41,655
I'm disgusting?

198
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,926
Right. I'm disgusting.

199
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,080
Then let me tell you, Gu Hai,

200
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,040
I have done so many disgusting things.

201
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,486
I have slept with him long before.

202
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,104
You think you got some benefits.

203
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,360
I'm telling you,

204
00:13:51,495 --> 00:13:52,440
Before I had relationship with you,

205
00:13:52,547 --> 00:13:53,827
I hadn't been a virgin already.

206
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,612
We are done.

207
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,046
Dahai, don't leave. Don't leave.

208
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,960
You misunderstand me.

209
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,470
I just want you to be jealous.

210
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,652
Let you have a sense of crisis.

211
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,870
We are just pretending to have an affair.

212
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,341
He doesn't love me at all.

213
00:14:07,396 --> 00:14:08,252
And I don't love him.

214
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,960
We are just acting in front of you, Dahai.

215
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,560
Trust me, Dahai.

216
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,655
Go back to the bed.

217
00:14:16,086 --> 00:14:16,978
You wear too little.

218
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:18,836
Don't gat a cold.

219
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,320
Dahai,

220
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,292
Dahai,

221
00:15:20,307 --> 00:15:20,920
Hello?

222
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,756
Will you come back?

223
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,018
I lost my girlfriend.

224
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,726
Can't you comfort me?

225
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,476
I found them sleeping together in the hotel.

226
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,055
Are you angry, cuckold?

227
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,024
You don't comfort me.

228
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,175
And instead, laugh at me, huh?

229
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,200
Why should I comfort you?

230
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,920
I don't find you feeling sad.

231
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,904
How can I not feel sad?

232
00:16:32,178 --> 00:16:33,870
Three years.

233
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,240
Don't scare yourself by using the time.

234
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,409
To tell the truth in all conscience,

235
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,270
are you sad or heartbroken?

236
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,320
I am indeed very sad.

237
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,670
I hear that.

238
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,116
Your conscience is abusing you.

239
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,720
Tomorrow Mrs Zoe's restaurant will be open.

240
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,224
It is so fast.

241
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,000
Are they ready?

242
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,886
Almost.

243
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,880
Let's go there together tomorrow.

244
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,040
Not tomorrow. How about now?

245
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,120
The day breaks. Let's go.

246
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,012
What are you doing here?

247
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,840
I am telling you,

248
00:17:48,683 --> 00:17:50,880
it's impossible that that woman will treat you sincerely.

249
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,163
She treats you kindly because she is intentional.

250
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,692
Human mind is very complicated now.

251
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,400
What intention?

252
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,387
Intention to take our money? Do we have that?

253
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,855
Intention to take our power? Do we have that?

254
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,335
If she is just to get my father,

255
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,824
then that is enough for me to accept her.

256
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,320
Why you can accept your father's remarriage,

257
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,098
but you can't accept mine?

258
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,375
Don't I have the right to choose my happiness?

259
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,793
Or you think all the happy women

260
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,806
should be narrow-minded as she is.

261
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,600
I don't say I don't accept it.

262
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,267
When did I say that?

263
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,790
Number five, your wonton is ready.

264
00:18:33,163 --> 00:18:35,840
Number seven, your steamed dumplings are ready.

265
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,889
Mrs Zou, where is Yinzi?

266
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,255
He has just been here.

267
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,864
It seems that someone comes to see him and he goes out.

268
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,280
I go to have a look.

269
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,760
OK. Go and see what happens.

270
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,966
Because we are not the same sort of people.

271
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,009
What are you doing here?

272
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,720
Why are you talking to her? Let's go.

273
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,320
You know her.

274
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,880
She is the new wife my father marries.

275
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,160
I have told you.

276
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,120
After failing to persuading me,

277
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,520
she comes to persuade you.

278
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,840
Ignore her. Let's go.

279
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,523
Wait.

280
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,169
You guys know each other.

281
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,298
That's great. Great.

282
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,153
You haven't realized it yet, right?

283
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,889
This is my son

284
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,849
who I often mentioned to you.

285
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,273
I know that you guys have the same temper.

286
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,707
You must get long very well.

287
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,569
Great.

288
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,270
Son, where are you going?

289
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,686
Nothing,

290
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,240
Dad, I am going out for a while.

291
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,846
Where are you going?

292
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,680
I am going back to bring something.

293
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,680
I will be back soon.

294
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,560
Yinzi, Yinzi,

295
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,800
Bai Luoyin,

296
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,329
don't you hear me?

297
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,520
I hear you.

298
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,892
Then you still ignore me.

299
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,480
Go away.

300
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,720
You ask me to go away?

301
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,240
What right do you have to let me go?

302
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,600
You, liar.

303
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,904
Where did I lie to you?

304
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,787
I also don't know it until today.

305
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,572
Don't you hear Jiang Yuan's tone?

306
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,680
Where did I lie to you?

307
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,200
Bai Luoyin, what do you want?

308
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,224
Am I not kind to you?

309
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,840
Are you the only one who get wronged?

310
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,000
Your mother has had an affair with my father for so many years.

311
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,738
The cause of my mother's death is still mysterious.

312
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,080
It is me who should be angry.

313
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,723
It is me who should say go away.

314
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,713
Right. You're right.

315
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,809
Leave now. If you leave, everything will be fine for both of us.

316
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,449
You tell me why I don't leave.

317
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,246
If I am willing to part with you,

318
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,667
why would I degrade myself and don't leave?

319
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,910
No matter how I hate your mother,

320
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,280
that is nothing, compared with my affection for you.

321
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,092
Bai Luoyin,

322
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,440
you hate my father. I won't stop you.

323
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,544
But why do you shift your hatred on me?

324
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,676
Don't you think that is too cruel?

325
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,880
Gu Hai, I don't hate you.

326
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,560
And I don't hate your family.

327
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,400
I just can't accept you.

328
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,440
I can't accept your family.

329
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,978
Because I have my family as well.

330
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,960
Your family is a pain on my family.

331
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,698
You mean,

332
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,600
I have to leave.

333
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,840
I will pack those things for you.

334
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,243
Bai Luoyin, you are so cruel.

335
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,538
Enough.

336
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,812
You don't need to pack those things. I don't need them.

337
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,104
Tell Mrs Zou for me,

338
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,206
I congratulate her on the opening of her business.

339
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,365
# You carried me on your back, recollecting the past, #

340
00:23:06,115 --> 00:23:09,315
# And stalling for time on your own. #

341
00:23:09,814 --> 00:23:13,106
# I was smiling while listening to you. #

342
00:23:13,322 --> 00:23:17,445
# But a tear-blurred vision faded in. #

343
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:24,792
# You held my hand that had been wavering, #

344
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:28,694
# Slowly moving forward... #

345
00:23:28,965 --> 00:23:33,118
# Slowly moving forward with me... #

346
00:23:33,574 --> 00:23:37,623
# Don't say I'd never understand. #

347
00:23:37,697 --> 00:23:41,543
# Don't say I'd never feel the pain. #

348
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:44,355
# As the wind was blowing over, #

349
00:23:44,602 --> 00:23:49,611
# It left some warmth on my lips. #

350
00:23:50,042 --> 00:23:53,666
# Don't tell me you'll be here with me. #

351
00:23:53,669 --> 00:23:57,851
# I didn't say it because I was stuck in silence. #

352
00:23:57,972 --> 00:24:04,669
# You held my hands too tightly to hear what I was saying. #

353
00:24:04,817 --> 00:24:08,632
# Don't say I'd never understand. #

354
00:24:08,632 --> 00:24:12,460
# Don't say I'd never feel the pain. #

355
00:24:12,462 --> 00:24:15,654
# As the wind was blowing over, #

356
00:24:15,657 --> 00:24:20,620
# It left some warmth on my lips. #

357
00:24:20,842 --> 00:24:24,731
# Don't tell me you'll be here with me. #

358
00:24:24,732 --> 00:24:28,866
# I didn't say it because I was stuck in silence. #

359
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:36,540
# You held my hands too tightly to hear what I was saying: #

360
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:38,263
# Please, don't go... #
