Dad.

18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,320
Why did you throw my underwear

00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,460
into the drain again?

20
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,730
It's not possible.

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,210
I might threw it away by mistake

when pouring away water.

Wait. Why did you throw it away?

24
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,440
A big fat waste.

25
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,740
You can still wear it after washing it.

26
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,280
Then save it for yourself.

But...

28
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,120
I'm going to school.

OK, come back early.

00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,460
You called me yesterday,

31
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,730
but hung up before finishing what you said.

32
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,050
What did you want to tell me?

33
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:08,580
My mom is getting married again.

34
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,040
You've got a mom?

35
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,000
You thought my dad was hermaphrodite like an earthworm?

36
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,680
So he could finish fertilization

37
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,920
by joining segment 5 and segment 6 together?

38
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,520
Nope. Don't tease me.

39
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,800
I'm serious.

40
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,800
I've known you since we were kids.

41
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,320
But I've never seen your mom.

42
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,320
Bullshit.

43
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,580
My mom was here with me last week.

Don't you remember?

45
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,920
She always backs up her car near your house.

46
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,440
That's your mom?

47
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,280
She looks much younger than my niece!

48
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,840
Are you looking for trouble?

49
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,780
No. it's just my niece is a newborn

50
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,360
but she's got lots of wrinkles on her forehead.

51
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,960
Newborns are all like that.

52
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:51,170
Hai, the wedding feast reservation is done.

53
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,230
When will you leave for it tomorrow?

54
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,490
When did I say I would go?

55
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,010
General said it was an order.

56
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:58,960
No disobedience.

57
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,320
Then tie me up and send me there.

58
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,400
Don't be so stubborn.

59
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,600
Your mom passed away long time ago.

60
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,480
And General is only in his 40's.

61
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,610
You can't make him single for the rest of his life.

62
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,870
I'll hate him forever because of my mom's death.

63
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,080
Hai, you can't say things like that!

64
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,230
If General heard what you said, he'd rage about it.

65
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,960
Your mom died in an accident.

66
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,440
The forensic expert proved it.

67
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,640
- Why do you still doubt him? - Enough, stop!

68
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,020
I have my own judgment.

69
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,960
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

70
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,400
How did you get so tanned?

71
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,610
I've been swimming lately.

72
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,360
My dad is getting married tomorrow.

73
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,680
So soon?

74
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,040
Are you going to their wedding?

75
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,400
Should I go or not?

76
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,800
You should go. Why not?

77
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,120
You need to let his wife know

78
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,980
she's not the only one who can call the shots.

79
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,450
She can never be capricious and do whatever she wants.

80
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,240
I really don't want to see them.

81
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,180
You know what?

82
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,920
When my mom was still alive,

83
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,620
they hooked up with each other.

84
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,890
Someone in my dad's position can never divorce and marry again.

85
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,120
So, you should know what I mean.

86
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,490
Maybe it's you who makes things too complicated?

87
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:08,260
Gu Hai, why are you keeping silent tonight?

88
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,630
I'm not supposed to talk while eating.

89
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,000
Talk. You can do it tonight.

90
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:21,420
General, I have nothing to talk about.

91
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,060
Gosh! Since when my dad's got such a lousy taste?

92
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:34,880
Sorry.

93
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,160
He's tasted so many good things

94
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,640
that he wants to taste shitty things now?

95
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,040
Hai, eat some more.

96
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,600
By the way, ask your son to move in tomorrow.

97
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,200
Hai, my son is at your age.

98
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,480
His character is similar to yours.

99
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,320
I think you two will get along.

100
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,240
If he moves in, I'll leave.

101
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,330
Fine. Leave now!

102
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,120
Hai!

103
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,300
My son will not move in to live with me.

104
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,430
He wants to be with his dad.

105
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,960
I've never considered to ask him to move in.

106
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,090
Don't be mad at your dad.

107
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,710
I'll leave no matter if he moves in or not!

108
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,300
Keep eating.

Mrs. Zhou, let me help you.

I can handle it.

113
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,130
You're up earlier today. Have a seat.

114
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,820
- Are you doing well? - Yes.

115

Where is Yinzi? Won't he come for breakfast?

116

- Yinzi? - Yes.

117
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,980
He has gone to the hospital to get his grandma's medicines.

118
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:14,960
Good boy.

119
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,320
He should have had breakfast before leaving.

120
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,800
He didn't have time for eating.

121
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,560

Luoyin!

125
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,200
I called out to you several times, why didn't you respond?

00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:51,980
If you don't respond, fine.

127
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,680
I'll just go inside.

128
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,380
Luoyin, I thought about it.

129
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,460
The high school you're going

130
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,960
has poor conditions and low college-going rates.

131
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,480
I've found a private school for you.

132
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,160
You should study there for two years.

133
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,550
After the college-entrance examination, I'll send you abroad.

134
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:26,840
No.

135
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:34,710
Luoyin...

136
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,230
You have the right to hate me.

137
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,360
And you have the right to think I'm a bad mother.

138
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,200
But you can't make yourself suffer from it.

139
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,760
You won't have a future if you stay in the lousy school.

140
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,640
My new husband has a son at your age.

141
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,680
He is studying in the private high school.

142
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,600
You're never less than him.

143
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,730
I know...

144
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,760
I've never been a responsible mother.

145
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,760
But...

146
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,730
I want to make things up to you.

147
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,040
Mom loves you.

148
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,150
You're still a child.

149
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,150
And I'm still young.

150
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,010
Could you please give me a chance?

151
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,240
I'll give you a chance.

152
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,560
Just leave me alone.

153
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,250
Luoyin!

154
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:39,600
Besides...

155
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,050
Never talk about your new family in front of me.

156
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:43,440
So irritating.

157
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,760
Luoyin! Luoyin!

158
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,760
What? You're going to transfer to another school?

159
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,090
The school I attend now is too near from home.

160
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,310
Since I've already moved out,

161
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,720
I feel weird to go to that school.

162
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,680
My husband does have connections with school principals.

163
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,160
Then make it happen.

164
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,710
But I have to make it clear.

165
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,450
You'll only transfer to a key high school.

166
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,290
The conditions there may not be as good as your previous school,

167
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:18,500
but it cannot be bad.
