Turn to this side. Sleeping like that is not good for your heart.

17
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,504
Turn around and sleep.

18
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,479
Turn around and sleep.

19
00:02:11,907 --> 00:02:12,480
Did you hear me?

20
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,720
I'm talking to you!

21
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,640
All right, all right.

22
00:02:23,665 --> 00:02:24,919
I won't make any sound.

23
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,926
Go to sleep, go to sleep.

24
00:03:41,011 --> 00:03:43,511
Do they have to flirt like that while playing?

25
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,680
You can stop, it's time for me to get on the field.

26
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,440
You Qi is so handsome!

27
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,560
Pass me the ball.

28
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,723
You Qi, pass me the ball.

29
00:04:18,154 --> 00:04:20,839
You Qi is so handsome! You Qi is so awesome!

30
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,040
What are you doing?

31
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,935
What are you doing?

32
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,814
What team are you from? Get out!

33
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,095
Don't beat me.

34
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,095
- What if I beat you? - Beating is a foul!

35
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,696
What if I beat you?

36
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,126
You Qi, just go back and keep acting cute.

37
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,662
How dare you push him?

38
00:04:51,568 --> 00:04:53,271
Gu Hai, Gu Hai, leave him alone

39
00:04:53,296 --> 00:04:54,016
Just take a look at Yin Zi first!

40
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:55,760
Wait for me!

41
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,521
Yin Zi!

42
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,960
Yin Zi, let me see.

43
00:04:58,802 --> 00:04:59,503
Yin Zi!

44
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,415
Are you okay?

45
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,120
I'm fine. I'm fine.

46
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,640
Is this fine for you?

47
00:05:03,665 --> 00:05:04,440
- What? -I'm fine.

48
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,880
Who hurt you like this, Yin Zi?

49
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,080
Let me have a look.

50
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,680
I'm fine. It won't leave any scars.

51
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,440
You! It's a good move

52
00:05:15,636 --> 00:05:17,240
to take revenge for our Yin Zi.

53
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,008
Hey girl,

54
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,320
what are you saying?

55
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,710
Who's the girl?

56
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,445
It's you!

57
00:05:23,516 --> 00:05:24,036
You...

58
00:05:24,132 --> 00:05:26,406
Gu Hai! That's enough.

59
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,328
Well. What's wrong with him?

60
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:35,920
Nothing.

61
00:05:36,391 --> 00:05:37,468
Is it okay?

62
00:05:37,531 --> 00:05:38,240
Just leave him alone.

63
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,790
Get on!

64
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,760
What are you doing?

65
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,040
What are you doing?

66
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,120
I asked you to get on the bike.

67
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,259
I'll do it myself.

68
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,650
Mom, give me the chopsticks.

69
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,525
One pair is enough.

70
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,800
Dad, I'm home. Hi, Grandma.

71
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,727
What's the matter with your face, son?

72
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,120
Nothing, I just fell down.

73
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,335
Let me have a look.

74
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,860
It's okay. It's just a little skin scratch.

75
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,665
Where's Da Hai? Why didn't Da Hai come with you?

76
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,640
He's dead.

77
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,000
Is he dead? How?

78
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,141
All right, forget it.

79
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,320
Just do what you were doing.

80
00:06:59,320 --> 00:06:59,920
Nothing.

81
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,300
What would you like to eat today?

82
00:07:11,325 --> 00:07:12,261
Why didn't you wait for me?

83
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,415
Yin Zi said you were dead.

84
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,980
I'm dead? Dead?

85
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,400
Who are you talking about?

86
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,082
Who told you to come?

87
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,960
Aren't you willing to answer me?

88
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,560
I wasn't ignoring you.

89
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,280
It's you who wanted to think like this.

90
00:07:43,775 --> 00:07:44,926
I already got medicines from the infirmary,

91
00:07:44,951 --> 00:07:45,911
why did you buy these?

92
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,637
You bought it in the infirmary with someone else,

93
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:52,080
but I bought this.

94
00:07:52,793 --> 00:07:53,600
How could they be the same?

95
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,926
Don't throw it away.

96
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,400
Let's take a shower together later.

97
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,560
I will help to clean your body

98
00:08:05,012 --> 00:08:07,207
Your wounds got to avoid contacting with water.

99
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,040
I just scratched my face,

100
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,400
how can it affect me during the shower?

101
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,848
You have also wound on your leg.

102
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,020
It's just a bit swollen.

103
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,332
It's not really wounded.

104
00:08:19,012 --> 00:08:20,240
It's normal that two guys have a shower together,

105
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,400
why are you so embarrassed?

106
00:08:22,496 --> 00:08:23,720
I don't even want to look at you.

107
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,730
I still feel worried about you.

108
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,799
Get out of here.

109
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,280
Fine, fine. I'm not looking.

110
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,300
What a freaky voyeur!

111
00:08:51,013 --> 00:08:52,040
We'd better not disinfect it

112
00:08:52,255 --> 00:08:53,200
and just apply ointment on it.

113
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,440
Don't move. Don't be scared, it won't hurt.

114
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,615
Didn't you say it wouldn't hurt?

115
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,560
Did you really believe that I said it wouldn't hurt?

116
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,830
Does it still hurt?

117
00:09:09,447 --> 00:09:11,640
Don't let that effeminate guy

118
00:09:11,665 --> 00:09:12,666
go around you anymore.

119
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,361
Can you speak in a decent way?

120
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,104
He just looks that way, it's not my fault.

121
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,611
Yang Meng is my childhood friend.

122
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,143
Yang Meng?

123
00:09:21,486 --> 00:09:23,510
He should get another cute name since he's so cute.

124
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,940
Are you done?

125
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:27,960
Okay.

126
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,763
Are you crazy?

127
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,240
Why don't you sleep

128
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:50,544
instead of touching me?

129
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,255
I've been staying here for about more than 10 nights,

130
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,779
why haven't I ever seen you do something?

131
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,640
Even if I do it, I won't let you see.

132
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,091
When do you do it usually?

133
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,640
I've been following you 24 hours a day

134
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,720
but still haven't seen it.

135
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,120
Is it interesting to talk about it in the evening?

136
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,160
Isn't it the topic usually discussed at night?

137
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,386
Get out of my way.

138
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,722
We are all men. What if I touch you?

139
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,975
Haven't you heard that

140
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,370
that letting some guy check on you,

141
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,308
You will do better in bed in the future.

142
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,840
Bullshit, I've never heard that.

143
00:10:30,003 --> 00:10:31,378
Even without you checking on me,

144
00:10:31,403 --> 00:10:32,816
I'm still the best.

145
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,272
It sounds like you've got a lot of experience.

146
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,325
So what? Did you do it?

147
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,255
It's none of your business.

148
00:10:46,295 --> 00:10:48,095
Are you a virgin or not?

149
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:50,950
Ask yourself first.

150
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,239
If you are, then I am.

151
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,958
How about

152
00:10:57,983 --> 00:11:00,145
tell me about your first time with your girlfriend

153
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,145
and I'll tell you about my first time with my girlfriend?

154
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,366
I don't want to hear your first time.

155
00:11:06,392 --> 00:11:08,366
Don't you want to hear an exciting story like that?

156
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,811
Exciting?

157
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,280
Wasn't it just the two guys do it with each other?

158
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,139
Who are you talking about?

159
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,647
Did it hurt?

160
00:11:20,233 --> 00:11:21,160
Go to sleep.

161
00:11:23,988 --> 00:11:26,030
Don't! Tell me about it.

162
00:11:27,874 --> 00:11:29,686
For what?

163
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,495
Just satisfy my curiosity.

164
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,780
I'm particularly interested in your performance in bed.

165
00:11:36,292 --> 00:11:38,201
Are you embarrassing me?

166
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,162
I've broken up with her.

167
00:11:40,593 --> 00:11:42,803
If you don't tell me, it's surely because you're not that good.

168
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,850
Then tell me about your first time, okay?

169
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,960
My first time, huh?

170
00:11:49,945 --> 00:11:52,084
That's mind-blowing.

171
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,160
Mind-blowing? Tell me about it.

172
00:11:56,076 --> 00:11:57,186
My first time,

173
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,709
Jin Lulu and I...

174
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,320
I can't think about it anymore. It makes me so thirsty.

175
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,840
It's too exciting.

176
00:12:10,294 --> 00:12:12,255
Have you ever tried to get someone else to help you out?

177
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,356
It's great.

178
00:12:13,381 --> 00:12:15,317
I like to do it by myself.

179
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,301
We're brothers!

180
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,747
What's wrong with helping each other?

181
00:12:23,489 --> 00:12:24,739
Get out!

182
00:12:27,154 --> 00:12:28,278
Where are you going?

183
00:12:28,445 --> 00:12:28,965
I'm going to pee.

184
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,270
It's such a cold day,

185
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,856
if you let junior Yin Zi freeze,

186
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,176
I'll be mad with you.

187
00:12:49,688 --> 00:12:50,320
- Thanks.  - Auntie.

188
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,946
Here you are.

189
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,125
So what?

190
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,625
Are you gonna eat here or take one to go?

191
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,559
Why have you changed your tables and chairs?

192
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,840
Last night a bunch of guys bashed them up.

193
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:03,692
- Bashed them? - Yeah.

194
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,400
Who are they? City management?
= Breakfast and Snacks =

195
00:13:06,413 --> 00:13:08,135
= Breakfast and Snacks =

196
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,576
Don't ask. It wasn't them.
= Breakfast and Snacks =

197
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,030
Here. Take it and go to school. Come on.

198
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,160
Go to school. Come on.

199
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,160
Let's go.

200
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,565
Give me two pancakes.

201
00:13:30,152 --> 00:13:30,752
Sure.

202
00:13:47,058 --> 00:13:49,214
Does your dad wanna marry Aunt Zou?

203
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,292
Why do you care so much?

204
00:13:53,526 --> 00:13:54,886
I'm just asking.

205
00:14:00,812 --> 00:14:01,581
Sir Zhang.

206
00:14:02,565 --> 00:14:03,675
Here comes the young master

207
00:14:04,558 --> 00:14:05,519
Come in, sit down, please.

208
00:14:07,902 --> 00:14:08,302
Sit down, please.

209
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,440
Gu Hai, is General Gu still well?

210
00:14:13,465 --> 00:14:15,237
He's great. And you?

211
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,170
I'm fine. I'm great.

212
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,800
Sir Zhang

213
00:14:20,925 --> 00:14:22,280
I need your help with something.

214
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:23,870
Just say it.

215
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:26,011
I want to find a storefront on this street.

216
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,190
Storefront?

217
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,722
So what? Do you want to do business when you are so young?

218
00:14:32,312 --> 00:14:34,232
It's not me. I'll help my aunt find it.

219
00:14:34,257 --> 00:14:35,247
Aunt?

220
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:37,781
Who is the aunt?

221
00:14:38,048 --> 00:14:40,052
Please don't ask. Just help me find it

222
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,960
Alright. Whatever the young master says.

223
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,513
Okay, Sir Zhang, I'll go first.

224
00:14:45,538 --> 00:14:46,153
Okay.

225
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,444
Be safe.

226
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,887
This is a good dog. Is it yours?

227
00:14:54,122 --> 00:14:55,997
Yes, it was a gift from someone else.

228
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,778
Okay, let me take him home for a couple days.

229
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,695
Young Master, you can't play with it.

230
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,731
This dog is fierce

231
00:15:02,756 --> 00:15:04,544
What could I do if it bites you?

232
00:15:04,678 --> 00:15:06,708
It's gonna be fine, I have a professional dog trainer.

233
00:15:06,884 --> 00:15:07,833
I won't treat your dog badly.

234
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,465
Don't worry.

235
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,762
Let's go.

236
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,703
Well, it's...

237
00:15:21,716 --> 00:15:23,630
Yin Zi! Good news!

238
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,560
What's up?

239
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,090
Your Aunt Zou happened to attend a government-organized program

240
00:15:28,115 --> 00:15:29,895
that is supporting peddlers.

241
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,779
And they're gonna give her a storefront at the intersection

242
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,099
to support vulnerable groups

243
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,224
so they are gonna let her rent it for free for a period of time.

244
00:15:37,498 --> 00:15:39,372
I'm going to clean up the store for her.

245
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,622
A free lease?

246
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,771
Why haven't I heard of such a project?

247
00:15:44,796 --> 00:15:46,458
I haven't heard of it, either.

248
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,380
Anyway, it's just in time.

249
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,720
Thank you for Aunt Zou.

250
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,720
What are you thanking me for that?

251
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,861
Don't be stupid.

252
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,160
She's also my auntie.

253
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,275
Why haven't you gone home?

254
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,049
I had a fight with my dad and I don't want to go back.

255
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,200
Then you can live in my house.

256
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,603
My house is a little run-down,

257
00:16:34,792 --> 00:16:36,752
but we treat you with all our heart.

258
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,174
Since you came,

259
00:16:40,471 --> 00:16:41,991
my dad's cooking has improved.

260
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,160
I can tell

261
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,200
he really likes you.

262
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:48,877
What about you?

263
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,640
Have a guess.

264
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,767
I think you really treasure me.

265
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,359
Bai Luoyin,

266
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,000
how can I like you so much?

267
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,695
What did you say?

268
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,520
Nothing.

269
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,389
You're all here!

270
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:28,911
Here you are.

271
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,934
Let me introduce.

272
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,880
This is my new friend from school,

273
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,800
Bai Luoyin.

274
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,215
He's quite handsome.

275
00:17:36,786 --> 00:17:38,356
This is Li Shuo.

276
00:17:39,361 --> 00:17:40,361
I'm Zhou Sihu.

277
00:17:40,618 --> 00:17:42,044
Da Hai, sit down.

278
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,135
Hasn't Da Hai really

279
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,294
gotten a new girlfriend at school?

280
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,403
No.

281
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,997
What did I say?

282
00:17:50,073 --> 00:17:51,286
No one could have loyalty

283
00:17:51,424 --> 00:17:53,270
that Da Hai to Jin Lu Lu.

284
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,903
You know Jin Lulu, right?

285
00:17:55,928 --> 00:17:57,317
Yeah, I've met her once.

286
00:17:57,595 --> 00:17:58,235
Let me tell you,

287
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,809
Da Hai is so good to Jin Lu Lu.

288
00:18:00,834 --> 00:18:02,411
You haven't seen them together.

289
00:18:02,622 --> 00:18:03,640
If you really saw them,

290
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,395
you definitely wouldn't recognize him.

291
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,200
Let me tell you,

292
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,080
don't think he's always cold.

293
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,067
When he sees Jin Lu Lu,

294
00:18:10,092 --> 00:18:12,497
he smiles so much that he leaves creases for days.

295
00:18:12,934 --> 00:18:14,528
Whenever we talk,

296
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,120
it's always about Jin Lu Lu.

297
00:18:16,653 --> 00:18:18,560
Our ears are going to fall off.

298
00:18:19,395 --> 00:18:20,684
Usually if we want something from him,

299
00:18:20,709 --> 00:18:22,419
we've got to find Jin Lulu first.

300
00:18:22,444 --> 00:18:23,800
As Jin Lulu asks him for help,

301
00:18:24,226 --> 00:18:26,692
Da Hai would never say no.

302
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,950
Isn't Gu Hai really just like that?

303
00:18:34,493 --> 00:18:35,253
What do you want to talk about?

304
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,360
Nothing.

305
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,059
Try this.

306
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,601
It's a little strong.

307
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,280
Strong?

308
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,109
I think it's pretty good.

309
00:19:00,266 --> 00:19:03,361
Doesn't Da Hai never drink out of someone else's drink?

310
00:19:03,401 --> 00:19:07,001
Did Gu Hai do it with you guys before?

311
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,760
Wait.

312
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:20,990
Get out.

313
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,600
Did you see that?

314
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,800
Da Hai hates people touching him.

315
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,876
If it's really what you said,

316
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,103
then what you'd see is our corpses.

317
00:19:37,603 --> 00:19:38,080
Come on.

318
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,360
Cheers.

319
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,228
Bottoms up!

320
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,200
Isn't it suffocating sleeping like this?

321
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,011
Let me loosen it up for you.

322
00:19:57,036 --> 00:19:57,876
Stay away from me.

323
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,057
Why are you doing this?

324
00:20:00,328 --> 00:20:01,248
If you're not sleeping, then get out

325
00:20:02,932 --> 00:20:04,658
I just don't think your blanket's warm enough.

326
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,307
What does it have to do with you whether it is warm or not?

327
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,908
I'll help you get warm.

328
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,932
Are you crazy?

329
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,705
You're like this every night.

330
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,213
Can't you just sleep?

331
00:20:15,426 --> 00:20:17,346
I'm telling you, I'm very sleepy today.

332
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:24,290
Yin Zi,

333
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,088
do you think it's normal

334
00:20:28,392 --> 00:20:29,438
What's not normal?

335
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,180
That's who I am.

336
00:20:31,274 --> 00:20:32,554
I like being close to my bros.

337
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,438
Did you see Li Shuo?

338
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,297
We are always close together like we are one person.

339
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,876
Every time I touch him

340
00:20:39,901 --> 00:20:41,203
he's always obedient

341
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,720
But when it come with you,

342
00:20:42,914 --> 00:20:44,196
how could it be so difficult?

343
00:20:44,297 --> 00:20:45,430
Come on.

344
00:20:45,752 --> 00:20:47,102
Today, Li Shuo already told me

345
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,015
that he never did that thing with you.

346
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:52,625
That... that's just because he's too ashamed to admit it.

347
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:55,679
He's as bashful as I am.

348
00:20:58,355 --> 00:21:01,008
Why did you ask him that?

349
00:21:02,976 --> 00:21:04,742
You don't really plan to do it with me, right?

350
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,200
Or you just wanted to ask him first so you can be more prepared.

351
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,758
How come A Lang is barking hard tonight?

352
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,920
I got go out and have a look.

353
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,840
A Lang, A Lang.

354
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,680
A Lang.

355
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,327
What's the matter? You're barking too much.

356
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,840
Come, give me a kiss.

357
00:21:32,722 --> 00:21:33,722
What?

358
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,960
After all this time, I'm no better than a dog?

359
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,150
# You carried me on your back, recollecting the past, #

360
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,980
# And stalling for time on your own. #

361
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:55,350
# I was smiling while listening to you. #

362
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:59,540
# But a tear-blurred vision faded in. #

363
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:06,520
# You held my hand that had been wavering, #

364
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:10,830
# Slowly moving forward... #

365
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:15,510
# Slowly moving forward with me... #

366
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:19,580
# Don't say I'd never understand. #

367
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,480
# Don't say I'd never feel the pain. #

368
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,590
# As the wind was blowing over, #

369
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:31,840
# It left some warmth on my lips. #

370
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,630
# Don't tell me you'll be here with me. #

371
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:39,760
# I didn't say it because I was stuck in silence. #

372
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:46,750
# You held my hands too tightly to hear what I was saying. #

373
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:50,590
# Don't say I'd never understand. #

374
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:54,460
# Don't say I'd never feel the pain. #

375
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:57,600
# As the wind was blowing over, #

376
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,500
# It left some warmth on my lips. #

377
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,560
# Don't tell me you'll be here with me. #

378
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,760
# I didn't say it because I was stuck in silence. #

379
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:18,670
# You held my hands too tightly to hear what I was saying: #

380
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,390
# Please, don't go... #
