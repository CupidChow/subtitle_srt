Bye.

00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:54,775
Sir.

Dahai.

20
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,280
I'll take Yinzi to my place.

21

It's getting late, just stay here.

22

I've already arranged the room for you.

This kid!

How could you joke with me?

26
00:02:06,853 --> 00:02:07,600
Let's go, Yinzi.

27
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,437
- Could he do this? - It's ok.

28
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,160
I'll carry him, bye.

Well, be careful.

32
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,135
See you, Sir.

33
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,925
- Well, I'll walk you to the door. - Okay.

34
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,443
Be careful on the way home.

- Sure. - Okay.

I...

40
00:02:49,091 --> 00:02:51,083
I wanna

41
00:02:51,764 --> 00:02:53,568
go to the rooftop.

42
00:02:53,593 --> 00:02:55,068
Go to rooftop?

43
00:02:58,158 --> 00:02:58,548
Okay.

44

# the one who had fed it? #

# I... #

51
00:03:42,123 --> 00:03:44,764
Don't cry, Yinzi.

52
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,080
Your father is still you father

53
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,560
regardless of how many times he's gotten married,

54
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,000
he loves you the most.

55
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,330
There will be no one

56
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,560
cooking such horrible meals for me.

57
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,200
Do you still want to eat the food he cooked?

58
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,720
There will be no one

59
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,920
throwing away my underwear into the gutter.

60
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:20,406
Yinzi.

61
00:04:22,921 --> 00:04:24,121
Then I'll cook for you,

62
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,600
and I'm sure what I cook would be worse than him.

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,320
I'll wash your clothes, too.

64
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,674
Let's buy a whole box of underwear

65
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,510
and throw one of them each time we do the laundry.

66
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,205
Yinzi,

67
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:47,853
I promise, besides your dad,

68
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,640
no one will ever love you more than I do.

69
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,803
I have to go out for a while.

70
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,720
What are you doing?

71
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,760
I'm picking up my brother, he has just come back from abroad.

72
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,639
Your brother? Your sibling?

73
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,631
Not sibling, he's my cousin.

74
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,405
He's been living abroad most of the time,

75
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,045
actually we don't have many chances to meet.

76
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,520
He's just back for business

77
00:05:31,656 --> 00:05:32,456
and take a time to meet me.

78
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,600
He'll just stay for a few days.

79
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,240
Then you better go now.

80
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,000
See you.

81
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,424
Bro.

82
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,560
Bro, this is Bai Luoyin.

83
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,480
This is my brother, Gu Yang.

84
00:06:21,158 --> 00:06:23,182
Miss, would you mind bring the dishes?

85
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,800
Have some.

86
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,440
What's up? Not to your taste?

87
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,040
No.

88
00:06:53,632 --> 00:06:54,432
Hai Luoyin.

89
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,410
Yes, blending our name together you'll get an addictive drug.

90
00:07:28,387 --> 00:07:29,187
Come on.

91
00:07:37,592 --> 00:07:38,697
Brother,

92
00:07:39,768 --> 00:07:41,721
I wanna propose a toast.

94
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,440
Do you want something to drink?

95
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,360
The TV is too small.

96
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,600
Replace it with a bigger one tomorrow.

97
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,189
The color of the carpet doesn't match the coffee table.

98
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,559
The wallpaper gives a sense of depression.

99
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,259
The fringe of the curtain is too conspicuous.

100
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,034
The decorative pattern of ceiling lamp

101
00:08:50,035 --> 00:08:51,280
looks too simple and ancient.

102
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,480
In the end, you just put such an enjoyable dining table.

103
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,520
What kind of designer

104
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,993
could possibly decorate

105
00:09:03,965 --> 00:09:05,064
the room inappropriate like that?

106
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,040
Yinzi, hand me a night gown.

107
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,462
Come out with your bath towel on.

108
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,160
Bro? How... Why are you here!

109
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,564
I'm coming here to see you.

110
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,314
You don't hide even from him,

111
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,480
why are you hiding from me?

112
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,001
How can the decent gentleman like you

113
00:09:26,548 --> 00:09:28,353
possibly stand for my vulgar behavior?

114
00:09:28,915 --> 00:09:30,134
Watch yourself next time.

115
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,969
Why didn't you tell me that my bro is here?

116
00:09:35,994 --> 00:09:37,398
You are such a bad boy.

117
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,305
I'll give you a lesson after his leaving.

118
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,920
He won't left so soon.

119
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,295
How do you know?

120
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,375
Just wait and see.

121
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,322
Bro,

122
00:10:36,794 --> 00:10:37,911
why are you not leaving yet?

123
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,996
Why do you want me to leave?

124
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,080
Am I bothering you two?

125
00:10:44,884 --> 00:10:47,941
You can do whatever you want.

126
00:10:50,652 --> 00:10:51,785
It's time for us to go to bed.

127
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,707
Do you guys go to bed so early?

128
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,895
Don't your young people

129
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,640
often stay up late?

130
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:00,358
It is only over 8 pm now,

131
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,850
and the old man and the old lady could be still energetic now.

132
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,725
Don't say "your young people".

133
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,960
You're two years older than me.

134
00:11:07,051 --> 00:11:08,655
Now that you're going to have a rest,

135
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,000
I won't bother you anymore.

136
00:11:10,387 --> 00:11:12,667
Putting on more blankets. Don't freeze yourself.

137
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,124
Sure.

138
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,108
Bro, take care.

139
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,223
You little brat, get out now!

140
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,557
We're not done yet!

141
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,770
Window is still open, you can get in if you can.

142
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:40,043
Fine! Just wait for me.

143
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,848
Did he really go downstairs?

144
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,320
Did you really go out?

145
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,530
Would he ambush at the door?

146
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,884
Come here, you want to run away again?

147
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,830
Damn!

148
00:12:59,855 --> 00:13:02,135
Let me tell you, you can't cry out any grandpa for help now.

149
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,564
Gu Hai, let me down.

150
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,525
I told you that no one can help you today.

151
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,306
Put me down, Gu Hai.

152
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,345
Call me husband.

153
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,490
Call me husband and I'll let you down.

154
00:13:09,515 --> 00:13:10,556
Let me down!

155
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,335
Call husband or not?

156
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,681
You put me down.

157
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,931
Call husband or not?

158
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,989
If I had known this, I wouldn't come with you.

159
00:13:15,014 --> 00:13:16,400
Do you want me to climb the stair?

160
00:13:16,483 --> 00:13:16,947
Gu Hai.

161
00:13:16,972 --> 00:13:18,642
Do you want me to climb the stair?

162
00:13:19,392 --> 00:13:20,901
Do you find it exciting?

163
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:22,198
Call husband or not?

164
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,135
No, no way.

165
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,315
Call husband or not?

166
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,690
Would you tell me

167
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,040
how did you get the scar on your waist?

168
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,343
The one on the waist?

169
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,840
I was cut down by my brother when I was a kid.

170
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:41,840
Gu Yang?

00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,440
Right.

172
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,360
Why did he cut you?

173
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,280
When we were kids, we compete for a slice of watermelon,

174
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,538
he couldn't win me,

175
00:13:50,904 --> 00:13:53,092
and then he gave me a cut with the fruit knife.

176
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,943
So do you think

177
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,080
it is his obligation to give you money

178
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,960
and treat you well?

179
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,920
I didn't force him, he did of his own free will.

180
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,960
But I have to say fair words

181
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,960
your brother is more handsome than you.

182
00:14:12,807 --> 00:14:14,451
"Man should lose with grace"

183
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,200
When we were little,

184
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,440
we went out to fly a kite together.

185
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,920
But the kite string was broken,

186
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,480
and we chased for the fallen kite.

187
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,520
I was crying while chasing

188
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,720
and my bro was laughing while chasing.

189
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,832
What do you mean by that?

190
00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:37,574
Can't you see it from this little thing?

191
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,400
My nature is good.

192
00:14:42,191 --> 00:14:43,665
My brother is evil.

193
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,320
But I'm just curious

194
00:14:48,996 --> 00:14:50,168
that kite had fallen,

195
00:14:50,193 --> 00:14:51,633
you could just chase and take it back,

196
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,760
why did you cry?

197
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,493
Aren't you stupid?

198
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,439
Forget it! Sleep.

199
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,287
Bro,

200
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:20,432
when will you leave?

201
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,240
I'm not sure yet.

202
00:15:24,535 --> 00:15:25,537
Before returning home,

203
00:15:25,562 --> 00:15:27,760
I had planned to deal with this matter in six or seven days.

204
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,960
But the speed of our people made me so...

205
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,520
I'm afraid it'll take another week.

206
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,560
You should leave

207
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,760
as soon as you finish your business.

208
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,320
What do you want me leave?

209
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,311
I remember you were the one

210
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,120
who called me to come back the last few times.

211
00:15:51,072 --> 00:15:52,288
But this time, why do I feel like

212
00:15:52,328 --> 00:15:54,095
you are being dislike towards me?

213
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:56,840
Actually I...

214
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,200
I think you're tired of jet lag all day.

215
00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:02,307
Hai,

216
00:16:03,752 --> 00:16:05,260
this time I come back here,

217
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,160
I feel that you have changed a lot

218
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,720
and you've even known how to care for other.

219
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,360
Please don't talk with sarcastic tone, okay?

220
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600
What about your little brother?

221
00:16:17,792 --> 00:16:18,712
Why are you asking about him?

222
00:16:23,517 --> 00:16:24,690
Just curious.

223
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,313
What would you like to have?

224
00:16:34,033 --> 00:16:35,473
How about two packs of rice crust?

225
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,720
What kind of flavor would you like?

226
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,568
Chicken flavor.

227
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,440
Okay.

228
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,217
Hello, could you get me

229
00:16:45,218 --> 00:16:47,252
two packs of "pot meat flavored chicken cock"?

230
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,503
Come on, get me two packs of "pot meat flavored cock".

231
00:16:54,049 --> 00:16:55,449
We really don't have such thing here.

232
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,079
Keep the change.

233
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,686
Is that really so funny?

234
00:17:18,865 --> 00:17:20,960
Gu Hai, that was a retribution

235
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,905
for you not taking things seriously all the time.

236
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,670
Now you're slipping of your tongue!

237
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,225
I'm going to eat, I just want to eat it, what, is there a problem?

238
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,160
Tonight, I'll eat yours.

239
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,160
It's not over, is it? You're still laughing!

240
00:17:38,185 --> 00:17:39,465
"Pot meat flavored cock" !

241
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,080
Did you forget to lock the door?

242
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,160
You two got back home!

243
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,542
Why are you here?

244
00:17:56,921 --> 00:17:58,136
Your father asked me to come and have a look.

245
00:17:58,161 --> 00:17:59,776
He's worried about you guys living here.

246
00:18:00,894 --> 00:18:01,800
Where did you get the key?

247
00:18:01,964 --> 00:18:03,120
Your father gave it to me.

248
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,895
He had made two sets of keys for this apartment.

249
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,640
One for you

250
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,870
and other was kept by him,

251
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,292
just in case

252
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,933
when you need somethings,

253
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,917
we could come and see you guys.

254
00:18:10,947 --> 00:18:12,036
Even if you want to come here,

255
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,240
you should let us know first.

256
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,520
I don't have your phone number,

257
00:18:16,564 --> 00:18:18,177
so I couldn't contact you.

258
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,570
I didn't move anything in this house,

259
00:18:20,595 --> 00:18:22,903
I just did some cleaning and organizing.

260
00:18:28,098 --> 00:18:29,058
Luoyin, come here.

261
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,160
Luoyin, sit on the couch.

262
00:18:35,735 --> 00:18:36,496
Luoyin,

263
00:18:37,692 --> 00:18:39,304
I heard your dad and that woman got married.

264
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,160
So what?

265
00:18:40,803 --> 00:18:42,481
What do you think?

266
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,278
The woman had a child of her own.

267
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,520
Do you think she would get a place for you in her heart?

268
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,731
Look, you father just got married,

269
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,800
they had kicked you out.

270
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,200
I was willing to come here.

271
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,160
Would you stop slandering my dad

272
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:52,960
every time you see me?

273
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:53,960
All right, all right.

274
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,239
Could you improve yourself

275
00:18:55,264 --> 00:18:56,144
by putting him down?

276
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,040
I just feel sorry for you.

277
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:00,640
You're so young

278
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,400
and you need to be loved and cared,

279
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,960
they can't just let you be free.

280
00:19:05,067 --> 00:19:06,760
I had my own difficulties in the past

281
00:19:06,761 --> 00:19:08,320
and couldn't take good care of you.

282
00:19:08,887 --> 00:19:11,040
Now I have the opportunity and the ability,

283
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,125
so you got to come back to me.

284
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,280
Let me make up for it, okay?

285
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:14,960
It's too late.

286
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,178
Yinzi,

287
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,224
do you want to take a bath together?

288
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,600
Here we are.

289
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,247
Look at you boys,

290
00:19:25,272 --> 00:19:26,600
how could you be so close?

291
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,120
I'm so happy to see this

292
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,760
and I feel so relieved now.

293
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,357
What take you two so long?

294
00:19:45,654 --> 00:19:48,120
Shouldn't we take more hot baths during winter?

295
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:48,920
That's true.

296
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,640
Come on, come on.

297
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,680
You two just sit down.

298
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,680
I just peeled an apple

299
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,833
and how about having some fruit?

300
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,800
Forget it. I'm going back to my bedroom to do my homework.

301
00:19:57,013 --> 00:19:58,599
You just sit down.

302
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,080
Come on.

303
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,560
It's not necessary to do your homework.

304
00:20:02,857 --> 00:20:04,716
it is just for dealing with the exam-oriented education.

305
00:20:04,856 --> 00:20:06,550
Now, you should let your brain

306
00:20:06,575 --> 00:20:08,280
get relax and have a good rest.

307
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,000
And you really don't need to

308
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,440
do those totally-skill-lacking homework.

309
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,200
Just think about it, even if they get into a famous university

310
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,505
and learn for four years,

311
00:20:16,124 --> 00:20:18,317
but those come from the bottom are still at the bottom.

312
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,015
Son, your hair is too wet.

313
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,600
I'll blow it dry for you.

314
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,135
No, I can dry it myself.

315
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,200
How can we do that?

316
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,280
If you don't get it dry, you will get headache in the morning.

317
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,830
I have been like this for more than a decade

318
00:20:27,831 --> 00:20:28,640
and I never got a headache.

319
00:20:31,747 --> 00:20:33,387
Yeah, it's been ten years.

320
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,160
You are such a big boy.

321
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,557
You've got many bad habits that have formed.

322
00:20:38,642 --> 00:20:40,713
It's hard to change now even if you want to.

323
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,432
All right, I'll do it for him.

324
00:20:45,872 --> 00:20:47,196
I've never blown dry. I'm not used to it.

325
00:20:47,221 --> 00:20:48,455
Come on, just get you hair dry

326
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,240
and then and we can go to bed.

327
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,485
Your dad suggested you two to study abroad for two years.

328
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,325
Foreign education is not at the same level as here.

329
00:20:57,684 --> 00:20:59,160
I've been enjoying my life now.

330
00:20:59,434 --> 00:21:01,055
For me, going to a regular high school

331
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,918
is an essential part of life experience.

332
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,960
It's the same to go to the high school abroad.

333
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,440
You could make new friends

334
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,640
and could also get many interesting and wonderful life experiences.

335
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,320
Moreover, it will be more valuable and meaningful than here.

336
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,360
All right, my hair's dry.

337
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,920
Don't waste your time on me anymore.

338
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,320
I don't have the good habit of letting parents make decide for me.

339
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,887
Luoyin.

340
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,175
Our brains

341
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,800
need full relaxation and rest.

342
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,040
So, could you please just leave?

343
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,800
Well, then you have a good rest.

344
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,000
I'm leaving.

345
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,560
It's really annoying.

346
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,800
How could she have the key to here?

347
00:21:55,853 --> 00:21:58,632
If she come here everyday, how can we live our lives?

348
00:21:58,872 --> 00:22:00,241
We must change the lock quickly.

349
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,750
# You carried me on your back, recollecting the past, #

350
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,580
# And stalling for time on your own. #

351
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:12,950
# I was smiling while listening to you. #

352
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:17,140
# But a tear-blurred vision faded in. #

353
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:24,120
# You held my hand that had been wavering, #

354
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:28,430
# Slowly moving forward... #

355
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:33,110
# Slowly moving forward with me... #

356
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:37,180
# Don't say I'd never understand. #

357
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,080
# Don't say I'd never feel the pain. #

358
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,190
# As the wind was blowing over, #

359
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:49,440
# It left some warmth on my lips. #

360
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,230
# Don't tell me you'll be here with me. #

361
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:57,360
# I didn't say it because I was stuck in silence. #

362
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:04,350
# You held my hands too tightly to hear what I was saying. #

363
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:08,190
# Don't say I'd never understand. #

364
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:12,060
# Don't say I'd never feel the pain. #

365
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:15,200
# As the wind was blowing over, #

366
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,100
# It left some warmth on my lips. #

367
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,160
# Don't tell me you'll be here with me. #

368
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,360
# I didn't say it because I was stuck in silence. #

369
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:36,270
# You held my hands too tightly to hear what I was saying: #

370
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,990
# Please, don't go... #
