I'll show you how to do it.

17
00:01:54,754 --> 00:01:55,777
Put your jaw above the bar,

18
00:01:55,801 --> 00:01:57,863
keep your legs together and your body straight,

19

Now, the first one.

20

00:02:23,665 --> 00:02:24,783
Fatty!

You, come on.

24
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:33,472
Higher!

25
00:02:39,398 --> 00:02:40,171
Anyone else?

26
00:02:40,898 --> 00:02:41,554
Come on.

27
00:02:42,077 --> 00:02:46,100

Gosh! It's too funny.

00:02:58,248 --> 00:03:00,115
Yeah, he can't do it at all.

32
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:02,106
You are only good at flirting.

33
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,920
Though practicing for 15 days, you failed.  Button your shirt.

34
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:09,607
You won't be better.

00:03:19,673 --> 00:03:21,673
One, two...

38
00:03:29,597 --> 00:03:32,737
...twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty.

39
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,979
Luoyin!

40
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:37,773
Not bad.

41
00:03:40,297 --> 00:03:44,203
But you guys' total number of pull-ups is still below 60,

42
00:03:44,781 --> 00:03:45,741
Anyone else?

43
00:03:47,765 --> 00:03:48,366
You.

44
00:03:49,093 --> 00:03:50,796
You're a tough guy. Do it.

45
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:55,630
Sir, Gu Hai has just finished 100 push-ups. He's exhausted now.

46
00:03:55,654 --> 00:03:57,872
It would be fair to let him do it next time.

47
00:04:00,096 --> 00:04:02,017
Okay? Will you do it next time?

48
00:04:03,838 --> 00:04:06,314
You do it first, sir.

49
00:04:07,087 --> 00:04:09,493
Then, I'll do more than all you guys did.

50
00:04:10,594 --> 00:04:14,422
Do it together! Do it together...

51
00:04:14,446 --> 00:04:15,891
Let's do it together.

52
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:21,950
Hold my jacket.

53
00:04:27,621 --> 00:04:33,454
Up! Up! Up...

54
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:34,502
Give it to me.

55
00:04:34,526 --> 00:04:38,080
Up! Up! Up...

56
00:04:39,276 --> 00:04:44,510
- Up! Up... - Up, Gu Hai! Up, Gu Hai...

57
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,534
- Up! Up... - Up, Gu Hai! Up, Gu Hai...

58
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,645
Dude, try to pull up for hundreds of times.

59
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:57,098
I need your durability.

60
00:04:57,942 --> 00:05:00,667
- Up, sir! - You're exhausted, sir.

61
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,112
Gu Hai has pulled up 100 times.

62
00:05:22,636 --> 00:05:26,893
Up! Up! Up...

63
00:06:38,818 --> 00:06:40,075
What's the problem with you?

64
00:06:54,299 --> 00:06:55,978
Class begins now, everyone.

65
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:02,103
Young man, you can't sit here without putting on your jacket.

66
00:07:02,337 --> 00:07:05,618
Sir, something's wrong with my jacket. I can fix it quickly.

67
00:07:05,642 --> 00:07:06,532
Fix it, now.

68
00:07:09,335 --> 00:07:10,678
Bastard!

69
00:07:13,061 --> 00:07:13,873
Dammit!

70
00:07:15,748 --> 00:07:19,576
Young man, you have to go out if you can't put on your jacket.

71
00:07:19,787 --> 00:07:22,365
I don't care what other guys will think of it,

72
00:07:22,505 --> 00:07:24,058
but it's not allowed in my class.

73
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:26,153
You are interfering with my lecture.

74
00:07:27,145 --> 00:07:28,785
How many stitches did you sew?

75
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:32,574
Same as your number of pull-ups.

76
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:48,793
Dad.

77
00:07:49,847 --> 00:07:52,097
You haven't cooked, have you?

78
00:07:56,781 --> 00:08:00,757
Absolutely not. They were sent here by Mrs Zou.

79
00:08:03,812 --> 00:08:07,577
Dad, you have every breakfast at her house.

80
00:08:07,929 --> 00:08:09,600
Now dinner included?

81
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:14,786
What if you marry her? So your breakfast will be free.

82
00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:16,059
Cut your crap.

83
00:08:16,513 --> 00:08:18,137
She has a husband.

84
00:08:19,716 --> 00:08:24,262
She has a husband who is away from home all year round.

85
00:08:24,286 --> 00:08:26,504
He is away from home to make big money.

86
00:08:26,825 --> 00:08:31,246
You know, it's impossible they only own a small breakfast-stand.

87
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:32,567
Big money?

88
00:08:32,777 --> 00:08:34,706
So why is his wife's life so tough?

89
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:42,324
Hello.

90
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:44,980
Talk to Luoyin?

91
00:08:47,404 --> 00:08:49,833
Yinzi, it's a girl.

92

Hello.

93

Hi.

94
00:09:08,817 --> 00:09:11,152
I'll come to you if you hang up.

95
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,581
I'm serious.

96
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,180
What's up?

97
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,492
Why do you never read the letter I wrote you?

98
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:25,289
Why do you never answer the text I send you?

99
00:09:25,671 --> 00:09:29,631
I am alone in a foreign country. I need you.

100
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:32,928
Why are you so cold-blooded?

101
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:38,224
- How do you know I didn't read your letter? - Of course I know.

102
00:09:40,145 --> 00:09:41,348
Then you should know,

103
00:09:42,488 --> 00:09:43,816
I'm a man of decision.

104
00:09:44,378 --> 00:09:47,378
- We've broken up! - Read my mails.

105
00:09:47,596 --> 00:09:49,760
Read every one of them. Or...

106
00:09:50,244 --> 00:09:52,470
I'll ring up your dad's phone everyday.

107
00:09:52,603 --> 00:09:53,993
No, Shi Hui.

108
00:09:54,204 --> 00:09:56,391
I never thought you're so unreasonable.

109
00:09:57,102 --> 00:09:58,945
Because you've  pushed me too far.

110
00:09:59,672 --> 00:10:00,273

00:10:21,565 --> 00:10:23,041
I woke up at 3:00 a.m.

114
00:10:23,377 --> 00:10:25,814
- When did you go to bed? - 2:50 a.m.

115
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,930
So you had a sleepless night.

116
00:10:39,049 --> 00:10:41,509
Sorry. Something was dropped.

117
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,215
Listen,

118
00:10:51,668 --> 00:10:55,105
- I'm in a bad mood today. Leave me alone. - Bad mood?

119
00:10:57,293 --> 00:10:59,824
- Sorrow follows joy? - Don't you understand Chinese?

120
00:11:01,097 --> 00:11:02,362
No, I don't.

121
00:11:10,886 --> 00:11:12,464
Class begins now.

122
00:11:13,284 --> 00:11:16,221
We'll recite the new words of Unit 3 in the morning.

123
00:11:16,245 --> 00:11:17,604
First, turn to page 8.

124
00:11:20,728 --> 00:11:23,415

125

"Which"...

126
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,642
You'd better patch it if you won't throw it.

127
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:27,408
"Who"...

128
00:11:27,876 --> 00:11:30,180
Was all your yarn used up to sew my jacket?

129
00:11:31,469 --> 00:11:33,078
Cut your crap, will you?

130
00:11:33,187 --> 00:11:35,444
- "Brother"... - "Brother".

131
00:11:35,765 --> 00:11:37,124
Okay, I'll leave you alone.

132
00:11:37,148 --> 00:11:38,351
"Father"...

133
00:11:38,718 --> 00:11:40,772
- "Sister"... - "Sister".

134
00:11:41,264 --> 00:11:43,318
- "Mother"... - "Mother".

135
00:11:43,342 --> 00:11:44,998
- "Room"... - "Room".

136
00:11:52,258 --> 00:11:53,867
Are you damn crazy?

137
00:12:01,891 --> 00:12:03,633
Sorry, madam. I thought...

138
00:12:07,557 --> 00:12:08,533
Come out with me.

139
00:12:31,057 --> 00:12:32,463
Hey, you're back.

140
00:12:33,892 --> 00:12:36,962
I told you I would leave you alone.

141
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,696
Why did you yell?

142
00:12:40,109 --> 00:12:41,648
Are you stupid?

143
00:12:45,572 --> 00:12:46,900
I'm asking you.

144
00:12:48,189 --> 00:12:49,048
You Qi.

145
00:12:49,876 --> 00:12:52,384
- Let's switch our seats, okay? - Why?

146
00:12:52,408 --> 00:12:54,134
Don't ask. Just do me a favor.

147
00:13:24,558 --> 00:13:27,425
Not me. He pushed me.

= Convenient and Excellent Lub =

149
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,331
Look at this cuboid.

150
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:55,956
With the two intersecting lines...

151
00:13:56,682 --> 00:13:58,524
...inside the plane A B C D,

152
00:13:59,501 --> 00:14:01,282
- Childish. - The A' and B'...

153
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:04,196
...and the A' B' plane...

154
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,875
- ...are respectively... - Sir.

155
00:14:07,554 --> 00:14:10,491
- I'm gonna wash my arm. - Come back ASAP.

156
00:14:11,788 --> 00:14:18,748
AC and BD are parallel to A'B'C'D'.

157
00:14:20,022 --> 00:14:24,582
A'B' and C'D' are parallel.

158
00:14:25,373 --> 00:14:28,544
So the ABCD of the plane...

159
00:14:28,927 --> 00:14:33,927
...is parallel to the A'B'C'D of the plane.

160
00:14:34,762 --> 00:14:36,908
- The ABCD of the plane... - Open the door for me.

161
00:14:36,933 --> 00:14:42,394
...is parallel to the A'C'B'D' of the plane.

162
00:14:43,448 --> 00:14:46,877
According to the decision theorem of "Line Parallel to Plane",

163
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:51,376
We know that both the two intersecting lines, AC and BD,

164
00:14:51,923 --> 00:14:58,173
...are parallel to the plane A'B'C'D'.

165
00:14:59,025 --> 00:15:00,274
- Then... - Bai Luoyin,

166
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,900
do you think I'd be blocked by the doors tampered with by you?

167
00:15:03,275 --> 00:15:05,548
...AC and BD...

168
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,486
- Hello. - ...are respectively...

169
00:15:08,048 --> 00:15:12,899
...parallel to the two intersecting lines A'B' and C'D',

170
00:15:13,392 --> 00:15:16,899
which are inside the plane A'B'C'D'.

171
00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:53,313
Dammit!

172
00:15:58,798 --> 00:16:00,352
...parallel to the two planes.

173
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,575
Someone just told me the teacher had fainted.

174
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,130
Why can't I open the door?

175
00:16:09,465 --> 00:16:10,308
Open it now!

176
00:16:12,613 --> 00:16:14,652
I can't open it either, Director.

177
00:16:14,816 --> 00:16:16,417
- Open it quickly. - Let me try.

178
00:16:16,823 --> 00:16:19,994
= Bai Luoyin's patent =

179
00:16:32,378 --> 00:16:33,518
Bai Luoyin?

180
00:16:34,518 --> 00:16:35,635
Come to my office.

181
00:16:36,838 --> 00:16:39,595
To put it mildly, you've vandalized public property.

182
00:16:39,674 --> 00:16:43,369
To put it sternly, you have a big problem on your morality.

183
00:16:43,556 --> 00:16:45,274
We can't dial a false distress call.

184
00:16:45,454 --> 00:16:48,782
We can't change any door lock as we wish.

185
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,430
You're not a child any more. Why did you do something so stupid?

186
00:16:56,252 --> 00:16:58,587
You have to compensate for the locks you damaged.

187
00:16:59,134 --> 00:17:01,243
Give me 100 yuan tomorrow.

188
00:17:01,267 --> 00:17:03,977
Why? Both the locks are not damaged.

189
00:17:04,048 --> 00:17:06,751
- I can fix them now. - You've tampered with them.

190
00:17:06,946 --> 00:17:09,149
You have to pay for it. It's the rule.

191
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,140
My family is poor.

192
00:17:11,507 --> 00:17:13,467
- I have no money. - So why did you do it...

193
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,241
...and touted it's your patent?

194
00:17:16,241 --> 00:17:19,514
If you have no money, tell me your dad's phone number.

195
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,264
He will give me.

196
00:17:21,857 --> 00:17:25,474
- It's more difficult to ask him for money. - Cut your crap.

197
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:26,676
The number!

198
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:32,238
186-8888-2901

199
00:17:38,456 --> 00:17:41,456
I'm the Guidance Director of your son's school.

200
00:17:41,846 --> 00:17:44,900
Your son vandalized two door locks in school.

201
00:17:45,072 --> 00:17:46,228
I wanted him to pay for it,

202
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,805
but he said: "My family is poor."

203
00:17:49,275 --> 00:17:53,798
Now I want to know how poor your family really is,

204
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,938
so that he could be exempted.

205
00:17:56,133 --> 00:17:56,711
Listen,

206
00:17:57,436 --> 00:18:00,443
My door lock has been broken for five years and it's still there.

207
00:18:00,717 --> 00:18:03,107
Moreover, no thief visits my house during the five years.

208
00:18:03,388 --> 00:18:05,536
Now you know how poor we are.

209
00:18:11,802 --> 00:18:14,028
Get out! Get out!

210
00:18:24,545 --> 00:18:27,201
It's raining hard. Don't take a taxi.

211
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:28,622
Okay.

212
00:18:46,102 --> 00:18:48,937
Hai, the General said today is his wife's birthday.

213
00:18:49,391 --> 00:18:51,141
He wants you to go home for the dinner.

214
00:18:52,305 --> 00:18:53,367
Go back to my place.

215
00:18:53,992 --> 00:18:56,093
- Hai... - I said "go back to..."

216
00:19:06,917 --> 00:19:08,706
- Follow him. - Hai...

217
00:19:09,112 --> 00:19:10,730
Why don't we give him a ride?

218
00:19:20,132 --> 00:19:22,460
- Take them inside! - Mrs Zou, dad.

219
00:19:22,647 --> 00:19:24,803
- Here you are. You're wet. - Give me a hand.

220
00:19:27,498 --> 00:19:28,794
- Let's go. - Go.

221
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:30,105
= Breakfast =

222
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:31,622
Wait, wait...
= Breakfast =

223
00:19:31,646 --> 00:19:32,942
= Breakfast =

224
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:42,378
- Hai, shall we go to help them? - No.

225
00:19:43,073 --> 00:19:44,268
Go to my place now.

226
00:20:06,684 --> 00:20:10,082
= These are for you. =

227
00:20:23,354 --> 00:20:24,729
= Portuguese egg tarts =

228
00:20:57,971 --> 00:20:58,924
The rest is for you.

229
00:21:01,181 --> 00:21:02,735
How do you know I've eaten nothing?

230
00:21:02,977 --> 00:21:03,937
Wait!

231
00:21:07,406 --> 00:21:08,898
Do you regret it so soon?

232
00:21:09,406 --> 00:21:11,523
- You didn't buy them, did you? - What?

233
00:21:13,046 --> 00:21:15,514
Throw them away if you don't want to eat,

234
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:18,256
but never give them away as a gift.

235
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,529
You bought them.

236
00:21:28,108 --> 00:21:29,412
Why didn't you say it earlier

237
00:21:29,717 --> 00:21:32,756
If I knew it, I would rather starve than eat them.

238
00:21:36,648 --> 00:21:39,093
- But you ate them. - You put them on my desk.

239
00:21:40,421 --> 00:21:43,280
If you feel sorry about it, you can pay me.

240
00:21:43,975 --> 00:21:46,990
They cost 32 yuan. It's okay to just give me 30.

241
00:21:48,115 --> 00:21:49,740
Does your family run a breakfast-stand?

242
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:53,005
Is this your bad idea to improve its business?

243
00:21:53,294 --> 00:21:56,294
Yes, my family does run a breakfast-stand...

244
00:21:56,973 --> 00:21:58,582
...to cheat the fools as you.

245
00:22:08,316 --> 00:22:11,667
# You carried me on your back, recollecting the past, #

246
00:22:12,261 --> 00:22:15,471
# And stalling for time on your own. #

247
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:19,549
# I was smiling while listening to you. #

248
00:22:19,985 --> 00:22:23,750
# But a tear-blurred vision faded in. #

249
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:27,101
# You held my hand... #

250
00:22:28,358 --> 00:22:31,139
# ...that had been wavering, #

251
00:22:31,576 --> 00:22:35,208
# Slowly moving forward... #

252
00:22:35,435 --> 00:22:39,575
# Slowly moving forward with me... #

253
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:43,949
# Don't say I'd never understand. #

254
00:22:43,974 --> 00:22:47,895
# Don't say I'd never feel the pain. #

255
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,395
# As the wind was blowing over, #

256
00:22:50,996 --> 00:22:55,777
# It left some warmth on my lips. #

257
00:22:56,526 --> 00:23:00,213
# Don't tell me you'll be here with me. #

258
00:23:00,237 --> 00:23:04,266
# I didn't say it because I was stuck in silence. #

259
00:23:04,501 --> 00:23:08,086
# You held my hands too tightly... #

260
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,086
# ...to hear what I was saying. #

261
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:14,985
# Don't say I'd never feel the pain. #

262
00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:18,837
# Don't say I'd never feel the pain. #

263
00:23:18,861 --> 00:23:21,540
# As the wind was blowing over, #

264
00:23:21,907 --> 00:23:26,860
# It left some warmth on my lips. #

265
00:23:27,524 --> 00:23:31,172
# Don't tell me you'll be here with me. #

266
00:23:31,196 --> 00:23:35,164
# I didn't say it because I was stuck in silence. #

267
00:23:35,492 --> 00:23:39,179
# You held my hands too tightly... #

268
00:23:39,406 --> 00:23:43,031
# ...to hear what I was saying: #

269
00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:44,601
# Please, don't go... #
