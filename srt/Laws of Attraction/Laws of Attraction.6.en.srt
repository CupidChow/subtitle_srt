00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,990
Doll?

3
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,330
What doll?

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,640
I gave it to Ploy as a souvenir

5
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,230
when she came to say goodbye to me.

6
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:10,980
I've got Tonkhao's doll.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,460
If we give this doll

8
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:13,690
to the senior official I know,

9
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,010
everything will be over.

11
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,030
Are you disappointed, Vit?

12
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:22,490
It means that the evidence

13
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,500
and the doll...
I really found them,

14
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,010
or not?

15
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,210
Nam got the news

16
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,800
that Ploy had moved to Phetchabun Province.

17
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,410
Do you know the details?

18
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,890
In which area of Phetchabun Province?

19
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,050
Ban Dong Pan Village.

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,540
You said

21
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,210
you would never go there again.

22
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,760
It's good that I can go back.

23
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,050
So I can know

24
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,270
if I have the courage to face my past.

25
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:55,450
I hope this time you can get the evidence

26
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,070
to prove that Senator Thatthep is guilty.

You...

00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,280
Are you tired?

31
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,550
You've been driving for three hours.

32
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,440
How about I drive for some time?

33
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,780
It's okay.

34
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,400
How is it? Is your trip sweet?

35
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,810
The trip is terrifying.

36
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,240
It's all your fault.

37
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:38,530
Are you sure you can go there without us?

38
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,010
Did you change your mind?

39
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,290
I'm ready.

40
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,750
Good for you.

41
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,090
In fact, not all the memories about that place are bad,

42
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,470
right, Charn?

43
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,680
Am I right?

44
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,260
You might see your ex-boyfriend there.

45
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,490
What ex-boyfriend?

46
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,780
We've never been together.

47
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,950
Really?

48
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,340
He was your boyfriend for almost a year.

49
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,680
You were together for so long.

50
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,829
Everyone knew

51
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,300
how crazy he was about you.

52
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,760
I also remember

53
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,690
you liked him too.

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,670
You also told me

55
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,340
that was the best night of your life.

56
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,690
A crazy night.

57
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,630
-Stop.
-If you two meet again,

58
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,390
you will probably fall in love with each other again.

59

That's a sure thing.

60
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,579
You will have the second crazy night.

61
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,810
When did he come?

62
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,230
When you mentioned the first crazy night.

63
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,680
Let's listen to some music.

00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,720

♫Are waiting for the day to be in love again♫

66
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,920
♫The one who shows up late♫

67
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,680
♫Has to hide his feelings♫

You...

74
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,550
Are you okay?

75
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,750
I'm fine.

76
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,970
What's going on with you?

77
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,690
You've been quiet since we came here.

78
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,200
I'm fine.

79
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,960
Are you sure?

80
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,030
You're not mad with me now?

81
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,090
Why should I be mad?

82
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,640
For what happened this morning.

83
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:39,730
You got jealous.

84
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,960
Do I have the right to be jealous and angry because of you?

85
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,340
Do you want the right?

86
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:47,850
You can be jealous for me.

87
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,920
You can also be angry with me.

88
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,030
I'll comfort you.

89
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,050
I saw

90
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,230
a luxurious country hotel over there.

91
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,430
Why don't we live there?

92
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,440
Forget about that.

93
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,380
There are casinos,

94
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,660
wine and drugs in that place.

95
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,110
Almost all of them are illegal.

96
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,930
Almost?

97
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,400
But what you said

98
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,620
is totally illegal.

99
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,780
Some powerful men

100
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,940
have made their business legal.

101
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:28,720
I thought this place was

102
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,850
an ecological tourist attraction.

103
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,140
Where there are people,

104
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:39,960
there will be dirty business.

105
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,550
Young Master, pack your things.

106
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:12,840
What's wrong, Thee?

107
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,500
You don't want to stay here.

108
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,190
So let's leave and have fun somewhere else.

109
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,320
But my dad won't allow...

110
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,620
Forget about that.

111
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,460
We'll come back after the trip.

112
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,640
Okay?

113
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:26,900
Let's go.

114
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,370
That way, Young Master.

115
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:42,940
Young Master, be careful.

116
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,150
Thee, where are you and Young Master going?

117
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,130
Young Master, this way.

118
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,940
Let go of me!

119
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:00,960
Let go of me!

120
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,470
Let me go!

121
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,850
Young Master.

122
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:10,740
Let's go.

123
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:12,820
Let's go.

124
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,520
Those people are so stupid.

125
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,160
And you

126
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,160
must be crazy to take me out of there.

127
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,450
I think so.

128
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,390
I must be crazy.

129
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,400
Just the two of us.

130
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,440
Have some water, Young Master.

131
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,730
Thank you, Thee.

132
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,730
Take the food.

133
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,280
Take the food.

134
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,290
-Thank you. 
-Take the food.

135
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:13,920
Oh.

136
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,000
This is the last one.

137
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,760
Have a nice meal.

138
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,810
Thank you.

139
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,100
What's your name?

140
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,250
Methee.

141
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,450
Methee.

142
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,060
When you grow up, don't be a corrupt man.

143
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,490
Okay, thank you.

144
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,520
Thank you.

145
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,130
-Enjoy the food.
-Thank you.

146
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,610
Oh.

147
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,800
All the food has been given. It's okay.

148
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,930
Here. Go buy some food.

149

-Give it to me.
-Give me the food.

152

-Give it to me.
-Give me the food.

153
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,910
Give it to me.

154
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,370
Give it to me.

155

00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,150
It's okay.

377
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,130
It can record sounds,

378
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,600
but it's broken.

379
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:19,280
Well...

380
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,130
We will have it fixed.

381
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,490
Okay?

382
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,520
[The garden full love and peace]

383
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,330
-Hurry.
-We're late.

384
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,810
-Hurry up.
-Come on.

385
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:40,920
We're going to be late.

386
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,880
-Take this.
-Take this with you.

387
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,530
-Bye, Great Grandma.
-Bye, Uncle.

388
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:46,000
-Bye.
-Bye.

389
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,780
Bye.

390
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,220
I'll make you nice dishes

391
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,540
this evening.

392
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:52,530
-Bye.
-Don't be late

393
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,850
Charn.

394
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,640
Thank you.

395
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,510
For what?

396
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,350
Everything.

397
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,900
Without you, I wouldn't get the evidence now.

398
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,730
You know what?

399
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,160
I used to think

400
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,390
I was so unlucky

401
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,560
to meet you.

402
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,790
But in fact, I was so lucky

403
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:29,890
to meet you.

404
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,270
Hey.

405
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,290
Food!

406
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,270
Food!

407
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,050
Where is the food?

408
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,300
Sir.

409
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,220
Give back my bag!

410
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,170
No.

411
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,730
Mr. Charn.

412
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,020
Chief.

413
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:26,360
-Hello.
-Hello, Mr. Lawyer.

414
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,890
Thank you so much.

415
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:31,290
My pleasure.

416
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,350
Don't come over.

417
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,800
I'm scared.

418
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,800
-Are you still alive?
-Stay back.

419
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,650
I'm scared.

420
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,810
Come here.

421
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,050
Tan, come down.

422
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,090
You may fall down.

423
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,180
It's okay, Thee.

424
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,450
I can do it.

425
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:08,680
Come here, kid.

426
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,900
Come here.

427
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,530
Here.

428
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,570
Tan.

429
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:19,690
That cat is so annoying.

430
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,890
When I fell,

431
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,560
it came down on its own.

432
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,530
If I knew this would happen, I wouldn't have helped it.

433
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:27,790
Thee.

434
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,740
You can put me down. I can walk on my own.

435
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,210
It's just a minor injury.

436
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,390
I'm fine.

437
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,350
I always carry you on my back.

438
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:37,880
This is nothing.

439
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:39,360
Really?

440
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,640
When did you carry me on your back?

441
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,130
Every night

442
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:45,740
when you were drunk.

443
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,000
Really?

444
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,450
I don't remember.

445
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,030
Thee.

446
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,450
You know what?

447
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,280
I drink

448
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,520
to forget something.

449
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,710
But now I want to remember it

450
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,490
forever.

451
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:41,780
Aren't you going to ask me

452
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,100
about what happened during the day?

453
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:47,820
I won't ask you if you don't want to tell me.

454
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,530
But if you want to tell me,

455
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,710
I'm ready to listen to you.

456
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,820
I used to live here.

457
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,950
That's what I guessed.

458
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,830
You seem familiar with this place.

459
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,340
Do you remember the case of Ban Dong Pan Village

460
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,940
seven or eight years ago?

461
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,450
The government official

462
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:22,920
kicked the villagers out.

463
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:27,280
The news said the government official

464
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,530
had reached an agreement with a capitalist.

465
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:31,290
If the villagers here left,

466
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,060
that official would change the name

467
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,860
of the title deed to the capitalist's, right?

468
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,610
The villagers disagreed.

469
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,970
So there was a fight.

470
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,870
The leader of the villagers

471
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,670
was a warm-hearted new lawyer.

472
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:50,880
Don't tell me...

473
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,420
I'm that lawyer.

474
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,410
[Village Chief's Office]

475
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,410
[We're not going anywhere] 
[This is our home]

476
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,410
Don't be afraid.

477
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,090
I won't let the government official

478
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,200
or any capitalists

479
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,310
to kick everyone out of here.

480
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,320
Yeah!

481
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,140
Someone is here to help.

482
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,180
Someone is helping us.

483
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,730
You have no right to drive away

484
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,810
the villagers here.

485
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,590
They've lived here for decades.

486
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:26,120
-Right?
-Yes.

487
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,870
I'm just doing my job.

488
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:29,600
Your job?

489
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,730
You came with the capitalist.

490
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,130
Everyone can see that.

491
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,350
If you drive the villagers out of here,

492
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:38,980
you'll give him the authorization document.

493
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,410
This piece of land

494
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,400
is in a good location.

495
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,880
If these villagers keep living here,

496
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,650
this land will be wasted.

497
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,790
But if I come in,

498
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:51,370
I will make this place into a developed area.

499
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,460
When tourists come,

500
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,150
the villagers can bring some vegetables here

501
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,200
to sell.

502
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,510
It's a win-win situation.

503
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,800
How about this?

504
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,160
Let's cut to the chase.

505
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,260
How much do you need

506
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,630
to stay out of this?

507
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,620
Take your money and bribe others.

508
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,390
I don't need it.

509
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:15,080
I need justice.

510
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,130
I can promise you

511
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:20,090
I'll sue both of you.

512
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,680
I'm going to put you in jail!

513
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,220
Get out! Get out!

514
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:31,270
Get out! Get out!

515
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,080
Get out! Get out!

516
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:36,250
Go! Go! Go!

517
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,420
Chief.

518
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,600
Mr. Charn.

519
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,510
About what they said...

520
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,660
Chief, don't worry

521
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,690
about that.

522
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,760
The villagers have lived here for so long.

523
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,420
If he wants the villagers to leave here

524
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,690
and let the capitalist in for business,

525
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:56,740
it's absolutely not feasible.

526
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,220
Yes.

527
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,210
Chief.

528
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:04,900
I'll file a complaint to the National Anti-Corruption Commission.

529
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,130
I'll find out

530
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,790
all the people related to that chaebol.

531
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:10,890
No matter what,

532
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,290
every bad guy will be punished by the law, Chief.

533
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,690
Charn.

534
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:20,120
I'm proud of you.

535
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:26,140
Don't worry, Chief.

536
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:35,580
I was really stupid.

537
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,940
I believed justice could overcome everything.

538
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:44,560
Move!

539
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,160
Mom. Mom. Mom.

540
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:58,570
Charn. Charn. Charn!

541
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,770
-Mom. Mom. Mom.
-Charn. Charn. Charn!

542
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:02,340
Mom, are you okay?

543
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:03,430
I'm fine.

544
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,200
Mom, we'll be fine.

545
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,510
Chief.

546
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,120
I'm sorry, Mr. Charn.

547
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,460
Why did you do that?

548
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,590
I've tried my best to remind you.

549
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:22,960
But you're too stubborn.

550
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,679
Who doesn't want to live comfortably?

551
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:27,929
Don't hate me.

552
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,110
Give the money to the villagers

553
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:36,100
and take care of everything.

554
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,630
It's okay, Mom.

555
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,130
Mom.

556
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,889
Mom!

557
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:51,940
Mom!

558
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:54,550
Mom!

559
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:56,560
Mom!

560
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,630
Mom!

561
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,640
Mom!

562
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,800
Mom!

563
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,430
Mom!

564
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,920
Mom!

565
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:48,320
Mom!

566
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:49,950
Mom, talk to me. Mom.

567
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,440
Don't fall asleep, Mom.

568
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:53,120
Mom.

569
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,170
Mom!

570
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,950
Mom.

571
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,800
Mom, wake up and talk to me.

572
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,730
Mom, wake up and talk to me

573
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,070
Charn.

574
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:37,920
How are you?

575
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,190
Sister.

576
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,750
Where is my mom?

577
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,050
You wait here.

578
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,150
I'll get the doctor.

579
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:49,160
Where is my mom?

580
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,400
It's all my fault.

581
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,040
I brought my mom here.

582
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:16,450
My mom died because I brought her here, right?

583
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,490
Charn.

584
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,790
Don't think like that.

585
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:21,720
Don't blame yourself.

586
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,370
If your mother were still alive,

587
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:26,980
she wouldn't want to see you like this.

588
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,510
Charn.

589
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,680
What's wrong?

590
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:40,840
What?

591
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,330
Yes.

592
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,330
I shouldn't be sad.

593
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:51,860
They should be sad.

594
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:11,610
Stop. Stop. Stop.

595
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,210
Stop.

596
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:17,820
Are you tricking me?

597
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,270
Didn't you tell me to start building

598
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:20,580
and you would issue the documents?

599
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,360
Now, you tell me I need to stop.

600
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,240
My leader

601
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,320
told me

602
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:27,800
he had a new partner, Young Master.

603
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:29,480
He

604
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,830
signed an agreement

605
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,060
with another capitalist named Nawin.

606
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,650
A new contract?

607
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,970
Who is that?

608
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:38,000
[Mr. Charn]

609
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:40,020
Hello.

610
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,950
Charn?

611
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:47,680
I'm the lawyer

612
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:49,000
of Mr. Nawin.

613
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,310
Are you unhappy

614
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:55,540
to meet your old friend?

615
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:57,440
Mr. Charn.

616
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,680
I think we have a lot of past events

617
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,220
to catch up on.

618
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,690
[Village Chief's Office]

619
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,760
Fire! It's on fire!

620
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:19,310
Fire!

621
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:21,830
Fire! Fire!

622
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,170
Help! Help!

623
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,990
So beautiful!

624
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:18,700
Destruction.

625
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:20,270
So beautiful.

626
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,470
Charn

627
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:44,080
I understand your pain.

628
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,030
I know.

629
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,010
You also lost

630
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,640
the person you love.

631
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,890
That's why I want you to see

632
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,240
if you have money,

633
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,050
power,

634
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,890
and prestige,

635
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,400
no one will

636
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,440
make you sad again, Tin.

637
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,660
Charn, I understand you.

638
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,870
But I don't think what you do is right.

639
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,050
No.

640
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,870
You don't understand me.

641
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:25,000
You won't understand me

642
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:27,140
until you get power.

643
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:30,730
By then, you can live a life where you don't feel inferior.

644
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,360
That feeling is so good.

645
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,180
Come to my side, Tin.

646
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:43,620
I'll show you.

647
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,670
It is you who have to come to my side, Charn.

648
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,530
Stop it.

649
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:01,320
I know, deep down,

650
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,720
you're still a lawyer

651
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:06,220
who pursues justice,

652
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:07,760
who is brave,

653
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:09,140
and who's willing to help others.

654
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:11,210
That fool died long ago, Tin.

655
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,360
And that's exactly why

656
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:20,570
I can live

657
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,370
in this sinful world proudly, Tin.

658
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,580
If your mom knew

659
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:33,790
what you have become,

660
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:34,910
what would she think?

661
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:36,300
Don't mention my mom.

662
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,510
Why, Charn?

663
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:47,940
You told me yourself

664
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:52,000
that you are living your life proudly.

665
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,320
What's so shameful about that?

666
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,410
Your mom will be

667
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,670
-proud of you.
-Shut up.

668
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:13,060
Would she be happy

669
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:16,970
to know that you've avenged her death?

670
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:20,300
Would she be happy

671
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,930
to see you being

672
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:24,230
rich

673
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:25,880
and powerful?

674
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:28,590
Would she be happy

675
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:30,220
to see that you become like this?

676
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:33,280
You don't care about others' feelings.

677
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:36,000
You obtain what you want

678
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,170
by hook or by crook.

679
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,950
You have to destroy

680
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:41,290
-your enemy.
-Enough.

681
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:52,110
You know you're not happy.

682
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,530

Incomparably amazing.

00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:16,310
Oh.

721
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:18,260
Why did you bite me?

722
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,910
Are you a dog?

723
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:22,260
Yes, I am.

I'm a crazy dog.

If you don't stop being a bad lawyer,

I'll keep biting you

728
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:37,840
What? Are you going to bite me as well?

729
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,070
It's just a sprain.

Can we just live together like this forever?

733
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:01,970
I'm kidding.

734
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:03,970
I know.

735
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:05,870
That's impossible.

736
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:09,670
-No matter what, I have to go back
-Tan.

737
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,730
and be the

738
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:13,540

740
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:17,040
What can I do?

741
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:19,010
I'm his son.

742
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:21,290
Even if you need to go back,

743
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:23,500
you don't have to be the old you.

744
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:26,540
Thee.

745
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:28,870
We can't escape from ourselves.

746
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:32,650
That's not your true self.

747
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,540
I know that

rowdy

749
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:38,460
and angry kid

750
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:41,150
just wanted his father to pay attention to him.

751
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,350
But don't do that anymore.

752
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,220
That will only hurt you.

753
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:51,100
Thee.

754
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:53,740
I'm just bad.

755
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:55,790
It has nothing to do with my dad.

756
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,210
Tan.

757
00:49:57,730 --> 00:49:59,000
I want others to know

758
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:00,110
the Tan I know.

759
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:02,850
That Tan is kind.

760
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,250
That Tan can be easily teased.

761
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:06,680
That Tan laughs a lot.

762
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:08,890
That Tan is empathetic

763
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,570
and warm-hearted.

764
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:13,770
That Tan helped a homeless kid

765
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:15,020
and gave him a place to live.

766
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,420
I...

767
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:23,630
Am I that kind of person?

768
00:50:26,330 --> 00:50:27,360
Yes.

769
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:30,660
That Tan climbed onto the tree

770
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:31,810
to save the cat

771
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,110
but fell down and hurt his leg.

772
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,250
Every time I heard

773
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,600
others badmouthing you, I was sad.

774
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,360
Because I know that's not your true self.

775
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:51,880
If you have something on your mind,

776
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:53,880
you can tell me.

777
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:56,790
Don't hurt yourself anymore.

778
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:17,810
Thank you.

779
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:43,250
Tin.

780
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:47,270
Tin.

781
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:50,140
Tin.

782
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,770
[We still have something to talk about]

783
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:59,860
[Let's meet somewhere]

784
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:27,720
When are we going back to Bangkok

785
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,340
to fix Tonkhao's doll

786
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:31,120
so that we can know what's inside?

787
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:32,320
If it's evidence

788
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:33,670
that can convict Senator Thatthep,

789
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:35,460
we can take action as soon as possible.

790
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:37,910
You love him, don't you?

791
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,500
Dad. Dad.

792
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:40,670
Don't hurt Thee.

793
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:41,950
I'll do anything

794
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:43,190
you ask me to do.

795
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:45,880
What did you promise him?

796
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:48,210
What is this?

797
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,250
Charn.

798
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:50,450
Charn.

799
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:51,800
What do you want to do?
