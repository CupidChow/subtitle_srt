My grandson

194
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,120
is becoming sillier and sillier.

195
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,480
Hey.

196
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,170
How old are you?

197
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,910
Are you a three-year-old?

198
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,920
How old are you?

199
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,080
Are you two?

200
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,420
Let's go.

201
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,710
The customers are waiting.

202
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:15,710
Go downstairs.

203
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,230
This boy.

204
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,420
That table.

205
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,580
Wow.

206
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,460
It's delicious.

207
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,670
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

208
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,080
Bye.

209
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,120
Tin.

210
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:50,370
Go to the market

211
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,210
and buy these things.

212
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,370
I'll cook now,

213
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,620
or else my grandson will be hungry.

214
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,540
Oh no.

215
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,960
Grandma, I'm your grandson.

216
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:01,250
Charn is an outsider.

217
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,330
I don't know.

218
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,250
I'm sick of your face.

219
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,620
Take the bag.

220
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,250
My new grandson is much cuter than you.

221
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,960
-Am I not cute, Grandma?
-Go.

222
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,330
Go.

223
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:37,510
♫When you have no one and you're lost♫

224
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:43,980
♫When the hurried life only has darkness♫

225
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:51,150
♫You lit up my pained heart like sunlight♫

226
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:56,080
♫From now on, I live for you♫

227
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:04,670
♫Love has come♫

228
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:12,280
♫No matter what, I won't back down♫

229
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:18,380
♫I want to do everything for you♫

230
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:25,850
♫No matter what happens♫

231
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:32,500
♫I'll still choose to be with you♫

232
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,370
Wait for me.

233
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,460
I'm going to buy something.

234
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:43,740
♫No tricks, just want to say you can always trust me♫

235
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,420
How did it go?

236
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,920
I went to see Mr. Chai.

237
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,420
He's fine.

238
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,790
He also asked me

239
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,790
to thank you and Mr. Thatthep.

240
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,790
Thank us?

241
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,830
Dad and I sent him to jail.

242
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,910
Is he crazy?

243
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,120
How pathetic.

244
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,500
Pathetic.

245
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,420
Do you like these?

246
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,170
They're all my favorite.

247
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,080
Let's eat.

248
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,120
-Eat.
-Let's eat.

249
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,790
Let's eat.

250
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,250
It's so delicious.

251
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,210
Grandma, what's wrong?

252
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,910
Tonkhao likes this soup.

253
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:27,330
I'm sorry.

254
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,830
I ruined the atmosphere.

255
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,040
It's okay, Grandma.

256
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,790
It's okay.

257
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,670
I also want to hear you and Tin

258
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,550
talk

259
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,710
about Tonkhao.

260
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,540
Why?

261
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,250
She was just a kid.

262
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,620
It's heartbreaking that she was hit.

263
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,420
In the future,

264
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,580
I'll frequently ask Grandma and Tin

265
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,390
to tell the reporters about Tonkhao.

266
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,840
This way, people will pity us

267
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,540
and hate those guys.

268
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,160
You want to get to know my niece, right?

269
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,210
Tonkhao's real name is Tanyanari.

270
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,750
She was in the fifth grade.

271
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,960
She liked dogs more than cats.

272
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:11,500
She liked the color blue.

273
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,830
Her English was amazing,

274
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,500
but her math was horrible.

275
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:24,820
She failed every exam.

276
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,960
She was very curious.

277
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,910
If she wanted to know something,

278
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:36,960
she would insist on finding out.

279
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,910
Once,

280
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:41,960
she wanted to know

281
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,330
why you could call with phones.

282
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:46,870
Do you know what she did?

283
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,620
She took apart my phone entirely.

284
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,910
I was so mad.

285
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,040
That was my first

286
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,460
smartphone.

287
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,170
I can imagine your expression at the time.

288
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:15,579
Charn.

289
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:23,369
I want to remember my niece like this.

290
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,910
A skinny girl

291
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,750
who liked to make me and Grandma laugh.

292
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,910
She liked lemon-flavored ice cream.

293
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:46,170
She brought joy to others.

294
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,750
I don't want others

295
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,960
to remember my niece

296
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,080
because of the murder.

297
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,370
It's fine.

298
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,330
You don't have to

299
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,000
tell the reporters about Tonkhao anymore.

300
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,670
I also lost a loved one before.

301
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,000
I understand how you feel.

302
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,210
I'm sorry I didn't understand you in time.

303
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,330
Thank you for understanding.

304
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,960
Thank you for telling me this.

305
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,710
Mr. Tanthai didn't go out.

306
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:39,830
He's in his room.

307
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,580
Should I call him to see you?

308
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,330
No.

309
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,120
I don't want to see him frowning.

310
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,290
Don't let him

311
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,480
run out again.

312
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,830
He'll ruin our plan.

313
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:53,050
What about Mr. Chai?

314
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,170
What should we do?

315
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,000
None of the public

316
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,080
believes that Mr. Chai did it,

317
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,120
let alone Charn.

318
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,230
What can they do even if they don't believe it?

319
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:05,670
As for Chai,

320
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:07,590
don't worry.

321
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,100
Things will get better.

322
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,960
As for Charn,

323
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,000
my men will report

324
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:17,990
about his actions.

325
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,370
Okay.

326
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,210
What are you looking for?

327
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,280
It's all Tanthai's videos.

328
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,300
On the night Tonkhao died,

329
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,710
Tanthai really did come here.

330
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,460
What a pity.

331
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,950
I can't see which car Tanthai drove.

332
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,040
If I must guess,

333
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,750
it's definitely not the one that hit Tonkhao.

334
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,420
What is it, Tin?

335
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,170
How is it going, Charn?

336
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,670
Did you find any useful clues?

337
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:07,670
No.

338
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,040
I looked from daytime until now.

339
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,210
My eyes hurt so much.

340
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,910
What are you doing?

341
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,000
I just cleaned up the store.

342
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,400
There were more customers than the day before yesterday.

343
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,080
Are you still at Rose's shop?

344
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,300
I'll go find you.

345
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,210
You don't have to come.

346
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,840
Are you tired?

347
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,710
No.

348
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,250
Wait for me there.

349
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,250
I'll come over.

350
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,030
We can find something to eat.

351
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,130
Bye.

352
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,790
Bye.

353
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:55,690
Stop pretending.

354
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,580
Tell me everything.

355
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:59,210
Are you dating?

356
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,670
What do you mean?

357
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,850
He just called to ask about his niece's case.

358
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,040
It's normal.

359
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,830
Yes.

360
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,790
My eyes hurt so much.

361
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,880
Are you tired?

362
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,120
Bye.

363
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,910
He's seduced you, hasn't he?

364
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,460
You know me.

365
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:24,000
I won't get seduced by anyone.

366
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'll call back later.

367
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:41,960
Is it Tin?

368
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,960
No.

369
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,000
Show me.

370
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,080
-Lady!
-Show me.

371
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,250
-Show me.
-This is...

372
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,850
Robbery!

373
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,940
For robbery,

374
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,180
you'll be in jail for at least five years

375
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,160
and be fined up to 100,000 baht.

376
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:54,870
I have money.

377
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,700
-Give it to me.
-No.

378
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,890
[Chan Law Office]

379
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,250
What's in that box?

380
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,250
It's Tonkhao's stuff.

381
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,170
What for?

382
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,080
Is there something about the content

383
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,080
or does it contain other evidence?

384
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,080
It has nothing to do with the case.

385
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,620
I just want to know more about Tonkhao.

386
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,420
Pumpun,

387
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,750
have you seen Tonkhao's dolls before?

388
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,040
Yes.

389
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,460
It's a dog.

390
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,080
A dog.

391
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,170
A very special doll.

392
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,250
How is it special?

393
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,040
It could say, "Hello, woof."

394
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:46,750
Doll.

395
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:49,370
What doll?

396
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:53,170
Nothing.

397
00:23:58,670 --> 00:23:59,460
I'm in a hurry.

398
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,480
Let's talk later.

399
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,620
How is it?

400
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,710
Did you find it?

401
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:21,710
No.

402
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,500
I also searched everywhere,

403
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,750
but I can't find it.

404
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,620
But I remember

405
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:31,330
that doll wasn't part of Tonkhao's items

406
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:33,420
that I donated.

407
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,330
It's okay.

408
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:36,420
Charn, send the picture

409
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,390
to me.

410
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,960
I'll show it to him.

411
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:53,210
Wait.

412
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,540
This bag...

413
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:56,870
What's wrong, Grandma?

414
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,460
I gave this bag to Ploy

415
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:02,330
to keep as a memory

416
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:04,710
before I

417
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:05,710
donated everything.

418
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,210
This phone number

419
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:15,540
has unsubscribed.

420
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,870
What should I do?

421
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:20,540
I only have Ploy's aunt Bo's number.

422
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,540
I don't have her dad or mom's number.

423
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,500
Do you know

424
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,830
where they moved to?

425
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,210
She said

426
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:28,960
she's going out of the city to sell things.

427
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,790
When she came to say goodbye to me,

428
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,620
I didn't say much

429
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,370
or ask for the details.

430
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:41,290
I talked to Tonkhao about this before.

431
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,370
Tonkhao said Ploy has relatives

432
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,400
selling things in the market.

433
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:46,790
It's where I often go to buy things,

434
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:49,250
but I don't know what they sell.

435
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,910
Oh,

436
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,170
they won't be hard to find it if they're still selling.

437
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,170
I'll look for them.

438
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:59,960
[Chan Law Office]

439
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,960
Mr. Charn.

440
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:05,290
You went out for a long time.

441
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:06,290
Where did you go?

442
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,910
Is the doll you mentioned

443
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,210
a piece of evidence

444
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:11,500
for Tonkhao's case?

445
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:13,750
Vit, stop asking me.

446
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:14,790
I’m tired.

447
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:25,790
I'm sorry.

448
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:27,790
I was a little excited.

449
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,710
I thought we found the doll.

450
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,330
Then we would have the evidence

451
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:32,870
to bring down Senator Thatthep.

452
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,580
Even if I can't find the doll,

453
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,050
it doesn't mean

454
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,460
I can't find a way to bring him down.

455
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:03,210
What do you mean?

456
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,790
Someone sent me evidence.

457
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,580
That man wasn't in Bangkok

458
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,120
on the night of the incident.

459
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,580
We have the witness and evidence.

460
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,750
They won't be able to escape.

461
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,040
I'll force him to reveal

462
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:22,250
who the mastermind is.

463
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:28,750
The game is over, Senator Thatthep.

464
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:22,000
[It was my mistake. I'm sorry.]

465
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,710
[Let me pay with my life.]

466
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,550
Mr. Chai,

467
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,750
the real murderer who hit Tonkhao,

468
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,290
has died in prison.

469
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:31,830
He committed suicide.

470
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:32,910
How do you think

471
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,080
this case will develop?

472
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,670
The police will immediately investigate

473
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:37,920
the suspect and prison staff

474
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,650
to see if he really committed suicide.

475
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,420
But after reading the staff's report,

476
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,480
it says Mr. Chai has depression.

477
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:44,750
He also said

478
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,370
he doesn't want to live in this world anymore.

479
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,310
He left a suicide note

480
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,420
and wrote down all his sins.

481
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:51,870
Based on the initial evidence,

482
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:54,080
I think this case will be closed soon.

483
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,580
It could be

484
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,670
that the criminal committed suicide

485
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,080
due to anxiety.

486
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,580
It's possible from the evidence.

487
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:02,290
Young Master!

488
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,120
Young Master!

489
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,540
Young Master!

490
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,710
Did you kill him?

491
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,080
What did I do?

492
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,960
You killed him, didn't you?

493
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:26,920
He was willing to go to jail for us.

494
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,620
Why did you have to kill him?

495
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,670
If you admitted your mistake,

496
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,000
and accepted legal punishment,

497
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,170
it wouldn't have happened.

498
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,330
Was that my fault?

499
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,670
Did I

500
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:44,670
cause all this, Dad?

501
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:48,870
What else do you want?

502
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:51,290
The case will be closed soon.

503
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,710
Why do you have to argue with me?

504
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,080
You're just a troublemaker.

505
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,080
If you weren't my child

506
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:57,790
and didn't have my money,

507
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,790
you'd only

508
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,210
turn out to be a scumbag.

509
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,170
How much money

510
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,330
have I spent on you?

511
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,420
But you can't even

512
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,910
repay me a little bit.

513
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:14,210
Trash.

514
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I should be punished.

515
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,620
Another person died

516
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,500
because of me.

517
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,420
It's not your fault.

518
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:41,250
How is this not my fault?

519
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:43,790
If I got punished,

520
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,080
everything would be over.

521
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,370
I made things complicated.

522
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,620
You know what?

523
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:54,080
It's the first time

524
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,580
I've ever been this close to Dad

525
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,170
since the child's death.

526
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:03,370
Young Master, calm down.

527
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,540
Don't think too much.

528
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,620
We fight over this case every day.

529
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,460
And this was

530
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,000
the longest time I talked to my dad.

531
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,580
Even if it was just a quarrel,

532
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,120
it made me feel

533
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,830
I was nothing to him.

534
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,960
I'll get you some medicine for anxiety.

535
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Have a good sleep.

536
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,120
Thee.

537
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,040
If I didn't have Dad's money

538
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,080
or his power,

539
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,580
I'd definitely just be a bad kid.

540
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,870
Nobody would want to be with me,

541
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,290
including you, right?

542
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:51,170
-I... -Of course that's a yes.

543
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,420
I'm sorry

544
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,870
for asking you such a meaningless question.

545
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,250
Sorry to put you in a difficult position.

546
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:12,170
♫I'm not an exception to you♫

547
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:17,720
♫I'm just someone around you♫

548
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:22,370
♫I can only say I'm someone around you♫

549
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:32,260
♫Will we be like lovers someday♫

550
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:37,690
♫Will that day ever come♫

551
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:52,330
You missed a lot,

552
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,790
just like the case you're handling now.

553
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,960
You got him killed to solve the problem.

554
00:32:58,670 --> 00:32:59,670
The case is over.

555
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,540
You can't handle the person behind it.

556
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,370
I warned you.

557
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,580
Don't mess with Senator Thatthep.

558
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,210
The more dangerous it is,

559
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:12,120
the higher the pay is.

560
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:15,040
If you want results,

561
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,080
you have to

562
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,420
bring Senator Thatthep to justice.

563
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:22,960
It'll be big news.

564
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,830
Great results.

565
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,910
But if we're bringing

566
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:29,210
Senator Thatthep to justice,

567
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,620
we need sufficient evidence.

568
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,420
What if I can find the evidence?

569
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,830
As a detective,

570
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:43,040
I must arrest the culprit.

571
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:45,370
But are you sure

572
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:47,000
that Senator Thatthep

573
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,750
won't take revenge on me?

574
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,580
Don't worry.

575
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,620
I have an idea.

576
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:56,120
Just wait for my witness and evidence.

577
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,000
I talked to my superior.

578
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:12,290
He said he'd help

579
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,790
if we had evidence against Senator Thatthep.

580
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:16,500
The case is already closed.

581
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,250
What evidence should we find

582
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,670
to make them reopen the case?

583
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:25,370
Charn.

584
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,750
I got Tonkhao's doll.

585
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,750
The doll they've been looking for?

586
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,330
If we give the doll

587
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:36,750
to our superior,

588
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,960
it'll be over.

589
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:47,460
[Charn Law Office]

590
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:24,540
[Surprise]

591
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:31,120
Are you disappointed, Vit?

592
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Mr. Charn.

593
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,460
I must praise you.

594
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,120
You've been hiding yourself.

595
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:44,170
No.

596
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:46,210
You almost did it.

597
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:48,910
When did you find out?

598
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,170
When you said

599
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:51,460
it was Nam who did it.

600
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,250
I told you to find out who released the news.

601
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:55,910
I got the transfer certificate

602
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,080
from the reporters

603
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:01,290
and found out the receiver was Nam.

604
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,120
Mr. Thatthep must have given you a lot of money.

605
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,500
Now Mr. Thatthep knows

606
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,910
Mr. Charn burned the house.

607
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:09,910
Before this, me and Charn didn't know.

608
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:10,910
How would they have known?

609
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:16,460
It means you've been suspecting me.

610
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,250
Everyone is suspicious.

611
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:22,370
If I want to figure it out, I have to verify it.

612
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,670
Phon, Nam's husband,

613
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,670
just got evidence from a friend

614
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,080
at the taxi repair center.

615
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:31,210
I think it's from the dashcam.

616
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:32,920
I just found it out too.

617
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:36,120
Keep it a secret for me.

618
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:41,000
Thank you for believing that I didn't do it.

619
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,290
I trust you.

620
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,080
One more thing.

621
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,210
Tin's old boss contacted me.

622
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,330
He said someone sent me the evidence.

623
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:50,460
It's the evidence

624
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,000
with which we can catch the mastermind.

625
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,370
They must be doomed this time.

626
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:57,790
Someone sent me the evidence

627
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,460
saying that the man wasn't in Bangkok

628
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,040
on the night of the incident.

629
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,250
We have the witness and evidence.

630
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,580
They can't escape from it.

631
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:10,370
Charn.

632
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,750
I got Tonkhao's doll.

633
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,670
The doll they've been looking for?

634
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,420
If we give the doll

635
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,540
to our superior,

636
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:23,670
it'll be over.

637
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:34,290
I just placed bombs on three people

638
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:36,750
and waited to see which one would explode first.

639
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:39,750
And yours exploded.

640
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:42,910
It means the evidence,

641
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,910
-the doll. -I really found it.

642
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,670
Or I didn't.

643
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:49,210
Or I did.

644
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:53,330
I'm taking you

645
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:54,870
to meet my superior.

646
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,620
Please provide

647
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,620
useful information

648
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,910
as a verification.

649
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:02,790
It's inconvenient for me.

650
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:04,830
Then you'll be charged with trespassing.

651
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,580
According to Article 326,

652
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:08,170
the maximum penalty is 10,000 baht

653
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,960
and one year of

654
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,830
imprisonment.

655
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:15,910
I can sue you

656
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,250
for many other crimes.

657
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:19,540
I can also make

658
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,580
a scapegoat.

659
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,170
That's our Charn.

660
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,710
But I'm sorry.

661
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,910
I don't think I can do what you want,

662
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,830
because I have an arrangement.

663
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,460
Get them.

664
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:29,910
Let go.

665
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,540
Thank you

666
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,910
for teaching me so many times

667
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,870
that I must have Plan B.

668
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,580
Vit.

669
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:05,710
Vit.

670
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Don't.

671
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,120
There is a fire.

672
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:36,670
Charn.

673
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:37,910
Charn.

674
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:38,910
Sister.

675
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,960
It's hot.

676
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:47,370
Charn, wait.

677
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:25,420
-Be careful. -Charn.

678
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:46,330
Let's go.

679
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:48,330
Let's go.

680
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:56,330
Hurry.

681
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:21,830
Are you okay?

682
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:25,210
I'm fine. What about you?

683
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,250
I'm fine.

684
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:28,870
Sister.

685
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,420
I'm fine.

686
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,910
I burned your house before.

687
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:44,500
Now my law firm is on fire.

688
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:47,210
It's karma.

689
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:48,620
Am I right?

690
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,420
Good.

691
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:55,460
I bought fire insurance.

692
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:04,830
Stay here.

693
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:06,170
Don't go home.

694
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I don't know what else they're up to.

695
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:12,170
This house is under my friend's name.

696
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:14,960
Don't worry they'll find it.

697
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:18,670
Tin and I may need your help for a while.

698
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:22,420
Grandma.

699
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:23,750
I have to go back to pick Grandma up.

700
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:26,210
Ladies and gentlemen,

701
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:29,580
Maya presents

702
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,750
Galaxia.

703
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,620
Grandma.

704
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,910
Maya went to pick her up.

705
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,420
You can't call me Grandma anymore.

706
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,370
Maya gave me a new name.

707
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,750
Galaxia.

708
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:15,000
And Grandma…

709
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,670
No. Galaxia

710
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:18,290
won't go back to sell Thai hotpot.

711
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:20,710
She's going to sing with Maya

712
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:23,920
and pursue her dream when she was young.

713
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:28,580
Don't worry about Grandma.

714
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:46,250
Lalalalala.

715
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:49,330
Lalalalala.

716
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:52,170
Lalalalala.

717
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:53,620
Lalalalala.

718
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:10,330
Rose wants you

719
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:11,910
to sleep with me.

720
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,420
Am I going to lose my virginity?

721
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:16,580
Narcissistic.

722
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:31,540
I'm sorry that your office caught fire.

723
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:35,080
If you hadn't helped me with this case,

724
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:36,830
this wouldn't have happened.

725
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:43,500
To apologize,

726
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,870
I'll let you punish me. You can do anything to me.

727
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:52,000
Anything.

728
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,170
Hello?

729
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,080
It's not hot.

730
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
You don't have a fever.

731
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:46,420
Are you sick?

732
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:47,710
Go see a doctor.

733
00:46:56,170 --> 00:46:57,170
Thee.

734
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:01,250
I don't want to stay here anymore.

735
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:22,910
Those two

736
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:24,750
haven't come downstairs yet.

737
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:26,870
They must have had a great time last night.

738
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:34,910
I saw them in the pool.

739
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:35,960
Oh.

740
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:41,920
Do you know

741
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:43,370
about what happened between them?

742
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:46,920
I've raised Tin for so long.

743
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:49,370
I know

744
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:50,460
what he likes and dislikes.

745
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:51,870
Right?

746
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,830
As long as he's happy.

747
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,500
I wish my family were like you too.

748
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:02,420
By the way,

749
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:04,170
Rose and Maya,

750
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:05,750
have you known Charn for a long time?

751
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,040
Ten years.

752
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:10,460
But I haven't seen Charn this happy

753
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,710
for a long time.

754
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:33,540
Go away.

755
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:34,910
Annoying.

756
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:37,500
What now?

757
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:42,500
You looked afraid of me.

758
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:43,830
Last night,

759
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:45,000
you took the quilt and pillow downstairs and slept there.

760
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:46,580
Do you think I want to

761
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:47,580
sleep on the same bed with you?

762
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:49,460
Disgusting.

763
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:05,670
Hey.

764
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:06,790
I'll sleep with you.

765
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:12,710
Hey.

766
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:15,710
Hey.

767
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:25,910
Hey.

768
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:26,910
You're pretending to be sleeping, right?

769
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,040
Hey.

770
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,040
Hey.

771
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,750
What? Why are you sighing?

772
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,040
Nothing.

773
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:13,080
I saw the news.

774
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:17,210
There was news about your office fire.

775
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:19,960
They said

776
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:21,620
the circuit went short.

777
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:26,460
It's probably the trick of Thatthep again.

778
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:29,790
If the news said

779
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,580
someone set fire to my office,

780
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:32,870
I wouldn't be surprised either.

781
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:34,920
Because in this world,

782
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,250
hundreds of people want to burn my office.

783
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:41,120
I have so many enemies.

784
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:44,120
People who I thought weren't my enemies

785
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:45,870
might be too.

786
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:50,000
You mean Vit?

787
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:54,670
You're kind of the reason why

788
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:56,540
he did that.

789
00:51:58,540 --> 00:51:59,790
I guess

790
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:02,870
what you said about you didn't trust others,

791
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,330
it was all for money

792
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:07,210
and power,

793
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:10,500
he must have heard it every day.

794
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:13,040
Don't you think

795
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,670
he'd be affected by what you said?

796
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:19,460
Maybe.

797
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,120
You may think

798
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:26,670
not trusting anyone

799
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,420
can make you feel safe.

800
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:31,670
But I think

801
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:33,290
that kind of life is tiring, Charn.

802
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:41,420
Tin.

803
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:42,580
Charn.

804
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,670
There is progress.

805
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:48,910
Nan found out

806
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,540
where Ploy was.

807
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,040
Really, Grandma?

808
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:54,870
I asked Nam and Sompol

809
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,620
to find Ploy's relatives.

810
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:01,210
Nan just called

811
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:02,250
and told me

812
00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:03,670
that she knew

813
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:05,500
Ploy moved to Phetchabun.

814
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:07,250
Is there a phone number?

815
00:53:08,910 --> 00:53:09,910
No.

816
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
No address either.

817
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:13,000
Well,

818
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,620
do you know the details?

819
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:16,040
Which area is it in Phetchabun?

820
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:20,790
Bang Dong Pan Village.

821
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,330
Bang Dong Pan Village.

822
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:31,830
Why does it sound so familiar?

823
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:35,210
Oh, that's the village

824
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:37,540
where the sensational event happened many years ago.

825
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,870
Oh, the village where the government

826
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:54,790
expelled the local minorities, right?

827
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:59,000
Later, an investor invested in it

828
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,460
and constructed many buildings.

829
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,620
Wow, it's a great place now.

830
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:04,330
It's a tourist spot.

831
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:07,670
There are hostels everywhere.

832
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:17,210
Let me, Maya, and Tin go find the doll.

833
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:20,040
You stay here.

834
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:21,670
Don't go back.

835
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:23,250
I'll go by myself.

836
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:25,710
You and Maya should stay here and take care of Grandma.

837
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:27,750
You said

838
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:29,330
you thought you'd never step into that place again.

839
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:33,250
It's been so long.

840
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,420
That place has changed.

841
00:54:36,290 --> 00:54:37,540
The people I know

842
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,670
must have moved out or died.

843
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:42,960
It's good that I can go back.

844
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:44,910
Only then can I know

845
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,290
if I dare to face the past.

846
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:50,580
I hope this time

847
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:52,460
we can find the evidence against Senator Thatthep.

848
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:05,420
Charn.

849
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:06,620
What's wrong?

850
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,170
Who said

851
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:10,580
I wanted to bring Senator Thatthep to court?

852
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:12,120
It's so boring.

853
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:15,540
Don't you want to catch Senator Thatthep?

854
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:16,910
What do you mean?

855
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:18,910
Sister.

856
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:21,420
Thatthep

857
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:23,290
tried so hard to get

858
00:55:23,290 --> 00:55:24,290
the evidence in the doll.

859
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:26,290
It means it's very important to him.

860
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:29,420
If I get the evidence,

861
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:32,330
I'll be able to control Thatthep.

862
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,040
His money

863
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,910
and power will be mine.

864
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,040
What about Tin?

865
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:40,210
Tin will get

866
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:41,540
what he deserves.

867
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:44,370
He deserves fairness.

868
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,870
Fairness doesn't exist.

869
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:48,500
Do you think

870
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,500
everything will end

871
00:55:49,870 --> 00:55:51,330
if I bring Thatthep to the court?

872
00:55:51,670 --> 00:55:52,750
He will find a way

873
00:55:52,790 --> 00:55:54,330
to get himself out of this.

874
00:55:56,210 --> 00:55:57,460
Fairness is rare,

875
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:58,500
so rare that

876
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:59,960
we can't expect it.

877
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,000
Tin will get money and power.

878
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:04,540
When that day comes,

879
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:05,750
he will be satisfied.

880
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:08,620
Are you making him

881
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:11,460
the weakest coward

882
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:13,290
like you?

883
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,870
How am I weak?

884
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,120
You dare not enter his world,

885
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:19,540
but you have to drag him

886
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:21,120
into your dark world.

887
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:24,790
Charn.

888
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,250
Don't do this.

889
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:30,790
Or you'll regret it.

890
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:53,580
I'm sorry.

891
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:54,620
Have you seen this before?

892
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,040
Thee, where are you taking Young Master?

893
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:01,960
Let go of me.

894
00:57:02,370 --> 00:57:03,370
Destruction

895
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
is so beautiful.

896
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:06,830
Your enemy

897
00:57:06,910 --> 00:57:08,080
-will be destroyed. -Enough.

898
00:57:10,670 --> 00:57:12,710
I know deep inside, you're still the same person,

899
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:15,420
a lawyer who loves fairness.

900
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:18,670
That idiot died a long time ago, Tin.
