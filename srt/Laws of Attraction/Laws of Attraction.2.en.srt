Calm down, Tin.

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,970
If he doesn't want money,

192
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,580
what does he want?

193
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,770
What?

194
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,990
I haven't found anything yet. Mr. Tanthai.

195
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,170
Someone came

196
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,920
before I found it.

197
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,710
So I ran away quickly.

198
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,380
Then go back and find it for me.

199
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,970
Yes.

200
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,230
Relax.

201
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,870
Get home safely.

202
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,670
-Bye. -Thank you.

203
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,980
Thank you.

204
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,010
Bye.

205
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,410
Hello, Ms. Bo.

206
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,160
Ploy asked me to bring her to you,

207
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,780
because a few days later,

208
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,920
Ploy and her dad will move out of Bangkok.

209
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,710
She wanted to bring you

210
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,400
something in Tonkhao's desk.

211
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,150
Thank you.

212
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,720
Since her best friend passed away,

213
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,250
she's been depressed.

214
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,240
I miss Tonkhao.

215
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,380
[Family]

216
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:57,380
[My beloved great-grandma and Uncle Tin]

217
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,360
-Grandma. -Okay.

218
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,050
Press this button.

219
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,340
-Press it. -The arrow.

220
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,990
Here, press this button.

221
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,440
Why can't I see it clearly?

222
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,800
Why?

223
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:16,980
I forgot to wear glasses.

224
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:19,020
Grandma.

225
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,350
-You're so forgetful. -Okay. Come on.

226
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,150
-Here's the starting button. -Please press it.

227
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,310
-I see it. -Did you see it?

228
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,300
-Yes. -It's so clear.

229
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,580
It's so clear.

230
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,850
Press the button at the lower right corner and it'll zoom in.

231
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,440
-Lower right corner. -Zoom in. Where? Where?

232
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,050
-One more time. -One more time.

233
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,470
-Hey. -Oh.

234
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,210
What are you doing here?

235
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,300
Charn is here to install security cameras for us.

236
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,510
We'll know

237
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,840
if there is a thief again.

238
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:45,910
Yes.

239
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,830
Thank you so much.

240
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,330
I'll pay

241
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,310
for the installation.

242
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,600
It's okay.

243
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,810
Tin and I are close.

244
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:55,990
No.

245
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,020
Oh.

246
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,680
Take your things out.

247
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,390
Don't fall into his trap.

248
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,800
Actually, he is...

249
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,650
He used to be the lawyer of the person who killed Tonkhao.

250
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,570
But he told me he changed his mind.

251
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,190
He's coming to help us.

252
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,940
Are you sure he's here to help

253
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,850
instead of installing the security camera so he can watch our every move?

254
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,030
I don't have to use the camera if I want to see you,

255
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,180
I've seen your whole body.

256
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,660
Mr. Charn.

257
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,510
I've installed all the cameras.

258
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,850
Grandma and Nam can stay here.

259
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,450
I'll go behind the house.

260
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,500
Have a look at the picture. Is it clear?

261
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,720
OK.

262
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,740
I can use it now.

263
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,920
I remember.

264
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,360
Here, take a look.

265
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,280
Yes, very clear.

266
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,640
So cute.

267
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,920
That's great.

268
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,740
-We don't have to worry anymore. -Yes.

269
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,780
This camera is so nice.

270
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:10,480
It's so clear, Grandma.

271
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,730
What do you want?

272
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,970
Remove your security cameras.

273
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:19,560
I'll find someone to install it.

274
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:21,369
You can use mine first.

275
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,770
You're annoying.

276
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,900
When can you stop bothering me?

277
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,600
Tin.

278
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,830
The day the bad guy entered your house,

279
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,350
all the cameras nearby were broken.

280
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,850
Do you think it was a coincidence, Tin?

281
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,440
Do you mean Senator Thatthep did it?

282
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,080
I found this picture through the front camera of

283
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,740
a parker's car in this neighborhood.

284
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,780
Look at this man.

285
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,360
He works for Senator Thatthep.

286
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,620
He sent someone to teach me a lesson.

287
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,560
Here.

288
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:13,970
Or do they hate us for not letting go of his son killing my niece

289
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,210
and deliberately sent someone to threaten me and Grandma?

290
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,740
No.

291
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,900
I don't think so.

292
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,470
If they really want to threaten me and Grandma,

293
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,250
why didn't they come when I was home

294
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,520
but when no one was around?

295
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,880
They want something

296
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:33,960
related to this case.

297
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:36,980
Related to the case?

298
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,330
What do they want?

299
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:56,120
Oh, why does it coincide with the day to see a doctor today?

300
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,300
You can go.

301
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,920
I want to wait for Tin.

302
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,460
But I'm afraid there will be lots of people in the hospital.

303
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,330
Just go.

304
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,560
Come back soon.

305
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:03,370
-Okay. -Close the door.

306
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,470
Turn off the lights and the tap.

307
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,510
-Okay, Grandma. -Okay.

308
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:06,640
Okay, stop looking.

309
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,320
Go. I'll take care of it.

310
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,710
I should check it again.

311
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:11,680
Just go.

312
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,100
Thank you.

313
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,520
Go.

314
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,890
Go to the doctor. Grandma.

315
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,360
Okay.

316
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,430
Same as before?

317
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,110
Alright, Tin.

318
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,760
Oh, the day before yesterday,

319
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,930
Ms. L came to buy something.

320
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:38,350
She said she wanted to buy more.

321
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:40,320
But I don't remember what it is.

322
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,900
Did she tell you?

323
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,940
No.

324
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,450
Really?

325
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,920
I'll call her and ask about it.

326
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,080
Okay.

327
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,200
Grandma.

328
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,740
What are you doing?

329
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,600
Thief! Thief!

330
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,940
Help!

331
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,300
Tin.

332
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,670
-Nam -Thief!

333
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,380
Tin.

334
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,180
-Nam, get up. -Wait.

335
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,850
Get up, Nam.

336
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:52,300
You hit me so hard last time.

337
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:54,170
Get up.

338
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:55,450
Get up and let's talk.

339
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,580
Hey.

340
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,930
This is my favorite shirt.

341
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:10,190
What does your boss want

342
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,900
to send you here?

343
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,570
What boss? No one asked me to come.

344
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,340
I just wanted to steal something.

345
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,220
Stop pretending.

346
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,940
I know who you are.

347
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,930
What does your boss want

348
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,070
so he asked you to search Tin's house?

349
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:30,320
Or

350
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,790
is it about the car accident?

351
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,480
Ouch.

352
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,540
It hurts.

353
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,450
Brother.

354
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,230
I don't think it's good to use such a sharp knife.

355
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,390
Be careful not to cut your skin.

356
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,160
Put it down.

357
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,550
Take your time.

358
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:57,500
Hey, don't.

359
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:58,850
Put down the knife.

360
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,610
Put it down.

361
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,410
Oh.

362
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,500
I told you.

363
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,790
Put it down.

364
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,780
See?

365
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:08,030
I'm bleeding.

366
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:11,050
Put the knife down first.

367
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,180
Let me apply the ointment for you.

368
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:33,460
Take off your clothes.

369
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:35,870
Are you crazy?

370
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,400
Hey.

371
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,390
I may look like a bad guy,

372
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,930
but I'm not a casual person.

373
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,820
Okay. Okay.

374
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:47,090
I'm done. I'll take it off.

375
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,510
Take it off.

376
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,680
Oh my.

377
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:13,550
The wound is huge.

378
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:14,510
I think we should go to the hospital.

379
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:15,670
-Let's go. I'll take you there. -Hey.

380
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:19,490
It's okay. It'll heal faster with you applying the ointment for me.

381
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,850
I'm not kidding.

382
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,760
Apply it.

383
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,610
-Ouch. -What's wrong with you?

384
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,850
It hurts.

385
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,730
It's just saline.

386
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,720
Why would it hurt?

387
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,500
-Stop acting cute. -Oh.

388
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,040
Hang in there.

389
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,450
I told you to go to the hospital, but you wouldn't go.

390
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,980
It's cold.

391
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,140
Are you crazy?

392
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,390
Oh, you...

393
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:09,590
Hang in there.

394
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,570
Ah.

395
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:16,310
Ouch.

396
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:17,430
Oh.

397
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,770
Why are you smiling?

398
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,270
It doesn't hurt anymore?

399
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:30,340
Yes, it does.

400
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:33,780
Ah, you...

401
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,860
All right.

402
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,900
You can leave now.

403
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,890
Hey.

404
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,620
You're so cruel.

405
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:49,510
I got hurt because I helped you catch the bad guy.

406
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,900
Really?

407
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,070
Then how did you know the bad guy came to my house?

408
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:01,000
Did you connect your phone to our security cameras?

409
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,180
Well...

410
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,270
I...

411
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:13,800
I just want to help you.

412
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:17,110
I just looked around your house.

413
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,730
I didn't look inside.

414
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,840
I won't invade your privacy.

415
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,750
I'll remove your cameras

416
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,150
and buy some myself.

417
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:34,650
Right. Send me the picture of the bad guy in the security camera.

418
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:35,930
I'm going to give it to the police.

419
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,390
Hey, are you going to call the police?

420
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,230
It'll be a waste of time.

421
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,090
That's Senator Thatthep.

422
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:46,800
That'll only alert them.

423
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,920
The snake has been awakened.

424
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,150
You and I have shown our faces.

425
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,300
They must know now.

426
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,050
It's good to call the police,

427
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,180
so they'll know I want to fight them.

428
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,750
And I'm not afraid of them.

429
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:05,850
What you said makes sense.

430
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,220
However…

431
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:10,900
you told me your plan.

432
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,250
So we're on the same side, right?

433
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,880
Impossible.

434
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,380
Go back. I'll give you a ride.

435
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,220
No, my wound is still hurting.

436
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,220
I want to sit down.

437
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,780
Let's go. I'll give you a ride.

438
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,590
I want to sit down for a while.

439
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,320
You're so troublesome. Go.

440
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,330
Oh, my wound hurts.

441
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,100
Idiot!

442
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,180
You can't do anything!

443
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,910
I'm sorry.

444
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,300
There's one more thing.

445
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,720
That lawyer called Charn

446
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,310
is now on Tin's side.

447
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,570
He knows who I am.

448
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,680
He also knows

449
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:44,430
you want something in that house.

450
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,280
How could you let him see your face?

451
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,500
You're so stupid!

452
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:48,920
How could you show them your face?

453
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,130
That's enough, Young Master.

454
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,240
Let go of me! Stupid thing!

455
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:00,970
Get out!

456
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,040
Yes.

457
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,580
Young Master.

458
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,620
Young Master.

459
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:30,780
You only know how to make trouble.

460
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,940
Why did you send someone to beat Charn?

461
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:36,350
Now he's holding a grudge

462
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:37,880
and go join the opposite party.

463
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,480
What are you going to do about that?

464
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,200
Dad.

465
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,910
I just wanted to help you.

466
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:44,870
Help?

467
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:47,370
If you want to help me,

468
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,700
just be quiet

469
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,930
and spend money. Don't make trouble for me.

470
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,340
Since you were born,

471
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,570
you only know how to cause problems.

472
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,130
A person like you

473
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,100
doesn't deserve to be my son.

474
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,210
Apply some ointment, Young Master.

475
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,030
Thee.

476
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:47,630
I think I'm the worst.

477
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,380
Do you know

478
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,600
how I felt

479
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,400
when that kid died?

480
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,420
I felt nothing.

481
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,530
I felt empty.

482
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,950
Very empty.

483
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:06,200
And now,

484
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,210
I want their whole family to die.

485
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:10,860
The uncle,

486
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,010
the grandma,

487
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,510
and the lawyer named Charn all drop dead.

488
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:16,240
Why aren't they all dead?

489
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,120
I hate them so much.

490
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,240
There's no point for them to keep living.

491
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,860
Why aren't they all dead?

492
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:24,190
Calm down, Young Master.

493
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,870
You're shouting so loudly that Mister will hear you.

494
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,720
He'll get angrier if he hears you.

495
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,380
Thee.

496
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,160
Is the person who should die

497
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,000
me?

498
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:48,070
As my dad said, I shouldn't have come to this world.

499
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:51,870
Don't say that.

500
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,870
[Bar Bar Rose]

501
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,410
I'm sorry, Ms. Rose.

502
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,970
Remember, even if you're a client,

503
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:56,560
you have no right to molest my employee.

504
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,660
Do you understand?

505
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,150
I'm sorry.

506
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,630
Let me go.

507
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,400
Go on teaching him a lesson,

508
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,030
so that he will remember.

509
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,909
Then throw him in front of the hospital.

510
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:24,550
According to Article 297 of criminal law,

511
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:27,489
if you cause

512
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,449
severe physical damage

513
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:31,110
to the victim's body,

514
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,409
you'll be given a sentence of 6 to 10 years.

515
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,639
And you'll be fined 10,000 to 200,000 baht.

516
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:53,100
Here.

517
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,230
Thank you, Narin.

518
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,240
You're welcome.

519
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:58,790
Wait.

520
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:05,030
I should add a glass of wine for you.

521
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:07,210
That's not enough.

522
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:08,860
What?

523
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:11,860
Oh.

524
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:12,960
Well...

525
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:15,890
Aren't you here to drown your sorrows with spirit?

526
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,400
Wasn't your representation of a famous politician canceled?

527
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:21,020
Humph.

528
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:23,710
You got the news so fast.

529
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:27,410
That's why I came to you today.

530
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:30,720
I heard that

531
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,940
Tanthai got drunk here two days ago?

532
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,630
Yes.

533
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:37,270
Did he say anything?

534
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:41,700
I think this case is strange.

535
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:47,830
That day, Maya and some other girls were with Mr. Tanthai.

536
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,780
Maya.

537
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,590
The most beautiful Queen Rose.

538
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,600
Pretty boy.

539
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,770
What can I do for you?

540
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,460
Two or three days ago,

541
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,620
you and your girls

542
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,520
drank with Mr. Tanthai, right?

543
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,190
Tanthai.

544
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,810
Oh.

545
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:36,200
That self-righteous kid

546
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,920
got wasted after only two drinks.

547
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,350
He chattered nonstop.

548
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,120
Full of nonsense.

549
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,130
Did Tanthai say anything strange?

550
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,220
Can you tell me in detail?

551
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:55,460
-One.
-Two, three.

552
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:56,770
-By the time I was there,
-Four.

553
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:00,580
he was already completely drunk.

554
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:05,060
Hey, look, yeah!

555
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,410
You're here.

556
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:13,270
Drink with me.

557
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:15,700
Cheers!

558
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,980
Let's have a drink for my stupid dad!

559
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,940
Yeah!

560
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,400
Wait.

561
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,010
What did you say?

562
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:25,490
My dad.

563
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,710
My stupid dad.

564
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,710
If you know

565
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,970
what kind of person

566
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,370
my dad is,

567
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,170
you'll be shocked.

568
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:36,230
A benevolent father,

569
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,460
always level-headed,

570
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:38,890
likes to give food to monks and nuns.

571
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,240
I'm really going to throw up.

572
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,190
Come on. Drink!

573
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:46,280
Yeah!

574
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:47,340
Cheers.

575
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:50,320
I really want to see

576
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:52,500
my dad's face,

577
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,340
when they see the doll.

578
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:56,240
Die.

579
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,450
Die then.

580
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:59,000
Let them all die

581
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:01,050
so that I can die with them.

582
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:03,010
Come one. Cheers.

583
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,600
Die!

584
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:06,700
Young Master.

585
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:08,370
You're drunk. Go back.

586
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:11,530
I'm not going back.

587
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:12,570
Go back.

588
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,760
No.

589
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:14,830
I'm having a good time.

590
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,600
Cheers.

591
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,670
Thee, let go of me!

592
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:19,800
Thee!

593
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:21,650
Cheers.

594
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:25,510
That's what happened, pretty boy.

595
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:28,110
Thank you for the details.

596
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,950
Use this

597
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:37,160
to reward the girls in the shop.

598
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,850
Just tell them it's from a handsome guy.

599
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:45,640
As Maya said,

600
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,880
Tanthai mentioned some doll.

601
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:47,960
What doll?

602
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,960
Doll.

603
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:05,240
-Let me help you.
-Okay, thank you.

604
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,570
Let me help you.

605
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,640
These are

606
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,780
all Tonkhao's

607
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:15,170
toys and dolls.

608
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:18,270
I'll open it then.

609
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,760
What doll is this?

610
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,370
This is Tonkhao's favorite doll.

611
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,850
She didn't often take it out and play with it,

612
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,160
because she was afraid that it might be lost.

613
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:53,010
It's always at the head of the bed.

614
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Really?

615
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,800
Yes.

616
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,840
Tin sewed it for her.

617
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,150
No wonder

618
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,580
it resembles him so much.

619
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:14,610
At that time, all of Tonkhao's friends had dolls.

620
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,860
But we were just scammed.

621
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,910
We don't even have money

622
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:24,950
to eat, not to mention buying dolls.

623
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:28,580
But Tin didn't want the kid to be sad.

624
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:31,520
So he practiced sewing dolls.

625
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,080
Although this doll is ugly,

626
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,000
Tonkhao liked it very much.

627
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,070
He must have loved his niece very much.

628
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,240
I understand him.

629
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:16,860
To lose a person you love,

630
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,170
I know how painful it is.

631
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:23,500
The more we feel

632
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:27,480
that we've reached our limit of pain,

633
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:31,090
the more it hurts.

634
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,350
Charn.

635
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:46,040
Grandma,

636
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:49,660
can I take these dolls back to check?

637
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,690
If I find anything,

638
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:54,860
I swear I will take good care of these dolls.

639
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:56,580
I won't lose them.

640
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:58,390
Okay.

641
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,510
Thank you.

642
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:10,590
Charn.

643
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,100
Thank you so much

644
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:19,790
for helping Tin and me.

645
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,320
Come and chat with me

646
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:25,300
if you're free someday.

647
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,310
You can talk about anything with me.

648
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,440
Okay, Grandma.

649
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,210
Nam said he came to our home this afternoon, right, Grandma?

650
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:05,920
What? Who came?

651
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,400
Don't act like you don't know.

652
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:14,580
He just dropped by to see Tonkhao's dolls.

653
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:18,300
He said it might be related to the burglary.

654
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:21,510
Grandma, just ignore him.

655
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:25,310
You know what? The one who used my account to apply for donations online

656
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:26,940
is him, Grandma.

657
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:31,440
People like him only have good looks.

658
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:34,560
He's evil and dark inside.

659
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,650
Sometimes, he may not be that kind of person.

660
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:42,060
Grandma.

661
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,510
Don't fall into his trap again.

662
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:47,820
Maybe there's a reason why he's like this.

663
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:50,410
What reason could it be, Grandma?

664
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,080
I don't know.

665
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:55,370
But I have a feeling that

666
00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:00,730
Charn must have encountered a lot of terrible things.

667
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:05,270
When we get hurt,

668
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:10,440
sometimes we add a thick layer of armor to ourselves

669
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:15,390
to cover our wounds.

670
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:18,930
We don't want the wounds to hurt again.

671
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:50,300
Hello.

672
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,950
Is that from the police station?

673
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:00,670
Yes.

674
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:02,280
I can.

675
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,440
Thank you very much.

676
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,550
Who is it?

677
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:11,160
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

678
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:12,590
Thank you so much, sir.

679
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,080
Thank you so much, sir,

680
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,520
for helping us with the case.

681
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:17,150
It's your turn now.

682
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:19,340
There will be progress.

683
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,290
We need you

684
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:22,910
to give a statement again.

685
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,240
-OK.
-OK. OK.

686
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:25,260
-OK.
-OK.

687
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,430
We'll do our best to cooperate.

688
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:29,270
But let me make it clear.

689
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:30,400
You know what?

690
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:31,610
Me alone,

691
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,560
I'm in charge of over a hundred cases.

692
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,320
I hope you can understand.

693
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:37,300
And please tell your lawyer

694
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:40,200
to stop threatening me. It's hard for me too.

695
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:44,960
Did Grandma and Tin hire a lawyer?

696
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,460
When?

697
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,540
No.

698
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:48,520
We didn't.

699
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,570
Then who hired the lawyer?

700
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:52,720
-Well...
-What's going on?

701
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,100
I'm sorry, sir.

702
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:56,020
Who is the lawyer you were talking about?

703
00:45:56,690 --> 00:45:58,290
He's right here.

704
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:02,760
I didn't threaten you, sir.

705
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:04,880
I just followed the law.

706
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:08,460
If the public officials don't fulfill their duties,

707
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:10,660
then they've violated Article 157 of the law.

708
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:13,250
What can we do?

709
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,150
There's no progress in our case.

710
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:17,560
I can only give you a little push.

711
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:26,780
Yeah! Coming!

712
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:28,730
I feel so good today.

713
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,420
How's it? As soon as Mr. Charn made a move,

714
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:31,970
the police started the investigation immediately.

715
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:33,570
Right?

716
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,510
I really want to thank Charn.

717
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:36,590
Without you,

718
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:39,040
we don't know how longer we'll have to wait.

719
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:42,280
The police must register a case

720
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,230
with a hit-and-run accident with a victim.

721
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,100
They must collect evidence,

722
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,090
make a charge,

723
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,870
and then file a suit.

724
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,580
And then,

725
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:51,450
Grandma,

726
00:46:51,490 --> 00:46:53,780
you can appoint me as your lawyer.

727
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:55,540
I can take care of everything.

728
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:57,030
-Really?
-Great!

729
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:58,550
Can we do that?

730
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:01,120
OK, let's do that!

731
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:03,270
-Okay.
-But wait.

732
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:05,350
Those senators have great power.

733
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:08,900
What if the case gets stuck again?

734
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:12,090
If the case isn't handled properly,

735
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,600
for example, the police don't arrest the suspects or start investigating,

736
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:17,260
those who suffer losses can collect evidence

737
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,830
and let their lawyer file a suit against them.

738
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:20,860
However,

739
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,930
the court will first investigate whether the lawsuit is reasonable

740
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,690
before moving on to the next step.

741
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:27,070
If that's the case,

742
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:29,070
I'll make you our lawyer.

743
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:30,480
-Okay, let's do this.
-No.

744
00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:34,270
I don't agree to let you represent us.

745
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:35,320
Oh?

746
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:37,830
Grandma, Nam, Aiphon,

747
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:39,700
don't fall into his trap.

748
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:41,640
See?

749
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:44,240
Tin takes me as a villain again.

750
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:46,070
I don't know what made you so angry.

751
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,570
Did you quarrel with your girlfriend or what?

752
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,040
What girlfriend?

753
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:53,150
He doesn't have a girlfriend, right, Grandma?

754
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:54,200
Tin doesn't have a girlfriend.

755
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:55,930
-Really?
-No.

756
00:47:57,110 --> 00:47:58,560
I thought a lot of girls will pursue him

757
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:00,580
as he has such a pretty face.

758
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:02,640
There are indeed many girls chasing him.

759
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:04,520
But Tin doesn't like them.

760
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:07,390
I know what my grandson likes.

761
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:09,660
-Grandma.
-What?

762
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:11,020
Why are you yelling so loudly?

763
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,350
We're so close.

764
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:16,620
Let's just eat.

765
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,820
Hurry up.

766
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:18,990
Are you hungry?

767
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:20,520
-Please.
-Make yourself at home.

768
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:21,810
Feel free.

769
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,050
What do you think?

770
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:27,480
-Please.
-Okay.

771
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,630
Good night, Grandma.

772
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:32,490
Good night.

773
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:33,950
Bye, Grandma.

774
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,010
Bye.

775
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:36,410
What?

776
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,450
Me?

777
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:40,680
Thank you very much, Tin.

778
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,040
No need to help you.

779
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:43,700
Let's go.

780
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,830
See you, Mr. Charn.

781
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:47,560
-Bye.
-OK. Bye.

782
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:48,800
-Attorney.
-Let's go.

783
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:50,050
Let's go, honey. Hurry.

784
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:51,300
-Don't let Tin change his mind.
-Bye.

785
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:52,720
-Bye.
-It's hot these days.

786
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:54,180
Can I turn on the air conditioner today?

787
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,120
Why are you still here?

788
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:01,560
I stay to help you clean up.

789
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,280
No need to flatter me.

790
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:05,900
I won't be soft-hearted like my grandma.

791
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,330
You're so cruel to me.

792
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:10,830
I'm so cute.

793
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:12,490
Aren't you soft-hearted at all?

794
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:14,940
Let me ask you.

795
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:16,550
Why?

796
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,120
Why are you helping us?

797
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:19,710
What on earth do you want?

798
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:26,830
I want something the same as you.

799
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:29,880
Revenge.

800
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:33,800
-Revenge.
-Yes.

801
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:36,300
I admit it.

802
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,550
I feel ashamed to be terminated representation by them.

803
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:39,290
They even sent people to teach me a lesson.

804
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,030
I just want them to know

805
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:43,610
people like me

806
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:46,230
are not someone who they can treat at will.

807
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,210
You have a strong sense of self-value.

808
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:50,460
I admit it.

809
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,140
Team up with me, Tin.

810
00:49:58,130 --> 00:49:59,500
You and me.

811
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:01,280
Let's work together

812
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,630
and find out what they've done.

813
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:06,010
I'm going to deal with Thatthep

814
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:07,890
together with his political rivals.

815
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:10,990
As for Tanthai who hit and killed Tonkhao,

816
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,530
I'll make sure he has no future

817
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:16,260
and make him pay for what he did.

818
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:25,590
How did you know

819
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:27,360
that's what I want?

820
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,030
What do you want then?

821
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:31,970
Justice?

822
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,240
Do you really think justice exists?

823
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:38,590
How many years do you think it will take?

824
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:40,260
Five years?

825
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:42,080
10 years?

826
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,230
Even if you sue him,

827
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:48,120
it'll just end up with a verdict.

828
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:53,330
You learned the law,

829
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,830
but you don't believe in the law.

830
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:56,650
The law is worthy of awe.

831
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,260
But humans are the worst.

832
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:01,070
I told you.

833
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:02,460
This is how our world is.

834
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:04,700
I know.

835
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:08,040
But I've always taught Tonkhao

836
00:51:08,050 --> 00:51:09,730
to believe in justice.

837
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:13,410
If Tonkhao is still looking at me,

838
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:16,570
if I can't do what I taught her,

839
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:19,190
she will be disappointed in me.

840
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,170
You will regret it.

841
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:28,980
I used to be like you.

842
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:32,150
You said that again.

843
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,110
What?

844
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:36,740
Talking about your past.

845
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:39,820
Why?

846
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,280
What happened to you before?

847
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:56,950
Nothing.

848
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:59,070
Nothing worth remembering.

849
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:00,420
I forgot everything.

850
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:08,820
If you forget the past, you won't talk about it often.

851
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:13,940
You don't forget.

852
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,200
But you want to.

853
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:24,960
Why?

854
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:28,230
Were you not so heartless before?

855
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:32,450
I really want to know

856
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:35,610
what made you become someone like this.

857
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:23,740
Congratulations.

858
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:25,250
This is your first case.

859
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:27,370
Thank you.

860
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,680
[Case 8943, 2017]

861
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:40,300
Thank you so much, Mr. Lawyer.

862
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:41,370
Thank you so much.

863
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,380
It's okay.

864
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,870
Thank you so much for helping me.

865
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:45,300
It's okay, Grandma.

866
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:46,760
It's okay.

867
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:54,510
Mom.

868
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:58,460
I miss you, son.

869
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,230
Have you waited for a long time?

870
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:01,040
Not long.

871
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:02,040
Let's go eat.

872
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:03,830
Let's go. Are you tired?

873
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:05,170
No.

874
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,590
Great.

875
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,430
Do you think sticking to your justice

876
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:38,860
and kindness

877
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,540
will make you win?

878
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:42,320
What can they do to us?

879
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:45,910
He has money and power.

880
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:47,460
If everyone is like you,

881
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:48,910
what would this world be like?

882
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:50,080
Just ignore it.

883
00:54:52,610 --> 00:54:54,180
If you keep doing this,

884
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:56,200
stop dreaming that you can protect others

885
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:58,110
or help your niece pursue justice.

886
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:02,060
What?

887
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:03,780
You just used me and Grandma as pawns.

888
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,510
I didn't expect you to be so smart.
