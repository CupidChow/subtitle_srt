00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,920
(Criminal Court )

2
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,800
That day around 10 pm

3
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,760
(Case 707-710)

4
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,800
I heard the sound of people
arguing following

5
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,120
after there were
many sounds of gunshots.

6
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,560
The door of the dead brotherís room

7
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,000
suddenly opens

8
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,640
and a women comes out
rushing holding a gun.

9
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,560
They had been in a relationship
for many years,

10
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,640
but the younger brother,
the room owner has a new girlfriend.

11
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,440
I have no more questions.

12
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,160
The witness may come forward

13
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,560
I want to ask to
submit additional documents

14
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,880
The court allows it

15
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,040
Can you look at this picture

16
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,080
and tell me what you see?

17
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,840
Oh dog?

18
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,720
or king kong?

19
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,320
Oh no it shouldnít be right.

20
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,360
Iím sorry auntie Iím sorry Iím sorry.

21
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,720
Auntie Iím so sorry

22
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,800
Wow what is it?

23
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,200
Oh, or is it

24
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,480
a Hippo, Hippo, Hippo

25
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,600
thatís right, Hippo, oh Hippo,

26
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,960
eh, why are the glasses so blurry?

27
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,320
You are wrong.
This is a picture of a bear.

28
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,920
The Witness wore glasses as

29
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,760
they witnessed the event of that day.

30
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,440
But you answered wrongly,

31
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,000
it is possible that the person
the witness saw ran out of the room

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,080
was not the defendant?

33
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,200
But I saw it,

34
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,520
this girl is a muderer

35
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,240
since her husband has a fling.

36
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,800
You are a muderer.

37
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,079
You killed my brother.
You killed my brother

38
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,560
STOP

39
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,200
Hey! You killed my brother!

40
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,560
You killed my brother! Let go!

41
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,000
Let go! Let go!

42
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,720
(Chinese Language)

43
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,960
HAHA, Wit Iíve cleared
with Mr. Chen already.

44
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,040
Wit, come pick me up
at the front of the alley.

45
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,400
Iím walking,

46
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,360
Okay..

47
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,080
you scared me.

48
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,640
Hey Chan! Itís because of you that

49
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,200
women got cleared even though
she killed my brother.

50
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,200
Oh, if I donít help my client
Who will I help?

51
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,120
In fact your brother is the cause.

52
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,480
He went out with a woman
the same age as his mother.

53
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,480
Then, he tricked her
and got 10 million from her

54
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,400
and cheated on her.
Thatís why he got killed.

55
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,680
Your a bitch, a shameless,
a money-faced bastard.

56
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,520
Hey, how did your parents raise you?

57
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,000
To grow up to be a lawyer like this.

58
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,560
The world is like this, you know.

59
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,440
If you are angry,

60
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,880
you have to be angry with the world
that roates with this money.

61
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,960
Take this,

62
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,640
You take the money your brother
got him into hiring me.

63
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,560
Iíll help you sue him back.
Do you want it?

64
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,680
HAHAHAHAHA.

65
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,400
Iím going to kill you first

66
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,640
and then go kill that women.

67
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,000

He deserves to die.
Why are you helping him?

82
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,330
One day you will be heartbroken
helping someone like him.

83
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,840
Why are you, Chan?

84
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,120
Oh, let me go, let me go.

85
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,800
Iím so sorry Chan.

86
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,520
Another car was blocking my car
thatís why I came late to pick you up.

87
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,240
If I hadnít come pick you up late,

88
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,960
this story wouldnít have happend.

89
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,240
No problem Wit.

Iím okay.

98
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,360
But the guy I fought isnít,

99
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,000
looks like his arm is broken.

100
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,280
Looks concerning.

101
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,920
Do you want me
to treat you to food in return?

102
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,840
If today is too late,

00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,480
wants you to take this money
and make a fortune.

377
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,480
Cash, 10 million baht.

378
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,160
Do you think
you can persude me with money?

379
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,240
Donít think like that.

380
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,840
This is something you deserve

381
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,240
after the accident.

382
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,160
My nephew died

383
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,280
and this is going to compensate?

384
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,280
Of course it can't compensate.

385
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,720
The life you love is priceless.

386
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,000
But it's better than losing
your nephew.

387
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,760
And you don't get anything back.

388
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,320
fight you take this money

389
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,430
and then live the rest of his life

390
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:06,180
Wouldn't it be better
to be comfortable?

391
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,000
Here is my answer.

392
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,720
Get out.

393
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,920
I hope the best for you Tin.

394
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,000
They have money and power.

395
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,880
You cannot fight that.

396
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,600
How can money and
power get above the truth?

397
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,760
Put it in your head

398
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,440
and go back and tell them.

399
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,200
I will never accept them.

400
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,280
I will bring them to the end.

401
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,360
You will regret it.

402
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,920
Tought you can use money?

403
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,360
Shit how can money and
power get above the right.

404
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,000
Shake my head.

405
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,760
Today I met someone stupid.

406
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,280
Stupid like that

407
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,480
they will die
because of their own stupidity.

408
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,800
(Money Alert)

409
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,360
Hello, my bank account
has something wrong.

410
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,000
Thereís a lot of deposits.

411
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,640
Can you check for vaildity?

412
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,680
Hey! What are you shooting.

413
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,400
Stop taking pictures right now

414
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,200
if not I will call the police.

415
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,520
- Oh
- Stop

416
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,600
Theyíre threating you

417
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,480
Let me tell you.

418
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,480
Taking pictures for what?

419
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,000
Here they come

420
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Everyone, everyone take a picture.

421
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,320
You must have seen the breaking news

422
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:49,160
of a girl who died in a accident

423
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,840
heres the murderer.

424
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,960
What are you talking abour

425
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,280
Tin is not a murderer?

426
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,640
How is she not a murderer

427
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,480
the news are saying that
sheís a drunk.

428
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,000
What does she do on a daily basis?

429
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,400
Not caring for her nephew
to the point until the accident?

430
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,320
Hey!

431
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,440
Right and she opened a bank account
to receive money for the dead.

432
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,000
Smile! Smile

433
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,320
Thatís not true.

434
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,920
We did not open a bank account
to receive any money.

435
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,199
- You have mistaken - Well!

436
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:16,239
Oh someone took a fake account
and pasted the account number.

437
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,840
If not the owner of the account
who will it be

438
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,920
- Thatís not true
- Then tell us the truth.

439
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,360
We did not do it.

440
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,639
Tin Tin Tin want to say anything?

441
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,560
- What  - Hey Hey

442
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,280
Donít Grandma donít

443
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,120
Tin

444
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,920
Tin calm down calm down

445
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,320
Wow, everyone look.

446
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,480
The food at the funeral wasnít enough.

447
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,679
Now here is some force
and drama the work of a murder.

448
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,320
Move

449
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,000
Hey Hey

450
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,600
Go you crazy people
and donít ever come back

451
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:53,040
Iíll leave it here.
You will be so famous

452
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,120
What happened.

453
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,560
Now, in the social media world,

454
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,360
there are people spreading
the news that

455
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,480
Tin is being drunk prone
to violence and

456
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,040
don't care about Ton Khaw

457
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,720
Then it's important
There is also a account number of Tin.

458
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,680
Post it to ask for donations as well.

459
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:19,040
How did this happened.

460
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,640
Iím so confused.

461
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,200
I never thought people
would be this horrible.

462
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,440
You put me to do bad.
I never did any harm to my nephew

463
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,360
What did you say. I wasnít listening.

464
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,960
Tin wait up.

465
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,960
Hey

466
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,640
Did you miss me that much.

467
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,640
Youíre horrible

468
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,800
I agree
Iím horrible thatís my nickname

469
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,400
You made me go bad.

470
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,480
Did you take my bank account number
to make an account for donations?

471
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,240
Nowadays, they trade a lot online.

472
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,920
Click twice and you'll find it.

473
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,600
Tin,

474
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,520
I already told you, right?
You can't fight.

475
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,800
You take the money and end this story.

476
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,880
Bitch

477
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,360
You know,

478
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,480
the fact that
you broke into my office and

479
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,240
attacked me

480
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,400
gave me an opportunity to shoot youÖ

481
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,320
but I didn't,

482
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,920
you see,
I'm a better person than you think.

483
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,080
When you're angry

484
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,120
You look hotter than ever.

485
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,040
This is why

486
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,920
it is all about money.

487
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,800
You are a horrible person
because of money?

488
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,520
It's not just money.

489
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,000
I like money like having power

490
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,880
Life without these two things

491
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,280
I've seen it before. Damn it sucks.

492
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,520
It's about me. Never mind.

493
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,760
I think

494
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,320
let's talk about you.

495
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,120
I donít have anything
to talk to you about anymore.

496
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,920
Tin,

497
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,440
what I did was still very light.

498
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,520
If compared to
what Thanatthep would do

499
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,560
If you haven't stopped pursuing this,

500
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,960
trust me,

501
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,040
take the money.

502
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,800
You can summon

503
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,200
as much as you want.

504
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,200
Thanatthep
is willing to give you anything.

505
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,560
How can you..

506
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,040
Do this kind of thing with your face.

507
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,560
You're a lawyer,

508
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,400
you know the law,
you should be on the side of justice.

509
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,120
Help people in need.

510
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,560
In the past, I used to think like you.

511
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,160
fight against injustice

512
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,200
protect the weak

513
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,320
but in fact, I realized that

514
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,080
I'm just a cute little lawyer.

515
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,120
How am I going to change the world?

516
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,480
This world is full of wickedness.

517
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,000
We just must let it spin.

518
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,400
Even though
this world is filled with iniquity

519
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,040
We don't need to follow evil.

520
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,120
This is my way of helping people.

521
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,680
I am a bridge for the lost

522
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,040
to support compensation
with those who have power.

523
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,000
No one has to die again.

524
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,880
This is the softest way.

525
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,640
But it's not the right way.

526
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,040
You go tell Mr.

527
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,600
I didn't want
a single penny of their money.

528
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,280
I want Tanthai pay homage
to my nephew's corpse

529
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:15,000
and apologized
with sincere guilt of it

530
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,680
I really like your quirk.

531
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,640
It's honest

532
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,280
and cute,

533
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,800
but those people can't apologize.

534
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,200
You won't get what you hoped for.

535
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,280
The only thing
you can expect from them

536
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,200
is money.

537
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,080
Then we'll meet in court.

538
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,880
No matter what bad methods you use.

539
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,680
You remember,

540
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,160
I'm not afraid of you.

541
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,080
I have to thank you very much.

542
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,160
That now makes that side

543
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,960
condemned by social media.

544
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,200
Supporters are diminishing every time.

545
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,560
I think soon

546
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,520
they must have accept our offer.

547
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,640
No, even if there is no support

548
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,400
But I know that someone like Tin.

549
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,560
Tin certainly wouldn't stop easily.

550
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,560
Also I came today

551
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,040
because I want to discuss
the case with Mr. Tanthai.

552
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,880
Are you going to talk to Tanthai?

553
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,960
Yes,

554
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,400
since the case
I havenít talked to Tanthai ever.

555
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,680
I have to talk to him
to discuss all the details

556
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,800
small or little

557
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,640
so I can help it effectively.

558
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,800
I think you shouldnít

559
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,200
because TanThai has suffered enough

560
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,360
from that incident ranging

561
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,760
from society barging on him.

562
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,720
I donít want him to interfere
with this matter anymore.

563
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,000
But..

564
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:21,000
Letís just close this case quickly
before the court does.

565
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,920
If you have any questions only
come to me

566
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,520
and I will answer them.

567
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,840
Tanathettep looks odd Yan

568
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,760
I donít know what heís thinking about

569
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,840
Do they have a meeting about
lower class people today?

570
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,440
I came to talk to him.

571
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,480
This is why I asked you

572
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,640
if they are having a meeting about
the lower class people today?

573
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,200
Thatís good that I saw you.

574
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,240
Please go to my office.

575
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,720
I want to talk about the case.

576
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,640
Talk about what.

577
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,520
I am sorry I donít want to bother.

578
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,800
Itís not my specification

579
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,960
Talk about the car accident.

580
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,840
The accident that
got the whole world cursing at you.

581
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,200
My dad didnít tell you

582
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,080
I canít talk about this situation?

583
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,040
My client
is not your father, it's you,

584
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:51,160
if you want to talk.
No one can stop you.

585
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,480
By the way,

586
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,080
do you want to talk to me for a bit?

587
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,440
What exactly happened that day, huh?

588
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,080
Tanthai

589
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,200
Methee will take you home

590
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,200
Okay

591
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,960
The whole situation is not like
what you think

592
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,280
We should head going Tanthai

593
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,440
I told you already not
to talk to my son.

594
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,080
Why?

595
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,080
or is the situation more than
an accident?

596
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,920
What does this mean?

597
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,800
(From today on Tanthai's case,
the party's lawyers will take over, )

598
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,960
(and your wages can be sent to me.
I'll handle it.)

599
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,320
It means exactly that

600
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,600
Are you upset that
I talked to Tanthai the other day?

601
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,440
I told you

602
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,040
I do not like people

603
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,320
who disobey my requests.

604
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,800
I'm really stubborn.

605
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,760
And a stubborn person like me

606
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:11,080
When you want to know
what I need to know

607
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:14,200
Like now that I'm curious.

608
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,280
Talk to Tanthai, what are you hiding?

609
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,240
Yan

610
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,040
Allow me to excuse myself

611
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,000
Where are you going

612
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,480
What is it with you?

613
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,720
Do you want to die

614
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,920
Anything that is not about
you donít come and be noisy.

615
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,360
Yan

616
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,240
Oh Vit

617
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,000
What's wrong with you?

618
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,520
I saw Mr. Yan come in for
a long time not going out for a while

619
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,720
So I came to see.

620
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,360
Huh, Vit,

621
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,160
they are the people of Tanathettep.

622
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,160
The point of
sending people to train me

623
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,480
It's exactly what I thought.

624
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,760
This was definitely not
an ordinary child car accident.

625
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,840
Now this is getting
interesting and fun.

626
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,880
Mr Police.
Whatís the status of my case.

627
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,640
Itís been taking a while.

628
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,560
I havenít seen any progress.

629
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,160
Just be patient with us please.

630
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,760
Patient?

631
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:40,800
The person doing the wrong thing
can float around outside as usual.

632
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,880
If there is a police then it can't do
anything, why would it be there?

633
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,560
Watch your word

634
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,120
Because the offender is
the politicanís son right?

635
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,600
So you donít dare do anything to them?

636
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,440
Hear you are, talking like this.

637
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:58,750
Be careful that you will be charged
by disrespecting the staff

638
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:01,200
Would you like to sleep
in a cell for a night?

639
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,440
The police will contact you later.

640
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,560
Quit now, disturb others.

641
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,360
Shitty Police canít do anything right.

642
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,000
Sister, Iím going to leave it here.

643
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,160
Yes, okay

644
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:45,240
What was that?

645
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,280
Sorry

646
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:50,120
Wait wait wait

647
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,120
This is the person
on the news right here.

648
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,400
Take donations from yards
to drink alcohol like this.

649
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,480
I really respect you.

650
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,880
Damn the worst

651
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,200
Give me the donation money!!

652
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,480
What did you say?

653
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,280
Give me it

654
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,920
This side has money and power.

655
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,480
You cannot fight them

656
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:07,280
Wake up Ton Khaw wake up to auntie

657
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,600
Oh I think so

658
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:23,200
Kill me Kill me Kill me

659
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:26,120
Do it Kill me

660
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,480
Letís go drink

661
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,280
Yesterday you were drunk

662
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,640
So I brought you back here

663
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,640
And then after that Ö

664
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,640
This is your work right ?

665
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,160
How could I do that to you

666
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:16,840
Last night we were together the whole night

667
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,360
The case for your niece

668
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,240
It might have not been an accident

669
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,480
Help me please

670
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:23,520
Okay

671
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,100
Will you come ?
