[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,650
Have you got the evidence?

3
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:02,730
Yes.

4
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,160
Thatthep is the jerk who drove the car and hit Tonkhao.

5
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,430
You said you would negotiate with Senator Thatthep.

6
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:11,360
Don't do that.

7
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,990
I've made up my mind.

8
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,990
So I'm asking you to do me a favor.

9
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,020
What favor?

10
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,840
Dad, please don't hurt Thee.

11
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:20,560
I hit him just now.

12
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,020
And now you are crying and said you would always obey me.

13
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,460
So I've been

14
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,340
messing with the wrong guy, right?

15
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,890
You really love him, don't you?

16
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,900
I'll do anything you ask me to do.

17
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,440
-Charn.
-No.

18
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,820
-Stop. Stop.
-Charn.

19
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:40,880
Charn, what are you going to do?

20
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,580
-Charn.
-Charn's going to negotiate with Thatthep.

21
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,880
Nawin will send you home in two days.

22
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:46,780
Let's go.

23
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:48,730
Charn, don't go!

24
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,380
Let me go.

25
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,200
Charn.

26
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,140
Did anyone say

27
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,190
when a person is dying,

28
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,770
all his or her memories will come into mind?

29
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,009
Why are my memories all about you?

30
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,070
I lost to you, Mom.

31
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,310
I can't believe I lost to you.

32
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,360
Whatever happens,

33
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,360
please bless me wish me success.

34
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,570
Have you made all the preparations?

35
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,700
We're doing it.

36
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:27,590
That's it for now. Maya will come back for livestream tonight.

37
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,190
Don't forget to follow all my platforms.

38
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,240
I'll post the link later.

39
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,240
But let me tell you a secret today.

40
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,240
Don't miss anything that will happen tonight.

41
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,120
I will not only sing songs for you.

42
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,020
I've also prepared a rare gift.

43
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,070
See you at nine tonight.

44
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,760
It's okay now.

45
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,010
Follow the plan.

46
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,130
Open the door!

47
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,560
Why aren't you shouting?

48
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,220
No matter how loud you shout, I won't open the door.

49
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:19,890
You lunatic.

50
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,500
If you don't set me free, go and help Charn.

51
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,720
He's in danger now.

52
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:28,280
What danger?

53
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,990
He was lying to you. Do you still believe him?

54
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,400
Let me tell you.

55
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,710
As his ex,

56
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:40,970
I can tell you what kind of person Charn is.

57
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,820
He's cold-blooded, cruel and dangerous.

58
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,140
But he's cute too.

59
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,440
That's why I love him.

60
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,920
You won't understand.

61
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,030
People like you won't know him better than I do.

62
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,470
It's you who don't know about him.

63
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,740
Otherwise, he wouldn't have dumped you.

64
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,240
You idiot.

65
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,110
-Beat him!
-Come on!

66
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,400
Kill him!

67
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,690
Kill him!

68
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:18,940
You bastard.

69
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,240
If you win,

70
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,240
I'll let you go and see Charn.

71
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,990
Don't just sneak up on me, idiot!

72
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:43,990
Why did you dodge?

73
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,990
Beat him! Beat him!

74
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,940
Boss.

75
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,240
You're awesome.

76
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,990
Look at yourself in the mirror.

77
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,780
What makes you think you're good enough for Charn?

78
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,990
You're poor and weak.

79
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,780
Yes.

80
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,070
Who do you think you are?

81
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,070
What makes you think you can change him?

82
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,070
Boss.

83
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,440
He'll never fall in love with you.

84
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,030
Boss, you're awesome!

85
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,780
You're awesome.

86
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,070
Useless.

87
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,990
-Stand up.
-Yeah.

88
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,780
Think about it.

89
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,940
You loser!

90
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,240
One.

91
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,740
Two.

92
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,070
Three.

93
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,320
Four.

94
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,690
Five.

95
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,990
Six.

96
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,320
Seven.

97
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,360
Eight.

98
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,650
He stood up.

99
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,240
Start.

100
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,280
He can't make it.

101
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,740
It's you who don't know about him.

102
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,740
Hey.

103
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,440
I've never tried to change him.

104
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,990
Even if he is out of my league,

105
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,280
even if he doesn't love me,

106
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,990
even if he lied to me,

107
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,990
I still have to go and help him.

108
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,240
I must protect Charn.

109
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,820
-Boss!
-Boss!

110
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,400
Thank you for lending me your motorbike.

You bastard!

112
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,070
I hope you fall from the motorbike and die.

113
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,320
Why are you doing?

114
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,150
Curse him! Curse him!

115
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:53,070
Curse Tin.

116
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,570
Fall and die.

117
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:59,570
-Fall and die.
-Curse Tin.

118
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,510
Are you okay?

119
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,130
Oh, he's fine.

120
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,190
Okay.

[Bangkok-New York Business Class]

122
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,900
Let go of me!

123
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,990
Max, Yout.

124
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,510
Untie me now.

125
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,260
It's too late.

126
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,970
It's almost 9 p.m. Young Master is on the plane now.

127
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,130
God.

128
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,570
Give me some water.

129
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,640
I'm thirsty.

130
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,120
How can I drink in this way? I'm tied up.

Thee! Stop!

133
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,860
Stop!

134
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,690
You...

135
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,230
Are you looking for Charn?

136
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,390
Yes, is he here?

137
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:52,960
No.

138
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,150
Where is he?

139
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,800
Help me first.

140
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,190
Then I'll tell you where they might go.

141
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,030
Tell me where Charn is.

142
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,500
The warehouse where your niece was hit.

Young Master.

144
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,760
I must have been influenced by your character which is like a crazy puppy.

145
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,220
We're here to negotiate.

146
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,830
Do you really need to bring these people?

147
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,320
If you didn't set a trap for me,

148
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:05,660
you don't have to be afraid.

149
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,840
Where's the doll?

150
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,740
Maya, sing a song for us.

151
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,740
I'll sing it for you later.

152

But I've got something more special to show you. Please wait.

153
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,660
Let's wait together for some time, okay?

154
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:33,510
Should we start now?

155
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:34,860
Wait.

156
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,440
We need to wait for Charn's evidence.

157
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,200
Everyone.

158
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,010
Let me tell you,

159
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,030
if you plan to kill me like you killed the reporter,

160
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,100
things will get more complicated.

161
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,440
So,

162
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,740
you've prepared a Plan B.

163
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,580
Just in case.

164
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,560
I've put the documents in different places,

165
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,590
written down your stories,

166
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,990
and made copies of the audio.

167
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,530
And I have to insert the password every 24 hours.

168
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,020
Otherwise, those documents will be automatically sent to the police,

169
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,260
the reporters,

170
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,670
and your enemies.

171
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,380
That's a perfect plan.

172
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,110
How much money do you want?

173
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,510
Money? I've got a lot of money.

174
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,110
I want to work for you.

175
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,900
If you have my help, you won't have to

176
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,230
worry about the illegal matters you are involved in.

177
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,410
Then you'll be able to further your political career.

178
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:47,300
You mean

179
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,600
you want to take advantage of my power

180
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,340
and get benefits from me forever?

181
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,830
Yes. It's a win-win situation.

182
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,270
If that happens, you won't lose anything.

183
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,460
Deal.

184
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,760
I like you. You're smart.

185
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,770
But today,

186
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,200
the thing about that girl

187
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,380
has to be over.

188
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,950

193
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:32,230
But before that, you have to tell me what happened that night

194
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,040
so that I can come up with a good plan.

195
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,310

I want to know

201
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,480
why you didn't

202
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,330
throw away Tonkhao's body after you hit her.

203
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,480
Why did you make your son your scapegoat?

204
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:21,890
It's different.

205
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,600
That reporter was too greedy

206
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,690
and had many enemies.

207
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,320
They won't discover me.

208
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,390
But I didn't know who the child was

209
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:36,500
and if she got missing, her family would look for her.

210
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,920
There were cameras on the road.

211
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,160
The car I was driving was caught by the cameras.

212
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:49,290
That car was your son's car too? You asked him to be your scapegoat?

213
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,200
Yes.

214
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,820

215
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,440

00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:41,760
You can go now. Bye.

377
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:46,830
Are you really okay? Should I stay and take care of you?

378
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:50,110
It will be troublesome if your suture ruptures.

379
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:53,690
Take care of me? You are a taekwondo teacher.

380
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:56,850
You're neither a doctor nor a nurse.

381
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,500
You were in the hospital for so many days.

382
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,080
I miss you so much.

383
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,520
Now we can have a good chat.

384
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:08,910
Miss me? You can call me if you want to chat with me.

385
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:13,690
It's not just chatting. We can do something else.

386
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,410
What?

387
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:17,820
I can do

388
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:19,730

389
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,130
Wow.

390
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:39,350
Clean the windows after you're done with the bathroom.

391
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,970
Do it quickly. I'll wait for you while taking a shower.

392

You really don't know?

Are you going to pawn the ring?

412
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,910
You're so mean.

413
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,730
I've been planning this for a long time.

414
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,470
Marry me, Charn.

415
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:51,030
But there's no law

416
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:52,860
that admits same-sex marriage.

417
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,060
Even if there isn't any now,

418
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,230
there will be one day.

419
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:01,320
The world moves forward. No one can stop it, Charn.

420
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,960
The more people refuse it,

421
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,360
the sooner should we get married.

422
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,390
We should let everyone know about this,

423
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:13,130
so they will know that they have no right to stop those who are in love.

424
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:14,700
Hey.

425
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,240
I don't want to romanticize marriage equality.

426
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,320
This isn't just about love.

427
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,690
It's related to many legal rights.

428
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:28,770
People should have equal rights.

429
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,840
Why are you suddenly talking about the law?

430
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:37,480
Are you going to marry me or not?

00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,240
I have many ways that you can't imagine to deal with you.

435
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:14,100
I changed my mind. Give the ring back to me.

Oh.

00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:41,500
♫I can see you in my dreams♫

560
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:46,390
♫I think no one♫

561
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:51,170
♫Is more important than you and I like you♫

562
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:53,960
♫I love you♫

563
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:59,160
♫I can be the person by your side♫

564
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,400
You killed my father.

565
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:19,990
Invincible Sword!

566
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:21,060
You...

567
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:35,640
Let go!

568
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:36,990
No.

569
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:37,870
No?

570
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:42,050
I just let you go.

571
00:52:57,590 --> 00:53:03,570
♫You're my true love I'm willing to give up everything for you♫

572
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:09,070
♫When you look into my eyes, you're the only one who can stop the world♫

573
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:16,770
♫Let us stay together from now on♫

574
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:23,940
♫It may stop your world♫

575
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:27,340
♫Just like me♫

576
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:33,920
♫I'm willing to give my heart♫

577
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:37,610
♫To you♫

578
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:41,930
♫You're the only one I need♫

579
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:47,630
♫I will do everything for you from the bottom of my heart♫

580
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:49,000
I love you.

581
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,610
Bad lawyer.

582
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:54,210
I love you too.

583
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:56,700
Crazy dog.

584
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:13,590
♫This is how I love you♫

585
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:20,330
♫My heart beats only for you♫

586
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:31,950
♫You're the only one I need♫

587
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:42,850
Welcome.

588
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:53,740
Whose is it?

589
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:03,570
My client, Mr. Tae,

590
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:05,360
is accused of raping

591
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,690
Ms. Teuy.

592
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:08,150
It's not true.

593
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:11,940
She is obsessed with celebrities.

594
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:13,530
She called many times to threaten my client,

595
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:15,530
demanding to have sex with my client.

596
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:17,440
She was refused and she couldn't accept it.

597
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:21,150
So, she spread rumors to ruin your client's reputation.

598
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:24,110
It's true, friends from the media.

599
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:27,070
She's been threatening me.

600
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,800
Now your fans are your baits.

601
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:32,690
And they almost committed suicide.

602
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:34,980
Who are the ones being threatened?

603
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:44,720
I once took care of this case.

604
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:47,760
I heard there's a press conference today.

605
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,050
So, I came to introduce myself

606
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:52,700
before going to court.

607
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:55,220
We're in trouble now.

608
00:56:58,430 --> 00:57:00,430
I have sufficient evidence.

609
00:57:01,110 --> 00:57:02,780
I promise

610
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,700
it'll be more fun than what you're playing now.

611
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,440
Go take a shower.

612
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:21,340
Let's eat first.

613
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:27,910
How is the case?

614
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:29,970
Just wait and see.

615
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,900
I'm going to put a celebrity in jail.

616
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:38,070
Thank you for handling this case.

617
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:41,370
That girl must be happy to have your help.

618
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:44,710
But I'll also have rich clients.

619
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:48,490
Because I need to make a living. I'm not in a charity.

620
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,130
I know.

621
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:54,930
We're not machines. We can't change immediately by hitting a button.

622
00:57:57,070 --> 00:58:00,810
If you don't kick people when they're down and don't be mean to others,

623
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:03,530
and become a little kinder,

624
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:06,600
then it's enough for me.

625
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,950
Actually, I'm happy doing this.

626
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:17,010
But our world is sick. It's still as cruel as ever.

627
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:21,660
As long as we don't go adrift.

628
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:28,750
I love you.

629
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:35,940
I love you more.

630
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:46,530
Hello.

631
00:58:47,930 --> 00:58:49,290
Someone from the office called.

632
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:53,350
The files for tomorrow's case?

633
00:58:54,290 --> 00:58:55,380
Have you searched everywhere?

634
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:59,360
Try again.

635
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:01,680
The second floor.

636
00:59:03,090 --> 00:59:04,390
Have you searched the second floor?

637
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:08,700
Hello.

638
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:11,000
I'm Mr. Charn's husband.

639
00:59:12,030 --> 00:59:13,370
Call him tomorrow.

640
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:15,170
Don't call him today.

641
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:18,520
What are you doing?

642
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:22,070
Don't you know? You are off work now.

643
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,630
Next is our family time.

644
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:33,240
♫I don't ask you to love me♫

645
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:36,740
♫I just want you to be safe♫

646
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:40,190
♫No matter what bad things have happened♫

647
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:44,000
♫I hope you can meet love♫

648
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:50,210
♫I'll take care of you until the sky lights up again♫

649
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:54,290
♫No matter what happens♫

650
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:57,830
♫I choose to be with you♫

651
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:04,330
♫When no one is with you♫

652
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:03,700
[The End]

653
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:15,190
♫I'll always be by your side♫
