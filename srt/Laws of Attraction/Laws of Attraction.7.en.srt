1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Do you know how much I had to pay

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:04,010
to cover up the real cause
of Chan's office fire?

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,730
I will not make mistakes again.

4
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:07,430
Do you still think

5
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:08,990
that there will be next time?

6
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,190
-I know how to find Chan.
-Shut up!

7
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,120
Get lost and don't let me
see your face again.

8
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,950
You are such a dumbass.

9
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,730
That's why you could
only be Chan's servant.

10
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,510
You don't want to be here,

11
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,400
so let's go on a vacation.

12
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,510
-But my dad doesn't allow me to.
-Don't think about other things.

13
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,690
Just take a vacation to clear your head
and come back later.

14
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,540
What about Tan? Any updates about him?

15
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:30,080
Nothing yet, sir.

16
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,370
My son is such a pain.

17
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:33,540
He never stops causing problems.

18
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,470
Here, Mr. Tinn.

19
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,620
Actually, it can record sounds.

20
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,080
But it's broken.

21
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,800
We can find a way to fix it later.

22
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,010
Thank you for everything.

23
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,280
If it weren't for you,
we wouldn't have this as evidence.

24
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,590
I think we need to talk.

25
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,680
Tell me where.

26
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,979
Here you go.

27
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,960
-Thank you.
-Drive safely.

28
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:02,210
(I'm going back to Bangkok.
See you soon.)

29
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,740
(I'll be waiting.
Do not forget that plushie.)

30
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,960
The formula for the area of a rhombus

31
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:43,650
is height times base.

32
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,350
The formula for the area of a rhombus

33
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,980
is height times base.

34
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:09,600
You think I'm just bluffing?

35
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,090
Calm down.

36
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,110
I think we can talk this out.

37
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,579
If you think I'm just bluffing,

38
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,820
tonight, you can read
about MP Thattep and

39
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,860
the highway bribery scheme on the news.

40
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:29,070
I'll dig up everything
and expose everyone involved.

41
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,530
How much do you want?

42
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,950
Ten million.

43
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,090
No.

44
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,230
This is big.

45
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,750
I think it has to be 50 million.

46
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,030
I think your rival parties
are probably willing to pay

47
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,060
if they know I have evidence.

48
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,190
She saw that we killed Mana.

49
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,100
Hey, kid.

50
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,300
Please calm down.

51
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,610
We're just filming a drama.

52
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,300
Help!

53
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:13,760
Great-Grandma! Uncle Tinn! Help me!

54
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,839
Uncle Tinn!

55
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:19,720
Great-Grandma!

56
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,170
Help!

57
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,950
Thattep.

58
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,950
You son of a bitch.

59
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,590
Sir, you should leave.

60
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,060
I'll take care of it here.

61
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,360
We ran a red light on the way here.

62
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,540
A camera must have caught the car.

63
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,240
Everyone knows this cars belongs to Tan.

64
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,540
So what should we do, sir?

65
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You take care of
that reporter's body quickly.

66
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,390
Then call Maetee

67
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:36,060
and tell him to bring Tanthai here.

68
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,090
Yes, sir.

69
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:46,230
What's going on, Dad?

70
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,260
Why did you take my car?

71
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,290
People are criticizing Mr. Tanthai
badly on social media.

72
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,400
And some feel sorry for you
for having a son like this.

73
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,660
As for the reporter,
no one questioned anything.

74
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,680
You, don't do anything.

75
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,110
I'll take care of it.

76
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,550
There's one more thing, sir.

77
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,890
My niece has this kind of plushie
hanging on her bag too.

78
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,680
It can record sounds.

79
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,030
What did you say?

80
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,430
I think that girl recorded it, sir.

81
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,210
You're dead.

82
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,820
You kidnapped me.

83
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,570
And you did this.

84
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:59,130
If my dad knows, he's gonna kill you.

85
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,300
I didn't kidnap you.

86
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,430
You willingly ran off with me.

87
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,110
You dared to say that?

88
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,190
Wait and see. I'll tell my dad

89
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,800
that you harassed me.

90
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,750
You're dead.

91
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,560
Then, can I choose the way I die?

92
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,090
How?

93
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,790
Well.

94
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,470
I want to be tired to death.

95
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,520
Tee, don't.

96
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,630
No, don't.

97
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:33,800
Don't do this.

98
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,390
It's creepy.

99
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,380
Chan, are you okay?

100
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,920
Why the hell did you drive like that?

101
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,020
Wit.

102
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,780
Are you happy that I'm alive?

103
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,340
How did you find me?

104
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,780
I guess you put a GPS tracker on my car.

105
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,250
Did Thattep send you?

106
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,440
MP Thattep, that son of a bitch.

107
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,900
He kicked me out even though
I went as fas as to betray you.

108
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,030
And almost got burned to death.

109
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,610
Everything

110
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,410
was all because of you, Chan.

111
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:43,740
Wit.

112
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,600
You know what?

113
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,550
Thattep has just agreed to work with me.

114
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,620
That's not true.

115
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,310
Wit.

116
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,050
Who do you think he'll choose?

117
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,410
Between me and you?

118
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,840
Do you want to be
on the same level with me?

119
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,510
Or do you want to be like me?

120
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,970
You know that's impossible.

121
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,360
There's no one better than Chan.

122
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,550
There'll be.

123
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,240
Because Chan is about to die.

124
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,780
Chan!

125
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,660
A church?

126
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,780
You're awake?

127
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,320
Who are you?

128
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,630
Mr. Lawyer, you can't remember me?

129
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,130
Pai.

130
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:08,000
Are you Pai? Did you help me?

131
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,890
Yes.

132
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,590
I saw you at the Walking Street.

133
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,960
But, at first,
I wasn't sure if it's really you.

134
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,240
So I followed you.

135
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,820
I didn't know you're good at music too.

136
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,490
I thought you're only good
at using your strength.

137
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:24,100
Jeez. Here.
Stop saying that and eat this.

138
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,370
Mr. Lawyer.

139
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,970
Then I saw that

140
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,420
you were being attacked.

141
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,420
Chan!

142
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,630
Chan.

143
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,830
At first,

144
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,120
I was going to take you to the hospital,

145
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,750
but I don't know
who the person who hurt you is.

146
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,160
So I was afraid they might
come back to hurt you agian.

147
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,460
So I brought you here

148
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,620
and asked someone at the health station
to treat your wound.

149
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:27,190
They said you're okay now.

150
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,280
Thank you, Pai.

151
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,600
Well.

152
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,130
It's been ages. How are you?

153
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,380
I'm good.

154
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,740
I work for this church now,

155
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,600
and also got a scholarship.

156
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,850
Mr. Lawyer.

157
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,850
About that back then...

158
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,990
Not everyone agreed with the Headman.

159
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,850
Some of the villagers

160
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,230
tried to help you.

161
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,060
But the Headman

162
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,260
and the capitalist
stopped them in every way.

163
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,970
I thought they'd bought everyone off.

164
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,800
Many of them wanted to help you.

165
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,140
We tried to find you and Auntie,

166
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,830
but we couldn't.

167
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,600
And after that,

168
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,210
those who disagreed with them

169
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,870
were almost all eliminated.

170
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,800
You mean

171
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,150
there're still people were willing to
fight the tycoon and Headman to death.

172
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:51,850
Yes.

173
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,710
And everyone is sorry
about what happened to you.

174
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,040
If they were still alive,

175
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,800
they would want to thank you,
just like I do.

176
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,590
I even forgot

177
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,230
that I once helped you.

178
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,200
Never thought you'd be the one
to come back and help me.

179
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,190
-(Sign the petition)
-How is it going, Chan?

180
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,810
Nobody wants to help us.

181
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,820
Nobody wants to risk it
with that tycoon.

182
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,350
Did I...

183
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,130
bring you here into trouble?

184
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:47,940
Not at all, Chan.

185
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,640
I'm proud of you.

186
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,360
Don't be discouraged.

187
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,800
Mom, I can't help feeling that way.

188
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,040
We're trying so hard to help them,

189
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,380
not even knowing if
we'll get anything in return.

190
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,750
You'll feel peace at heart, I guess.

191
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,570
It sounds ideal, right?

192
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:13,850
Honestly, Chan,

193
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:15,920
I also don't know

194
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,660
if what we do

195
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,720
will get us anything in return.

196
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,740
But it's because we don't know.

197
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,310
That's why we should treat others well.

198
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,210
At least,

199
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,530
if one day it gives something
back to us in return,

200
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,380
it'll be something good for us.

201
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,050
But if it doesn't give
anything good back to us,

202
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,170
it means

203
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,050
we'll have to take a loss, then?

204
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,200
I guess.

205
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,960
We'll just have to wait and see.

206
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,430
Do you wanna bet?

207
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,440
If what we do comes back to us,

208
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,890
whoever loses has to buy
a can of coffee for the other.

209
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,960
Just one can?

210
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,620
One is enough.

211
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:56,950
Promise?

212
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,350
-Promise me first.
-Okay.

213
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,930
You can do it. Hang in there.

214
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,300
-Let me help.
-Thank you, Mom.

215
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,250
I guess I lost, Mom.

216
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:12,650
Damn it.

217
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,720
Someone like me, losing?

218
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,079
Chan.

219
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,940
Are you all right, Chan? Do you know
how much I worried about you?

220
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,130
I'm fine.

221
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,340
They hunted me down.

222
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,260
By the way, how did you get here?

223
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,980
I told him to come here.

224
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,260
When Pai told me you were attacked,

225
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,030
I was so scared, Chan.

226
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I thought I'd never
get to see you again.

227
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:25,710
After Wit, I don't know

228
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,370
who else Thattep is going to send.

229
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,760
I'm going to ask my old friend
to help protect us.

230
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,870
-Hello, Mr. Chan.
-Please let me help.

231
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,190
Pleased to meet you.

232
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,680
Welcome.

233
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,500
Son of a bitch!

234
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,230
Who do you think you are?

235
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,510
How dare you steal my money, huh?

236
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,360
I'll let Mr. Nawin know you're here.

237
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,650
Chan, who are these people?

238
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,980
Chan.

239
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,890
-Hey, you! Go shut him up! Now!
-Yes, sir.

240
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,440
Sorry for that, Chan.

241
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,330
I'm having a little problem
with my accountant.

242
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,510
There he goes.

243
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,310
Chan.

244
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:12,580
I've missed you so much.

245
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,790
Wait

246
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,050
Oh, sorry.

247
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,520
Who the hell are you?

248
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,860
How come you're in my house?

249
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,100
He came with me, Nawin.

250
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:35,370
Tinn, this is Nawin, my old friend.

251
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,580
Nawin, this is Tinn.

252
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,710
Whatever, Chan.

253
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,330
Chan.

254
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,000
It's great that you're here.

255
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,640
You know what?
I have something to show you.

256
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,760
Do you want to see it?

257
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,470
Here.

258
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,830
(Yan)

259
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:05,530
How's it? I got your name tattooed, so
I can feel like you're always with me.

260
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,180
Well, it's just that...

261
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,570
It's misspelled.

262
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,050
It's misspelled.
This way, it's pronounced Yan.

263
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:19,590
Yan.

264
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,030
Damn it! You!

265
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,290
You!

266
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,460
Why didn't you tell me?

267
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,330
You know I'm not good at Thai.

268
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:38,280
Hey, hey, hey, you! You!

269
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:41,080
You little dog. Are you laughing at me?

270
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,100
Let go.

271
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,930
Tinn.

272
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,400
Are you okay?

273
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,150
What are you thinking bringing me here
to your ex's place?

274
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:23,590
I have no choice, Tinn.

275
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,400
We're being hunted down.

276
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,560
It's risky if we go
somewhere we don't know.

277
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:29,650
We gotta ask him to help us.

278
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,210
He's powerful in this area.
He can protect you.

279
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,900
Why would I need his protection?

280
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,790
You can't expect me to be okay
about this, Chan.

281
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,330
Tinn.

282
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,080
Don't be jealous. You've already seen
how weird and crazy he is.

283
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,510
You're jealous of a crazy man?

284
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,540
That crazy man is your ex, Chan.

285
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:48,870
Is it this guy?

286
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,640
Your Mr. Ruthless Night of the Horny?

287
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:51,950
Tinn.

288
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,650
Be more reasonable.

289
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:56,300
If you're going to take a time machine
and go back,

290
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,540
wouldn't you have to be jealous
of, like, ten, or twenty people?

291
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,490
I shouldn't have said that.

292
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,400
Tinn.

293
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,320
Sorry for acting like an idiot.

294
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,250
I just...

295
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,920
Never mind.

296
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,930
Just what? Tell me.

297
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,660
It's nothing, Chan.

298
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,830
I won't act like that again.

299
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,640
-I promise.
-No, Tinn.

300
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:13,960
You can say it.

301
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,650
You're mad, jealous,
possessive of me, or...

302
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,280
you want to tell me off.
You can just say it.

303
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:20,310
You don't have to worry
if it's right or wrong.

304
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,850
Just say it,

305
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,710
so we can find a way to fix it.

306
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,170
I...

307
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:30,340
I feel vulnerable, Chan.

308
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,570
I feel insecure.

309
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,190
Do you understand?

310
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,170
That guy is your ex-boyfriend.

311
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:38,370
It's really over between me and him.

312
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,690
But I feel uneasy, Chan.

313
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,910
Look at his house.

314
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,940
He has money and power.

315
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,620
And you like those two things.

316
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,840
Now look at me.

317
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,730
I don't have anything for you.

318
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,980
Plus, he has known you longer than me.

319
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,020
He knows everything about your past.

320
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,380
He's been through bad things with you.

321
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:09,110
Now that you get to meet him again,
I'm afraid that...

322
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,470
You'll dump me.

323
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,480
You're afraid of being dumped that much?

324
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,050
Of course.
I shouldn't have fallen for you.

325
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:28,990
You're so cute.
Who would be able to dump you?

326
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,070
-Really?
-Yeah.

327
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,880
But part of what you said is true.

328
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:39,330
You are no match for Nawin in anything.

329
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,440
He has money and power, so you're just

330
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:43,940
a total loser compared to him.

331
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,220
But there's one thing
that you can beat him at.

332
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,190
What?

333
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,460
You won my heart.

334
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,790
Now, that's comforting.

335
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,080
But I guess that's the only thing

336
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,100
I'm better at than your
Mr. Ruthless Night of the Horny.

337
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,930
Now that you mentioned it,
there's one more thing

338
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,940
you can beat him at.

339
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,080
What is it?

340
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,080
It's...

341
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,100
the Ruthless Night of the Horny.

342
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,400
You're way more ruthless than him.

343
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:26,410
I'm relieved hearing that.

344
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,170
Chan.

345
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:56,190
Do you really want to do this?

346
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,030
Ah!

347
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,470
You little dog!

348
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,180
Why did Chan adopt you?

349
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,630
-I want to beat you up.
-Hey.

350
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,320
We have a deal.

351
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,580
What deal did you make with him?

352
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,320
The deal is that you're my boyfriend,

353
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:28,460
so he'll stay away from you.

354
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,760
All clear, you can be 100% sure
no old flame will reignite.

355
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,930
And when are we going back to Bangkok
to get Ton Khaw's plushie fixed?

356
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,900
So we'll finally know what's in there.

357
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:43,070
If it's the evidence
that can convict Thattep,

358
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,240
we can quickly proceed.

359
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,700
Tomorrow, Nawin will
have someone take us there.

360
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,170
That's good.

361
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,360
I don't want to stay here for long.

362
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,160
Chan.

363
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,380
Where have you been?

364
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,010
I couldn't reach you. I was so worried.

365
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,690
I'm safe. I'm at Nawin's house.

366
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,140
You're with that idiot?

367
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,580
What about Tinn?

368
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:15,580
He's here with me too.

369
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,260
Well, aren't they
going to kill each other?

370
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,820
They're totally going to.

371
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:21,930
They tried to punch each other
in the mouth every time.

372
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,910
You're so irritating.

373
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,290
Oh, right.

374
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,460
Have you found the evidence?

375
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,080
I have.

376
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,340
That son of a bitch Thattep
was the one who hit Ton Khaw,

377
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,050
because she saw him kill a reporter.

378
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:42,070
That evil son of a bitch.

379
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,760
Chan.

380
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:50,460
About the thing you said
that you'll make a deal with MP Thattep,

381
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,380
don't do it.

382
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,680
Tinn will not forgive you.

383
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,040
I've thought it through.

384
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,110
That's why I want your help.

385
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:00,810
With what?

386
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:03,540
You have to promise me first

387
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:06,240
that when I'm gone,

388
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,610
you'll take care of Grandma and Tinn.

389
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,080
Chan.

390
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,400
What are you planning to do?

391
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,410
I have thought it through.

392
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,000
Just promise me

393
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,660
that you'll help protect them
if I'm gone.

394
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,670
Okay.

395
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,230
I will.

396
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,290
Now, can you tell me

397
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:31,850
what you're going to do?

398
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,120
What's wrong with you?

399
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,820
Why?

400
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,200
Does there have to be something wrong?

401
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,350
I just want to be clingy to you.

402
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,540
Of course, why not?

403
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,580
By the way,

404
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:25,100
after all this is over, are you free
for, like, three to four days?

405
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,430
I can make time for it.

406
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,690
Why?

407
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,680
I want to take Grandma
to a temple in Udon Thani.

408
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,680
I want you to come with me.

409
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,520
My parents ashes are there.

410
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,470
I want to show off my boyfriend
to my parents.

411
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:41,890
If so,

412
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,250
after we go back to Bangkok,

413
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,520
I'll take you to the temple
to pay homage to my mom.

414
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:47,270
I'll show you off first.

415
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,490
Do I even have anything for you
to show off?

416
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:53,820
You really don't know?

417
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:56,640
You're very hot.

418
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,790
Otherwise, when we first met,

419
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:00,500
I wouldn't have asked for your number.

420
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,930
I really shouldn't have fallen for you.

421
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,480
You know, I tried to stop myself

422
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,830
and stay away from you.

423
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,860
But in the end, I still lost.

424
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,510
I'm the one who lost.

425
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,530
I love you.

426
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,310
I really do love you, Tinn.

427
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,110
I love you too, Chan.

428
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:10,040
Can I have some?

429
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,600
Come here.

430
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,420
I'll feed you.

431
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,340
It's good.

432
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:38,720
Tee.

433
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,610
Hold the camera.

434
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,389
Are you crazy?

435
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:11,179
Why did you put it on Instagram story?

436
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,530
Tee.

437
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,199
Dad.

438
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:27,690
The audacity you have.

439
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:30,070
How dare you step on my toes!

440
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:31,760
What an ungrateful child!

441
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,880
Dad!

442
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:35,670
Dad, please don't hurt him.

443
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,460
I surrender, Dad.

444
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:39,639
I won't disobey you ever again.

445
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:43,800
Tee.

446
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:46,800
You love him so much?

447
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,719
You love him so much?

448
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:52,060
Right? You love him so much?

449
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,820
-Dad! Dad, stop!
-You love him so much?

450
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:58,580
This whole time,

451
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,130
I hit you and hurt you,

452
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:02,950
but you're still stubborn.

453
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,530
You never listened to me.

454
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,800
Now, I'm just
beating him up a little bit,

455
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,450
and you're already begging,
and yielding to me?

456
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,380
Does that mean

457
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:20,360
I've been doing it to the wrong person?

458
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,160
Dad.

459
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,920
Tee.

460
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:29,490
Dad.

461
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:36,970
-Don't do it?
-Dad.

462
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,320
Dad, don't hurt Tee.

463
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,860
I'm sorry.

464
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,150
I surrender.

465
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,180
Whatever you want me to do,
I'll do everything!

466
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,200
I'll do everything!

467
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,810
Please let him go.

468
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,660
Tee.

469
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:55,670
Let me ask you honestly.

470
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,970
Don't you love Tan at all?

471
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,780
You've been hitting him
since he was little.

472
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,720
You ignore him.

473
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,590
He's your son, you know!

474
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,250
Tee.

475
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,330
You think I didn't try to love you?

476
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,650
I tried!

477
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,090
But I couldn't!

478
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:28,270
The first day you're born,

479
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,630
you took the life of the woman
that I love the most.

480
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,450
The doctor said

481
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:39,230
that Mon had preeclampsia,

482
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,940
and if she wanted to keep you,

483
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,680
there's a chance she'd die.

484
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,580
But she chose you.

485
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,830
I... I... I...

486
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:54,930
You killed your mother

487
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:58,280
the day you're born.

488
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,310
That's why I don't want to look at you.

489
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,720
-I'm sorry.
-All I can do

490
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,910
is just to bring you up.

491
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,440
Dad.

492
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:12,950
I'm sorry.

493
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,980
I'm sorry for being born.

494
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:17,490
I'm sorry, Dad.

495
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,800
-Tan. Listen to me, Tan.
-I'm sorry.

496
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,610
It's not your fault.

497
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:24,920
You don't have to be sorry.

498
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:26,400
Don't cry.

499
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:29,580
I promise

500
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,770
I'll take you away from this psycho.

501
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,000
You're still talking?!

502
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,200
(Lawyer Chan)

503
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,940
Hello, Chan.

504
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,150
Where the hell have you been?

505
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,180
Why didn't you come
to the meeting place?

506
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:08,870
I had a little problem.

507
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,420
I'm heading back to Bangkok now.

508
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,970
Don't pull any tricks this time.

509
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,960
Are we meeting at the same warehouse
where it happened?

510
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,930
See you tomorrow.

511
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,390
What the hell?

512
00:38:58,430 --> 00:38:59,510
Chan.

513
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,250
Chan!

514
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,050
Chan!

515
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,950
Let's go Chan. I'll take you there.

516
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:20,780
Thank you, Nawin.

517
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:24,780
I totally forgot.

518
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,430
Before you go,

519
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,980
I have a little gift for you.

520
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:38,850
Wit.

521
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,470
Is he the one who hurt you?

522
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,760
I just happened to find him.

523
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,980
Chan.

524
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,730
What do you want me to do with him?

525
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:58,570
You had the audacity.

526
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:00,570
How did you dare to touch Chan?!

527
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:04,560
What should I do with you?

528
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,540
Oh, I know now.

529
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,020
I'll cut your hands off.
Hey, get a knife.

530
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,080
-Nawin.
-Yes.

531
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:14,130
Let him go.

532
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:18,180
Thank you, Mr. Chan.

533
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,670
I will not do this again.

534
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:29,850
Wit.

535
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,380
You're like this

536
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,790
partly because of me.

537
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:43,010
I made you think that
life with power and money

538
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,520
is a comfortable life.

539
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:48,320
Actually, it's...

540
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,420
more comfortable than having none,

541
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:54,570
but it's not perfect.

542
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,160
And if you want to be like me,

543
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:08,070
if you use my method,

544
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:12,670
there'll be someone who's ready
to betray you, the way you did to me.

545
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:24,280
Honestly,

546
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,440
I think you should find another way.

547
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,830
Being me is not fun at all.

548
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,910
I understand now.

549
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,990
Hey.

550
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:03,180
Come on, Chan.

551
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:05,490
Let's go.

552
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:08,230
Nawin.

553
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,370
About Tinn...

554
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,080
Oh. Tinn.

555
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,430
That guy.

556
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:20,050
I got it.
I'll lock him up here for two days.

557
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:23,370
And after that, I'll just take him
to the place you told me, right?

558
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,360
And do not hurt him.

559
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,160
Jeez, Chan.

560
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:30,520
Can I kick him one time in the mouth?
Just one time?

561
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:32,210
He always gives me that look
and it gets on my nerves.

562
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,480
-Nawin.
-Yes.

563
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,830
Fine, all right.

564
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,210
I promise.

565
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:43,890
Come on.

566
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,310
Chan!

567
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:54,240
Chan!

568
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:55,270
Chan!

569
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,400
-Don't!
-Stop!

570
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:57,660
Chan!

571
00:42:57,690 --> 00:42:58,900
Let me go!

572
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:00,260
Chan!

573
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:02,310
Chan, what are you doing?

574
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:06,030
Jeez! You!

575
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:08,390
You broke my bed?!

576
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,100
Do you know that I hired

577
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:11,700
a craftsman to custom build it?

578
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:13,280
And he freaking died long ago.

579
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:15,820
Who's going to fix it now?

580
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:17,840
Chan.

581
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:19,130
Where are you going?

582
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:22,350
Do you still have to ask?

583
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:25,330
Of course, Chan's going to
negotiate with Thattep.

584
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,980
Chan.

585
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:32,370
Hey.

586
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:34,390
Hey.

587
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:37,450
Do you really think that he loves you?

588
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:39,590
Let me to you something.

589
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,500
Chan told me

590
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:44,180
that he's going to use
the evidence that he got

591
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:46,460
to extort money out of that MP.

592
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:50,930
You idiot.

593
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:54,860
Is that true, Chan?

594
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,840
You've never stopped
being a fool, have you?

595
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:09,650
Do you really think

596
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:12,380
that I'd love someone like you?

597
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:21,050
Chan.

598
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:25,530
I just used you.

599
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,700
I'm the same person you told me I am.

600
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,330
I trick people. I'm evil. I'm selfish.

601
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,500
And you're just a fool.

602
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,670
I don't believe you.

603
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:43,570
What are you planning to do, Chan?

604
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:46,060
Can you stop being stupid?

605
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:50,170
How many times do I have to tell you?

606
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:53,390
What I'm planning to do

607
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,620
is dumping you.

608
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:01,020
And I will use this plushie
to extort money out of Thattep.

609
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:13,060
Then look at me.

610
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:17,830
Look me in the eye.

611
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:21,630
And tell me that you don't love me.

612
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,360
That you tricked me.

613
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:30,850
Look at me, Chan.

614
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,760
You mad dog.

615
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:48,230
Why the hell do you
have to make it hard?

616
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,880
It's okay, Chan.

617
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:12,720
It's okay.

618
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:17,130
Whatever is bothering you, tell me.
I'll help you.

619
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:21,070
Don't forget that you have me.
You're not alone, Chan.

620
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,550
Think of me sometime, okay?

621
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:13,870
Chan.

622
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:16,170
What are you going to do?

623
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:18,690
Tinn.

624
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:22,140
In two days,
Nawin will send you back home.

625
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,860
Everything will be okay.

626
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:29,050
Trust me.

627
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,430
Let's go, Nawin.

628
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:33,370
Chan, don't go.

629
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,450
Get the hell off me!

630
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,040
Chan!

631
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:38,070
Chan!

632
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:41,550
Chan!

633
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:44,390
Chan, don't go, please. I'm begging you.

634
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:47,500
Chan.

635
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,920
Chan, I'm begging you. Please don't go.

636
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:01,950
I said get off!

637
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:04,920
Get off me!

638
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:10,050
Chan!

639
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,540
Chan!

640
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:19,240
Chan! Chan!

641
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:21,360
Chan!

642
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,850
Let go!

643
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:43,340
Let go of me! I said let go!

644
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,560
Chan!

645
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:50,730
Let go! Let me go!

646
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,330
Chan!

647
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:05,170
Chan!

648
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,590
Chan!

649
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:45,440
Where's the plushie?

650
00:49:45,470 --> 00:49:48,090
Now, I know how I should end this.

651
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:50,340
Hurry up and let me go now.

652
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:51,600
Mr. Tanthai has boarded the plane.

653
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:53,110
Damn it!

654
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:55,390
If you're not going to let me out,
hurry up and go help Chan.

655
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:57,400
He's in danger.

656
00:49:58,570 --> 00:49:59,670
If you can beat me,

657
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:01,330
I'll let you go see Chan.
