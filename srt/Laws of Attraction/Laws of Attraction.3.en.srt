00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,730
I want to talk about the case with you.

3
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:02,870
Didn't I tell you before?

4
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,250
Don't talk to my son.

5
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,320
It's none of your business.

Mind your own business.

7
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,870
I want to help you with your niece's case.

00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:11,410

12

Grandma.

14
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,310
Grandma, are you okay?

15
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,790
I'm fine.

16
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,570
A thief came to our house.

17
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,560
We didn't lose anything.

18
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,380
If he didn't take anything,

19
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:30,660
then why did he break in?

20
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:31,930
Look at this man.

21
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,950
He works for Senator Thatthep.

22
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,990
He sent someone to teach me a lesson.

23
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,200
Look.

24
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,260

00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,280
related to this case.

26
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,660
What exactly do they want?

27
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,070
These are all

28
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,420
Tonkhao's toys and dolls.

29
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,200
Can I take these dolls back?

30
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:54,190
I might have a discovery.

31
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,630
Of course.

We can't do as you say.

58
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,159
Mr. Thatthep ordered us

59
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,290
to stay out of the matter with Tin.

60
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,130
He said he'll take care of it himself.

61
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,380
Idiot.

62
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,330
If he asked you to die,

63
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,600
would you do that too?

If Charn and the others know

72
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:57,260
about the doll,

00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,760

-It was found around 3:03 p.m. -Hello, Grandma.

-The police are investigating the scene. -Oh.

79
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,050
Hello, come in.

80
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,720
I'm here to say goodbye to you with Ploy.

81
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,690
We're moving out tomorrow.

82
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:27,220
I know. Tin told me.

83
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,270
What's wrong, Ploy?

84
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,780
Why do you look so haggard?

85
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,020
You don't want to leave?

86
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,220
She misses Tonkhao.

87
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,170
She cries every night.

88
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:47,159
Ploy,

89
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,690
when you think about Tonkhao,

90
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,310
think of just the good things.

91
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,110
Tonkhao probably hopes that

92
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,560
we only remember her happy moments.

93
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,480
I know, Great Grandma.

94
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,580
Come with me.

95
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,450
I'm going to donate Tonkhao's stuff.

96
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,920
You can choose one as a keepsake.

97
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,340
Thank you, Great Grandma.

98
00:06:58,659 --> 00:06:59,780

99
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,760
Wow.

100
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,820
Your waist got bigger.

101
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,470
How dare you insult me

102
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,760
on my territory?

103
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,910
What crime can I charge you for?

104
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,760
Do you want to sue me?

105
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,370
This is bad,

106
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,830
because the winner

107
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,240
will definitely be me.

108
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,020
Sure, because you're so full of yourself.

109
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,540
So...

110
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,790
Did you get what you were looking for?

111
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,590
No,

112
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,530
but I think that thing

113
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,000
must be very important.

114
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,520
How do you think

115
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,800
my mom would think of me

116
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,230
if she sees me now?

117
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,430
I'm not a spirit.

118
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:58,580
How would I know?

119
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,000
What's wrong?

120
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,090
Why are you suddenly bringing up the past?

121
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,610
It's that fool.

122
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,450
He said he won't use my way

123
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,720
to handle Thatthep.

124
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,800
He insists on staying just,

125
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,150
so his dead niece won't be disappointed in him.

126
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,420
He's too optimistic.

127
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,720
The world is round.

128
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,600
It's not single-sided.

129
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,760
He might be happier

130
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,970
to look at the world in his way.

131
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,480
That's fake happiness.

132
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,850
True happiness

133
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:29,980
should be "ding, ding, ding."

134
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,650
The sound of your phone

135
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,429

136
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,789
like this.

137
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:37,770
If this is what makes you happy,

138
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,570
then why are you angry?

139
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,610
I'm angry because of that fool.

140
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,720
People like Tin

141
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,310
will be trampled down in the end.

142
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,170
I'll show him

143
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,370
how cruel this world is

144
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,260
and how selfish people are.

145
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,670
You

146
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,310
care about Tin.

147
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:03,160
You care about his world

148
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,960
and his thoughts.

149
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,080
Are you sure you can beat him?

150
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,440
I've never lost before.

151
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:19,610
Attention. Relax.

152
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,330
Take a break.

153
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,410
Don't be naughty.

154
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,720
I need to go to the bathroom.

155
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,770
Okay.

156
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,050
Don't run around.

157
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,030
I had fun learning today.

158
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,630
Migi, where did everyone go?

159
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,380
Where did you get the ice cream?

160
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,620
An uncle is giving out ice cream.

161
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,100
He's giving out ice cream?

162
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:10,480
Here.

163
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:17,920
What are you doing?

164
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,400
Grandma said

165
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,400
Tonkhao was close to the kids here.

166
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,170
One chocolate, please.

167
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,570
Hold on.

168
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,450
Chocolate.

169
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,750
-Here. -Thank you.

170
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,010
Where were we?

171
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,400
Grandma said.

172
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,240
Grandma said? Oh.

173
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,510
I just wanted to ask the kids

174
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,410
if Tonkhao gave anyone a doll.

175
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,110
What if it's the doll we're looking for?

176
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,720
One vanilla.

177
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,110
Vanilla?

178
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,540
Thank you.

179
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,220
So?

180
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,130
You're bribing the kid with ice cream?

181
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,220
Yes.

182
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,320
I was so scared

183
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,390
when the kids said an uncle was giving out ice cream.

184
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,950
I thought it was a child trafficker.

185
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,060
Uncle? Uncle?

186
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,700
Uncle, one ice cream with mixed flavors.

187
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,060
None left!

188
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,780
There's more, kid.

189
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,970
I'll make it for you.

190
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,930
Two flavors mixed, right?

191
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,230
The one in the middle.

192
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,740
-Here. -Thank you.

193
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,200
Here.

194
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:38,510
I'm a handsome guy.

195
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,850
If someone calls me uncle again,

196
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,330
I'll take the ice cream back. Got it?

197
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,370
Okay.

198
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,020
Tell your friends.

199
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,630
-Okay? -Yes, Uncle.

200
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,490
Hey, there's no ice cream anymore.

201
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,210
Why are you laughing?

202
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,180
Sit here, kid.

203
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,280
Have you seen

204
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,190
the doll Tonkhao played with?

205
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,990
Have you seen

206
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:17,280
the doll Tonkhao carried around?

207
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,520
Have you seen it?

208
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,600
Or...

209
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,870
Stop. It's okay, kid.

210
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,450
Tin, this is the last student.

211
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,070
If we still can't get the key information,

212
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,940
our efforts will be in vain.

213
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,000
Come, sit here.

214
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,880
Banban.

215
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,410
Have you seen Tonkhao's doll?

216
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,700
Yes.

217
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,430
It's a puppy.

218
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:52,800
A puppy.

219
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,880
There were no dogs

220
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,350
in the dolls that Grandma gave me.

221
00:12:58,530 --> 00:12:59,780
I think this is a lead.

222
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,170
The puppy doll you saw before,

223
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,760
where is it now?

224
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,700
Tonkhao always carries

225
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,810
a very special doll.

226
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,970
How special?

227
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,930
It can say, "Hello, woof."

228
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,110
It can eat

229
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,660
and even light up.

230
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,620
Oh.

231
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,310
This is a child.

232
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,320
Thank you, Banban.

233
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,450
We found nothing in the end.

234
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,230
I'll find a chance

235
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,520
to ask the other kids.

236
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,040
Are you sure

237
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:43,340
that doll is related to the case?

238
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,490
I have a good hunch.

239
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,380
I want to know

240
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:53,230
how you can stay with these kids every day.

241
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,670
They're like little monsters.

242
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,200
Full of themselves,

243
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,820
hard to understand,

244
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,310
and hard to control.

245
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,860
Why are you laughing?

246
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,790
Full of themselves,

247
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,560
hard to control,

248
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,790
and hard to understand?

249
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,880
Yes.

250
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,100
Doesn't that sound familiar?

251
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:18,520
You're saying I'm a kid?

252
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,570
I'm older than you.

253
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,040
Show me some respect.

254
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,060
Okay, Uncle.

255
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:29,650
Hey, calm down.

256
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,320
Hey,

257
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,440
the police told me to make a statement the day before yesterday.

258
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,050
Great.

259
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,820
Then I can continue as I planned.

260
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,550
Grandma.

261
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,830
Hello.

262
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,630
Wait a moment. Tin is getting ready.

263
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,070
I heard there's a reporter today,

264
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,560
so I have to look good.

265
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,310
Very handsome.

266
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,880
Come with me.

267
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,720
What are you doing?

268
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,420
You're too handsome and good.

269
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,600
I need an uncle who is not afraid of death,

270
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,680
to be down-to-earth,

271
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,170
willing to do anything for his niece,

272
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,470
and is family-oriented.

273
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:58,700
Why?

274
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,540
I'm not on a TV show.

275
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,790
Have you heard of the perfect victim?

276
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,790
The perfect victim?

277
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,380
Yes. Many years ago,

278
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,210
a woman reported that she was sexually harassed

279
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,860
by her boss.

280
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,160
The major news media

281
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:18,350
called her an honest and innocent woman

282
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,200
who was harassed by a rogue.

283
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,600
The public sympathized with her.

284
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,280
And then?

285
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,050
The defendant's lawyer

286
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,220
dug into her past

287
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,520
and found out that she liked going to bars.

288
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,930
She liked drinking with unfamiliar men,

289
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,360
and sleeping with others.

290
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,520
This affected her perfect image.

291
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,400
People in the society started insulting her,

292
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,150
saying she lied.

293
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,440
They said she was harrassed because she wanted money.

294
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:51,980
Oh.

295
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,230
I wasn't the lawyer of this case.

296
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,210
Otherwise, you'll hate me more.

297
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,560
You did something similar, didn't you?

298
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,130
You used my bank account

299
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,340
to ask for donations online.

300
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,950
You made people think I'm short of money

301
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:10,069
and wanted to make money with my niece's death.

302
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:12,690
Are you still mad at me for that?

303
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,180
I'm not mad, but I don't like that.

304
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:20,849
About that woman,

305
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,220
no matter if she was a simple woman,

306
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,460
or if she liked going to bars,

307
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,450
none of that should change the fact that she was harrassed.

308
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,859
Her being harrassed

309
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,150
or hurt

310
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,820
is just like my situation.

311
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,910
I'm not pitiful.

312
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,990
I'm not naive.

313
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,970
Everyone makes mistakes.

314
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,530
I know.

315
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:41,980
But it's bad, Tin.

316
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,410
We all grew up

317
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,850
hearing those comments.

318
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,890
Tin,

319
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,100
that's Senator Thatthep.

320
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,170
He's rich and powerful.

321
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,810
We must rely on the media

322
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:56,880
and public pressure.

323
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,780
I promise

324
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,130
I won't force you

325
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,410
to do what you don't like.

326
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,970
Let me interview you.

327
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,110
Is Mr. Tin all right?

328
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,760
Any progress?

329
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,840
How did it go?

330
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,410
-How is it going? -Is there any progress?

331
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,610
What happened?

332
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,680
Please answer.

333
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,440
What do you think, Mr. Tin?

334
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,500
Please answer.

335
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,370
Mr. Tin, please answer the question.

336
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,130
Please answer.

337
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:46,660
How are things?

338
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,250
Mr. Tin came to do a case record today,

339
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,610
regarding the case of Mr. Tonthai, the son of Senator Thatthep,

340
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,000
being accused of

341
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,820
driving

342
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,120
and killing someone.

343
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,840
I want to inform you all

344
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,200
Mr. Tin

345
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,230
has appointed me as the lawyer of this case.

346
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,890
I will cooperate with the prosecutor

347
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,610
when this case goes to court.

348
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,790
He's the son of a politician.

349
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,050
Will it affect you?

350
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,230
Not at all.

351
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:18,390
I have evidence.

352
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,350
I'm confident I can win.

353
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,350
Don't worry, Dad.

354
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:26,250
He's just a useless lawyer.

355
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:27,840
What can he do to us?

356
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,170
How dare you say that?

357
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,090
You caused this problem.

358
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,000
Charn will never let us go.

359
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,210
Mr. Charn.

360
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,250
We have no evidence.

361
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,050
Is it okay to say that?

362
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:48,590
They don't know if we have evidence or not.

363
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,050
I just want them to be anxious.

364
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,540
When they're anxious, they'll make mistakes.

365
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,100
Mr. Charn, Mr. Thatthep wants to see you.

366
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,160
You're not coming?

367
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,210
Wait. I'm busy.

368
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,440
Mind your facial expression.

369
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,090
If you mess things up again,

370
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:42,000
I'll kill you.

371
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,460
Sorry to keep you waiting.

372
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,460
I'm very busy with work.

373
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,590
It's okay.

374
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,490
I'm here today

375
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,800
to talk about Tanthai.

376
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,560
I'm sorry.

377
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,130
I'm the one who sent people to attack you.

378
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,960
It has nothing to do with my dad.

379
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:25,780
Okay.

380
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,700
My son is very impulsive.

381
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,140
He likes to solve problems with violence.

382
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,070
I don't know who taught him that.

383
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,420
Yes.

384
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,870
It's very unlike you.

385
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,120
You must be exhausted,

386
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,820
cleaning up after him again and again.

387
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,840
I'm sorry for being so straightforward.

388
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,540
You're right.

389
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,960
You're absolutely right.

390
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,150
He only knows how to create problems.

391
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,540
Young people nowadays

392
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,300
are used to being self-centered.

393
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,550
Well,

394
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:14,820
you must punish him severely

395
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,310
so that he can remember his mistake.

396
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:20,080
The more painful the whip is, the better.

397
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,500
Shameless!

398
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,130
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

399
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,320
Just wait and see.

400
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,940
I'll teach you a lesson.

401
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,970
What I have with my dad is none of your business.

402
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,060
Hey.

403
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,590
Did you know that people who can only threaten others

404
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,590
do that because

405
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,300
they themselves live in fear?

406
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,270
What are you afraid of?

407
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,150
Well,

408
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,620
it was my son's mistake.

409
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,460
I hope

410
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,730
we can be friends

411
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,390
and you can stay out of this case.

412
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,730
I will help you handle

413
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,690
all the cases in the party.

414
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:32,980
I promise

415
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,530
you will receive both fame and fortune.

416
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,850
I accept your apology,

417
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,160
but I think I'll continue

418
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,710
with Mr. Tanthai's case.

419
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,450
Charn,

420
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:49,940
you'll regret

421
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,690
becoming my enemy.

422
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,970
Get out.

423
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,860
Also,

424
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:04,730
I found out

425
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,250
why Tanthai

426
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,640
sent someone to Tin's house.

427
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,400
It should be

428
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,690
a doll.

429
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,350
Guess

430
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,220
who will regret

431
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,920
becoming enemies?

432
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,880
Would it kill you

433
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:38,580
to do what I say?

434
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,470
I told you to be quiet.

435
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:41,940
Why did you mess with him?

436
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,480
He started it.

437
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,530
What should I do?

438
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,380
You have to hold back in whatever you do,

439
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,530
because now he has something on us.

440
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,560
I don't know

441
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,880
if he really has that doll or not.

442
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:57,660
If he does,

443
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:58,970
what are you going to do?

444
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,110
I have an idea.

445
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,860
What is it?

446
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:06,920
Turn yourself in.

447
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:10,280
Get punished and end this case.

448
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,130
What did you say?

449
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:14,920
You want me to go to jail?

450
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,420
Are you crazy?

451
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,120
Calm down.

452
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,920
Stop yelling.

453
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,920
Just say what happened.

454
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,940
You were careless and you're still a child,

455
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,060
so you'll at most

456
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,760
get a criminal punishment.

457
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,430
Calm down.

458
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,240
No matter what,

459
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,180
I will help you.

460
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,630
But now,

461
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,420
we need Charn

462
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,780
to stay out of our business.

463
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,850
Okay.

464
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,710
Okay, Dad.

465
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,390
If you want me to tell you,

466
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,060
I'll tell you everything.

467
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:57,280
Happy?

468
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:04,600
Idiot!

469
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,690
Are you feeling better?

470
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,150
Thee,

471
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:00,000
can you take me away from here?

472
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,420
I don't want to stay here anymore.

473
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,420
Mr. Thatthep won't let you go anywhere.

474
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,120
You work for my dad.

475
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,450
You're paid by him.

476
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,270
Naturally, you should listen to him.

477
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,750
Thee,

478
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:22,190
I thought you were on my side.

479
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,760
Som.

480
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,250
Som.

481
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,400
Come and eat.

482
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,740
Here.

483
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,370
It's delicious.

484
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,270
I made it specially for you.

485
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,200
Who left you here?

486
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,870
I have a new burden now.

487
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,930
Is it good?

488
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,100
How's my cooking?

489
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:20,970
Tin, I want to talk to you.

490
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,670
Okay.

491
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,590
Hello, Nam, Aiphon.

492
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,640
Aren't you going to teach the students?

493
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,660
I got fired.

494
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,880
-What? -What?

495
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,630
What happened, Tin?

496
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,620
The person in charge of renting at school

497
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,800
owes Senator Thatthep money.

498
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:55,960
They put pressure on him.

499
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,660
If I still teach there,

500
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:58,950
they'll terminate the lease contract.

501
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,580
-What? -What?

502
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:02,790
They fired you

503
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,360
with such a dirty trick?

504
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,040
Despicable.

505
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:07,940
Don't give up, Tin.

506
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,010
What should we do? Should we make it public with the reporters?

507
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:12,560
Make it public with the reporters or do something else.

508
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,600
Don't let them

509
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,140
do this to you anymore.

510
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,490
I'm thinking about it.

511
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,660
But

512
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,850
don't tell Grandma yet.

513
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,610
I don't want her to worry.

514
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:37,820
Som.

515
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,190
Come and eat.

516
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,690
Grandma, what's wrong?

517
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,180
Grandma, what's wrong?

518
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,240
Oh, Som.

519
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,880
I fed it yesterday.

520
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,540
Who killed it

521
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,160
cruelly?

522
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:11,130
It must be someone who doesn't like dogs, Grandma.

523
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,320
It probably went after someone.

524
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:16,120
No, it's impossible.

525
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,990
It never bit.

526
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:20,400
People around here liked it very much.

527
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,590
Oh.

528
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,920
Tin, could it be…

529
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:27,320
Could it be what?

530
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,460
Oh, it's nothing, Grandma.

531
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:31,200
My wife always talks nonsense.

532
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,730
She always speculates nonsense.

533
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,910
Nothing. Let's go.

534
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:36,540
Let's go prepare something to sell.

535
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,140
It must be them.

536
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,550
They mean to scare you and Grandma.

537
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,130
I think so too.

538
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,290
I'll ask Nam and Aiphon

539
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,400
to pay more attention to Grandma.

540
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,560
Okay.

541
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,160
I'll let Grandma carry a tracker with her

542
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,360
to make sure she's safe.

543
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:03,620
What's wrong?

544
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,190
The day before yesterday,

545
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:11,630
the father and son came to me

546
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:13,460
and wanted to make peace with me.

547
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,810
So I played with them.

548
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,370
They might still hate me

549
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,140
so they vented their anger on you and Grandma.

550
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:22,820
I don't think so.

551
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,500
They wanted to scare me.

552
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:29,290
By the way, did you mention Tonkhao's doll

553
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,850
when you met them?

554
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,740
Yes.

555
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:35,680
They suddenly turned pale.

556
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,170
I think there must be vital evidence

557
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:39,010
in the doll.

558
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,360
It's not just a car accident.

559
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,460
Tanthai's reaction

560
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,490
is getting more and more suspicious to me.

561
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:47,890
What did he do?

562
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,540
He seemed

563
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,500
to be hiding something.

564
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,450
He was scared.

565
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,900
How is that possible?

566
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:58,460
He seemed violent and rebellious

567
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,380
from the news.

568
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,460
What would he be afraid of?

569
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,500
Sometimes

570
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,930
a person's behavior

571
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,220
reflects what he's afraid of.

572
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:12,570
Violence only creates problems.

573
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:15,160
It may also be a signal

574
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,430
to draw other people's attention.

575
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:17,840
Anyone can help me.

576
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,950
You have the same experience, right?

577
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,510
You're hiding something too.

578
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,230
Are you crazy?

579
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,290
What can I be hiding?

580
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,310
I hope you're not.

581
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,500
If you are

582
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,720
and I can help,

583
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:44,670
or you need someone to listen to you,

584
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,950
you can tell me.

585
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:51,840
I'm leaving.

586
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,200
It's done.

587
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:30,480
I think they'll be scared.

588
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,600
It's better to end quickly.

589
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,730
If it's not over,

590
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,680
I can do more.

591
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,030
I'm afraid if your father finds out,

592
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,080
he'll be mad at you.

593
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:41,540
Why will he know

594
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,820
if you don't tell him?

595
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,540
You're his man.

596
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,690
Go ahead if you want to tell him.

597
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,920
Go.

598
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,389
This is a tracker, Grandma.

599
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,020
Take it with you

600
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,610
so that I can know where you are at any time.

601
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,030
If you want to know where I am,

602
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:21,080
you can call me. I have a phone.

603
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:23,659
You're afraid I'll sneak out?

604
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:25,600
I'm not a kid anymore.

605
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,530
It's not like that, Grandma.

606
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:30,850
It's just in case you don't have your phone with you.

607
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,190
What happened?

608
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,860
Nothing.

609
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,870
Are you afraid that I'll be hurt?

610
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,090
The doggie's death is because

611
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:49,400
they wanted to threaten us, right?

612
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:55,969
-No, Grandma. -Of course, it is.

613
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:58,520
You got fired too.

614
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,210
People in the market told me.

615
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:13,440
Tin.

616
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:17,210
Don't worry about me.

617
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:19,840
I can take care of myself.

618
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,660
This is nothing to me.

619
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,830
I'm not afraid,

620
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:25,360
nor will I give up.

621
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,740
Tin. Tin.

622
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,650
What's burning?

623
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:48,820
Grandma.

624
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:51,540
Grandma.

625
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:53,340
Tin, what happened?

626
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,440
Let's get out of here.

627
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,110
This way.

628
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:02,340
Oh, we're going down.

629
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,590
-We're going down. -Hurry. Grandma.

630
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,970
Oh, no.

631
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,780
What happened?

632
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:12,380
I'm worried about you.

633
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:14,380
The fire was burning when I came here.

634
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,990
Grandma, are you okay?

635
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,870
I'm fine.

636
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,170
But how did the fire start?

637
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,840
Maybe they did it.

638
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,950
They sent someone to set fire

639
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:24,320
to threaten you and Tin.

640
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:22,040
[Welfare House]

641
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:25,950
You look bad. You're always so bad.

642
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:30,480
You're not a bad boy.

643
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:34,930
You look bad. You're always so bad.

644
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:39,450
You're not a bad boy.

645
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,350
Good.

646
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,570
All right, kids. Go have some snacks.

647
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,150
Don't forget

648
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:47,010
to line up,

649
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,620
because order

650
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:49,680
and honesty

651
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,000
are the standards of good people.

652
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:53,200
You can't embezzle or cheat when you grow up.

653
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,460
Thank you.

654
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:56,630
Thank you. Well done.

655
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:57,970
Go, kids.

656
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:09,110
Sir, the party called.

657
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:12,640
Yes.

658
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,590
What did you say?

659
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,540
Is it you?

660
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,220
Why is your voice like this?

661
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:41,380
Is something wrong?

662
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:43,780
Did you do it?

663
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:45,840
Did you send the photos to the party?

664
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,630
Actually, your son did it.

665
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,850
He left the fuel at my client's house

666
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,770
and made a point of leaving the ring

667
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:56,800
with his name engraved on it there.

668
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,180
What a lousy method.

669
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,790
Charn.

670
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:08,280
If you still won't let Grandma and Tin go,

671
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,370
all these photos

672
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,910
will be sent to your opponents.

673
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,030
Also,

674
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:18,120
please say hello to Thantai for me.

675
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,650
Bye.

676
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:40,460
Than.

677
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:42,680
Will you

678
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,260
stop causing me trouble one day?

679
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,490
I don't think so.

680
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,470
To you, I'm just a troublemaker.

681
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:52,190
If you want to be a bad guy,

682
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:53,640
I have nothing to say.

683
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,330
But can you be smarter?

684
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:57,400
Why did you leave the evidence

685
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,650
when burning Tin's house?

686
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:01,400
Burn what?

687
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,780
What ring? I don't know what you're talking about.

688
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,810
You don't know?

689
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:08,460
Then why was this ring with your name on it

690
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:09,940
in Tin's house?

691
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:14,980
When did I lose this ring?

692
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,390
I don't even know.

693
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,890
Are you still lying?

694
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:22,720
Why did you do that?

695
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:26,440
If you think I did it, I might have done it.

696
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:27,880
Why do you have to ask me then?

697
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,250
Are you crazy?

698
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,230
Do you know?

699
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,410
Charn sent the evidence to the party.

700
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,720
The leaders are very angry now.

701
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,140
They may not let me join the list of senators this time.

702
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,620
I think it's good.

703
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:42,610
Our country would have a better future

704
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,660
without a senator like you.

705
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:47,740
Than, you...

706
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:50,040
You...

707
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,490
Master.

708
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:56,860
Let me go!

709
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:14,360
Young Master.

710
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:16,170
Young Master.

711
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,250
You too.

712
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:22,960
I told you to keep an eye on him

713
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:24,090
and not to let him cause trouble.

714
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,560
But you never did it.

715
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,700
You two are useless.

716
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,300
I'd rather have a dog.

717
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,210
Young Master.

718
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:42,280
Are you okay?

719
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,200
You shouldn't get involved.

720
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:48,530
You should let him kill me

721
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,580
so all of these can end.

722
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,130
Wow.

723
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:17,710
It's what I want.

724
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:21,130
Look, I made merit.

725
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,560
I planned to pray for Charn,

726
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:23,960
but now you're treating us instead.

727
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,750
It's okay.

728
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:28,930
It's better to eat together, so we won't feel lonely.

729
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:31,150
From now on,

730
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:33,010
Grandma and Tin can rest assured.

731
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,440
They'll eat well and sleep well.

732
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:35,640
They used to

733
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:37,440
be worried

734
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:38,660
if the senators would send someone again.

735
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:41,890
They don't dare to do it anymore.

736
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:43,210
Yes, they won't come again.

737
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,370
How dare they

738
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:46,610
burn Grandma's house again?

739
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:49,620
Lawyer Charn scared them

740
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:51,430
and they've become cowards.

741
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,460
-They must be so scared. -Right, Tin?

742
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:57,120
-Are we digging in? -Let's dig in.

743
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:59,440
-It's getting cold. -Let grandma eat first.

744
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,570
The elderly should eat first.

745
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:04,580
Grandma, open it first.

746
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:25,500
I'm so full that I can't talk.

747
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,090
-I'm so full. -I'll come again.

748
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:30,780
-Okay. -Okay.

749
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:35,470
Nam, Phon, take Grandma inside.

750
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:36,930
I have something to say to Charn.

751
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,080
What's up, Tin?

752
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,370
Nothing.

753
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:49,410
Grandma, let them talk.

754
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,760
Let's go home.

755
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,110
-Let's go. -Don't worry.

756
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,240
-Come on, Grandma. -We're going.

757
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:58,280
-Let's go. -Come again.

758
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,650
Vit, you can go back now.

759
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:04,170
-But... -It's okay.

760
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:06,460
Okay.

761
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,150
Do you want something to drink?

762
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,090
No.

763
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,710
About the fire,

764
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:46,700
I think I should call the police.

765
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:48,360
I don't think it's necessary.

766
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:50,240
I've talked to them.

767
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,790
They don't dare to do anything anymore.

768
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,450
It'll only become news if we call the police.

769
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:57,240
It'll only draw attention and become a hit on social media

770
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,500
if it becomes news.

771
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:02,340
Don't you like this?

772
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:05,740
Tin, you're so nice.

773
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,810
Did you absorb my bad habits?

774
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:11,040
I don't think so.

775
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:13,460
Tell me what you want.

776
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:16,640
On the day of the fire, you stood in front of my house

777
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:17,800
with a fire extinguisher.

778
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:20,870
Who would put a fire extinguisher in their car?

779
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:26,830
You did it.

780
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:29,280
You framed Thantai.

781
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:32,620
You refuse to call the police and block the news

782
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,770
because you're afraid

783
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:37,240
that people will find out the truth if this gets out.

784
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:47,690
I need your help.

785
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:49,610
I'd love to.

786
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:57,550
-Drink it. -Of course.

787
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:03,920
Let me fill it up for you.

788
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,270
Enough.

789
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,670
I got it.

790
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,780
I promise no one saw it.

791
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:19,700
He couldn't hold his liquor.

792
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:20,930
He got drunk after two drinks.

793
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,890
This brand has a serial number.

794
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:26,020
We can find out who bought it.

795
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,240
It's hard for Thantai to deny that it's his.

796
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:26,700
You always surprise me, Tin.

797
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:29,450
I didn't expect you to know this.

798
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:32,450
Why did you do that?

799
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:35,530
Don't you know?

800
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:39,430
I did this to protect you and Grandma.

801
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:41,220
Don't say it's for me and Grandma.

802
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:44,130
You're doing this for yourself.

803
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:47,940
You just want revenge

804
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,140
because they excluded you.

805
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:52,480
You're just using me and Grandma as tools.

806
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:57,980
Can't you see any of my kindness?

807
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,010
I can't,

808
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,410
because you never had it in the beginning.

809
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:05,100
Have you ever thought about it?

810
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:07,320
If you didn't put out the fire that night,

811
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:09,780
what would have happened to my grandma?

812
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:11,980
Have you ever thought about it?

813
00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:14,270
If Senator Thanttep found it out,

814
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:16,040
he might try to kill us.

815
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,270
Things would get worse.

816
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:20,880
What do you want me to do then?

817
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:21,930
Anything,

818
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:23,460
as long as you don't use dirty tricks.

819
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:29,220
Do you think you can win

820
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:30,510
and solve all problems

821
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:32,660
by sticking to righteousness

822
00:50:33,350 --> 00:50:34,990
and virtue like you do?

823
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:38,720
Listen.

824
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:41,790
All problems in the world

825
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:43,510
come from the unfair

826
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:44,820
structure of society.

827
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:47,200
The structure of society is divided

828
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:49,500
according to human selfishness.

829
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:51,910
Who do you think you are

830
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:53,410
to solve the problem?

831
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,460
This is the nature of society.

832
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:58,850
We can only accept it

833
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,870
and learn to gain benefits from it.

834
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,270
If everyone thought like you,

835
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,160
what would happen to the world?

836
00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:10,390
Let it be.

837
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,190
Let it be.

838
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,630
Before you worry about the world,

839
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:17,320
you should worry about yourself.

840
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:19,070
How can you protect your grandma?

841
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:24,280
If you don't like what I do,

842
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,170
what can you do?

843
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:32,410
You can't answer me,

844
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:35,070
because you can't do anything.

845
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:38,380
If you keep thinking this way,

846
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:40,430
don't ever dream you can protect others

847
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:42,490
or get justice for your niece.

848
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:48,260
You're weak and powerless.

849
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:50,500
You can only dream about beautiful things that don't exist.

850
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:30,480
What is it

851
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:33,730
that makes a great lawyer like Charn

852
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,980
so worried?

853
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:36,440
Are you the owner of the bar

854
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:37,870
or a psychologist?

855
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,650
Stop it. Let's drink.

856
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:43,170
It seems serious.

857
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:45,470
Let me guess.

858
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:46,570
It should be about

859
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:47,730
a man named Tin.

860
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:50,180
-No. -You talked back so quickly.

861
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,360
I think it must be about him.

862
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:54,940
Why?

863
00:52:55,890 --> 00:52:57,190
Did he do something to you?

864
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,210
That day I framed Thantai.

865
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:07,780
He hated me for that.

866
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:09,740
He criticized me and hated me.

867
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,970
I can understand from his point of view.

868
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:16,340
His niece died.

869
00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:17,570
All he has is his grandma.

870
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:19,690
If you made more mess

871
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:21,120
and something happened to his grandma,

872
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:22,330
what should he do?

873
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,140
Did it fail?

874
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:25,950
No.

875
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:27,820
Then why did he say that?

876
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,140
It'd only make him angry.

877
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:30,340
He had to say it

878
00:53:30,370 --> 00:53:32,540
so you'll be more careful next time.

879
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:35,720
Charn.

880
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,250
You've been alone for a long time.

881
00:53:39,490 --> 00:53:41,040
You only think about yourself

882
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:43,390
and have nothing to worry about.

883
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:45,420
But Tin is not like you.

884
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:48,230
Try to think about

885
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:49,820
when you were with your mother.

886
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:52,210
You should be like Tin now.

887
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:01,730
You're so partial to him.

888
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,000
Do you know him?

889
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:04,180
No.

890
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:06,060
But

891
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:08,090
I want to see him.

892
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:10,260
I want to know

893
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,670
what kind of man

894
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,350
can tempt

895
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:17,580
our great lawyer.

896
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,420
Stop it. Let's drink.

897
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:25,910
What?

898
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:29,580
Stop laughing.

899
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:46,650
If you keep thinking this way,

900
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:48,570
don't ever dream you can protect others

901
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:49,620
or get justice

902
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:50,870
for your niece.

903
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,930
You're weak and powerless.

904
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,040
You can only dream about beautiful things that don't exist.

905
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:25,480
[Next episode]

906
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:27,460
You're going to Tanthai like this?

907
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:28,560
Are you crazy or stupid?

908
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:29,980
Think about what your grandma is gonna do

909
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:31,050
if something happens to you?

910
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,210
Stop pretending

911
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:33,290
it's for the sake of me and Grandma.

912
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,020
Is that man important to you?

913
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,830
Grandma, I heard

914
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,840
you received

915
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:43,190
a-million-baht insurance compensation.

916
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:47,110
A man like him never cares about anyone.

917
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:48,350
He's just lying in sheep's clothing.

918
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:51,670
You can't trust anyone now.

919
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:53,300
Including you?
