1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,660
I have evidence

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:03,410
that I'm sure will convict him.

3
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:05,370
We don't have any evidence.

4
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,200
Is it a good idea to say that?

5
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,070
I just want them to be restless.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,330
When they're restless,

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,610
they'll make mistakes.

8
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,000
Chan!

9
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,330
You're going to regret

10
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:16,980
being my enemy.

11
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:18,400
Let's see

12
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,270
who is going to regret it.

13
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,420
Hey, what happened?

14
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,570
When I got here,

15
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,650
it's already burning.

16
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,130
Grandma, are you okay?

17
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,770
How did the fire start?

18
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:28,380
It's probably them.

19
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,480
They sent someone to burn this place

20
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,610
to scare you and Tinn.

21
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,640
Why did you burn Tinn's house

22
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,750
and leave your ring as evidence?

23
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,590
I don't even know

24
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:37,870
when I lost this freaking ring.

25
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,510
They tried to burn Grandma's house down.

26
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,000
One threat from Mr. Chan

27
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,710
and they chickened out.

28
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,750
What a chicken.

29
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:45,810
The night of the fire,

30
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:46,790
you were in front of my house

31
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:47,920
with a fire extinguisher.

32
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:48,970
You did it.

33
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,520
You set Tanthai up.

34
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,640
Why did you do it?

35
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,390
Can't you see
any good intentions of mine?

36
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,920
I can't because there's none

37
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:55,950
from the start.

38
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,360
A man who can

39
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,310
shake up such a great lawyer like you,

40
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,910
I'd love to meet him.

41
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,870
What should we eat today?

42
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,039
I don't know.

43
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,940
Come on, Ton Khaw.

44
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,930
Ouch!

45
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,730
No! Don't! Don't fight!

46
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:28,680
Hello, Teacher.

47
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,750
Aren't you going to scold me?

48
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:47,980
I will.

49
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,380
I'll do it in one go
at home with Grandma.

50
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,630
So you don't have to
go through it twice.

51
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,410
If I'd known,
I wouldn't have told the teacher

52
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,010
that she handed out
the wrong exam paper.

53
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,760
She gave us the one with answers.

54
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,470
I should have kept quiet
like everyone else.

55
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,760
I was going to scold you

56
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,000
for fighting with your friends.

57
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,430
It's the same thing.

58
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,990
If I'd done what everyone did,

59
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,090
no one would have had
to retake the exam.

60
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,530
I wouldn't have fought with my friends.

61
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,980
And nobody would hate me.

62
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,460
What were you thinking
when you told the teacher?

63
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,450
I just thought that it wasn't right.

64
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,160
It bothered me.

65
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:33,920
And I didn't want to cheat.

66
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,980
Now, everyone hates me.

67
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,200
Khaw.

68
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:44,600
Do you know what is worse

69
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,030
than getting hated?

70
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,420
It's hating yourself.

71
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,090
If you'd kept quiet
and hadn't told the teacher,

72
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,110
you wouldn't like yourself now, right?

73
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,190
See?

74
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,070
Everyone

75
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,090
will have to reach a point

76
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,120
where they have to choose
the way they want to live their lives.

77
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:08,780
When you reach that point,

78
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,980
don't choose what you don't believe in.

79
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,520
Don't do anything
that goes against this.

80
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:18,920
Understand?

81
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,470
Can I have a bite?

82
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,680
No.

83
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,720
It's your punishment.

84
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,250
What the heck?

85
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,850
What's wrong with him?

86
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:39,240
I'm not here to pick a fight.

87
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,590
I just want to ask
what happened that day.

88
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,250
Open!

89
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,670
Why did you lock the doors?!

90
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,150
You son of a bitch.

91
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,330
Don't come close.

92
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:33,790
Don't come close!

93
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:35,800
I said stop!

94
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,930
You son of a bitch, stop!

95
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,590
Damn it!

96
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,430
You son of a bitch!

97
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,060
Mr. Tanthai.

98
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,530
Don't!

99
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,430
Tell me

100
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,670
what happened that day.

101
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,159
Did you really hit my niece?

102
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,420
I'm not telling you!

103
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,490
Let go of me!

104
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,620
Let go of me!

105
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,810
Son of a bitch.

106
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:34,850
Move!

107
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:44,860
You wanna show off?

108
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,600
You two, take Mr. Tanthai home.

109
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,300
Leave this to me.

110
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,110
Don't pick a fight with me again.

111
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,320
Are you sure you're not
going to the hospital?

112
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,170
No.

113
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,020
Why are you helping me?

114
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,410
If something happens to you,

115
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,980
Mr. Tanthai will be in trouble again.

116
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,490
You're tame.

117
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,750
And loyal.

118
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,270
How much does that kid pay you?

119
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,170
It must be a lot.

120
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,250
A packed meal.

121
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,370
That's already impossible to pay back.

122
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:18,000
But if you keep bothering him,

123
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,080
I won't be this kind to you.

124
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,310
I also want to protect my niece
from all the bad things,

125
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,500
like how you're protecting Tanthai now.

126
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,800
But I can't do that anymore,

127
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,890
because of him!

128
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,450
He is sorry about it too.

129
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,550
Sorry?

130
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,670
He didn't even go to my niece's funeral.

131
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,790
He's just a spoiled rich brat.

132
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,240
Someone like you, or me,

133
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,890
is just garbage to him.

134
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,680
He's never felt sympathy for anyone.

135
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,530
He's never felt sorry for anyone.

136
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,950
My niece was just
the first person he killed.

137
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,430
Someone like him
will kill somebody else again.

138
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,720
Don't talk about him like that.

139
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,580
He isn't like what you said.

140
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,350
And everything

141
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,610
is not as you saw.

142
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,670
What do you mean?

143
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,440
Why isn't Tinn home yet?

144
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:33,860
Oh.

145
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,180
Maybe something happened?

146
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,150
-Huh?
-Hey, dear.

147
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,250
-What?
-What? You're doing it again.

148
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,130
Tinn.

149
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,610
Where are you going?

150
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,760
What have you done?

151
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,920
You went to confront Tanthai.

152
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,250
Are you crazy, or are you dumb?

153
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,260
I wanted to know the truth,

154
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:23,290
so I had to ask.

155
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,300
I'm not as smart as you, Mr. Chan.

156
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,210
If the truth got out that easily,

157
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,220
the police and lawyers
wouldn't have to work so hard.

158
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,480
Have you ever thought
if something happened to you,

159
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,580
how could your grandma live?

160
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,690
Stop making it sound like you care

161
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,860
about me and Grandma.

162
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,270
You never care about anyone.

163
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,990
Otherwise you wouldn't...

164
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,180
Hey, Tinn.

165
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,170
Don't say that.

166
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,500
Chan is here to help us.

167
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,940
Grandma.

168
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,740
Stop falling for his tricks.

169
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,720
He is never sincere with anyone.

170
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,470
He's only good at deceiving people.

171
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,040
Grandma.

172
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:26,740
I'm sorry.

173
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,710
I was the one who burned the house.

174
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,840
I set Tanthai up

175
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,410
to use it against MP Thattep.

176
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,350
You really have to go that far?

177
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,830
Someone like him can do anything.

178
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,900
He only wants to win.

179
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,650
He doesn't care about anyone.

180
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,050
I'm exactly what he said.

181
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,480
I've done a lot of horrible things.

182
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,020
How could I still hope

183
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,460
people would see me in a good light?

184
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,990
I'm just...

185
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,990
evil.

186
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,930
Grandma.

187
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,930
You think you're so good, huh?

188
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,250
You think you're the hero
in an action movie?

189
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,650
You're lucky you're alive.

190
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,580
I'm sorry, Grandma.

191
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,240
What are you going to do about Chan now?

192
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,050
What should I do?

193
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,500
We probably need a new lawyer.

194
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,870
Don't you see what he did to us?

195
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,460
Tinn.

196
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,980
What he did is wrong,

197
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,580
but what you did...

198
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:01,740
Ouch. It hurts, Grandma.

199
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,510
is no better than what he did.

200
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,670
He's a schemer.

201
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:09,040
And you're too rigid
to the point of being dull.

202
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,560
You two need to find the middle ground.

203
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,480
Why would he want

204
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,260
to find the middle ground with us?

205
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,120
What you said to him today

206
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,410
was very harsh, you know?

207
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,670
What he did is wrong,

208
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,650
but he's not heartless.

209
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,940
He meant well for us.

210
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,370
He wanted to protect us.

211
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,050
But you told him off like that.

212
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,570
He must feel very bad.

213
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,400
Grandma,

214
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,290
don't fall for his trick.

215
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,820
Someone like him doesn't feel bad
for anything.

216
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,140
He doesn't even feel anything.

217
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,720
You know

218
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,960
why Chan came here today?

219
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,230
He came to tell me

220
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,940
that he made you angry

221
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,730
and he wanted to talk it out with you.

222
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,680
He wanted to apologize.

223
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:55,780
Really?

224
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,920
Yes.

225
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,120
It's also his plan.

226
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,180
You're so stubborn.

227
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,540
Think about it carefully.

228
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,060
Is it because Chan is really heartless,

229
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:10,800
or is it because you're so angry

230
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,760
that you can't see his good intention?

231
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,819
Hey, and use your brain,

232
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,740
not your prejudice.

233
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,640
Yes, ma'am.

234
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,620
Oh, Grandma El.

235
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,530
You're still selling?

236
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,660
If I were you,
I'd have stopped long ago.

237
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,830
Oh, wait until I win the lottery
and get a million.

238
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,630
Then I'll definitely stop.

239
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,750
You're talking too much.
Come buy something.

240
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,650
-What would you like?
-Well. You're rich now.

241
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:00,430
I heard that, after Khaw died,

242
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,140
you got a lot of money.

243
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,190
Hey. What are you talking about?

244
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,770
Tinn.

245
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,750
Haven't you checked social media
or the news?

246
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:13,600
On the news, they said you guys got paid

247
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,170
by your granddaughter's insurance

248
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,590
more than a million.

249
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:17,700
Huh?

250
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,890
(Accidentally rich)

251
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,020
(Ton Khaw's insurance money

252
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,290
changes her uncle's life.)

253
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,510
(His niece died
and he suddenly got rich.)

254
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,960
(Gotta make it worth it.)

255
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,180
(Your niece is dead.
You're not crying anymore?)

256
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,490
(Soon, he'll be on TV shows
making easy money.)

257
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,640
(This is still not over? I'm bored.)

258
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:49,700
Mr. Thattep.

259
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,390
You didn't listen to my warning.

260
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,700
Do you want me to leak the info

261
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,130
about your son
burning my client's house?

262
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,200
What are you talking about?

263
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,970
I have no idea.

264
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,490
The news about
Ton Khaw's insurance money

265
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,720
that's been leaked.

266
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,710
And the fact that
your son attacked Tinn.

267
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,590
What about the fact that your client

268
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,000
went there to attack my son first?

269
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,720
The car has a front camera, you know?

270
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,320
Actually, that night,

271
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,340
Tan should have just killed him.

272
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:27,980
So this can finally be over.

273
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,010
It'll be considered a defensive act.

274
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,080
Don't you think?

275
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,170
If you dare to touch

276
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,400
a single strand of his hair...

277
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,440
Hey, I've known you for a long time.

278
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,130
I've never seen you like this.

279
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:53,860
Why?

280
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,300
Is that man

281
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,020
that important to you?

282
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:08,050
And about my son burning his house,

283
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,000
stop using it to threaten me.

284
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,170
My son didn't do it.

285
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:13,820
It was you

286
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,640
who tried to frame my son.

287
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,480
So?

288
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,260
You think you're the only one
who knows the tricks?

289
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,950
And one more thing.

290
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,170
That plushie.

291
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,140
The one you said you've found.

292
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,260
Actually, you don't have it, right?

293
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,350
How's that?

294
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,520
I'm smart, aren't I?

295
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:45,820
After this,

296
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,900
I'm looking forward to seeing you lose,

297
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:51,940
Mr. Chan.

298
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,130
Grandma asked me to bring you
Vietnamese noodle soup.

299
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,120
Please thank her for me.

300
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,630
Do you want to eat it now?

301
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:33,660
I'll warm it up for you.

302
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,600
Okay, I'll get to the point.

303
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,600
I want to talk to you about us.

304
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,880
I still don't like the fact
that you burned my house.

305
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,470
But I shouldn't have said that

306
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,940
you don't care about me
and my grandma.

307
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,160
I know it's not true.

308
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,710
Who told you that?

309
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,890
Maybe it is true.

310
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,500
You can be mad at me,

311
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:07,050
or withdraw from the case, Chan.

312
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,950
But I want you to know that
I really feel bad

313
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,240
for hurting your feelings,

314
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,790
for seeing you in a bad light,

315
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,050
and for being prejudiced against you.

316
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:23,690
Honestly, I was mad at myself

317
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,270
because I couldn't do anything.

318
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,880
I'm useless for the case.

319
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:33,330
And I took it out on you.

320
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,080
No, Tinn.

321
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,630
You did your best.

322
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:55,150
No one puts more effort
into this case than you do.

323
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,460
So, we...

324
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,640
Well.

325
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,420
The same.

326
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,000
I've never thought about

327
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,740
withdrawing from the case.

328
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:16,680
So, if you're going to do
anything later,

329
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:17,980
can you tell me beforehand?

330
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,190
Let's think and act together.

331
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,290
Don't think that you're alone.

332
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,130
Okay?

333
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:31,580
I'll warm it up for you.

334
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,100
Here you go.

335
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,970
You know,

336
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,750
my grandma's recipe is very good.

337
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,860
Wait.

338
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:56,680
Just a sec.

339
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:14,440
Actually,

340
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:16,560
I went to see Thattep.

341
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,950
He knows that I framed Tanthai.

342
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,550
What?

343
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:25,830
How did he know?

344
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,530
I don't know.

345
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,860
But all my plan is ruined.

346
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,540
Now that Thattep knows what I'm doing,

347
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:34,080
everything is going to be a mess.

348
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,640
You were right about everything.

349
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,050
It's okay to be mad at me.

350
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,730
It's all right.

351
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,230
I know you meant well.

352
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,440
Thattep must be very angry now.

353
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,350
From now on, if you want to do anything,

354
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,720
you have to be very careful.

355
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,510
Are you worried about me?

356
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,040
Of course.

357
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,180
Are you the only one
who can worry about me?

358
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:14,980
Why are you smiling?

359
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,410
Why are you smiling? Eat.

360
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,060
Ton Khaw's insurance

361
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,630
only paid 200,000.

362
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,790
If so,

363
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,310
I will post Ton Khaw's insurance policy

364
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,690
on social media.

365
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:48,670
And all your incomes and expenses.

366
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,270
Grandma, don't worry about it.

367
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:52,220
These pieces of evidence can prove it.

368
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,910
We can easily clear this up.

369
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:57,510
Thank you so much, Chan.

370
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,750
I was so worried at first.

371
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,630
And I was angry when people said

372
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,160
I live comfortably off

373
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,020
my dead granddaughter's insurance.

374
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:08,990
After spending the money we got
on the funeral,

375
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:10,560
there's barely any left.

376
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,500
Grandma.

377
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,830
Don't tell anyone about this yet.

378
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,410
If people spread the word,

379
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:24,580
it might be harder for us
to deal with the problem.

380
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,890
Okay.

381
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,620
I've taken care of

382
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:29,740
your car accident case.

383
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,670
How?

384
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:33,600
You don't need to know that.

385
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,210
Just don't cause any more trouble.

386
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,110
And after this,

387
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,240
if anyone asks you anything,

388
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,990
or if reporters ask you,

389
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,290
don't say anything.

390
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:46,860
Do you understand?

391
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:50,140
And get ready.

392
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,420
I'm sending you to the US.

393
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,090
This case is

394
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,710
in the public eye.

395
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,210
So the police had to do

396
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,310
everything carefully.

397
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,980
Now, we have arrested the driver

398
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,710
in the car crash that killed Ton Khaw.

399
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,400
Oh? Wasn't the driver Mr. Tanthai,

400
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,250
MP Thattep's son?

401
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:26,630
Mr. Tanthai is a victim

402
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,800
and a witness in this case.

403
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,470
-How come it turns out like this?
-On the day of the accident,

404
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,450
his car was stolen by Chai,

405
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,980
a gardener who used to
work at his house.

406
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:37,320
Chai wanted to sell the car

407
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,620
to pay off his loan shark debts.

408
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,900
But before he could do that,

409
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:42,300
he accidentally hit Ton Khaw.

410
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,730
Who would believe that?

411
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,190
How could such an honest old man

412
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,120
steal a car from MP Thattep's house?

413
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,010
He's obviously a scapegoat.

414
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,010
If he's going to use a scapegoat,

415
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:04,040
why didn't he do it in the beginning?

416
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,990
Why did he waste so much time

417
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:07,250
and let his own son be called

418
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,620
a murderer by the whole country?

419
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,420
Maybe Tanthai really didn't do it.

420
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,420
Are you crazy?

421
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,950
Don't tell me you believe that

422
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,340
that old man stole Tanthai's car.

423
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,370
No.

424
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:25,980
But the day I went to see Tanthai

425
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,080
and got hurt.

426
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:29,330
His bodyguard told me that

427
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,430
everything is not

428
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:32,520
as we saw.

429
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:42,160
So, that means

430
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,350
Tanthai's bodyguard

431
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,370
is another person
who knows the whole truth.

432
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,980
That uncle used to be our gardener.

433
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:17,200
When we were little,

434
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:19,290
you and I used to play with him.

435
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,930
You should stop watching.

436
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:27,060
It'll make you upset.

437
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:29,540
Tee.

438
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:31,380
Why would I be upset?

439
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,050
Do you know how much

440
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,320
people like that get paid in a day?

441
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,200
It's only 300 baht per day.

442
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,150
And honestly, that can't even buy

443
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:39,460
a sock I'm wearing.

444
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,300
I can imagine what it's like

445
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,710
when my dad went to make him an offer.

446
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,400
He must be happy.

447
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:47,400
Now, his wife and children

448
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,770
must be happy spending the money.

449
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,830
I feel like I have made merit.

450
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,520
Do you think, if I die,

451
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,210
I'll go to Heaven?

452
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,650
Hello, Beer.

453
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,880
Where are you?

454
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,470
Let's meet up at our usual place.

455
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,870
My treat.

456
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,230
You're not done dressing up?

457
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,050
It's good that you're here.

458
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,100
Come help me pick.

459
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,670
Which one should I wear?

460
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,950
This one?

461
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,150
This one?

462
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:03,220
You're still not done?

463
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:05,460
If you want it to be faster,

464
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,700
help me.

465
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:32,860
That's it.

466
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,890
Our plan for tonight...

467
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,520
I didn't tell anyone.

468
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,360
Good.

469
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:45,880
Because we don't know

470
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,530
where MP Thattep heard it from,

471
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,330
and how our plan got out.

472
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,670
You can't trust anyone now.

473
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,070
Does that include you?

474
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,930
Of course.

475
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,930
Including me.

476
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,250
Because I lie,

477
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,010
I deceive people, and I'm evil.

478
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,560
But if one day you make a slip
and fall for my tricks,

479
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:11,510
it'll probably only hurt your feelings.

480
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,500
But those who you think
are your friends,

481
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,530
are on your side,

482
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,200
love you,

483
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,510
and understand you.

484
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:25,400
You have to be very careful with them.

485
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,860
And do not trust them.

486
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,410
You seem pretty hopeless

487
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,830
about the goodness of fellow people.

488
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,780
We shouldn't expect anything

489
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,540
from something that doesn't exist.

490
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,480
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

491
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,460
We still have time to spare.

492
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:52,800
Shall we do something else?

493
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:55,910
What thing?

494
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,490
Anything.

495
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,810
It's up to you.

496
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:19,300
I don't think we should.

497
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:21,280
I don't trust you.

498
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,530
Are you Tinn?

499
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,389
Finally, we get to meet.

500
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:40,730
Hello.

501
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,830
Hello.

502
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:45,010
You always have good taste.

503
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:53,030
Since we can couple up,

504
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,690
let's have a double date.

505
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:58,840
Come this way.

506
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:15,190
All right, cheers!

507
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,660
Cheers!

508
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,070
-Are you okay?
-Leave me alone, Beer.

509
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,820
Move! You all, move!

510
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:32,540
-Tee.
-Mr. Tanthai.

511
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:33,790
Take me to the restroom.

512
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,230
Tanthai, that little kid.

513
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,190
He's drunk after two glasses, as usual.

514
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:43,260
I called my dearest little brother

515
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:45,540
as soon as I knew he booked
the whole zone.

516
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,550
You're always so sweet to me.

517
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,340
So, for this kindness of yours,

518
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:54,470
I'll repay you with...

519
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:58,140
a Birkin?

520
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,610
You read my mind.

521
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,920
Hey.

522
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,830
Do what we've discussed.

523
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,550
What are you looking at?

524
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,960
Are you okay?

525
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,020
I have something to talk to you about.

526
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,160
I don't have anything
to talk to you about.

527
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,400
Hey! You again?

528
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,380
You can't stop bothering us, can you?

529
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,500
You son of a bitch.

530
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:55,920
Mr. Tanthai.

531
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,130
Mr. Tanthai.

532
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:59,260
Mr. Tanthai.

533
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:09,030
In the restroom.

534
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:18,680
Take him to the car.

535
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,440
And tell everyone
that the party is over.

536
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:21,710
Go.

537
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,040
Don't you understand?

538
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:43,060
I told you to stay away
from Mr. Tanthai.

539
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,030
I'm here to ask you

540
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,090
if the person who got arrested
is a scapegoat.

541
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,110
You know that I don't talk about this.

542
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:53,080
Then it's a yes.

543
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,150
Who is he taking the blame for?

544
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:57,680
Tanthai?

545
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,710
Or someone else?

546
00:37:58,730 --> 00:37:59,830
I don't know.

547
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,190
I only know that
I must protect Mr. Tanthai.

548
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:07,170
What you're doing is covering things up.

549
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,710
And the more you cover up,

550
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,580
the worse the truth will hurt Tanthai.

551
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,190
Didn't you say it yourself

552
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,220
that he feels sorry

553
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:16,610
and he's hurting too?

554
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:21,790
Right now, only the truth

555
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,880
can help him.

556
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:31,120
If you're asking for justice,

557
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,460
you're asking the wrong person.

558
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,380
What do you mean?

559
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,090
That's all I can say.

560
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,470
This area is a private zone.

561
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,800
You have to make reservations to get in.

562
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,530
Sorry.

563
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,680
It's my first time here. I didn't know.

564
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,750
Are you leaving?

565
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:15,420
They've cleared your table.

566
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:20,390
I think you look familiar.

567
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,880
You might have seen me in a video.

568
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:25,390
Because there are a few

569
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,750
that got leaked.

570
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,020
Is it okay to sit and drink here?

571
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,100
They cleared your table.

572
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,970
Don't worry.

573
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,370
Tan reserved it
for the whole night anyway.

574
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,190
Tan?

575
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:51,380
Is he your friend?

576
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:53,380
He seems very rich.

577
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:56,620
He's both rich and dumb.

578
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:01,220
I'm Beer.

579
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,290
And you? What's your name?

580
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,030
I'm...

581
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:09,060
Ice.

582
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,800
You and your friend are regulars here?

583
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,920
Your friend seems to be somebody.

584
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,310
Who exactly is he?

585
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,000
I don't think we should talk
about someone else.

586
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,370
Let's talk about us.

587
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,710
Is the reason you don't want to talk

588
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,990
because actually

589
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,200
he's not just a friend?

590
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,330
Someone like Tan?

591
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,130
Who would be able to stand him?

592
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:37,920
He's such a brat.

593
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,120
If his dad weren't

594
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,490
an MP,

595
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:42,440
I don't think anyone would want
to be his friend.

596
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,490
Tan?

597
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:47,220
The Tan, who is the son of an MP,

598
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,310
who was on the news
because of a car accident.

599
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:51,150
I heard he hit a kid, right?

600
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,830
Your friend is pretty savage.

601
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:56,880
Actually,

602
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:58,280
the night of the car accident,

603
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,160
I was with him, getting drunk.

604
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,370
So that means

605
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:05,740
it's drunk driving?

606
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,850
If it's an accidental car crash,

607
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,330
and he takes responsibility

608
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,310
and pays for the damages,

609
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:12,750
his sentence will be a little lighter.

610
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,930
But if it's drunk driving,

611
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,870
the maximum sentence is another story.

612
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,090
Really?

613
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:21,390
That's why when something happens,

614
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,180
people try to avoid
getting tested for alcohol

615
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:24,750
and substances.

616
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:32,470
But I don't think someone like Tan

617
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:34,300
would be driving drunk.

618
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:36,460
More like passed out drunk.

619
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,220
After two glasses,

620
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,250
he'll be on the floor.

621
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:40,840
Forget driving.

622
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:42,260
He can't even

623
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:43,910
walk by himself.

624
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:54,230
I think we're done talking
about someone else.

625
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:55,380
After this,

626
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,940
let's go to my room to talk about us.

627
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:08,000
What are you looking at?

628
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,830
Come on.

629
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,650
Excuse me.

630
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,610
Finally,

631
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,890
the hero has come.

632
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:45,100
This is like a movie.

633
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:50,200
Excuse me.

634
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:51,300
He came with me.

635
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,350
What's wrong with you?

636
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:00,490
I'm not surprised.

637
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,430
I'd be more surprised

638
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:05,070
if someone like you
didn't have a boyfriend.

639
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,200
But I actually don't mind.

640
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,810
We can continue as a throuple.

641
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:14,600
No, thanks.

642
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,490
I don't like sharing.

643
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:22,320
Then please excuse me.

644
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,370
And see you later.

645
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:33,870
What are you looking at?

646
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,740
Oh, did I interrupt you two?

647
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:41,060
Do you want to go with him?

648
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:42,260
I'll take you there.

649
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:46,040
I'm not going with him.

650
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:48,110
I came with you.
I have to go back with you.

651
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:49,810
Stop being jealous.

652
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,540
Since Tanthai reserved the whole area,

653
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:55,300
let's have some more drinks

654
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:56,430
and we can talk.

655
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:20,120
Tanthai's friend said,

656
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:22,300
the night of the accident,

657
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,510
Tanthai's very drunk and
didn't seem like he could drive.

658
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,530
From what I've seen tonight,
it's probably true.

659
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:33,480
That means

660
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:36,060
maybe he's not the one who hit my niece.

661
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,570
I'll investigate more on this.

662
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:42,010
But I'm sure we're on the right path.

663
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:50,670
Was it your plan?

664
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:53,770
Sending me to Tanthai's bodyguard

665
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,260
to stop the party

666
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,040
so that you had a chance

667
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,300
to question his friend?

668
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,170
No.

669
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:03,730
That was me improvising.

670
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:07,200
We made a promise

671
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:09,100
that we'll tell each other everything.

672
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,580
I wouldn't dare to make you angry.

673
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:18,380
You're afraid I'd be angry?

674
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:22,690
But back then,

675
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:25,100
someone pulled a gun on me

676
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,110
and said that, when I'm angry,

677
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:28,160
I look hot.

678
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:30,490
You did look hot back then.

679
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:33,890
But I like it more when you're kind.

680
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:45,620
When this whole world
Is burnt to the ground

681
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:49,750
Things that used to surround us
Disappeared

682
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:57,180
Only then did I look at you and realize

683
00:45:57,230 --> 00:46:02,010
All I want is you by my side

684
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:09,210
When this world
Has nothing to confine us

685
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:13,440
We will destroy our differences
With our hearts

686
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:17,140
There will be no more you

687
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:20,340
And no more me

688
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:24,870
There will be only us

689
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,610
Combined into one

690
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:35,010
There will be no more walls
Of races or titles

691
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:39,260
We are ready to fly high to the sky

692
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:42,400
Today

693
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:49,430
When this whole world
Is burnt to the ground

694
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:54,200
Things that used to surround us
Disappeared

695
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:58,600
Only then did I look at you and realize...

696
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,270
I feel so drunk.

697
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:04,020
You only had one glass.

698
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:06,780
Then maybe I'm not drunk
because of the liquor.

699
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,810
It's probably something else.

700
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:12,850
When this world
Has nothing to confine us

701
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,390
We will destroy our differences
With our hearts

702
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:21,040
There will be no more you

703
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:24,060
And no more me

704
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:28,550
I only want us

705
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:31,650
Combined into one

706
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:37,920
We will be free with our hearts

707
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:42,770
Combined into one

708
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:49,700
Hello, Tee.

709
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:51,060
What is it?

710
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:52,870
Are you all right?

711
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:55,020
I see that the light is on in your room.

712
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:58,720
It's nothing.

713
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:00,880
I just woke up to drink water.

714
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:04,140
Okay.

715
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:05,790
Go back to sleep soon.

716
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:08,490
Okay.

717
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:49,290
I will leave now.

718
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:54,580
Drive safely.

719
00:49:57,510 --> 00:49:58,760
Tomorrow, are you...

720
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:02,080
coming to my house?

721
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:08,240
So we can discuss what to do next.

722
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,930
I'll drop by in the late afternoon.

723
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,290
I'm leaving, then.

724
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:02,030
(Next episode)

725
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:03,760
The day of the car accident,

726
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:05,170
I think Ton Khaw might have

727
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:06,460
heard something and recorded it.

728
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,470
If there's any updates,

729
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,370
my people will report to me.

730
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:12,380
The evidence from the plushie,

731
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:14,050
Thattep's willing to do anything

732
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,090
to get it.

733
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:17,690
And if I manage to get it,

734
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:18,810
his money

735
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:20,280
and his power will be mine.

736
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,570
If I didn't have my dad's money,

737
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:24,430
I guess nobody would really want
to be with me.

738
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:25,810
Including you, right?

739
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:31,290
Tinn will get money and power.

740
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,520
And when that day comes,
he'll be satisfied.

741
00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:35,360
What he deserves to get

742
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:37,350
is justice.
