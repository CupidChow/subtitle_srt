1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,900
The brush relies on the Broken-Tail

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:03,366
to absorb resentment in order to paint.

3
00:00:05,966 --> 00:00:06,466
I've got it.

4
00:00:43,466 --> 00:00:45,566
[Longhu Academy]

5
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:53,866
Dan Qing.

6
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:55,966
Wait for me.

7
00:00:56,366 --> 00:00:57,800
I will definitely paint you back.

8
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,833
I will bring you back with my painting.

9
00:01:00,866 --> 00:01:02,133
Wait for me, Dan Qing!

10
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:06,400
How could this happen…

11
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,100
How could this happen…

12
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:19,700
Dan Qing.

13
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:23,766
Dan Qing.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,300
Is there something wrong with this brush?

15
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:36,566
No…

16
00:02:42,966 --> 00:02:44,466
Xu Qianliu's wife was fake.

17
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:46,033
He painted her with the brush.

18
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,933
I saw his real wife.

19
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,933
The Broken-Tail is attached to his brush.

20
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:51,166
I already know.

21
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:53,733
You knew everything?

22
00:02:56,133 --> 00:02:57,666
I discovered his secret long ago.

23
00:02:58,266 --> 00:02:59,666
I argued with you before on purpose.

24
00:03:00,766 --> 00:03:01,700
It was my fault.

25
00:03:06,866 --> 00:03:07,600
Let's go.

26
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,733
The resentment within the brush should be resolved now.

27
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,166
Let's retrieve the Broken-Tail.

29
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,333
Dan Qing, wait for me.

30
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,133
I will definitely paint you back.

31
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,833
My brush! My brush!

32
00:03:21,466 --> 00:03:22,300
Give my brush back!

33
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:23,400
Give me my brush!

34
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:34,100
Rain falls across ten miles.

35
00:03:34,766 --> 00:03:36,200
Frost fills the sky.

36
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:39,200
Every strand of dark hair…

37
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,133
sorrows the passing years.

38
00:03:41,733 --> 00:03:44,366
Facing the moon alone, gazing in longing.

39
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,500
I envy only the mandarin ducks,

40
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:48,266
not the immortals.

41
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:52,233
Dan Qing.

42
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:53,766
The resentment has been dispelled.

43
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:54,800
And he has gone mad.

44
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,900
This Broken-Tail will never acknowledge him as its master.

45
00:03:57,866 --> 00:03:59,200
Though he committed countless wrongs…

46
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:01,400
he is still a pitiful soul.

47
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,666
Immortal Mo, have you heard a saying from the mortal world?

48
00:04:05,266 --> 00:04:06,366
A pitiful person…

49
00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:07,933
…must have something detestable.

50
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:11,033
But someone lofty like you…

51
00:04:11,533 --> 00:04:13,066
probably won't understand

52
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,300
the ways of the mortal world.

53
00:04:21,466 --> 00:04:22,666
For Ling'er's sake…

54
00:04:23,266 --> 00:04:24,300
I'll let this go.

55
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,033
[Secret Chamber]

56
00:04:54,766 --> 00:04:56,766
Seems like you've figured everything out.

57
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,000
Before the plum-blossom mark disappears,

58
00:05:21,033 --> 00:05:22,133
complete your task.

59
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,233
Otherwise…

60
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:24,733
even I won't be able to save you.

61
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,066
Don't worry.

62
00:05:26,966 --> 00:05:28,466
I will fulfill what I promised you.

63
00:05:30,766 --> 00:05:31,400
But…

64
00:05:31,933 --> 00:05:32,833
Don't you forget…

65
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,633
what you promised me.

66
00:06:14,766 --> 00:06:15,700
What's wrong with you?

67
00:06:32,866 --> 00:06:33,333
This is bad.

68
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,533
He is now in a mortal body.

69
00:06:34,933 --> 00:06:36,600
He can't withstand such powerful demon energy.

70
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,466
So the two of you

71
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,933

72
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:07,300
senior and junior?

73
00:07:07,566 --> 00:07:08,300
What else could it be?

74
00:07:10,466 --> 00:07:11,100
Xiaoyao.

75
00:07:11,966 --> 00:07:13,166
You actually still care about me.

76
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:19,333
Whether you're the great fox now…

77
00:07:19,966 --> 00:07:20,966
or Xiaoyao…

78
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,800
you are the one I want to protect.

79
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,633
Senior brother.

80
00:08:03,933 --> 00:08:04,966
You are a Taotie by nature,

81
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,066
a creature that devours all things.

82
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:07,233
For his sake,

83
00:08:07,466 --> 00:08:08,466
you damaged your immortal body like this.

84
00:08:09,033 --> 00:08:09,900
Is it worth it?

85
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:10,766
Senior brother…

86
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:13,133
Say no more.

87
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,833
It's a debt I owe him.

88
00:08:18,366 --> 00:08:18,800
You...

89
00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:26,200
It's getting more and more interesting.

90
00:09:05,233 --> 00:09:05,966
Little beauty.

91
00:09:06,266 --> 00:09:07,366
Why are you alone?

92
00:09:07,566 --> 00:09:08,300
At this late hour…

93
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,833
It's dangerous for you to be alone.

94
00:09:10,066 --> 00:09:11,466
If you run into a bad person,

95
00:09:11,466 --> 00:09:12,333
what would you do?

96
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:14,100
Then…

97
00:09:14,433 --> 00:09:15,833
what should I do?

98
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,166
How about I escort you?

99
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:20,600
Thank you, sir.

100
00:09:21,366 --> 00:09:21,900
Alright.

101
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,233
Let's go.

102
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:29,066
We're here.

103
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,000
Right here.

104
00:09:31,233 --> 00:09:32,933
Senior brother, why did you bring me here?

105
00:09:33,433 --> 00:09:35,033
Xiaoyao is still lying at home alone.

106
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,233
You absorbed all the demon energy overflowing from his body.

107
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:38,400
He'll be fine.

108
00:12:37,366 --> 00:12:38,266
What's wrong with you?

109
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,666
She saved me again.

110
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:47,566
Ling'er.

111
00:13:00,533 --> 00:13:01,666
Where did you go so early?

112
00:13:18,533 --> 00:13:19,566
Human wine…

113
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:21,200
is really strong.

114
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,766
Why did I fall asleep here?

115
00:13:28,366 --> 00:13:29,766
Find him for me!

116
00:13:29,966 --> 00:13:31,166
My husband

117
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,100
said clearly he was drinking here last night.

118
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:34,500
He still hasn't come home!

119
00:13:34,733 --> 00:13:36,366
What did you do to him?

120
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:37,433
Lady…

121
00:13:37,433 --> 00:13:38,766
How many times have I told you…

122
00:13:39,133 --> 00:13:41,266
Your husband drank here last night…

123
00:13:41,633 --> 00:13:43,300
and he left right after.

124
00:13:43,366 --> 00:13:44,100
Impossible!

125
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:45,466
I searched the whole town.

126
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,400
I didn't find him at all.

127
00:13:46,633 --> 00:13:48,033
Did you do something to him?

128
00:13:48,033 --> 00:13:48,366
You...

129
00:13:48,366 --> 00:13:49,433
Stop shouting here!

130
00:13:49,466 --> 00:13:50,700
Go look somewhere else!

131
00:13:50,933 --> 00:13:51,866
If you don't hand him over today,

132
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:53,100
I'm not leaving!

133
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:54,833
Is anyone there?

134
00:13:57,233 --> 00:13:58,333
Let me out!

135
00:13:58,566 --> 00:13:59,366
Let me out!

136
00:14:01,733 --> 00:14:02,766
Let me out!

137
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,833
Let me out!

138
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,066
Let me out!

139
00:14:06,966 --> 00:14:08,200
Let me out!

140
00:14:23,433 --> 00:14:25,100
Where could those two go?

141
00:15:45,466 --> 00:15:47,166
Did you remember something?

142
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,033
When I retrieved the second Broken-Tail,

143
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:56,866
a scene flashed in my mind.

144
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,833
In a field of snow…

145
00:16:03,233 --> 00:16:03,866
I saved you.

146
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,033
We beg you, Lady Zhu, please perform a divination for us!

147
00:16:26,033 --> 00:16:28,100
Please, Lady Zhu.

148
00:16:28,133 --> 00:16:31,966
Help us, please.

149
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:33,866
Lady Zhu!

150
00:16:35,366 --> 00:16:36,000
Go back, all of you.

151
00:16:36,433 --> 00:16:37,466
Lady Zhu is not home today.

152
00:16:38,966 --> 00:16:39,866
We can't leave.

153
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:41,366
Please let Lady Zhu see us.

154
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,266
Yes, we can't leave.

155
00:16:43,266 --> 00:16:44,466
Please let her meet us.

156
00:16:44,466 --> 00:16:45,133
We beg you.

157
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:45,800
Hurry and go.

158
00:16:46,033 --> 00:16:46,766
Zi Qing.

159
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:47,866
You've returned.

160
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,300
Let them in.

161
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:50,200
Yes.

162
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,700
Come with me.

163
00:16:53,933 --> 00:16:55,000
Lady Zhu is willing to see us!

164
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,533
Let's go!

165
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:56,200
Hurry!

166
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,100
Greetings, Lady Zhu.

167
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,566
I know what you wish to ask.

168
00:17:10,866 --> 00:17:11,900
A sign of great misfortune.

169
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,266
Go back and prepare for the worst.

170
00:17:17,766 --> 00:17:20,400
Those lustful men deserved to die.

171
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,000
What's there to cry about?

172
00:17:30,766 --> 00:17:34,033
They got what they deserved.

173
00:17:35,533 --> 00:17:36,666
That's more like it.

174
00:17:38,466 --> 00:17:39,566
Here, the official notice!

175
00:17:39,966 --> 00:17:40,566
Come take a look!

176
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:41,466
Everyone, come look!

177
00:17:44,466 --> 00:17:45,066
I heard…

178
00:17:45,266 --> 00:17:46,333
lately many men

179
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:48,033
have mysteriously disappeared.

180
00:17:48,266 --> 00:17:48,900
Yes.

181
00:17:48,933 --> 00:17:51,166
They were taken away by something after drinking.

182
00:17:51,433 --> 00:17:52,300
Very strange indeed.

183
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,266
How could so many vanish so bizarrely?

184
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,833
And all of them drunk men.

185
00:17:56,466 --> 00:17:57,333
Drunkards.

186
00:17:58,666 --> 00:17:59,466
Beauty…

187
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:00,800
Where is your home?

188
00:18:01,433 --> 00:18:02,633
Why aren't we there yet?

189
00:18:05,466 --> 00:18:05,866
Sir.

190
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:08,100
Yesterday I saw a drunk man…

191
00:18:08,233 --> 00:18:09,100
being led by a woman…

192
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:10,766
into the alley at the village entrance.

193
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,266
Did you see clearly?

194
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,000
I saw clearly.

195
00:18:13,733 --> 00:18:14,766
Let's go take a look.

196
00:18:17,433 --> 00:18:18,033
Look at this.

197
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:32,566
This should be the alley the old man mentioned.

198
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:42,600
This…

199
00:18:47,466 --> 00:18:49,366
There's indeed the aura of the Broken-Tail here.

200
00:18:50,533 --> 00:18:51,600
Those missing men…

201
00:18:51,866 --> 00:18:53,133
should all be connected to the Broken-Tail.

202
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:54,766
I have an idea.

203
00:19:02,966 --> 00:19:04,433
I didn't expect a celestial immortal like you

204
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:06,400
to actually come to my humble shop.

205
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,200
It is truly my greatest honor.

206
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:09,800
I didn't expect either

207
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,833
that I would run into you here.

208
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,633
Since you've come to my little shop,

209
00:19:21,933 --> 00:19:23,633
are you also here to divine good or ill fortune?

210
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,533
Immortal, would you like to make a prediction...

211
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,066
whether this time will be fortunate

212
00:19:28,466 --> 00:19:29,400
or disastrous?

213
00:19:30,066 --> 00:19:31,333
What are you doing in Yishan Town?

214
00:19:31,466 --> 00:19:32,733
Naturally, I'm here to do business.

215
00:19:36,933 --> 00:19:37,766
I'm warning you

216
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,833
don't try any tricks on me.

217
00:19:41,633 --> 00:19:42,933
We haven't met for thousands of years,

218
00:19:43,133 --> 00:19:45,000
and you truly haven't changed one bit.

219
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,600
You still hold such strong hostility

220
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,133
toward us demons.

221
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:53,866
I've already asked around.

222
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,333
Those missing men

223
00:19:55,366 --> 00:19:56,366
all share the same traits—

224
00:19:56,466 --> 00:19:57,366
they like drinking,

225
00:19:57,533 --> 00:19:58,433
and they're lecherous.

226
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,266
How do you know that?

227
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:02,066
A woman. A drunk man.

228
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,233
Is that hard to guess?

229
00:20:03,733 --> 00:20:05,033
No need to ask around.

230
00:20:06,433 --> 00:20:07,500
Then why didn't you say so earlier?

231
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,466
You were the one insisting on asking around.

232
00:20:11,566 --> 00:20:13,066
So have you figured out how you're going to act?

233
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:16,566
You...

234
00:20:16,566 --> 00:20:17,266
what are you doing?

235
00:20:18,266 --> 00:20:19,966
You said you'd play the drunk.

236
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,866
But you don't smell like alcohol at all.

237
00:20:21,866 --> 00:20:23,066
Anyone can tell you're faking.

238
00:20:24,466 --> 00:20:26,200
Good thing I prepared props in advance

239
00:20:26,466 --> 00:20:27,666
to help you get into character quickly.

240
00:20:31,766 --> 00:20:32,800
You're trying to force me to drink again?

241
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:33,866
Come on—drink up.

242
00:20:40,766 --> 00:20:41,500
What?

243
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,800
Didn't drink enough with your senior brother yesterday?

244
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,300
Now you're drinking with me again?

245
00:20:46,533 --> 00:20:47,466
Are you a drunkard?

246
00:20:48,033 --> 00:20:50,300
I've noticed you're oddly hostile toward my senior brother.

247
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:51,533
How did he offend you?

248
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,000
He's the one who said he'd descend to help you.

249
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:57,666
So why is it that at the critical moment,

250
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,200
he's nowhere to be found?

251
00:21:00,633 --> 00:21:01,833
If my senior brother isn't here,

252
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:02,866
he must have his reasons.

253
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,766
This is the way of our Immortal Clan.

254
00:21:04,766 --> 00:21:05,633
You mortals wouldn't understand.

255
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,533
It's just drinking—why so much nonsense?

256
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,300
We've got the "drunk" part covered now.

257
00:21:20,933 --> 00:21:22,033
But what about the "lecherous" part?

258
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:25,966
That's easy to handle.

259
00:21:42,966 --> 00:21:43,833
What are you doing?

260
00:21:44,633 --> 00:21:45,566
Aren't you the one who said

261
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,266
you wanted me to get into character quickly?

262
00:22:51,533 --> 00:22:52,433
For her,

263
00:22:53,366 --> 00:22:55,200
I am willing to give everything.

264
00:23:16,566 --> 00:23:17,400
Beauty.

265
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:18,700
I'm sorry.

266
00:23:19,433 --> 00:23:20,700
Did I hurt you?

267
00:23:21,866 --> 00:23:23,166
It's nothing serious.

268
00:23:23,866 --> 00:23:26,466
It's just my leg that's injured.

269
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:29,233
Since your leg is hurt, my lady,

270
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:31,766
why don't I

271
00:23:32,433 --> 00:23:33,566
escort you home?

272
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:36,066
Thank you, young master.

273
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,600
Xiaoyao.

274
00:23:47,133 --> 00:23:48,166
Such a jerk!

275
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,800
He clearly flirts with girls all the time.

276
00:23:58,566 --> 00:23:59,266
My lady.

277
00:23:59,933 --> 00:24:01,366
Your home is really remote.

278
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,133
This place doesn't look inhabited.

279
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,600
Young master.

280
00:24:05,633 --> 00:24:07,266
Escorting me back like this…

281
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:09,300
Won't your wife mind?

282
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:10,866
Wife?

283
00:24:11,966 --> 00:24:13,566
Just now, I accidentally…

284
00:24:13,566 --> 00:24:15,766
…saw you drinking with a woman in white.

285
00:24:16,433 --> 00:24:17,766
Isn't she your wife?

286
00:24:17,766 --> 00:24:19,000
What wife?

287
00:24:19,433 --> 00:24:20,766
She's just someone I flirted with…

288
00:24:20,766 --> 00:24:22,166
…nothing more.

289
00:24:23,033 --> 00:24:24,766
No beauty on her face.

290
00:24:24,766 --> 00:24:26,466
No figure either.

291
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,333
Rough in manners.

292
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,000
Bad temper too.

293
00:24:30,466 --> 00:24:32,966
How could she compare to you, my lady?

294
00:24:33,733 --> 00:24:34,600
Young master.

295
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,833
I think that girl…

296
00:24:35,866 --> 00:24:37,900
…wasn't as bad as you make her sound.

297
00:24:38,633 --> 00:24:39,633
Let's not talk about her.

298
00:24:40,933 --> 00:24:41,866
How much farther?

299
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:44,433
We're almost there.

300
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:02,566
Chase them!

301
00:25:18,066 --> 00:25:19,666
I've been walking for a whole day and night.

302
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,500
Why am I still circling around here?

303
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:24,166
I must find a way to locate him quickly.

304
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,833
Looks like she's working with that man.

305
00:25:28,666 --> 00:25:30,133
I must not let her find him.

306
00:27:24,766 --> 00:27:26,366
[The Xia Residence]

307
00:27:41,566 --> 00:27:42,766
You're finally back.

308
00:27:43,066 --> 00:27:44,000
Today I made…

309
00:27:44,066 --> 00:27:45,200
…all your favorite dishes.

310
00:27:45,733 --> 00:27:46,266
You…

311
00:27:46,566 --> 00:27:47,300
Weren't you...

312
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:48,466
Come, let's go.

313
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:49,566
Father and Mother are waiting for us.

314
00:27:54,633 --> 00:27:55,100
Come.

315
00:27:56,733 --> 00:27:57,466
Let's eat!

316
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:01,700
Here.

317
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:02,366
Xiaoyao.

318
00:28:02,366 --> 00:28:03,633
This is your favorite braised pork.

319
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:04,500
Try it.

320
00:28:04,533 --> 00:28:05,633
Braised pork is too greasy.

321
00:28:05,933 --> 00:28:06,633
I think it's better to

322
00:28:06,833 --> 00:28:07,866
have some porridge first.

323
00:28:08,033 --> 00:28:09,033
It's lighter.

324
00:28:11,233 --> 00:28:11,633
Here.

325
00:28:11,766 --> 00:28:12,433
It's perfect right now.

326
00:28:12,666 --> 00:28:13,100
Come.

327
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:13,800
Try it.

328
00:28:16,433 --> 00:28:17,766
Father… Mother…

329
00:28:18,133 --> 00:28:18,833
Xiaoyao.

330
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:19,666
Stop talking.

331
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:20,733
Go on, eat up.

332
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:21,400
Eat first.

333
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:22,266
These are all your favorites.

334
00:28:22,266 --> 00:28:22,933
Eat first.

335
00:28:24,966 --> 00:28:25,600
Darling,

336
00:28:25,633 --> 00:28:26,366
try this lotus root.

337
00:28:32,766 --> 00:28:33,233
How is it?

338
00:28:33,966 --> 00:28:34,400
Tasty, isn't it?

339
00:28:34,866 --> 00:28:35,166
Father.

340
00:28:35,266 --> 00:28:35,533
Mother.

341
00:28:35,666 --> 00:28:36,266
You two eat as well.

342
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:37,366
Come, eat quickly.

343
00:28:38,766 --> 00:28:39,666
Come, eat more.

344
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,700
Look how thin you are.

345
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,433
Try this.

346
00:28:42,133 --> 00:28:42,833
Have some of this.

347
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:44,900
Alright.

348
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,533
Eat more.

349
00:28:58,333 --> 00:28:59,066
Darling,

350
00:28:59,766 --> 00:29:01,033
it's getting late.

351
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:02,833
Let's rest early.

352
00:29:03,566 --> 00:29:05,300
Are we… already married?

353
00:29:06,566 --> 00:29:07,366
Darling,

354
00:29:07,866 --> 00:29:08,966
you're confused again.

355
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:11,200
We've always been husband and wife.

356
00:30:41,533 --> 00:30:42,733
My lady…

357
00:30:43,733 --> 00:30:44,933
Come on.

358
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,933
Drink with me.

359
00:31:17,233 --> 00:31:18,900
Do you still want to go home?

360
00:31:19,866 --> 00:31:20,600
No.

361
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:28,000
Another one bites the dust in the boudoir.

362
00:32:07,666 --> 00:32:08,366
Darling,

363
00:32:58,133 --> 00:32:59,266
What kind of demon is this?

364
00:32:59,566 --> 00:33:01,000
Such powerful magic…

365
00:33:01,566 --> 00:33:02,433
I must find a way

366
00:33:02,733 --> 00:33:04,466
to escape this barrier as soon as possible.

367
00:33:05,866 --> 00:33:07,333
A caster of the Fox Clan's mark

368
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,866
can not only hear the other's thoughts

369
00:33:09,466 --> 00:33:11,066
but also sense the other's location.

370
00:33:13,766 --> 00:33:15,366
If I run into danger again,

371
00:33:15,933 --> 00:33:17,666
will he show up like he did last time?

372
00:33:22,866 --> 00:33:24,133
I've temporarily sealed it for you.

373
00:33:24,466 --> 00:33:25,700
He won't be able to sense you for now.

374
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,100
I need to find a way

375
00:33:27,533 --> 00:33:28,600
to break this seal.

376
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,500
The seal is undone.

377
00:33:41,366 --> 00:33:42,566
Xiaoyao.

378
00:33:42,733 --> 00:33:43,833
It's up to you now.

379
00:33:51,966 --> 00:33:52,866
Xiaoyao.

380
00:33:53,166 --> 00:33:54,700
Can you feel it?

381
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:56,566
I need you.

382
00:34:06,533 --> 00:34:07,233
Break!

383
00:34:12,266 --> 00:34:13,400
Xiaoyao…

384
00:34:14,366 --> 00:34:15,566
Save me!

385
00:34:15,733 --> 00:34:16,866
Xiaoyao!

386
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,133
Help me!

387
00:34:19,966 --> 00:34:21,066
Xiaoyao!

388
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:22,600
Save me!

389
00:34:30,866 --> 00:34:31,566
Xiaoyao…

390
00:34:32,133 --> 00:34:33,333
Did you hear me?

391
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:34,566
Come save me, quickly!

392
00:34:35,366 --> 00:34:36,500
This is an illusion.

393
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,200
Xiaoyao…

394
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,033
Xiaoyao…

395
00:34:42,266 --> 00:34:43,200
Where are you going?

396
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:44,466
Xiaoyao…

397
00:34:44,733 --> 00:34:46,266
Are you abandoning Father and Mother?

398
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:51,000
Go!

399
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,933
Xiaoyao, run!

400
00:35:02,566 --> 00:35:03,166
Xiaoyao.

401
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,600
This is your favorite braised pork.

402
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,000
I think

403
00:35:05,266 --> 00:35:06,333
you should have some porridge first.

404
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:07,233
It's lighter.

405
00:35:13,666 --> 00:35:14,000
Well.

406
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,033
Well.

407
00:35:15,266 --> 00:35:17,266
Thank you for this dream reunion with my parents.

408
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:19,566
This is

409
00:35:19,566 --> 00:35:21,166
the best reunion meal I have ever had.

410
00:35:22,566 --> 00:35:23,033
Father.

411
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,133
Mother.

412
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,733
I'm sorry.

413
00:35:28,733 --> 00:35:29,566
I'm leaving now.

414
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:32,733
I'm going to save the one I love most.

415
00:35:38,133 --> 00:35:39,033
Xiaoyao.

416
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,466
Xiaoyao.

417
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:41,966
Xiaoyao.

418
00:35:49,866 --> 00:35:51,733
I can't hold on much longer…

419
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,133
Xiaoyao…

420
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,733
I knew you would come.

421
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,933
Good thing I didn't give up.

422
00:36:11,266 --> 00:36:11,933
I'm sorry.

423
00:36:12,366 --> 00:36:13,100
I came too late.

424
00:36:15,366 --> 00:36:16,800
They trapped me in an illusion.

425
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,100
Inside that illusion,

426
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,800
I saw my deceased parents.

427
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,800
You may not believe this,

428
00:36:22,933 --> 00:36:24,433
but there was another "you" in there.

429
00:36:24,733 --> 00:36:26,000
She could cook just like you.

430
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:27,233
And she was gentler than you.

431
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:30,533
What exactly are you trying to say?

432
00:36:30,766 --> 00:36:31,233
I…

433
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:31,966
I…

434
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,166
I'm trying to say…

435
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:34,966
You've saved me time and time again.

436
00:36:35,666 --> 00:36:36,533
From now on,

437
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,200
I will be the one protecting you.

438
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,200
Too many people have already died.

439
00:37:06,733 --> 00:37:07,566
This price

440
00:37:08,566 --> 00:37:09,233
is far too great.

441
00:37:09,666 --> 00:37:10,266
Sister,

442
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,200
you must not give up.

443
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,533
We're about to succeed.

444
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,366
But…

445
00:37:16,366 --> 00:37:17,700
Brother is about to wake up.

446
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,266
Haven't you always wanted to see him?

447
00:37:24,766 --> 00:37:25,600
Tonight,

448
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,733
we will go catch a few more people.

449
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,500
You were right.

450
00:43:17,033 --> 00:43:18,533
That cave has already been burned down.

451
00:43:19,033 --> 00:43:20,033
The snake demon fears exposure.

452
00:43:20,633 --> 00:43:21,766
They must have found a new place.

453
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:24,533
So where do you think they're hiding?

454
00:43:26,566 --> 00:43:27,466
Through this jade pendant,

455
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:28,933
we're sure to find out something.

456
00:43:31,366 --> 00:43:31,800
Hmm.

457
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:55,333
My lord,

458
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:56,800
you're really alive again.

459
00:43:56,833 --> 00:43:57,333
Yes.

460
00:43:58,466 --> 00:43:59,166
Xi'er,

461
00:43:59,566 --> 00:44:00,300
this time,

462
00:44:00,633 --> 00:44:02,266
we can finally stay together forever.

463
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,133
Xu Lang really didn't lie to me.

464
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:10,800
He did it.

465
00:44:11,133 --> 00:44:12,366
You're really alive again.

466
00:44:14,533 --> 00:44:15,433
Where is Xu Lang?

467
00:44:15,733 --> 00:44:16,666
Where is Xu Lang?

468
00:44:24,033 --> 00:44:24,966
Xu Lang,

469
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,300
he sacrificed himself for me.

470
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:29,933
What?

471
00:44:31,633 --> 00:44:33,466
The Broken-Tail is parasitizing inside Xu Lang.

472
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:34,633
To resurrect me,

473
00:44:35,266 --> 00:44:36,133
besides letting Broken-Tail

474
00:44:36,133 --> 00:44:37,666
absorb enough greed,

475
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:39,500
there is another condition.

476
00:44:40,233 --> 00:44:42,100
That is to attach Broken-Tail to my body.

477
00:44:43,366 --> 00:44:44,600
Xu Lang, that fool.

478
00:44:45,133 --> 00:44:46,333
From the start,

479
00:44:46,666 --> 00:44:48,300
he planned to sacrifice himself

480
00:44:49,033 --> 00:44:50,500
to fulfill the two of us.

481
00:44:51,666 --> 00:44:52,500
So,

482
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:55,000
he drugged me

483
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,800
because he was afraid I would learn the truth.

484
00:44:59,533 --> 00:45:00,966
Before my brother died, he told me

485
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,433
never to tell you.

486
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,800
He was afraid you would be sad.

487
00:45:06,366 --> 00:45:07,366
I never expected

488
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:09,166
he would make such a sacrifice

489
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:11,300
for us.

490
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,300
I'm sorry,

491
00:45:13,866 --> 00:45:14,866
it's all my fault.

492
00:45:14,933 --> 00:45:15,633
My lord.

493
00:45:16,233 --> 00:45:17,366
Don't blame yourself, okay?

494
00:45:17,833 --> 00:45:18,366
It's my fault.

495
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:19,466
It's all my fault.

496
00:45:19,966 --> 00:45:21,166
If I hadn't revealed my true form

497
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,033
on our wedding night

498
00:45:22,033 --> 00:45:22,866
and killed you,

499
00:45:23,233 --> 00:45:25,366
things wouldn't have come to this.

500
00:45:25,733 --> 00:45:26,366
No.

501
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:28,900
You know what?

502
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,333
I never cared that you are a demon.

503
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:36,700
What's wrong?

504
00:45:49,366 --> 00:45:50,200
I've asked around.

505
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,333
This jade pendant is the Xu family heirloom.

506
00:45:53,266 --> 00:45:54,300
That old lady over there

507
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:55,766
is the midwife who delivered

508
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:56,900
the two Xu brothers.

509
00:46:02,466 --> 00:46:03,300
Thank you, Granny.

510
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:06,966
The eldest Xu brother

511
00:46:07,033 --> 00:46:08,066
is named Xu Wei.

512
00:46:08,733 --> 00:46:09,366
Back then,

513
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:11,666
he married a stunningly beautiful wife.

514
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:12,800
Everyone thought

515
00:46:12,966 --> 00:46:14,366
it was a wonderful match.

516
00:46:14,666 --> 00:46:15,566
Who would have thought

517
00:46:15,733 --> 00:46:16,733
on the wedding night,

518
00:46:17,266 --> 00:46:19,100
Xu Wei suddenly dropped dead.

519
00:46:20,233 --> 00:46:20,900
He died.

520
00:46:25,966 --> 00:46:26,766
I heard

521
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,466
it was his younger brother, Xu Lang.

522
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:30,300
Who secretly got involved

523
00:46:31,033 --> 00:46:32,266
with his brother's wife.

524
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:33,733
The two of them conspired

525
00:46:33,866 --> 00:46:34,966
to kill Xu Wei.

526
00:46:35,633 --> 00:46:37,500
If they truly loved each other,

527
00:46:37,933 --> 00:46:39,133
they could have just spoken up openly.

528
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,700
Why did they have to kill Xu Wei

529
00:46:41,933 --> 00:46:43,133
and take a life?

530
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:44,333
Who knows?

531
00:46:44,733 --> 00:46:46,066
Anyway, after Xu Wei died,

532
00:46:47,033 --> 00:46:48,600
the two people disappeared together.

533
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:53,233
Granny,

534
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,266
do you know

535
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:55,633
where the Xu family residence is?

536
00:47:04,566 --> 00:47:06,266
[Late My lord Xu Wei's Memorial Tablet]

537
00:47:06,433 --> 00:47:08,066
The house has been abandoned.

538
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:10,200
But look at this memorial tablet,

539
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,100
it's clearly been tended to.

540
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:13,866
You mean

541
00:47:14,133 --> 00:47:15,600
someone has been making offerings to Xu Wei?

542
00:47:18,266 --> 00:47:19,166
Could it be the snake demon?

543
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:21,533
If what the old lady said is true,

544
00:47:22,666 --> 00:47:23,966
then that wedding night,

545
00:47:25,166 --> 00:47:26,766
the snake demon accidentally killed Xu Wei.

546
00:47:27,233 --> 00:47:28,733
So who does the snake demon truly love?

547
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:30,000
The older brother or the younger one?

548
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,333
Can you not be so gossipy?

549
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,300
Anyway, I don't believe

550
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,100
about her eloping.

551
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,433
Look at this memorial tablet.

552
00:47:37,666 --> 00:47:38,766
Wiped clean.

553
00:47:39,066 --> 00:47:39,766
That means

554
00:47:39,866 --> 00:47:41,500
she must love the older brother.

555
00:47:42,233 --> 00:47:43,333
Actually, when the snake demon

556
00:47:43,633 --> 00:47:44,933
took me to the cave,

557
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,233
I vaguely heard

558
00:47:46,266 --> 00:47:47,533
her say she had no choice.

559
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,100
Maybe she wants to use the Broken-Tail

560
00:47:50,533 --> 00:47:51,600
to revive her husband?

561
00:47:52,233 --> 00:47:53,333
That's a possibility.

562
00:47:56,233 --> 00:47:56,966
Someone's here.

563
00:48:29,666 --> 00:48:30,400
This...

564
00:48:31,433 --> 00:48:32,833
might not be needed anymore.

565
00:49:02,733 --> 00:49:03,866
Thank you, madam.

566
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,033
She doesn't seem that bad after all.

567
00:49:10,233 --> 00:49:11,333
Take a look, madam.

568
00:49:15,433 --> 00:49:15,866
This...

569
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:16,966
Madam,

570
00:49:16,966 --> 00:49:17,966
you have excellent taste.

571
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:19,366
Who are you making clothes for?

572
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:20,933
For my husband.

573
00:49:21,133 --> 00:49:22,033
I'm making a wedding dress.

574
00:49:22,633 --> 00:49:23,366
Congratulations then.

575
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,433
Thank you.

576
00:49:25,433 --> 00:49:25,933
My lord.

577
00:49:26,333 --> 00:49:27,566
Come quickly and try on this wedding dress.

578
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:29,700
How is it?

579
00:49:30,166 --> 00:49:30,833
Does it fit well?

580
00:49:31,233 --> 00:49:31,866
It fits perfectly.

581
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,733
The wedding dress my wife specially made for me.

582
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:34,800
How could it not fit?

583
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:35,700
Here.

584
00:49:36,066 --> 00:49:36,733
Try this too.

585
00:49:36,733 --> 00:49:38,033
The pastries I made for you.

586
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:44,033
My dear.

587
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:44,700
You have some too.

588
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:46,533
You eat first.

589
00:49:47,233 --> 00:49:48,733
I'll go try on my wedding gown too.

590
00:50:56,433 --> 00:50:57,466
But she still

591
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,033
fell in love with you.

592
00:51:02,733 --> 00:51:03,566
Be careful.

593
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:10,633
Come.

594
00:51:15,966 --> 00:51:16,633
Thank you, miss,

595
00:51:16,833 --> 00:51:17,666
for saving my brother.

596
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:19,266
It was nothing.

597
00:51:19,366 --> 00:51:20,500
No need to be so polite, sir.

598
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:22,600
Brother,

599
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,500
rest in peace.

600
00:52:00,566 --> 00:52:01,366
My lord.

601
00:52:03,133 --> 00:52:03,966
My lord.

602
00:52:06,766 --> 00:52:08,266
Today is our wedding day.

603
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,066
How could you fall asleep?

604
00:52:10,733 --> 00:52:11,533
Our wedding.

605
00:52:12,133 --> 00:52:12,933
Yes.

606
00:52:13,266 --> 00:52:14,066
Our wedding.

607
00:52:15,133 --> 00:52:16,166
I've waited for this moment

608
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:17,200
for so long.

609
00:52:17,933 --> 00:52:18,933
Weren't we

610
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,366
already married once before?

611
00:52:21,366 --> 00:52:22,033
It's different.

612
00:52:22,466 --> 00:52:23,800
Last time we got married,

613
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:25,433
both of us had accidents.

614
00:52:25,866 --> 00:52:26,500
This time,

615
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,133
I want to make up for the last time.

616
00:52:29,166 --> 00:52:29,666
Here.

617
00:53:26,166 --> 00:53:27,200
It must be Xu Lang.

618
00:53:27,366 --> 00:53:28,100
He prepared the wine.

619
00:53:28,133 --> 00:53:28,633
My dear.

620
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,400
My dear.

621
00:53:31,233 --> 00:53:31,866
My dear.

622
00:53:32,133 --> 00:53:33,133
My dear, are you okay?

623
00:53:39,933 --> 00:53:40,766
Don't be like this.

624
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:42,233
My dear, wake up!

625
00:53:42,233 --> 00:53:42,933
My dear!

626
00:53:43,366 --> 00:53:44,200
Snake demon, stop!

627
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:50,633
Don't kill her!

628
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,533
Let her go!

629
00:53:52,066 --> 00:53:53,166
This snake demon has harmed many.

630
00:53:53,566 --> 00:53:54,866
So many innocent people.

631
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:55,966
Today,

632
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:57,500
we carry out justice.

633
00:53:58,766 --> 00:53:59,433
Stop!

634
00:53:59,933 --> 00:54:00,866
Don't kill her!

635
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:01,900
All those wicked deeds

636
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:03,133
were done by me.

637
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,300
I pushed her to use poison and illusions

638
00:54:05,466 --> 00:54:06,600
to draw out people's greed.

639
00:54:06,933 --> 00:54:07,433
It was me.

640
00:54:07,466 --> 00:54:08,233
All me!

641
00:54:08,366 --> 00:54:09,200
You let her go!

642
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,633
You let her go!

643
00:54:11,066 --> 00:54:12,466
Aren't you supposed to be a dead man?

644
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:14,300
Then how did you do all that?

645
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:16,966
Because...

646
00:54:17,633 --> 00:54:18,166
Those things...

647
00:54:18,533 --> 00:54:19,933
Those things were all done by Xu Lang.

648
00:54:20,133 --> 00:54:21,266
He did them all by himself.

649
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,000
Please let the two of us go.

650
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:24,966
You finally admit it.

651
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,900
Take a look at your own face.

652
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,400
returned to his original appearance.

653
00:55:37,566 --> 00:55:38,566
It's you.

654
00:55:39,666 --> 00:55:40,933
We're not here to fight you.

655
00:55:42,166 --> 00:55:43,600
Although the Broken-Tail's power is strong,

656
00:55:43,866 --> 00:55:45,700
it cannot bring the dead back to life.

657
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:49,766
You should think about

658
00:55:50,433 --> 00:55:51,733
who the person you're marrying

659
00:55:52,733 --> 00:55:53,600
really is.

660
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:57,866
Thank you.

661
00:55:58,566 --> 00:55:59,633
If it weren't for you,

662
00:56:00,066 --> 00:56:01,866
I might still be kept in the dark.

663
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,366
You two are here for the Broken-Tail, right?

664
00:56:04,666 --> 00:56:05,233
Exactly.

665
00:56:06,733 --> 00:56:07,733
You helped me.

666
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:09,766
I'll persuade Xu Lang

667
00:56:10,733 --> 00:56:12,000
to return the Broken-Tail to you.

668
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:14,466
I've done many terrible deeds.

669
00:56:15,166 --> 00:56:16,200
I deserve death.

670
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:18,100
But before I die,

671
00:56:19,433 --> 00:56:20,633
could I beg you two

672
00:56:21,066 --> 00:56:22,000
to do one thing for me?

673
00:56:24,666 --> 00:56:31,966
[Tomb of Xu Wei, My Late Husband]

674
00:56:44,733 --> 00:56:46,566
Was everything just now an illusion?

675
00:56:50,666 --> 00:56:52,433
You actually teamed up with outsiders against me.

676
00:56:53,333 --> 00:56:54,066
Kneel down.

677
00:56:55,166 --> 00:56:56,400
Apologize to your brother.

678
00:56:58,733 --> 00:56:59,400
Let go of me.

679
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,533
Don't be deceived by them.

680
00:57:01,566 --> 00:57:02,266
Shut up.

681
00:57:02,966 --> 00:57:04,233
I told you to apologize.

682
00:57:05,966 --> 00:57:06,966
Do you know

683
00:57:07,566 --> 00:57:10,033
your brother was protecting you that day?

684
00:57:15,333 --> 00:57:16,533
You can eat me,

685
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:18,433
but please spare Xu Lang.

686
00:57:19,133 --> 00:57:19,466
Brother.

687
00:57:19,566 --> 00:57:20,200
Sister.

688
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,200
Are you both okay?

689
00:57:21,733 --> 00:57:22,566
It's nothing.

690
00:57:27,233 --> 00:57:27,933
What did you say?

691
00:57:31,566 --> 00:57:32,066
No.

692
00:57:33,766 --> 00:57:34,266
That's not it.

693
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:36,133
This isn't true.

694
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:37,633
Brother.

695
00:57:38,366 --> 00:57:39,200
I was wrong.

696
00:57:39,566 --> 00:57:41,600
I didn't mean to cause your death.

697
00:57:45,233 --> 00:57:46,500
The Broken-Tail on you

698
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,566
will only harm you.

699
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,466
After I'm gone,

700
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:53,733
return the Broken-Tail to them.

701
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:56,200
Shen Xi,

702
00:57:56,566 --> 00:57:57,233
what are you doing?

703
00:57:57,433 --> 00:57:58,466
Shen Xi, what are you doing?

704
00:57:59,066 --> 00:57:59,700
Don't.

705
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:00,633
Don't.

706
00:58:01,333 --> 00:58:02,033
Shen Xi.

707
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:03,433
Shen Xi.

708
00:58:05,166 --> 00:58:06,000
Shen Xi.

709
00:58:07,333 --> 00:58:08,266
Shen Xi.

710
00:58:13,233 --> 00:58:14,100
Spare Xu Lang.

711
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,233
All the mistakes,

712
00:58:17,166 --> 00:58:18,333
I will bear them alone.

713
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:21,833
Shen Xi.

714
00:58:44,566 --> 00:58:45,366
Thank you, miss,

715
00:58:45,366 --> 00:58:46,266
for saving my brother.

716
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:47,800
It was nothing.

717
00:58:47,966 --> 00:58:49,166
No need to be so polite, sir.

718
00:58:53,166 --> 00:58:54,000
As a token of gratitude,

719
00:58:54,333 --> 00:58:55,266
this is for you.

720
00:59:02,166 --> 00:59:03,200
Xu Wei,

721
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:05,900
wait for me.

722
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:21,733
Shen Xi.

723
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:25,433
Shen Xi,

724
00:59:27,933 --> 00:59:28,733
wait for me.

725
00:59:48,766 --> 00:59:49,466
Xiaoyao.

726
01:00:39,633 --> 01:00:41,166
Why do you want this fox demon's memories?

727
01:00:53,833 --> 01:00:55,100
Unrequited love,

728
01:00:55,366 --> 01:00:56,766
yet unwilling to let go,

729
01:00:57,066 --> 01:00:58,800
a lifetime burdened by greedy affection.

730
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:02,100
Is this really worth it?

731
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,233
Xu Lang has malicious intentions.

732
01:01:05,233 --> 01:01:06,700
He doesn't understand what love is at all.

733
01:01:08,433 --> 01:01:10,566
Then what do you think true love is?

734
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,533
True love...

735
01:01:14,066 --> 01:01:15,700
I think it's...

736
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,033
at least not betraying each other.

737
01:01:20,833 --> 01:01:21,500
What about you?

738
01:01:25,466 --> 01:01:27,366
Why ask me such a complicated question?

739
01:01:28,033 --> 01:01:29,433
I'm so innocent,

740
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,833
and I've never experienced marriage,

741
01:01:32,633 --> 01:01:34,133
so how would I know what true love is?

742
01:01:34,466 --> 01:01:36,366
When you flirt with girls,

743
01:01:36,833 --> 01:01:37,833
your lines

744
01:01:38,266 --> 01:01:41,400
are cheesier than anything in the romance books.

745
01:01:41,833 --> 01:01:42,833
How am I cheesy?

746
01:01:43,233 --> 01:01:43,966
How am I greasy?

747
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:46,666
Forget it, let's not talk about this.

748
01:01:46,833 --> 01:01:47,900
My wine is gone.

749
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:48,966
Go and get me another jug.

750
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:51,866
Alright.

751
01:01:51,866 --> 01:01:53,166
Seeing how you're helping me like this,

752
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:53,900
I'll go.

753
01:02:01,866 --> 01:02:03,800
If you remember our past…

754
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,666
You'll probably be disappointed in me.

755
01:02:23,366 --> 01:02:24,100
Miss.

756
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:25,600
May I help you?

757
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,633
I feel a connection with you.

758
01:02:28,033 --> 01:02:29,100
So I'll give you some advice.

759
01:02:29,466 --> 01:02:31,966
Cherish the days you spend with your beloved.

760
01:02:32,466 --> 01:02:33,566
Soon…

761
01:02:33,633 --> 01:02:36,166
That little fairy by your side will disappear.

762
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:37,700
Stop right there.

763
01:02:38,266 --> 01:02:39,266
Who exactly are you?

764
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:40,633
Explain it to me clearly.

765
01:02:40,866 --> 01:02:42,400
What do you mean Yao Ling'er will disappear?

766
01:02:44,233 --> 01:02:46,700
If you want the answer, follow me.

767
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,300
The answer you seek is inside.

768
01:02:55,666 --> 01:02:56,400
See for yourself.

769
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,466
Aren't you going to think it over?

770
01:03:31,633 --> 01:03:33,233
With a mortal body like yours,

771
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:36,066
it's already difficult to bear the spirit of a Qingqiu fox.

772
01:03:36,833 --> 01:03:38,733
Now, enduring the power of four Broken-Tails,

773
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:40,200
you haven't been backlashed at all.

774
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:42,033
You should really thank

775
01:03:42,066 --> 01:03:43,700
the little fairy by your side.

776
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,300
Where did Xia Xiaoyao go to get wine?

777
01:03:53,166 --> 01:03:54,233
Why isn't he back yet?

778
01:03:56,366 --> 01:03:57,100
You are...

779
01:03:57,666 --> 01:03:58,366
Little Food Immortal.

780
01:03:58,633 --> 01:04:00,033
We finally meet.

781
01:04:57,433 --> 01:04:58,866
Guess who I just met?

782
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,400
I'm not interested in your affairs.

783
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,000
What if I say...

784
01:05:03,433 --> 01:05:05,666
I just met your adorable junior sister?

785
01:05:06,433 --> 01:05:07,433
If she finds out...

786
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:09,600
that we knew each other thousands of years ago…

787
01:05:09,966 --> 01:05:11,366
What do you think her reaction would be?

788
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
I'm warning you.

789
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:14,933
Don't involve my junior sister.

790
01:05:17,266 --> 01:05:19,466
I've brought what you wanted.

791
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:23,633
Here.

792
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:49,566
but if you try any tricks

793
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:51,900
right under my nose,

794
01:06:05,633 --> 01:06:07,233
is just about to begin.

795
01:07:40,433 --> 01:07:42,266
who has saved your life again and again.

796
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:43,633
Senior Brother.

797
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,200
Don't.

798
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:03,333
Speak.

799
01:08:03,566 --> 01:08:04,433
What do you want?

800
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:05,700
I want to be beautiful.

801
01:08:06,066 --> 01:08:07,800
I want to make men unable to resist me,

802
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:09,500
regretting they ever left me.

803
01:08:09,833 --> 01:08:10,500
Fine.

804
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:11,700
What will you trade for it?

805
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:13,966
Ten years of my lifespan.

806
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,700
Thank you, Lady Zhu!

807
01:08:23,966 --> 01:08:25,933
I am willing to trade my lifespan

808
01:08:25,966 --> 01:08:27,066
for immense wealth.

809
01:08:41,066 --> 01:08:42,133
This frozen land

810
01:08:42,533 --> 01:08:44,233
can truly refine my foxfire

811
01:08:44,533 --> 01:08:46,133
to its highest realm?

812
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:48,100
Of course.

813
01:09:07,966 --> 01:09:09,266
You dare betray me.

814
01:09:09,533 --> 01:09:10,666
So what if I did?

815
01:09:43,266 --> 01:09:44,133
Thank you, senior brother.

816
01:09:44,466 --> 01:09:45,666
I told you long ago.

817
01:09:45,933 --> 01:09:47,233
Demons are demons.

818
01:09:47,733 --> 01:09:48,666
Born with a dark nature.

819
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:50,400
You did so much for him.

820
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:51,700
But in the end.

821
01:09:51,966 --> 01:09:52,900
He still wanted to kill you.

822
01:09:52,933 --> 01:09:54,400
It's because he remembered his past life.

823
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,033
And harbored resentment toward me.

824
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,900
The plum mark left by the Heavenly Venerable

825
01:10:06,166 --> 01:10:07,366
only has one petal remaining.

826
01:10:08,266 --> 01:10:10,266
Your immortal body is reaching its limit.

827
01:10:11,766 --> 01:10:12,633
What's left...

828
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:14,033
Let me handle it.

829
01:10:14,466 --> 01:10:15,300
Have a good rest.

830
01:10:16,133 --> 01:10:16,833
But...

831
01:10:16,833 --> 01:10:17,666
But what?

832
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:19,700
Just listen to me.

833
01:10:20,933 --> 01:10:21,600
I...

834
01:10:31,766 --> 01:10:33,266
Our shop is closed.

835
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:34,533
Come back tomorrow.

836
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:35,833
Who exactly are you?

837
01:10:36,166 --> 01:10:36,800
How could you know

838
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,133
the past of the Qingqiu fox and Ling'er?

839
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:40,766
I said.

840
01:10:40,766 --> 01:10:42,066
Come back tomorrow.

841
01:10:42,333 --> 01:10:43,700
What if I refuse?

842
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:52,833
You actually have five Broken-Tails.

843
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:54,600
Who are you?

844
01:10:55,733 --> 01:10:57,533
Right now, you're no match for me.

845
01:10:57,966 --> 01:10:59,400
I advise you not to overestimate yourself.

846
01:10:59,966 --> 01:11:00,800
If we really fight...

847
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,466
it's still uncertain who will win or lose.

848
01:11:03,333 --> 01:11:04,766
I suggest you just tell me honestly.

849
01:11:05,533 --> 01:11:06,666
What exactly is your purpose?

850
01:11:06,833 --> 01:11:07,833
What are you going to do to Ling'er?

851
01:11:10,566 --> 01:11:12,100
Didn't expect you to still

852
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:14,533
care so much about that little fairy.

853
01:11:15,066 --> 01:11:16,100
Then guess,

854
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:13,700
Are you crazy?

855
01:13:14,133 --> 01:13:15,133
She risked her life

856
01:13:15,133 --> 01:13:16,766
to save you again and again.

857
01:13:18,766 --> 01:13:20,633
No matter what she did in her past life.

858
01:13:21,266 --> 01:13:22,433
At least in this life,

859
01:13:23,266 --> 01:13:24,866
she never harmed me in the slightest.

860
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,500
His hatred arose because of me.

861
01:13:33,266 --> 01:13:34,566
I will use my own way

862
01:13:34,866 --> 01:13:36,100
to dissolve his hatred.

863
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:38,600
I beg you, Heavenly Venerable,

864
01:13:39,333 --> 01:13:40,533
spare his life.

865
01:13:42,366 --> 01:13:44,466
Now he has remembered everything.

866
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:45,866
What should I do?

867
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:46,933
Fox demon!

868
01:13:50,266 --> 01:13:52,166
Let Senior Brother handle the rest.

869
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:53,500
Just listen to me.

870
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,066
Oh no.

871
01:13:56,266 --> 01:13:57,633
What is senior brother going to do to him?

872
01:13:58,166 --> 01:13:58,900
No.

873
01:13:59,166 --> 01:14:00,400
I must find him quickly.

874
01:14:11,633 --> 01:14:12,900
This amount of lifespan

875
01:14:13,066 --> 01:14:14,166
is still far from enough.

876
01:14:14,766 --> 01:14:15,966
Once people have desire,

877
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:17,633
they just can't resist temptation.

878
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:19,733
As long as we

879
01:14:20,066 --> 01:14:21,400
can satisfy their desires,

880
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,166
they will offer more

881
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:24,533
precious lifespan

882
01:14:24,566 --> 01:14:25,800
to exchange with us.

883
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:26,800
Master,

884
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:28,100
just wait half a day.

885
01:14:28,933 --> 01:14:29,566
Wait?

886
01:14:29,866 --> 01:14:31,366
I don't have that much time to wait.

887
01:14:32,766 --> 01:14:33,500
Then I also

888
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:34,700
have another plan.

889
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:37,400
Do you have a way?

890
01:15:24,766 --> 01:15:26,200
Where did Xiaoyao go?

891
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:28,133
Why can't I find him anywhere?

892
01:15:30,066 --> 01:15:31,066
There was still water in the well yesterday,

893
01:15:31,066 --> 01:15:33,066
but today it suddenly became a dry well.

894
01:15:33,433 --> 01:15:34,466
Not just the well.

895
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:35,666
The river dried up too.

896
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:37,233
Really?

897
01:15:37,266 --> 01:15:38,633
What's going on here?

898
01:15:39,533 --> 01:15:42,000
I must find Xiaoyao quickly.

899
01:15:59,066 --> 01:15:59,866
I...

900
01:16:03,933 --> 01:16:04,733
I'm sor...

901
01:16:09,733 --> 01:16:10,500
I'm sorry.

902
01:16:12,066 --> 01:16:13,400
I was too impulsive before.

903
01:16:13,633 --> 01:16:14,633
I hurt you.

904
01:16:16,133 --> 01:16:17,033
This jug of wine

905
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:18,500
is my way of apologizing.

906
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:21,466
I should be the one apologizing.

907
01:16:23,066 --> 01:16:24,900
I did hurt him back then,

908
01:16:25,633 --> 01:16:27,366
though it wasn't my intention.

909
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:29,066
Moreover,

910
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:30,633
I approached you

911
01:16:30,633 --> 01:16:32,100
with an ulterior motive.

912
01:16:33,733 --> 01:16:35,166
You're right to hate me.

913
01:16:36,066 --> 01:16:37,266
I've thought it through.

914
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:40,500
What happened between you and the Qingqiu fox

915
01:16:41,333 --> 01:16:43,133
has nothing to do with me.

916
01:16:43,333 --> 01:16:44,233
And I won't hold it against you.

917
01:16:47,766 --> 01:16:49,766
I don't expect full forgiveness.

918
01:16:50,533 --> 01:16:51,966
After you find all the Broken-Tails,

919
01:16:52,366 --> 01:16:53,800
you can deal with me as you wish.

920
01:16:54,066 --> 01:16:54,900
How about that?

921
01:16:58,433 --> 01:16:59,633
The remaining five Broken-Tails

922
01:17:00,433 --> 01:17:01,500
are all in that woman's hands.

923
01:17:02,733 --> 01:17:03,466
What did you say?

924
01:17:03,633 --> 01:17:03,966
She...

925
01:17:05,133 --> 01:17:06,466
She has five Broken-Tails?

926
01:17:06,566 --> 01:17:06,900
Yes.

927
01:17:07,633 --> 01:17:08,833
Hurry, let's go!

928
01:17:08,866 --> 01:17:10,033
Lady Zhu is giving us water.

929
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:12,466
Lady Zhu is granting us water!

930
01:17:13,466 --> 01:17:14,266
Lady Zhu...

931
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,133
Lady Zhu is granting water, hurry up!

932
01:17:16,133 --> 01:17:16,933
Let's go!

933
01:17:18,633 --> 01:17:19,733
Jing Yu.

934
01:17:20,533 --> 01:17:21,266
Jing Yu.

935
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:23,800
Jing Yu.

936
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:25,400
Jing Yu.

937
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:26,833
Jing Yu.

938
01:17:27,366 --> 01:17:27,866
Jing Yu.

939
01:17:29,566 --> 01:17:30,166
Jing Yu.

940
01:17:30,633 --> 01:17:32,666
Jing Yu, wake up! Jing Yu!

941
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:33,333
Jing Yu.

942
01:17:42,566 --> 01:17:44,066
Qingqiu fox.

943
01:17:51,233 --> 01:17:51,866
Today,

944
01:17:52,533 --> 01:17:53,566
Lady Zhu

945
01:17:53,933 --> 01:17:54,766
can give you water.

946
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:56,000
But,

947
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,233
you must trade ten years of your lifespan for it.

948
01:17:58,566 --> 01:17:59,366
For this jug of water,

949
01:17:59,633 --> 01:18:01,433
she actually wants ten years of our lives?

950
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:03,533
This woman is truly wicked!

951
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:05,533
She's using water to threaten the people.

952
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:07,033
Could it be…

953
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:10,100
that her Broken-Tail relies on absorbing their life force?

954
01:18:11,033 --> 01:18:12,766
She deliberately created the drought beforehand.

955
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:14,333
In the face of drought,

956
01:18:14,766 --> 01:18:15,666
the desire to survive

957
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:17,733
can make people willing to give up anything.

958
01:18:18,233 --> 01:18:19,166
Then what should we do?

959
01:18:19,566 --> 01:18:20,766
Her magic power

960
01:18:20,766 --> 01:18:21,966
is stronger than both of us combined.

961
01:18:22,166 --> 01:18:24,266
Ten years of lifespan is far too much!

962
01:18:26,366 --> 01:18:27,500
I'm not trading mine.

963
01:18:28,733 --> 01:18:29,666
I refuse.

964
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:34,200
Everyone, don't listen to her!

965
01:18:34,733 --> 01:18:35,666
She's a demon!

966
01:18:35,933 --> 01:18:37,466
She used sorcery to create the drought,

967
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:38,800
and now uses water to threaten you.

968
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:40,933
You must not fall for her trick!

969
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:41,833
What?

970
01:18:42,033 --> 01:18:43,100
You say she's a demon?

971
01:18:43,433 --> 01:18:44,366
Do you have proof?

972
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:46,200
Exactly—baseless accusations!

973
01:18:46,433 --> 01:18:47,733
You look more like a demon than she does.

974
01:18:48,133 --> 01:18:49,333
Are you giving us water?

975
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:50,800
How dare you slander Lady Zhu?

976
01:18:51,933 --> 01:18:52,866
Are you giving us water to drink?

977
01:18:53,366 --> 01:18:54,433
Exactly!

978
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:56,766
Bring us water, then!

979
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:00,300
She's the demon.

980
01:19:03,966 --> 01:19:05,066
I bestow water upon them.

981
01:19:05,833 --> 01:19:07,533
And they trade their most precious thing for it.

982
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:08,766
Willingly on both sides.

983
01:19:08,766 --> 01:19:09,633
A fair exchange.

984
01:19:10,333 --> 01:19:11,933
Instead of meddling in their choices,

985
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:13,700
you should worry more about yourselves.

986
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:17,200
You're still protecting her like this.

987
01:19:17,966 --> 01:19:19,433
It seems my warnings to you

988
01:19:19,733 --> 01:19:21,733
went completely unheeded.

989
01:19:26,733 --> 01:19:27,433
Let's go.

990
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:30,966
Why did they leave?

991
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:38,433
Well?

992
01:19:39,533 --> 01:19:40,833
Just as we guessed.

993
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:42,733
Everyone, don't listen to her!

994
01:19:43,166 --> 01:19:44,033
She's a demon!

995
01:19:44,333 --> 01:19:45,666
She used sorcery to create the drought,

996
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,400
and now uses water to threaten you.

997
01:19:47,633 --> 01:19:49,633
You must not fall for her trick!

998
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:00,900
It's most likely this demon tree

999
01:20:01,033 --> 01:20:02,333
that caused the drought.

1000
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,066
Let me see what this demon tree truly is.

1001
01:20:22,533 --> 01:20:24,033
Quite a harvest today.

1002
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:25,733
This trick works wonderfully.

1003
01:20:26,133 --> 01:20:27,233
You've done well.

1004
01:20:28,933 --> 01:20:30,066
Thank you for the praise, Master.

1005
01:20:37,033 --> 01:20:38,433
I truly underestimated them.

1006
01:20:39,233 --> 01:20:40,633
They were creating a diversion.

1007
01:20:40,966 --> 01:20:41,766
Master, rest assured.

1008
01:20:42,033 --> 01:20:42,733
I will

1009
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:44,133
take care of it immediately.

1010
01:20:44,833 --> 01:20:45,566
Mind your limits.

1011
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:46,500
Yes.

1012
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:03,066
Why is it getting foggy?

1013
01:21:03,566 --> 01:21:04,800
This fog is strange.

1014
01:21:15,133 --> 01:21:16,133
Xiaoyao.

1015
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:18,300
Xiaoyao.

1016
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:19,700
Where are you?

1017
01:21:20,566 --> 01:21:21,300
Ling'er.

1018
01:21:22,366 --> 01:21:23,600
Where did you go, Xiaoyao?

1019
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:24,933
Ling'er.

1020
01:21:26,066 --> 01:21:26,600
Xiaoyao.

1021
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:27,133
Ling'er.

1022
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:28,500
Where are you, Ling'er?

1023
01:21:38,133 --> 01:21:38,933
Xiaoyao.

1024
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:41,700
Where did you go?

1025
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,266
Xiaoyao.

1026
01:21:44,433 --> 01:21:45,266
Xiaoyao.

1027
01:21:45,766 --> 01:21:46,633
Stop fooling around.

1028
01:21:46,933 --> 01:21:48,133
Come out, now.

1029
01:21:48,533 --> 01:21:49,333
Come out!

1030
01:21:49,533 --> 01:21:50,266
Stop messing around.

1031
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:51,333
Ling'er.

1032
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:53,133
Xiaoyao.

1033
01:21:54,733 --> 01:21:55,266
Ling'er.

1034
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:56,933
Stop fooling around.

1035
01:21:57,166 --> 01:21:57,966
Come out quickly.

1036
01:21:58,800 --> 01:21:59,333
Ling'er.

1037
01:22:03,533 --> 01:22:04,366
Xiaoyao.

1038
01:22:04,733 --> 01:22:05,800
Where did you just go?

1039
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:06,533
I've been looking for you...

1040
01:22:09,933 --> 01:22:10,733
Great Fox.

1041
01:22:11,766 --> 01:22:12,466
Ling'er.

1042
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:18,100
It's you.

1043
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:20,233
How are you here?

1044
01:22:21,133 --> 01:22:22,066
What about Xia Xiaoyao?

1045
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:23,033
How come

1046
01:22:24,233 --> 01:22:25,700
you fell in love with someone else so quickly?

1047
01:22:27,833 --> 01:22:28,500
Where's Ling'er?

1048
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:30,100
Where did you take her?

1049
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:31,700
You can barely protect yourself,

1050
01:22:31,966 --> 01:22:33,466
and yet you're worrying about your beloved.

1051
01:22:34,833 --> 01:22:35,866
Hand her over now.

1052
01:22:36,166 --> 01:22:37,200
I'll give you a choice.

1053
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:39,633
Your family's murderer or Yao Ling'er.

1054
01:22:39,966 --> 01:22:41,100
You can only choose one.

1055
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:43,200
You know who killed my entire family?

1056
01:22:45,833 --> 01:22:47,100
Of course I do.

1057
01:22:48,433 --> 01:22:49,233
And

1058
01:22:49,433 --> 01:22:50,566
I'm very familiar with them too.

1059
01:22:57,566 --> 01:22:58,566
No…

1060
01:22:58,833 --> 01:22:59,933
This is an illusion.

1061
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:01,300
Xiaoyao.

1062
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:02,166
Stop shouting.

1063
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:05,233
I killed him.

1064
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,300
What?

1065
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:10,566
Who is it really?

1066
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:13,833
They definitely sent a group of assassins,

1067
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:16,600
but unfortunately, they failed to kill you.

1068
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:19,433
You sent people to kill my parents

1069
01:23:21,133 --> 01:23:22,533
and wipe out my entire Xia family.

1070
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:24,500
Impossible.

1071
01:23:24,733 --> 01:23:25,666
Now it's your turn.

1072
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:27,700
I told you before

1073
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,266
that I never want to see you again.

1074
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:31,633
Or else,

1075
01:23:31,833 --> 01:23:33,233
I will kill you.

1076
01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:37,833
I was imprisoned by the Immortal Realm for three thousand years,

1077
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:40,300
enduring endless torment and humiliation.

1078
01:23:40,733 --> 01:23:42,433
You were the only one I trusted.

1079
01:23:43,133 --> 01:23:44,033
I didn't expect

1080
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:46,233
that you would also try to take my Foxfire.

1081
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:47,400
Why?

1082
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:49,133
Weren't you seeking revenge?

1083
01:23:50,366 --> 01:23:51,600
I'll kill you.

1084
01:23:55,966 --> 01:23:57,200
We have no grievances or grudges.

1085
01:23:57,433 --> 01:23:58,833
Why did you kill my parents?

1086
01:23:58,966 --> 01:24:00,000
I'm sorry.

1087
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,100
Great Fox.

1088
01:24:01,733 --> 01:24:03,000
I'm sorry.

1089
01:24:03,533 --> 01:24:04,266
Good.

1090
01:24:04,766 --> 01:24:05,666
That's it.

1091
01:24:06,133 --> 01:24:07,133
Kill her.

1092
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:13,800
Before I die, can you tell me

1093
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,500
what you did to Xiaoyao?

1094
01:24:17,033 --> 01:24:17,700
Hurry.

1095
01:24:17,833 --> 01:24:18,566
Just kill me quickly.

1096
01:24:19,366 --> 01:24:20,366
Get it over with.

1097
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:22,500
Xiaoyao.

1098
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:28,433
Ling'er is in danger.

1099
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:31,900
Why did it stop?

1100
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:37,600
Kill me now.

1101
01:24:37,833 --> 01:24:39,100
Your enemy is right in front of you.

1102
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:40,433
Yet you don't dare take revenge.

1103
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:42,066
No wonder the Xia family was wiped out.

1104
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:44,000
It's because each of you is a coward.

1105
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:45,000
Shut your mouth.

1106
01:24:46,966 --> 01:24:48,100
Xiaoyao.

1107
01:24:48,133 --> 01:24:48,733
Save me.

1108
01:24:48,733 --> 01:24:49,600
Have you forgotten...

1109
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:50,200
Xiaoyao.

1110
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:51,433
how your parents were killed?

1111
01:24:52,033 --> 01:24:53,766
They were hacked to death.

1112
01:25:05,933 --> 01:25:07,000
You're fake.

1113
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:20,133
Ling'er.

1114
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:22,500
Xiaoyao.

1115
01:25:22,766 --> 01:25:23,500
Why is it you?

1116
01:25:24,333 --> 01:25:25,000
Are you okay?

1117
01:26:10,433 --> 01:26:11,033
Found it.

1118
01:26:32,433 --> 01:26:33,833
It must be this demon tree

1119
01:26:34,533 --> 01:26:36,066
that caused the drought.

1120
01:26:37,733 --> 01:26:38,600
It seems

1121
01:26:39,033 --> 01:26:40,366
we have no choice but to remove this demon tree.

1122
01:27:24,533 --> 01:27:26,233
Lady Zhu.

1123
01:27:26,833 --> 01:27:28,433
We beg you to grant us some water again.

1124
01:27:28,433 --> 01:27:29,500
Lady Zhu.

1125
01:27:29,533 --> 01:27:31,033
We implore you.

1126
01:27:31,033 --> 01:27:32,333
We are willing to offer our lives in exchange.

1127
01:27:32,366 --> 01:27:34,566
We beg you, Lady Zhu.

1128
01:27:35,566 --> 01:27:36,633
Please, we beg you.

1129
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:40,900
It's thundering.

1130
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:42,433
It's thundering.

1131
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:43,700
There's water!

1132
01:27:46,333 --> 01:27:47,566
That's wonderful!

1133
01:27:47,833 --> 01:27:49,366
There's water now!

1134
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:51,133
Finally, we have water.

1135
01:27:51,133 --> 01:27:53,000
We no longer need to exchange our lives.

1136
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:55,366
We are saved.

1137
01:28:01,533 --> 01:28:02,933
They actually killed Zi Qing.

1138
01:28:08,566 --> 01:28:11,266
Great, we have water!

1139
01:28:12,166 --> 01:28:13,166
We have water!

1140
01:28:43,333 --> 01:28:44,133
Now,

1141
01:28:44,566 --> 01:28:46,366
no one can stop my plan.

1142
01:28:50,366 --> 01:28:51,900
You've come too late this time.

1143
01:28:52,933 --> 01:28:53,933
Stop teasing me.

1144
01:28:54,433 --> 01:28:55,666
Your final plan...

1145
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,033
What exactly is it?

1146
01:28:58,533 --> 01:29:00,800
The fox demon's spirit resides within Xiaoyao.

1147
01:29:01,566 --> 01:29:02,466
Tell me.

1148
01:29:02,766 --> 01:29:04,400
Once he has accumulated all nine tails

1149
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:05,500
and his body is suffused with resentment,

1150
01:29:05,833 --> 01:29:06,966
will he succumb to the demonic path?

1151
01:29:07,933 --> 01:29:09,133
Once he succumbs to the demonic path,

1152
01:29:09,366 --> 01:29:11,800
the Three Realms will be plunged into chaos and suffering.

1153
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:14,033
You didn't tell me this before.

1154
01:29:14,566 --> 01:29:16,266
Don't panic, Immortal Mo.

1155
01:29:16,533 --> 01:29:17,666
I haven't finished speaking yet.

1156
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:19,533
I plan to

1157
01:29:19,566 --> 01:29:21,300
make Xiaoyao watch his loved one,

1158
01:29:21,833 --> 01:29:23,333
your adorable junior sister,

1159
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:25,333
die right in front of him.

1160
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:26,466
In this way,

1161
01:29:26,533 --> 01:29:27,333
his resentment

1162
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:28,833
will inevitably reach its peak.

1163
01:29:29,133 --> 01:29:30,166
What are you going to do to Ling'er?

1164
01:29:30,333 --> 01:29:31,166
I just said.

1165
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:32,633
She must die in front of Xiaoyao.

1166
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:44,533
Immortal Mo.

1167
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,133
Don't overestimate yourself.

1168
01:29:46,433 --> 01:29:47,733
I won't allow you to hurt Ling'er.

1169
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:50,633
You can finally understand

1170
01:29:50,633 --> 01:29:52,166
what it feels like to watch the one you love die

1171
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:54,533
while you are powerless to stop it.

1172
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:56,633
You lunatic.

1173
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:59,233
I'm just giving you a taste of

1174
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:00,900
your own medicine.

1175
01:30:01,433 --> 01:30:02,466
What are you talking about?

1176
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:04,666
Back then,

1177
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:07,133
your Immortal Realm killed Jing Yu

1178
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:08,633
and framed the Qingqiu Fox.

1179
01:30:09,633 --> 01:30:10,933
Yet I was deceived by you

1180
01:30:10,966 --> 01:30:12,100
and became your pawn.

1181
01:30:13,366 --> 01:30:14,366
How could you possibly know?

1182
01:30:14,366 --> 01:30:15,800
Did you think such despicable tricks

1183
01:30:16,233 --> 01:30:17,833
could fool everyone?

1184
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:19,266
Immortal Venerable.

1185
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,033
Should we deal with this Zhu Ziyu…

1186
01:30:23,733 --> 01:30:25,266
After all, we disguised ourselves as the Qingqiu Fox

1187
01:30:25,566 --> 01:30:27,066
and killed her beloved.

1188
01:30:28,933 --> 01:30:30,266
She served the Immortal Realm well.

1189
01:30:30,733 --> 01:30:31,666
For now,

1190
01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:32,933
spare her life.

1191
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:36,233
Then this final move…

1192
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:40,200
The only reason your worthless life was spared

1193
01:30:40,433 --> 01:30:41,733
was because I needed to use you

1194
01:30:41,933 --> 01:30:43,000
to obtain the Immortal Realm's holy water.

1195
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:44,066
Now,

1196
01:30:44,333 --> 01:30:45,933
to turn the Qingqiu Fox into a demon,

1197
01:30:46,166 --> 01:30:48,066
I specially prepared a Nether Resentment Formation for him.

1198
01:30:49,033 --> 01:30:50,733
This formation requires not only holy water,

1199
01:30:51,133 --> 01:30:52,800
but also a sacrifice.

1200
01:30:53,300 --> 01:30:54,000
What sacrifice?

1201
01:30:55,133 --> 01:30:56,200
The Primordial Spirit of an Immortal.

1202
01:30:56,333 --> 01:30:56,866
You...

1203
01:30:57,100 --> 01:30:57,766
Besides,

1204
01:30:58,200 --> 01:30:59,266
only if you perish

1205
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:01,800
will the seal binding the Broken-Tail be lifted.

1206
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:09,600
So, Immortal Mo—sacrifice yourself!

1207
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:36,633
Since the Immortal Realm is so despicable,

1208
01:31:37,433 --> 01:31:39,100
what use is it anymore?

1209
01:32:07,966 --> 01:32:09,166
Still the familiar taste.

1210
01:32:10,566 --> 01:32:11,266
Well.

1211
01:32:12,033 --> 01:32:13,733
After just a few days of not eating my cooking,

1212
01:32:13,933 --> 01:32:14,866
you're already missing it?

1213
01:32:16,133 --> 01:32:17,366
Even if I miss it for only a day,

1214
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:18,400
I miss it very much.

1215
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:19,833
Let alone several days.

1216
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:22,166
What's gotten into you?

1217
01:32:22,366 --> 01:32:23,900
Why are you suddenly so sweet‑tongued?

1218
01:32:24,633 --> 01:32:26,933
A certain someone usually wears a grumpy face.

1219
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:28,433
From now on,

1220
01:32:28,966 --> 01:32:30,600
I want to eat your cooking every single day.

1221
01:32:30,933 --> 01:32:32,066
Not a day less.

1222
01:32:39,533 --> 01:32:40,566
If

1223
01:32:41,233 --> 01:32:42,133
one day

1224
01:32:43,166 --> 01:32:45,033
I can no longer cook for you,

1225
01:32:45,733 --> 01:32:46,566
what will you do?

1226
01:32:47,166 --> 01:32:47,866
No matter where you are,

1227
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:49,600
I will find you

1228
01:32:50,233 --> 01:32:51,133
and eat the food you make.

1229
01:32:52,233 --> 01:32:53,766
I am the Culinary God of the Three Realms.

1230
01:32:54,100 --> 01:32:55,733
Why must I cook only for you?

1231
01:32:59,333 --> 01:33:00,366
Because I like you.

1232
01:33:01,966 --> 01:33:03,233
That day in the dense forest,

1233
01:33:03,900 --> 01:33:04,966
I almost lost you.

1234
01:33:05,933 --> 01:33:07,133
I don't want to hide it anymore.

1235
01:33:07,833 --> 01:33:08,433
Ling'er.

1236
01:33:10,166 --> 01:33:10,866
I like you.

1237
01:33:13,433 --> 01:33:13,966
I…

1238
01:33:14,300 --> 01:33:15,633
Oh, wait!

1239
01:33:15,633 --> 01:33:16,966
I forgot to bring out one more dish.

1240
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:18,500
I'll go get it.

1241
01:34:36,466 --> 01:34:37,266
Heavenly Venerable,

1242
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:38,800
an anomaly has appeared within the Illusory Realm.

1243
01:34:38,833 --> 01:34:40,333
Qingqiu Fox Demon is about to become fully demonic.

1244
01:34:42,433 --> 01:34:43,800
Everything is the will of Heaven.

1245
01:34:44,633 --> 01:34:45,700
I don't know whether the Three Realms

1246
01:34:46,233 --> 01:34:48,166
can escape this catastrophe.

1247
01:34:50,333 --> 01:34:52,000
His hatred stems from me.

1248
01:34:52,733 --> 01:34:54,166
I will use my own way

1249
01:34:54,533 --> 01:34:55,833
to dissolve his hatred.

1250
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:58,633
If I can avert this crisis,

1251
01:34:59,033 --> 01:35:02,033
I beseech you, Heavenly Venerable Lady, to spare his life.

1252
01:35:06,666 --> 01:35:08,666
The Taotie Deity can devour all things.

1253
01:35:09,233 --> 01:35:11,533
Could it be that when the fox demon turns,

1254
01:35:11,700 --> 01:35:13,366
she intends to absorb all the demonic energy into herself?

1255
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:14,833
If that is truly the case,

1256
01:35:15,066 --> 01:35:16,100
then wouldn't she…

1257
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:19,333
The Three Realms...

1258
01:35:19,700 --> 01:35:21,766
None can escape the word "love."

1259
01:35:39,433 --> 01:35:40,666
What day is it today?

1260
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:42,233
Why is the meal so lavish?

1261
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:44,600
This is a calming soup.

1262
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:46,466
After drinking it,

1263
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:48,033
you will sleep better.

1264
01:35:50,700 --> 01:35:52,533
Why do I feel like something is weighing on your mind?

1265
01:35:54,533 --> 01:35:55,766
I'm fine.

1266
01:35:56,633 --> 01:35:58,033
What could I possibly be worrying about?

1267
01:36:00,233 --> 01:36:02,100
I know what's troubling you.

1268
01:36:02,866 --> 01:36:03,900
You are an immortal.

1269
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:05,433
I am a demon.

1270
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:07,266
But no one ever said

1271
01:36:07,700 --> 01:36:09,233
that immortals and demons cannot be together.

1272
01:36:15,233 --> 01:36:16,366
Love between an immortal and a demon

1273
01:36:17,666 --> 01:36:18,800
can only end in tragedy.

1274
01:36:20,666 --> 01:36:22,166
Just like in our previous life.

1275
01:36:24,466 --> 01:36:25,766
No matter what happened before,

1276
01:36:27,266 --> 01:36:28,600
in this life, I love only you.

1277
01:36:29,633 --> 01:36:30,533
That is enough.

1278
01:36:37,133 --> 01:36:38,133
Drink the soup first.

1279
01:36:38,833 --> 01:36:39,833
It will get cold soon.

1280
01:36:46,733 --> 01:36:48,166
Why are you so gentle today?

1281
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:50,100
Are you drinking it or not?

1282
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:51,166
I'll drink it.

1283
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:28,366
Forgive me.

1284
01:37:29,300 --> 01:37:30,400
I deceived you again.

1285
01:37:57,466 --> 01:37:58,400
I'm sorry.

1286
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:01,566
I'm out of time.

1287
01:38:19,533 --> 01:38:21,066
It was you who saved me.

1288
01:38:25,100 --> 01:38:26,366
Leave this mark.

1289
01:38:27,133 --> 01:38:27,766
From now on,

1290
01:38:28,433 --> 01:38:30,333
you belong to me, Qingqiu Fox.

1291
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:35,433
From this moment on,

1292
01:38:36,066 --> 01:38:37,133
I will protect you.

1293
01:38:40,466 --> 01:38:42,700
Then what do you think true love is?

1294
01:38:44,066 --> 01:38:45,433
At the very least, never betraying each other.

1295
01:38:47,300 --> 01:38:49,033
If only one of us can survive,

1296
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:51,333
I hope

1297
01:38:52,300 --> 01:38:53,533
that person is you.

1298
01:38:54,200 --> 01:38:55,133
This is

1299
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:57,600
what I owe you.

1300
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:04,833
Want to sacrifice yourself to save him?

1301
01:39:04,833 --> 01:39:05,766
Don't even think about it.

1302
01:39:09,033 --> 01:39:10,166
Ling'er!

1303
01:39:10,533 --> 01:39:11,466
There's danger!

1304
01:39:17,866 --> 01:39:18,666
Xiaoyao!

1305
01:39:20,900 --> 01:39:21,400
Ling'er!

1306
01:39:21,433 --> 01:39:22,100
Xiaoyao!

1307
01:39:30,666 --> 01:39:32,000
Senior Brother's Primordial Spirit...

1308
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,200
What did you do to him?

1309
01:39:45,866 --> 01:39:46,866
Zhu Ziyu.

1310
01:39:47,200 --> 01:39:47,933
What are you trying to do?

1311
01:39:48,133 --> 01:39:48,966
Xiaoyao!

1312
01:39:49,866 --> 01:39:52,133
Does this formation look familiar?

1313
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:56,433
This.

1314
01:39:57,233 --> 01:39:58,100
This is...

1315
01:39:58,600 --> 01:39:59,533
Nether Resentment Formation.

1316
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:02,266
You tore two pages from the ancient book before,

1317
01:40:02,666 --> 01:40:04,266
and now you've mastered it completely.

1318
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,133
Then you should know how powerful it is.

1319
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:09,500
Do you want to watch your beloved

1320
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:11,700
turn to ashes right before your eyes?

1321
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:14,700
Stop!

1322
01:40:16,233 --> 01:40:17,666
I am willing to give up my four Broken-Tails.

1323
01:40:18,133 --> 01:40:18,933
Let Ling'er go.

1324
01:40:19,300 --> 01:40:20,100
No!

1325
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:21,000
Xiaoyao!

1326
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:22,466
Run!

1327
01:40:22,633 --> 01:40:24,866
I want more than just your Broken-Tails.

1328
01:40:25,133 --> 01:40:25,966
What do you want?

1329
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:27,133
I'll give you anything.

1330
01:40:27,433 --> 01:40:28,100
What I want

1331
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:30,233
is the Primordial Spirit of Qingqiu Fox inside you.

1332
01:40:31,133 --> 01:40:32,533
As long as you step into the formation

1333
01:40:32,666 --> 01:40:33,800
and let me extract it,

1334
01:40:33,933 --> 01:40:34,800
I will release her.

1335
01:40:37,300 --> 01:40:37,766
No!

1336
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:38,666
Xiaoyao!

1337
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:40,400
Don't listen to her!

1338
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:41,633
Go!

1339
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:44,200
Stop!

1340
01:40:49,900 --> 01:40:50,700
I'll give it to you.

1341
01:40:51,666 --> 01:40:52,466
I will give you everything.

1342
01:40:54,133 --> 01:40:54,733
No!

1343
01:40:55,666 --> 01:40:56,466
Don't!

1344
01:41:14,900 --> 01:41:16,233
Today, my Primordial Spirit

1345
01:41:16,466 --> 01:41:17,700
will merge with yours

1346
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:18,633
to become the Nine-Tailed Fox.

1347
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:25,600
Back then,

1348
01:41:26,266 --> 01:41:28,100
the Immortal Clan feared the growing power

1349
01:41:28,300 --> 01:41:29,200
of Foxfire.

1350
01:41:29,233 --> 01:41:30,500
They wanted to eliminate you.

1351
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,500
So Mo Nan killed Jing Yu

1352
01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:33,333
and framed you for it.

1353
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:34,966
He used my hatred to betray you,

1354
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,266
and sealed you away.

1355
01:41:36,633 --> 01:41:38,033
Since they are utterly unscrupulous,

1356
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:40,000
we will make them pay the price.

1357
01:41:40,033 --> 01:41:40,900
Xiaoyao.

1358
01:41:40,900 --> 01:41:42,633
Didn't you want to know who your enemy is?

1359
01:41:42,933 --> 01:41:43,800
Let me tell you.

1360
01:41:44,266 --> 01:41:45,900
The one who destroyed your entire Xia family… was me.

1361
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:48,666
Now, only the final step remains.

1362
01:41:49,200 --> 01:41:50,300
Once the heavenly thunder strikes,

1363
01:41:50,633 --> 01:41:53,333
Yao Ling'er will turn to ashes before your eyes.

1364
01:41:53,866 --> 01:41:55,533
With the hatred of both you and me,

1365
01:41:55,866 --> 01:41:57,333
let us flatten the Three Realms.

1366
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:04,366
Xiaoyao, don't listen to her!

1367
01:42:04,633 --> 01:42:06,333
Don't let hatred control you!

1368
01:42:10,666 --> 01:42:11,866
The heavenly thunder is about to fall.

1369
01:42:12,433 --> 01:42:13,666
Your beloved

1370
01:42:13,666 --> 01:42:15,966
is about to disappear before your eyes forever.

1371
01:42:22,466 --> 01:42:26,200
I want the Immortal Realm to repay blood with blood.

1372
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:39,500
Yao Ling'er.

1373
01:42:39,633 --> 01:42:41,566
This is your last chance.

1374
01:42:41,866 --> 01:42:43,066
Heavenly Venerable Lady.

1375
01:43:32,100 --> 01:43:34,033
Are you going to sacrifice yourself… to save me?

1376
01:43:40,033 --> 01:43:41,100
No!

1377
01:43:51,066 --> 01:43:52,466
I can't hold on much longer.

1378
01:43:52,866 --> 01:43:53,966
Seal me quickly.

1379
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:55,800
If you seal the Qingqiu Fox,

1380
01:43:55,800 --> 01:43:56,833
Xiaoyao will surely die.

1381
01:43:56,833 --> 01:43:57,900
Don't listen to her!

1382
01:43:58,300 --> 01:43:59,200
If I descend into the demonic,

1383
01:43:59,700 --> 01:44:01,600
the Three Realms will face a great calamity.

1384
01:44:05,433 --> 01:44:06,333
Yao Ling'er.

1385
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:07,900
If he descends into the demonic,

1386
01:44:08,066 --> 01:44:09,900
he will no longer be the Xiaoyao you know.

1387
01:44:10,466 --> 01:44:11,466
For the sake of one person,

1388
01:44:11,633 --> 01:44:13,133
will you sacrifice all beings of the Three Realms?

1389
01:44:14,266 --> 01:44:16,566
There's no time—seal him now!

1390
01:44:31,266 --> 01:44:32,333
You are an immortal.

1391
01:44:32,866 --> 01:44:33,800
I am a demon.

1392
01:44:34,133 --> 01:44:35,733
But no one ever said

1393
01:44:36,066 --> 01:44:37,600
that immortals and demons cannot be together.

1394
01:44:38,533 --> 01:44:39,766
No matter what happened before,

1395
01:44:40,833 --> 01:44:41,933
in this life, I love only you.

1396
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:43,666
That is enough.

1397
01:44:59,666 --> 01:45:00,966
Xia Xiaoyao.

1398
01:45:02,466 --> 01:45:04,600
Xia Xiaoyao!

1399
01:45:17,866 --> 01:45:18,966
Yao Ling'er.

1400
01:45:19,100 --> 01:45:21,033
You have performed great merit in sealing the fox demon.

1401
01:45:21,466 --> 01:45:24,266
You are granted promotion to Taotie Immortal.

1402
01:45:25,300 --> 01:45:26,100
Yao Ling'er.

1403
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:27,866
Do you have anything to say?

1404
01:45:30,133 --> 01:45:31,600
I am willing to give up the rank of High Immortal

1405
01:45:32,700 --> 01:45:34,400
in exchange for reuniting with him in the next life.

1406
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:37,200
Heavenly Venerable Lady, I beg you to grant my wish.

1407
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:15,433
Excuse me, Miss.

1408
01:46:16,533 --> 01:46:17,400
What would you like to eat?

1409
01:46:18,200 --> 01:46:18,866
I'll have

1410
01:46:19,133 --> 01:46:20,200
your best dish.

1411
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:21,400
And one pot

1412
01:46:21,733 --> 01:46:22,666
of green plum wine.

1413
01:46:49,866 --> 01:46:51,100
If…

1414
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:53,633
one day I can no longer cook for you,

1415
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:55,933
what will you do?

1416
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:57,833
No matter where you are,

1417
01:46:58,500 --> 01:46:59,400
I will always find you.
