1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,333
[The Forbidden Realm of the Immortals,
the Land of Eternal Frost]

2
00:00:10,566 --> 00:00:12,466
So everything they said was true.

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,133
You know it all now.

4
00:00:14,466 --> 00:00:15,600
I was a fool.

5
00:00:16,866 --> 00:00:18,566
Imprisoned for thousands of years,

6
00:00:19,033 --> 00:00:20,733
and I still believed in the Immortal Clan.

7
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:25,633
I did it for your own good.

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,800
Can't bring yourself to strike?

9
00:00:34,766 --> 00:00:35,666
Let me do it.

10
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,933
From this day on,

11
00:01:00,133 --> 00:01:01,466
we owe each other nothing.

12
00:01:02,433 --> 00:01:03,433
Now,

13
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:05,533
your wish is fulfilled.

14
00:01:22,066 --> 00:01:23,666
Fox…

15
00:02:05,533 --> 00:02:07,000
Junior Sister, where did you go?

16
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:08,466
I searched everywhere and couldn't find you.

17
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,400
I'm

18
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,700
in the Land of Eternal Frost.

19
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:12,433
T-That

20
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:13,300
place is forbidden.

21
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,033
Come back now!

22
00:02:14,066 --> 00:02:15,600
I came for the Celestial Snow Lotus.

23
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,800
This ingredient

24
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:18,733
is essential for my Ascension Tribulation.

25
00:02:19,233 --> 00:02:21,133
So even if it's a forbidden ground,

26
00:02:21,366 --> 00:02:22,466
it's worth taking the risk.

27
00:02:23,366 --> 00:02:25,233
If the Heavenly Venerable finds out, it will be trouble.

28
00:02:26,066 --> 00:02:26,766
Alright, alright—

29
00:02:26,766 --> 00:02:27,500
I'll be careful.

30
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,266
Finally found you…

31
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:17,933
Don't tell me my luck is that bad—

32
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,900
the Heavenly Tribulation lightning is coming already?

33
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:23,900
Looks like I have to finish it here.

34
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,166
Heavenly Venerable, Heavenly Venerable,

35
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,066
please bless me to pass this tribulation,

36
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,533
and successfully ascend as a Taotie Immortal.

37
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,500
Come on, come on…

38
00:03:47,766 --> 00:03:49,200
Just one last step

39
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:50,966
and I'll ascend to High Immortal!

40
00:05:31,066 --> 00:05:32,000
Heavenly Venerable,
greetings to the Heavenly Venerable.

41
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,366
The sealing barrier has been broken.

42
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,300
The fox demon has escaped.

43
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:38,133
The Qingqiu fox is born with Foxfire capable of destroying heavens and earth.

44
00:05:38,733 --> 00:05:40,400
If he breaks free,

45
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:42,800
he will surely become a calamity upon the Three Realms.

46
00:05:43,066 --> 00:05:44,400
To protect all living beings—

47
00:05:44,766 --> 00:05:45,766
Immortals,

48
00:05:45,766 --> 00:05:47,633
follow me to the Land of Eternal Frost

49
00:05:48,033 --> 00:05:49,133
and seal the fox demon.

50
00:05:49,966 --> 00:05:50,500
Understood.

51
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,500
Yes.

52
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,600
You saved me.

53
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:23,733
Mm.

54
00:06:27,766 --> 00:06:28,400
Thank you.

55
00:06:29,866 --> 00:06:30,700
No need to thank me.

56
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,200
If anything, I should thank you—

57
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:35,966
the lightning of your Tribulation shattered my seal,

58
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,800
allowing me to see daylight again.

59
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:40,233
You…

60
00:06:42,366 --> 00:06:44,433
you're the Qingqiu fox demon

61
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,533
They came so quickly.

62
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,533
What's wrong?

63
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:50,766
Stay here.

64
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:52,066
Without my permission,

65
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:54,033
you're not allowed to go anywhere.

66
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:51,866
The wound has healed,

67
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,766
but your body is still weak.

68
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,400
Wait here. I'll make you something to eat.

69
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:50,366
Where is this?

70
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,533
Let me go!

71
00:10:52,766 --> 00:10:54,166
You brought me back.

72
00:10:54,466 --> 00:10:55,700
I rescued you.

73
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:00,733
Ling'er…

74
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:02,766
Ling'er.

75
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,066
why is your chamber

76
00:12:29,633 --> 00:12:30,933
filled with demonic aura?

77
00:12:31,633 --> 00:12:32,700
What demonic aura?

78
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,433
Senior Brother, you must be mistaken.

79
00:12:34,766 --> 00:12:35,233
Come on，

80
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,166
Both of you, stop!

81
00:12:54,933 --> 00:12:55,366
Ling'er,

82
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,633
do you know he is a fox demon?

83
00:12:57,033 --> 00:12:58,466
The entire Immortal Realm is hunting him.

84
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:58,800
How can you—

85
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,133
Senior Brother,

86
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,833
he saved me in the Land of Eternal Frost.

87
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,033
That's what happened.

88
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,266
So that means

89
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,833
you failed your Tribulation?

90
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,033
Then your body must be—

91
00:13:12,033 --> 00:13:12,900
Don't worry.

92
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,400
With my secret medicinal cuisine,

93
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,500
I'll recover in a few days.

94
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,200
But—

95
00:13:16,366 --> 00:13:17,433
Senior Brother,

96
00:13:17,933 --> 00:13:19,766
I am the number one Culinary Immortal of the realm.

97
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,200
Nourishing myself is nothing I can't handle.

98
00:13:25,566 --> 00:13:26,100
Fine.

99
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:27,933
But,

100
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,633
he cannot stay here.

101
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,733
Senior Brother,

102
00:13:32,966 --> 00:13:34,366
he won't harm me.

103
00:13:34,366 --> 00:13:35,866
Sheltering a fox demon is a serious crime.

104
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:37,133
If anyone finds out,

105
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,400
even I won't be able to protect you.

106
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,800
He'll leave once he's healed.

107
00:13:40,633 --> 00:13:42,300
Please, Senior Brother, keep this between us.

108
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:42,966
I swear

109
00:13:43,566 --> 00:13:44,966
I'll keep him under control

110
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,633
and won't let anyone discover him.

111
00:13:49,533 --> 00:13:49,966
Very well.

112
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:56,133
What's wrong with you?

113
00:13:56,133 --> 00:13:57,933
Didn't I tell you to stay hidden?

114
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,433
In that situation,

115
00:13:59,933 --> 00:14:00,866
there was no way to hide.

116
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:03,233
It was better to stand out openly.

117
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:04,666
Besides,

118
00:15:41,366 --> 00:15:43,000
Pervert.

119
00:16:00,366 --> 00:16:01,633
Why did you call me?

120
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,166
Culinary Immortal,

121
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:19,633
your cooking is too delicious.

122
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,833
From the first bite, I was in love.

123
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,400
Hurry and feed me.

124
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:24,766
Please?

125
00:16:25,033 --> 00:16:25,966
I'm starving.

126
00:17:27,733 --> 00:17:29,600
Wait here, I'll improve it.

127
00:17:51,966 --> 00:17:52,466
Try it.

128
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,700
What did you just do to me?

129
00:18:18,433 --> 00:18:19,633
Mark.

130
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,266
From now on,

131
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,400
you belong to the Qingqiu fox.

132
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:33,300
Big Fox,

133
00:19:23,233 --> 00:19:24,533
after this medicinal dish,

134
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:25,800
his body

135
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:27,500
will finally be fully recovered.

136
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:34,966
Ling'er.

137
00:19:38,433 --> 00:19:39,233
Senior Brother.

138
00:19:40,366 --> 00:19:41,566
After failing your Tribulation,

139
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,433
your immortal body was already weakened.

140
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,600
And yet you burn your cultivation day after day

141
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,600
to make medicine for him.

142
00:19:47,433 --> 00:19:48,300
For a fox demon—

143
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,433
is it worth it?

144
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,900
After all, a demon is a demon.

145
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,000
Its nature is hard to change.

146
00:19:54,766 --> 00:19:55,766
Even if he saved you,

147
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,333
it's difficult to alter his evil instincts.

148
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:00,200
But…

149
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,433
I've lived with that fox demon for over a thousand days.

150
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,433
I don't think his nature is bad.

151
00:20:05,033 --> 00:20:06,533
Maybe we Immortals

152
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,233
are too biased against him.

153
00:20:08,233 --> 00:20:08,700
You…

154
00:20:11,366 --> 00:20:13,166
Ling'er, you've likely already been seduced

155
00:20:13,566 --> 00:20:14,433
and blinded by that fox demon.

156
00:20:15,133 --> 00:20:16,733
Cannot let her remain lost like this.

157
00:20:18,766 --> 00:20:19,700
Tell me,

158
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:21,633
do you truly want to help him?

159
00:20:23,533 --> 00:20:24,633
Senior Brother, is there a way?

160
00:20:24,966 --> 00:20:26,833
Take the Foxfire from within him. That will do.

161
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,333
I can't harm him.

162
00:20:30,033 --> 00:20:31,166
This isn't harming him.

163
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,033
On the contrary—

164
00:20:32,233 --> 00:20:33,133
you're saving him.

165
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,266
The Qingqiu fox's spirit is immortal and indestructible.

166
00:20:36,933 --> 00:20:37,833
Taking the Foxfire

167
00:20:37,966 --> 00:20:39,200
won't cost him his life.

168
00:20:39,766 --> 00:20:40,266
On the contrary—

169
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,100
if you don't remove it,

170
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,966
he'll continue absorbing the resentments of the Three Realms

171
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,533
and eventually fall into darkness.

172
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,733
Since you believe the Qingqiu fox is inherently kind,

173
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,533
you must take the Foxfire

174
00:20:51,766 --> 00:20:53,300
so he won't descend into demonic corruption.

175
00:20:54,566 --> 00:20:56,100
And… since you failed your Tribulation before，

176
00:20:56,433 --> 00:20:58,533
if you extract the Foxfire in his heart,

177
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,266
you can refine it into Samadhi True Flame

178
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,466
and ascend in your next Tribulation.

179
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,000
But…

180
00:21:04,633 --> 00:21:06,300
how do I extract the Foxfire?

181
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:09,833
That fox demon is deeply wary of all Immortals.

182
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:12,100
You'll need this.

183
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,133
Simply trick him into consuming this pill.

184
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,400
Cold, isn't it?

185
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,300
Have some green plum wine to warm up.

186
00:22:33,233 --> 00:22:34,633
I brewed it myself.

187
00:22:34,966 --> 00:22:36,800
If it were anyone else,
I'd never share it.

188
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,233
Is it strong?

189
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:49,933
It's fruit wine infused with green plums.

190
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,100
How could it be strong?

191
00:22:51,366 --> 00:22:51,866
Go on, try it.

192
00:22:54,733 --> 00:22:55,800
You're that eager

193
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,633
to make me drink it?

194
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:06,800
Big Fox…

195
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:08,600
forgive me for deceiving you.

196
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,400
I only wanted to help you.

197
00:23:13,733 --> 00:23:14,833
Once the Foxfire is taken…

198
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,000
he will be reduced to ashes.

199
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
YoYo English Channel    YouTube

200
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:19,500
Hunt them down!

201
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:20,766
Go.

202
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:21,833
Run, Xia'er—

203
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:22,433
run!

204
00:23:24,366 --> 00:23:25,033
Father…

205
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:26,066
Mother…

206
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,066
Need help?

207
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:39,833
Kill them.

208
00:23:41,433 --> 00:23:42,533
Lend me your body.

209
00:23:49,433 --> 00:23:50,700
Find the nine severed tails.

210
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,933
Awaken the Foxfire.

211
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:53,200
And together…

212
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:54,600
we will have our revenge.

213
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,000
I was truly foolish.

214
00:24:14,033 --> 00:24:16,033
Imprisoned for thousands of years,

215
00:24:16,466 --> 00:24:18,500
yet I still believed Immortal Clan.

216
00:24:20,266 --> 00:24:21,300
So you knew everything.

217
00:24:21,633 --> 00:24:22,933
Can't strike him?

218
00:24:24,766 --> 00:24:25,700
Let me help you.

219
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,533
I thought you were different from the others.

220
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,233
But I was wrong.

221
00:24:52,266 --> 00:24:53,600
You're just like them—

222
00:24:53,966 --> 00:24:56,633
utterly hypocritical.

223
00:25:10,366 --> 00:25:12,766
I will never forgive you.

224
00:25:20,033 --> 00:25:21,300
From today on,

225
00:25:21,766 --> 00:25:22,966
we owe each other nothing.

226
00:25:23,633 --> 00:25:25,566
And you will never obtain the Foxfire.

227
00:25:38,866 --> 00:25:40,300
You harbored a fox demon,

228
00:25:40,466 --> 00:25:42,333
nearly bringing calamity to the Three Realms.

229
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,633
Do you admit your guilt?

230
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:46,400
I acknowledges my crime.

231
00:25:47,433 --> 00:25:48,166
My crime…

232
00:25:48,766 --> 00:25:50,366
is believing Senior Brother's lies

233
00:25:50,366 --> 00:25:51,666
and attempting to kill the Qingqiu Fox.

234
00:25:51,666 --> 00:25:52,300
Insolence.

235
00:25:54,766 --> 00:25:56,000
I just don't understand—

236
00:25:56,766 --> 00:25:58,300
not all demons are evil.

237
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,900
Why refuse to give them a chance?

238
00:26:00,933 --> 00:26:01,666
-Why must...
-Silence.

239
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,200
The fox demon is not dead.

240
00:26:10,233 --> 00:26:10,633
What?

241
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,700
He has scattered the power of the Foxfire

242
00:26:12,733 --> 00:26:14,366
into nine severed tails.

243
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:15,400
Those tails

244
00:26:15,733 --> 00:26:17,633
are now scattered across
the mortal world within the Illusory Realm.

245
00:26:17,833 --> 00:26:20,466
They will absorb human obsessions,

246
00:26:20,766 --> 00:26:21,866
growing stronger and stronger.

247
00:26:22,733 --> 00:26:25,800
The fox's spirit, bearing hatred, has descended to undergo its tribulation.

248
00:26:26,666 --> 00:26:27,700
I fear that

249
00:26:27,966 --> 00:26:29,266
once he gathers all nine tails

250
00:26:29,433 --> 00:26:30,633
and regains the Foxfire…

251
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:32,533
the Three Realms

252
00:26:33,066 --> 00:26:34,400
will be doomed.

253
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,200
This all began because of me.

254
00:26:37,066 --> 00:26:38,500
I am willing to descend to the mortal world and undergo tribulations

255
00:26:38,866 --> 00:26:40,266
to dispel the Qingqiu Fox's hatred.

256
00:26:43,566 --> 00:26:44,433
I can grant you that.

257
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:47,466
But the crime of harboring a fox demon cannot be forgiven.

258
00:26:48,633 --> 00:26:50,300
If you are willing to endure Heavenly Lightning as punishment,

259
00:26:51,066 --> 00:26:52,900
I will permit you to descend

260
00:26:53,033 --> 00:26:54,166
and redeem your sins.

261
00:26:57,466 --> 00:26:58,566
Have you truly decided?

262
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,500
Ling'er accepts the punishment willingly.

263
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,433
Taotie Immortal,

264
00:27:06,566 --> 00:27:07,900
for hiding a fox demon

265
00:27:08,033 --> 00:27:09,066
and endangering the Three Realms—

266
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,500
half of her cultivation shall be dispersed.

267
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,866
She shall endure twenty-four bolts of Heavenly Lightning,

268
00:27:14,033 --> 00:27:15,433
descend to the mortal world,

269
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,200
and atone for her crimes.

270
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,800
Big Fox…

271
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:45,133
wait for me.

272
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,933
I will find you.

273
00:28:43,566 --> 00:28:45,466
Is this town suffering some strange plague?

274
00:28:45,966 --> 00:28:47,300
Why are there so many sick people?

275
00:28:49,366 --> 00:28:50,366
Brother,

276
00:28:51,233 --> 00:28:53,133
what happened to all these people?

277
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,733
Rumor says

278
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:56,066
someone angered the Fox Immortal last month.

279
00:28:56,466 --> 00:28:58,166
The Fox Immortal cast down calamity.

280
00:28:58,666 --> 00:29:00,400
So people keep falling ill.

281
00:29:00,966 --> 00:29:03,633
Those who get sick become delirious,

282
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,900
rambling nonsense nonstop.

283
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:06,366
Such things…

284
00:29:07,266 --> 00:29:08,266
what a tragedy.

285
00:29:08,866 --> 00:29:09,766
Thank you, brother.

286
00:29:10,533 --> 00:29:13,200
Fox Immortal, spare me.

287
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,700
<b>狐仙大人 快饶了我吧</b>

288
00:29:21,466 --> 00:29:25,100
Fox Immortal, please spare me.

289
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,133
Fox Immortal, please spare me.

290
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,700
Fox Immortal…

291
00:29:30,466 --> 00:29:31,966
could it be him?

292
00:29:32,666 --> 00:29:34,766
I have searched for you in the mortal world for more than ten years.

293
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:36,433
So you were here.

294
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:52,900
W-Wait.

295
00:29:52,933 --> 00:29:54,166
Don't be afraid.

296
00:29:54,266 --> 00:29:55,266
I came to save you.

297
00:30:05,766 --> 00:30:07,966
They capture orphans like you as offerings.

298
00:30:07,966 --> 00:30:09,000
Run, quickly.

299
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,333
Don't let them catch you again.

300
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:12,333
Thank you… thank you, big sister.

301
00:30:16,166 --> 00:30:17,300
Let me go!

302
00:30:17,433 --> 00:30:18,700
Let me go!

303
00:30:23,366 --> 00:30:25,633
So it was you who let our offering escape!

304
00:30:26,966 --> 00:30:28,200
Tonight,

305
00:30:28,733 --> 00:30:30,333
we'll offer you to the Fox Immortal.

306
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,666
No! Let me go!

307
00:30:33,066 --> 00:30:34,000
Let me go!

308
00:30:50,366 --> 00:30:52,000
Bless us, Fox Immortal.

309
00:30:56,566 --> 00:30:58,200
Fox Immortal.

310
00:31:01,233 --> 00:31:04,333
Yishan Town has always been peaceful and prosperous.

311
00:31:04,933 --> 00:31:07,366
But now we've suffered such disaster.

312
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,400
Because ignorant folk angered the Fox Immortal.

313
00:31:11,966 --> 00:31:14,166
So we must pay to ward off misfortune.

314
00:31:14,533 --> 00:31:15,966
Fifty taels of silver per person.

315
00:31:16,266 --> 00:31:18,266
And we present this offering

316
00:31:18,566 --> 00:31:20,566
to appease the Fox Immortal.

317
00:31:21,366 --> 00:31:22,633
And grant Yishan Town—

318
00:31:23,233 --> 00:31:24,166
Peace

319
00:31:24,366 --> 00:31:25,300
and safety.

320
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,666
The ritual begins.

321
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:30,800
Kneel and bow.

322
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:36,300
Fox Immortal, bless us.

323
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:45,766
The Fox Immortal has manifested.

324
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,133
Present the offering.

325
00:31:49,133 --> 00:31:49,833
Stop!

326
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,900
How dare you use a living person as a sacrifice!

327
00:31:53,633 --> 00:31:54,500
Where did this wild girl come from?

328
00:31:54,966 --> 00:31:55,466
Drive her out!

329
00:31:55,966 --> 00:31:56,866
Don't delay the ritual!

330
00:31:58,633 --> 00:31:59,533
Faking divine powers.

331
00:32:00,166 --> 00:32:01,366
Deceiving the townsfolk.

332
00:32:01,566 --> 00:32:03,633
Your little act is quite convincing.

333
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:06,933
What's he doing here?

334
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:12,766
I finally found you.

335
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,466
Come on.

336
00:32:13,833 --> 00:32:15,666
Do that impression again in front of everyone.

337
00:32:22,133 --> 00:32:23,133
He was the one making those sounds!

338
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:24,333
Everyone saw that, right?

339
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,500
This is your so-called divine manifestation.

340
00:32:27,866 --> 00:32:28,466
No.

341
00:32:29,966 --> 00:32:31,166
I didn't want to do this either.

342
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:33,166
But he paid more than you.

343
00:32:35,766 --> 00:32:36,666
Xiaoyao.

344
00:32:36,666 --> 00:32:38,133
You've got some nerve.

345
00:32:38,466 --> 00:32:40,400
Daring to disrupt the ritual publicly.

346
00:32:41,033 --> 00:32:42,933
If the Fox Immortal truly blames us,

347
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,700
The whole town will suffer.

348
00:32:46,033 --> 00:32:47,766
You're still pretending at this point?

349
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:49,733
I tested it earlier today.

350
00:32:49,833 --> 00:32:51,466
The villagers' illness isn't fox poison.

351
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,133
This pill cures fox poison.

352
00:32:59,233 --> 00:32:59,966
Fox Immortal…

353
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,800
Spare me…

354
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:02,100
Why isn't it working?

355
00:33:03,166 --> 00:33:04,300
This strange illness in town

356
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:06,433
has nothing to do with the Fox Immortal.

357
00:33:07,133 --> 00:33:08,600
It's just a bunch of frauds

358
00:33:08,966 --> 00:33:10,400
using it to steal money.

359
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,800
Release her now!

360
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:13,100
Who are you?

361
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:15,866
I am

362
00:33:16,266 --> 00:33:17,266
here to help you.

363
00:33:18,733 --> 00:33:19,800
There's something you all don't know.

364
00:33:20,033 --> 00:33:21,500
He was the one who

365
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:23,166
smashed the Fox Immortal statue.

366
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,933
which caused today's calamity.

367
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:25,900
Get him!

368
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:26,833
It's him!

369
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:27,466
Hit him!

370
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:28,233
Beat him to death!

371
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,300
Kill the jinx!

372
00:33:33,233 --> 00:33:34,533
He's a walking disaster!

373
00:33:35,366 --> 00:33:36,166
A monster!

374
00:33:37,533 --> 00:33:38,400
Kill him! The jinx!

375
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,033
Beat him to death!

376
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,033
Kill him!

377
00:33:41,166 --> 00:33:41,800
A curse upon us!

378
00:33:42,433 --> 00:33:43,300
Kill them all—leave no one behind!

379
00:33:43,566 --> 00:33:44,066
After him!

380
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,300
Beat him to death!

Episode 4

386
00:36:00,233 --> 00:36:00,866
Master.

387
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:01,833
Master, you hit it.

388
00:36:02,133 --> 00:36:03,733
Master, you truly are a divine marksman.

389
00:36:05,266 --> 00:36:05,700
Master.

390
00:36:05,866 --> 00:36:07,500
I just saw many rabbits over there.

391
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:08,700
Alright.

392
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,666
Mother.

393
00:36:19,066 --> 00:36:19,866
Mother.

394
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,133
Mother.

395
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,800
I want revenge.

396
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,833
Hit him! Beat him to death! The jinx!

397
00:36:50,233 --> 00:36:51,100
He is a jinx.

398
00:36:51,433 --> 00:36:52,866
This jinx brings death to the whole family.

399
00:36:54,533 --> 00:36:55,800
Kill him! He's the family's jinx!

400
00:36:56,033 --> 00:36:57,300
Now he has angered the Fox Immortal again.

401
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,366
The fox spirit's primordial soul descended with hatred to undergo tribulations.

402
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,466
Once he gathers the Broken-Tails,

403
00:37:02,466 --> 00:37:03,766
he will regain the power of Foxfire.

404
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,400
At that time, all three realms will fall into eternal doom.

405
00:37:06,533 --> 00:37:07,600
Jinx! Hit him!

406
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,400
There's a monster!

407
00:37:12,266 --> 00:37:13,766
The Fox Immortal has manifested!

408
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:16,600
Run!

409
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,566
Run!

410
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,200
A fusion of resentments.

411
00:37:28,533 --> 00:37:29,966
We must not let this resentment

412
00:37:30,133 --> 00:37:31,200
corrupt the great fox.

413
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,500
Great fox.

414
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,200
I won't let you fall into demonic corruption.

415
00:38:08,933 --> 00:38:09,733
Young Master Xia.

416
00:38:10,066 --> 00:38:10,900
Wake up.

417
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,733
Of course, his home.

418
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:56,900
Come.

419
00:38:59,033 --> 00:38:59,833
What's your name?

420
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,400
Duoduo.

421
00:39:16,133 --> 00:39:19,333
I made you a thousand and one medicinal dishes in the heavens.

422
00:39:20,133 --> 00:39:21,266
Now that we're here,

423
00:39:21,933 --> 00:39:23,333
I still have to make you medicinal dishes.

424
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,333
My spiritual power is weak in the mortal world.

425
00:39:25,866 --> 00:39:27,166
I must have owed you in my past life.

426
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,233
Why is your face so pale?

427
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:11,966
Oh… cooking tired me out.

428
00:40:12,866 --> 00:40:14,566
And you still insist you don't like him.

429
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,933
If it were someone else,

430
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,400
you wouldn't be this

431
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,233
attentive and caring, right?

432
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:21,966
Don't worry.

433
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,033
I won't tell anyone.

434
00:40:25,466 --> 00:40:27,466
I won't disturb your little world of two.

435
00:40:32,033 --> 00:40:33,300
What a strange girl.

436
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,900
Let me examine your primordial spirit.

437
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:51,066
They actually look exactly the same.

438
00:40:55,033 --> 00:40:55,666
What are you doing?

439
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,166
Young Master Xiaoyao.

440
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,733
Don't get the wrong idea.

441
00:40:59,033 --> 00:41:00,633
I only came to check

442
00:41:00,633 --> 00:41:01,933
how your body is recovering.

443
00:41:03,866 --> 00:41:05,566
Do you have to get this close?

444
00:42:28,733 --> 00:42:29,400
I'll repay you someday.

445
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:30,966
No need for that.

446
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,300
We immortals don't ask for repayment for saving people.

447
00:42:34,233 --> 00:42:34,966
Well…

448
00:42:35,233 --> 00:42:36,166
rest well first.

449
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:37,200
I'll go now.

450
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,000
Who exactly is she?

451
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,900
What kind of demon is causing trouble?

452
00:43:09,266 --> 00:43:10,966
The poison contains powerful demonic energy.

453
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,800
Could it be related to the Broken-Tail?

454
00:43:17,233 --> 00:43:18,133
Why is Duoduo here?

455
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,900
So it's just a low-level immortal.

456
00:43:32,866 --> 00:43:34,366
I'll teach you a lesson in a moment.

457
00:43:43,033 --> 00:43:44,666
There's something strange about this mushroom.

458
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,500
Oh no.

459
00:44:03,533 --> 00:44:04,633
I can't move.

460
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,033
What do I do now?

461
00:44:09,433 --> 00:44:12,166
YoYo English Channel    YouTube

462
00:44:20,333 --> 00:44:21,666
The Xia family was wiped out yesterday.

463
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,733
Only he survived.

464
00:44:23,733 --> 00:44:24,733
What a jinx.

465
00:44:24,733 --> 00:44:25,566
Such bad luck.

466
00:44:26,133 --> 00:44:26,800
Let's go, let's go.

467
00:44:30,566 --> 00:44:32,466
Have some candy, and you won't feel sad.

468
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,200
So it was you.

469
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,266
I don't like owing anyone a favor.

470
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:41,433
Bear with it for a moment.

471
00:44:41,833 --> 00:44:42,700
I'll get you out of here.

472
00:44:43,566 --> 00:44:44,633
I don't need you to save me.

473
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,766
I just don't want to leave.

474
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:56,200
The Broken-Tail is actually with her.

475
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:10,633
This is bad.

476
00:45:10,633 --> 00:45:12,533
Am I going to die here?

477
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,133
You…

478
00:45:45,133 --> 00:45:46,233
Why are you here?

479
00:45:46,833 --> 00:45:47,700
Of course I came to save you.

480
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:50,133
Why didn't you stay home?

481
00:45:50,566 --> 00:45:51,966
What are you doing out here

482
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:52,933
in the wilderness?

483
00:45:53,366 --> 00:45:53,833
I…

484
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,066
I came up the mountain to gather herbs.

485
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,333
Why aren't you getting up?

486
00:45:58,633 --> 00:45:59,633
I'm poisoned.

487
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:00,766
My whole body is numb.

488
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:01,700
I can't move.

489
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,066
I need your help.

490
00:46:04,033 --> 00:46:04,733
I'll fetch a doctor for you.

491
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,400
Help me prepare the medicine.

492
00:46:13,833 --> 00:46:15,200
Add the honeysuckle first.

493
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,866
Then add the lobelia.

494
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:27,300
Do you think you're pounding garlic?

495
00:46:27,533 --> 00:46:28,766
You need to grind it in circles.

496
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:34,633
The final step.

497
00:46:34,766 --> 00:46:36,166
Mix in the green plum wine.

498
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,266
The wine is in the glass bottle at my waist.

499
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:51,700
I didn't expect a cook like you to know

500
00:46:52,133 --> 00:46:52,833
how to make medicine.

501
00:46:53,366 --> 00:46:54,466
I'm a culinary master.

502
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,533
I can't move.

503
00:46:59,133 --> 00:46:59,866
Feed me.

504
00:47:07,633 --> 00:47:09,233
This is too slow.

505
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,033
Are you trying to choke me?

506
00:47:20,833 --> 00:47:22,100
Aren't you already better?

507
00:47:28,966 --> 00:47:30,000
These two are really

508
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,333
the same inside and out.

509
00:47:31,366 --> 00:47:32,500
Who am I the same as?

510
00:47:33,733 --> 00:47:34,766
You're eavesdropping again.

511
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,533
Someone who looks exactly like me.

512
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:40,566
Did you get close to me because of that?

513
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:42,966
Yao Ling'er.

514
00:47:42,966 --> 00:47:45,000
You must not let him hear your inner voice again.

515
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:45,900
I won't talk anymore.

516
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,200
Did you find anything?

517
00:47:54,133 --> 00:47:56,400
Is the villagers' poisoning related to these mushrooms?

518
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:58,166
So you already know.

519
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,600
Yes, it is related.

520
00:48:02,433 --> 00:48:03,133
This.

521
00:48:03,166 --> 00:48:04,866
I collected the poisonous gas

522
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,133
from the villagers yesterday.

523
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,633
Is there any way to detoxify it?

524
00:48:19,733 --> 00:48:20,966
This mushroom itself is not poisonous.

525
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,600
A demon cast a spell on it.

526
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,300
Drink this decoction.

527
00:48:40,033 --> 00:48:41,266
It smells so good.

528
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:42,333
Where were you last night?

529
00:48:42,566 --> 00:48:43,800
Last night…

530
00:48:44,333 --> 00:48:45,366
I didn't go anywhere.

531
00:48:45,366 --> 00:48:46,233
You're lying.

532
00:48:46,233 --> 00:48:47,100
I clearly saw you...

533
00:48:47,133 --> 00:48:47,933
Saw what?

534
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,433
Nothing.

535
00:48:53,833 --> 00:48:55,033
There's one more dish.

536
00:48:55,333 --> 00:48:56,266
I'll go get it.

537
00:48:59,833 --> 00:49:01,133
She's hiding something.

538
00:49:14,533 --> 00:49:15,633
Strange.

539
00:49:16,133 --> 00:49:17,733
She has no demonic energy on her.

540
00:49:18,733 --> 00:49:20,166
Did I really see wrong?

541
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,533
The demon behind this isn't weak.

542
00:49:25,166 --> 00:49:26,200
No matter what,

543
00:49:26,766 --> 00:49:28,600
I can't let Xiaoyao take risks again.

544
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:30,333
Otherwise,

545
00:49:30,566 --> 00:49:32,233
if the demonic energy in his body erupts,

546
00:49:32,766 --> 00:49:34,066
the consequences will be unimaginable.

547
00:49:35,166 --> 00:49:36,966
I want to see where you're hiding.

548
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:44,366
This woman's cooking is truly delicious.

549
00:49:58,633 --> 00:50:00,733
The ingredients for the wedding banquet are finally ready.

550
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,700
Wedding banquet?

551
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,200
Come, come, please.

552
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,000
Congratulations.

553
00:52:10,233 --> 00:52:11,300
Drink more, drink more.

554
00:52:11,333 --> 00:52:12,400
Same to you, same to you.

555
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,433
Congratulations to you too.

556
00:52:13,433 --> 00:52:14,433
Please, this way.

557
00:52:15,166 --> 00:52:16,166
Congratulations.

558
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:16,633
Congrats.

559
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:17,333
This way, please.

560
00:52:17,766 --> 00:52:18,366
Congratulations.

561
00:52:18,366 --> 00:52:18,666
This way.

562
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:19,800
I clearly saw her come here.

563
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:21,933
Where did she go?

564
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:23,500
[Duoru, a Rabbit Spirit in the Mortal Realm]

565
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:24,233
Over here, over here.
[Duoru, a Rabbit Spirit in the Mortal Realm]

566
00:52:24,233 --> 00:52:24,533
[Duoru, a Rabbit Spirit in the Mortal Realm]

567
00:52:24,566 --> 00:52:25,233
Please.
[Duoru, a Rabbit Spirit in the Mortal Realm]

568
00:52:25,233 --> 00:52:25,666
[Duoru, a Rabbit Spirit in the Mortal Realm]

569
00:52:26,166 --> 00:52:27,200
Duoduo's Broken-Tail.

570
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:28,700
Why is it with her?

571
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:29,200
Gently.

572
00:52:30,233 --> 00:52:30,733
You jinx.

573
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:31,933
We're celebrating a wedding.

574
00:52:31,966 --> 00:52:32,966
Who let you come?

575
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:36,366
Congratulations.

576
00:52:36,366 --> 00:52:36,966
Please come inside.

577
00:52:36,966 --> 00:52:38,033
Inside, inside.

578
00:52:38,933 --> 00:52:39,733
Congratulations.

579
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,100
There's no demonic aura.

580
00:52:59,533 --> 00:53:00,400
What's wrong? Are you alright?

581
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:01,466
Darling, what's wrong?

582
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:02,733
Save me!

583
00:53:06,233 --> 00:53:08,300
Today, we can finally enjoy a proper meal.

584
00:53:11,133 --> 00:53:12,200
Please, let it go.

585
00:53:12,833 --> 00:53:13,366
Get out of my way.

586
00:53:14,333 --> 00:53:15,833
If I let it go, what am I supposed to eat?

587
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,800
Your kindness cannot redeem greedy humans.

588
00:53:21,466 --> 00:53:22,766
Look at your own kind.

589
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,400
It struggles even to its last breath.

590
00:53:37,266 --> 00:53:38,533
You are merely a shard of kindness

591
00:53:38,566 --> 00:53:40,100
separated from me.

592
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:41,400
Yet you dream of replacing me.

593
00:53:43,033 --> 00:53:44,433
Don't blame me for not warning you.

594
00:53:44,833 --> 00:53:46,666
You don't have much time left.

595
00:54:16,633 --> 00:54:17,366
What's wrong with you?

596
00:54:24,933 --> 00:54:26,633
You finally came back.

597
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:20,933
She's already delirious.

598
00:55:22,433 --> 00:55:23,166
Come, come, come.

599
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:23,700
Here, please.

600
00:55:26,566 --> 00:55:27,566
It tastes really good.

601
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:29,433
Cheers.

602
00:55:34,966 --> 00:55:35,566
Darling.

603
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,200
What's wrong?

604
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,733
What's wrong? What happened?

605
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:43,600
Darling.

606
00:55:44,033 --> 00:55:44,700
What's wrong, darling?

607
00:55:45,766 --> 00:55:46,500
Young master.

608
00:55:47,733 --> 00:55:48,766
Young master, what's wrong?

609
00:55:48,766 --> 00:55:49,433
Save him!

610
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,433
Butler, look at him!

611
00:55:53,833 --> 00:55:55,133
What on earth is happening?

612
00:55:55,166 --> 00:55:56,433
You actually poisoned the food!

613
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,066
You're treating human life like nothing!

614
00:55:58,533 --> 00:55:59,566
You must give us an explanation!

615
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,800
I enjoy this resentment.

616
00:56:16,733 --> 00:56:17,800
So it really was you.

617
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,133
It must have been that cook who poisoned it.

618
00:56:20,033 --> 00:56:21,366
Hurry, catch that cook!

619
00:56:23,533 --> 00:56:24,366
Run!

620
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,000
I lost my composure earlier.

621
00:57:22,433 --> 00:57:23,466
I'm sorry.

622
00:57:23,733 --> 00:57:25,533
What were those things I just saw?

623
00:57:28,033 --> 00:57:28,900
Are you alright?

624
00:57:28,933 --> 00:57:29,533
Don't touch me.

625
00:57:38,233 --> 00:57:39,533
My son…

626
00:57:40,033 --> 00:57:40,666
Cheng...

627
00:57:42,266 --> 00:57:43,000
Cheng...

628
00:57:43,233 --> 00:57:44,733
My poor child…

629
00:57:45,566 --> 00:57:47,166
On such a joyous day…

630
00:57:48,033 --> 00:57:50,433
It has become the day of your death.

631
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:52,700
Don't worry.

632
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:54,866
As your father,

633
00:57:54,966 --> 00:57:56,833
I will definitely avenge you.

634
00:58:15,866 --> 00:58:16,366
Have some candy.

635
00:58:16,666 --> 00:58:17,500
Then you won't be sad.

636
00:58:18,366 --> 00:58:18,766
Duoduo.

637
00:58:20,766 --> 00:58:22,766
Who exactly poisoned him?

638
00:58:23,466 --> 00:58:25,200
Master, I've brought the cook.

639
00:58:25,433 --> 00:58:26,433
Look at the trouble you've caused!

640
00:58:26,766 --> 00:58:27,366
Master.

641
00:58:27,733 --> 00:58:28,266
Master.

642
00:58:28,633 --> 00:58:30,266
I wasn't the one who cooked.

643
00:58:30,766 --> 00:58:32,800
I don't even know that woman.

644
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,866
You don't know her?

645
00:58:34,033 --> 00:58:35,966
Then how did she get into the kitchen?

646
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:38,533
Master.

647
00:58:39,233 --> 00:58:40,566
I've been framed, Master!

648
00:58:42,966 --> 00:58:43,900
If you ask me,

649
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,900
it's rare to find someone who shares my culinary philosophy.

650
00:58:47,266 --> 00:58:47,900
What do you call that?

651
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,433
A bond at first sight.

652
00:58:49,666 --> 00:58:50,566
Come, let's drink!

653
00:58:51,866 --> 00:58:52,333
Another one!

654
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,133
A bond at first sight!

655
00:58:57,733 --> 00:58:59,166
Trying to outdrink me?

656
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,100
She framed me!

657
00:59:03,133 --> 00:59:04,466
It must be her!

658
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:05,333
It was her!

659
00:59:05,933 --> 00:59:06,766
So that means...

660
00:59:07,333 --> 00:59:09,600
you were drunk because she forced the drinks on you?

661
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:10,500
Master.

662
00:59:10,666 --> 00:59:12,166
Please believe me, Master!

663
00:59:12,533 --> 00:59:14,133
It has nothing to do with me!

664
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:15,133
My son…

665
00:59:15,466 --> 00:59:16,966
cannot die in vain.

666
00:59:20,233 --> 00:59:20,900
Investigate.

667
00:59:21,566 --> 00:59:22,466
Go investigate!

668
00:59:22,733 --> 00:59:23,833
Find out who it was!

669
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,233
Go investigate!

670
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:29,800
Could it be…

671
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:31,000
Xiaoyao…

672
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,500
Such strong demonic energy…

673
00:59:43,866 --> 00:59:45,566
Could a demon have taken Duoduo?

674
00:59:50,566 --> 00:59:52,000
So the cook really is here.

675
00:59:53,366 --> 00:59:53,966
Hurry!

676
00:59:54,533 --> 00:59:55,966
Surround the both of them!

677
00:59:56,433 --> 00:59:57,900
So it really was you!

678
00:59:58,566 --> 01:00:00,233
You poisoned my young master to death!

679
01:00:00,233 --> 01:00:01,900
Today, you will pay with your lives!

680
01:00:02,633 --> 01:00:04,533
The real culprit is someone else.

681
01:00:04,766 --> 01:00:06,366
You still dare to argue at death's door!

682
01:00:06,733 --> 01:00:07,533
She isn't lying.

683
01:00:07,833 --> 01:00:09,133
The culprit truly is someone else.

684
01:00:14,433 --> 01:00:17,333
Now that I've absorbed enough resentment,

685
01:00:17,766 --> 01:00:19,700
it's time for humans to pay the price.

686
01:00:20,066 --> 01:00:23,366
From now on, none of you can stop me.

687
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,133
Come take a look!

688
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:37,566
Fresh!

689
01:00:39,266 --> 01:00:40,700
These mushrooms look delicious.

690
01:00:42,933 --> 01:00:44,366
What exactly are you planning to do?

691
01:00:44,366 --> 01:00:45,700
As the saying goes,

692
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:46,900
before chaos strikes,

693
01:00:46,933 --> 01:00:48,333
everyone becomes wary.

694
01:00:48,733 --> 01:00:50,466
Since I feed on malice,

695
01:00:51,166 --> 01:00:53,033
naturally, I must ensure that Yishan Town

696
01:00:53,033 --> 01:00:55,033
will never know peace again.

697
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:07,300
Where is this place?

698
01:01:09,233 --> 01:01:09,900
Who?

699
01:01:11,066 --> 01:01:12,966
Do you still remember our promise?

700
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:16,633
Find the nine Broken-Tails.

701
01:01:17,033 --> 01:01:17,733
Activate the foxfire.

702
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,400
You haven't told me

703
01:01:21,433 --> 01:01:22,933
how to obtain the Broken-Tails.

704
01:01:23,666 --> 01:01:25,800
If a Broken-Tail fuses with a demon,

705
01:01:25,833 --> 01:01:27,233
it cannot be taken by force.

706
01:01:27,666 --> 01:01:29,966
You have to make her willingly give it up.

707
01:01:54,866 --> 01:01:56,300
Duoduo is inside this cave.

708
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:00,400
Follow me.

709
01:02:10,033 --> 01:02:10,766
Duoduo.

710
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:16,133
How could this happen?

711
01:02:18,033 --> 01:02:18,666
Duoduo…

712
01:02:18,866 --> 01:02:19,766
Wake up.

713
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:34,733
Fortunately, when I descended,

714
01:02:34,733 --> 01:02:36,333
I secretly brought some Jade Condensation Elixir from the heavens.

715
01:02:36,833 --> 01:02:38,133
It can temporarily stabilize the spirit.

716
01:02:38,666 --> 01:02:39,133
Duoduo…

717
01:02:39,733 --> 01:02:40,966
Why is your body like this?

718
01:02:41,066 --> 01:02:42,133
What exactly happened?

719
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,000
I…

720
01:02:45,066 --> 01:02:46,333
I'm about to vanish.

721
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:47,766
Vanish…

722
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:50,033
You still won't tell me now?

723
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:52,433
What is the relationship between you two?

724
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:54,400
What "two"?

725
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:56,133
And the Broken-Tail on your body…

726
01:02:57,233 --> 01:02:58,133
Why is it now…

727
01:02:58,633 --> 01:02:59,333
with her?

728
01:03:03,866 --> 01:03:05,133
Her name is Duoru.

729
01:03:06,233 --> 01:03:07,866
We were originally one.

730
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:09,733
On the day of the ritual,

731
01:03:10,666 --> 01:03:12,133
she took the opportunity to feed on resentment.

732
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:14,766
The resentment made her extremely powerful.

733
01:03:15,466 --> 01:03:16,900
She could no longer restrain herself,

734
01:03:17,066 --> 01:03:19,200
and separated from my body.

735
01:03:20,233 --> 01:03:20,900
No…

736
01:03:22,233 --> 01:03:23,233
Why not?

737
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:25,066
I want revenge.

738
01:03:25,633 --> 01:03:26,733
I want to kill them.

739
01:03:31,233 --> 01:03:32,766
I am finally free.

740
01:03:33,266 --> 01:03:34,366
From now on,

741
01:03:34,833 --> 01:03:35,866
I will be called Duoru.

742
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:37,166
No…

743
01:03:38,066 --> 01:03:38,866
No!

744
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,100
So…

745
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:42,900
the one who lured me into the forest earlier,

746
01:03:43,333 --> 01:03:44,733
and sent beasts to attack me,

747
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:45,900
was Duoru.

748
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:49,333
It's just that at that time,

749
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,600
she hadn't yet changed her appearance.

750
01:03:53,533 --> 01:03:55,466
You said she was a manifestation of resentment…

751
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:57,366
What kind of resentment, exactly,

752
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,700
could make your obsession so deep?

753
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:01,600
Because…

754
01:04:01,866 --> 01:04:03,166
Because of mother…

755
01:04:04,666 --> 01:04:06,066
Master is truly a sharpshooter!

756
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,866
This Master Xiao is really detestable!

757
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:14,366
But…

758
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:16,000
Every grievance has a cause.

759
01:04:16,666 --> 01:04:18,333
Duoru could punish Master Xiao.

760
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:20,300
Why did she poison his son?

761
01:04:20,866 --> 01:04:22,733
Because she also wants Master Xiao to

762
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,500
experience the pain of losing a loved one.

763
01:04:26,466 --> 01:04:27,733
Killing him outright…

764
01:04:28,333 --> 01:04:29,733
would be too easy for him.

765
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:31,800
She wants Master Xiao

766
01:04:33,133 --> 01:04:34,666
to suffer a living hell.

767
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:37,333
But what about the innocent civilians?

768
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:38,766
What wrong have they done?

769
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,633
What Duoru wants is resentment.

770
01:04:41,033 --> 01:04:42,700
Whether it's a natural disaster or man-made calamity,

771
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:44,566
in this chaotic world,

772
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:46,700
people will only accumulate more and more resentment.

773
01:04:47,433 --> 01:04:49,566
The more resentment she feeds on,

774
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:52,600
the more her body grows.

775
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:54,533
As resentment accumulates…

776
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:57,300
kindness gradually disappears.

777
01:04:57,833 --> 01:04:59,433
That's why my body

778
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,233
has become what it is now.

779
01:05:02,433 --> 01:05:03,166
Don't worry.

780
01:05:03,533 --> 01:05:04,466
We will save you.

781
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,233
It's too late.

782
01:05:34,866 --> 01:05:36,866
We have to find a way to save Duoduo.

783
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:38,566
First, we need to get out of here.

784
01:05:56,266 --> 01:05:57,066
What just happened?

785
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,300
What's going on?

786
01:05:59,733 --> 01:06:01,166
Run! There's a monster!

787
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:01,933
Run, run!

788
01:06:15,066 --> 01:06:15,866
Just wait.

789
01:06:16,033 --> 01:06:17,033
I'll make you a restorative soup.

790
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:43,700
Nourish with blood.

791
01:06:44,133 --> 01:06:46,466
Hopefully it will help her spirit last a bit longer.

792
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:56,300
Are you alright?

793
01:06:56,733 --> 01:06:57,633
I'm fine.

794
01:07:12,233 --> 01:07:14,466
This soup can only temporarily stabilize your spirit.

795
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:16,300
Brother…

796
01:07:16,733 --> 01:07:17,533
Sister…

797
01:07:18,266 --> 01:07:20,366
I have a way to subdue her.

798
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:21,666
But…

799
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,133
What way could possibly stop Duoru…

800
01:07:25,266 --> 01:07:26,800
Before I vanish,

801
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:28,666
she and I...

802
01:07:29,866 --> 01:07:31,100
will perish together.

803
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:32,400
What?

804
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:34,600
She and I were originally one.

805
01:07:35,066 --> 01:07:36,700
Before we separated,

806
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:39,100
Duoru already existed.

807
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:42,933
Our two spirits were linked, sharing life and death.

808
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:45,366
That's also why…

809
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:47,466
her demonic power is a hundred times stronger than mine,

810
01:07:47,833 --> 01:07:49,700
yet she cannot kill me by hand.

811
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,766
She can only feed on resentment

812
01:07:53,333 --> 01:07:54,466
to strengthen herself

813
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:55,800
and weaken me,

814
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:58,200
until I vanish.

815
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:02,366
No, you haven't done anything wrong.

816
01:08:02,533 --> 01:08:03,666
Don't be the one to sacrifice yourself.

817
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:06,366
Don't worry, there must be another way.

818
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:07,900
Sister…

819
01:08:08,433 --> 01:08:10,300
This whole matter started because of me.

820
01:08:11,433 --> 01:08:13,166
As long as Duoru exists,

821
01:08:13,633 --> 01:08:15,633
she will continue harming the people.

822
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:20,700
Besides, if this continues, I will vanish too.

823
01:08:21,333 --> 01:08:23,333
Might as well let me sacrifice myself.

824
01:08:27,233 --> 01:08:28,366
Quick, think of a solution.

825
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:31,533
Don't worry, there must be another way.

826
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Malice strengthens.

827
01:08:37,333 --> 01:08:38,466
Kindness fades.

828
01:08:39,533 --> 01:08:40,866
If your kindness grows stronger,

829
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:42,766
could it suppress Duoru's malice?

830
01:08:43,533 --> 01:08:44,833
Wouldn't you be saved then?

831
01:08:50,433 --> 01:08:50,866
Duoduo…

832
01:08:51,233 --> 01:08:51,866
Wait there.

833
01:08:52,233 --> 01:08:53,233
We'll be right back.

834
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:00,433
Sister…

835
01:09:14,333 --> 01:09:15,566
It's you.

836
01:09:23,533 --> 01:09:23,633
It's okay that you don't remember me.

837
01:09:23,933 --> 01:09:25,366
After all, my appearance has changed.

838
01:09:26,066 --> 01:09:26,700
Well…

839
01:09:26,866 --> 01:09:27,500
Don't be afraid.

840
01:09:27,733 --> 01:09:28,633
I'm here to save you.

841
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:31,600
Thank you… thank you, Sister.

842
01:09:34,566 --> 01:09:35,966
You only think about saving others.

843
01:09:36,566 --> 01:09:37,633
What about yourself?

844
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:41,766
But if I don't take her place,

845
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:44,000
someone else will still be taken.

846
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:46,100
Seeing how pitiful you look now…

847
01:09:47,533 --> 01:09:48,600
I suppose I'll help you.

848
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:53,533
But you must remember,

849
01:09:54,066 --> 01:09:55,666
this time, it's me, Duoru, who helped you.

850
01:09:55,966 --> 01:09:57,000
Alright, I'm leaving.

851
01:09:57,533 --> 01:09:58,033
Sister!

852
01:09:58,266 --> 01:09:59,133
Thank you.

853
01:10:05,433 --> 01:10:07,366
If you hadn't poisoned them first,

854
01:10:08,066 --> 01:10:09,100
those villagers would never

855
01:10:09,366 --> 01:10:10,566
have resorted to sacrifice,

856
01:10:11,133 --> 01:10:12,400
let alone have used it to extort money.

857
01:10:14,233 --> 01:10:15,133
I did nothing wrong.

858
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:17,566
It's their fault.

859
01:10:18,566 --> 01:10:19,966
They are too greedy.

860
01:10:28,366 --> 01:10:29,300
What do you need me to do?

861
01:10:30,033 --> 01:10:31,133
This medicinal dish

862
01:10:31,333 --> 01:10:33,066
must absorb the goodwill of two people

863
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:34,500
for it to be successfully made.

864
01:10:36,433 --> 01:10:37,333
I see.

865
01:10:40,633 --> 01:10:41,300
Let's begin.

866
01:11:18,933 --> 01:11:20,633
This dish is called Purifying Marrow Soup.

867
01:11:20,966 --> 01:11:22,666
It can absorb goodwill from a hundred miles around

868
01:11:23,066 --> 01:11:24,366
and cleanse the eater's spirit.

869
01:11:24,966 --> 01:11:26,566
Since their spirits are connected,

870
01:11:27,033 --> 01:11:28,133
as long as Duoduo drinks it,

871
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:29,933
Duoru's spirit will also be purified.

872
01:11:30,366 --> 01:11:32,100
And her malice will disperse.

873
01:11:33,333 --> 01:11:34,000
In this way,

874
01:11:34,233 --> 01:11:35,433
the two of them may have a chance

875
01:11:35,433 --> 01:11:36,700
to merge back together.

876
01:11:39,733 --> 01:11:41,533
Go! Let Duoduo drink the dish quickly.

877
01:11:43,866 --> 01:11:45,500
Duoduo, we've found a way!

878
01:11:51,066 --> 01:11:51,900
I heard

879
01:11:52,233 --> 01:11:55,166
your life is tied to that demon's.

880
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:56,800
You caused my mother's death.

881
01:11:57,133 --> 01:11:59,666
You deserve all the retribution you're suffering now.

882
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:00,700
Even now, facing death,

883
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:01,800
you still dare act tough?

884
01:12:08,466 --> 01:12:09,166
Duoru!

885
01:12:09,466 --> 01:12:10,066
Master!

886
01:12:10,066 --> 01:12:10,533
Hurry!

887
01:12:16,866 --> 01:12:17,566
Don't come any closer!

888
01:12:18,333 --> 01:12:19,733
Or I'll kill her!

889
01:12:21,066 --> 01:12:22,133
Kill her?

890
01:12:22,333 --> 01:12:23,466
Do you think I'd care?

891
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:25,600
I've been wanting to kill her for a long time.

892
01:12:26,233 --> 01:12:27,733
Don't think I don't know.

893
01:12:28,066 --> 01:12:28,800
Your life

894
01:12:28,833 --> 01:12:30,633
is bound to hers.

895
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:32,400
If I kill her,

896
01:12:32,566 --> 01:12:33,766
you won't survive either.

897
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:38,033
Duoru!

898
01:12:41,533 --> 01:12:42,833
So it's true…

899
01:12:43,066 --> 01:12:43,733
You demon!

900
01:12:43,966 --> 01:12:45,066
Now your life

901
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:46,333
is in my hands.

902
01:12:46,766 --> 01:12:49,400
I'm going to torture you thoroughly,

903
01:12:49,833 --> 01:12:51,300
to avenge my son.

904
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:53,233
Despicable!

905
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:03,166
Despicable humans…

906
01:13:04,666 --> 01:13:06,466
I'll kill every last one of you!

907
01:13:13,033 --> 01:13:13,666
No!

908
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:43,100
Stop her, quickly!

909
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:45,033
Otherwise the entire town will perish!

910
01:14:27,866 --> 01:14:29,300
Their spirits have merged together again.

911
01:14:34,166 --> 01:14:35,600
She's preparing to release all her power

912
01:14:35,633 --> 01:14:36,500
to save everyone in town.

913
01:14:50,833 --> 01:14:52,700
What's happening? What's going on?

914
01:14:52,866 --> 01:14:55,200
What happened? What is this?

915
01:14:59,333 --> 01:15:00,766
The villagers have been saved.

916
01:15:01,566 --> 01:15:02,766
And my great vengeance is fulfilled.

917
01:15:03,333 --> 01:15:05,066
Thank you for helping me complete my last wish.

918
01:15:06,633 --> 01:15:07,733
This Broken-Tail

919
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:09,166
is returned to you.

920
01:15:47,666 --> 01:15:48,766
Duoduo is truly too kind.

921
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:50,700
To save the whole town,

922
01:15:51,333 --> 01:15:52,733
she sacrificed all of her cultivation.

923
01:15:53,133 --> 01:15:54,266
For her,

924
01:15:55,333 --> 01:15:56,766
this may not necessarily be a bad thing.

925
01:15:57,233 --> 01:15:59,100
This forest is rarely visited.

926
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:01,733
She can live a peaceful life here from now on.

927
01:16:02,633 --> 01:16:03,900
It's a pity that those villagers

928
01:16:04,233 --> 01:16:05,433
will never know

929
01:16:06,033 --> 01:16:07,333
how much Duoduo sacrificed

930
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:09,200
to save them.

931
01:16:15,833 --> 01:16:17,133
Just now Duoduo said

932
01:16:17,333 --> 01:16:18,266
"the Broken-Tail."

933
01:16:18,666 --> 01:16:19,666
What is the Broken-Tail?

934
01:16:20,733 --> 01:16:21,866
It is the

935
01:16:23,966 --> 01:16:25,266
ancestral heirloom of the Xia family.

936
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:28,833
But you,

937
01:16:29,266 --> 01:16:30,800
an Immortal descending to the mortal realm,

938
01:16:32,333 --> 01:16:33,933
would endure so much for a stranger.

939
01:16:35,033 --> 01:16:36,966
Could it be that you, too, are after the Broken-Tail?

940
01:16:37,766 --> 01:16:38,633
Of course.

941
01:16:39,133 --> 01:16:40,866
The Broken-Tail originally belonged to the Immortal Realm.

942
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:43,133
But your ancestor rendered great service there,

943
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:45,700
so it was granted to the Xia family.

944
01:16:46,366 --> 01:16:47,600

01:29:01,066 --> 01:29:01,800
Mo Nan.

1133
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:03,333
I told him

1134
01:29:03,366 --> 01:29:04,866
the academy was hiring teachers.

1135
01:29:13,633 --> 01:29:14,800
Your hairpin's crooked.

1136
01:29:15,666 --> 01:29:17,133
I'm from Longhu Academy,

1137
01:29:17,533 --> 01:29:19,233
nicknamed One Blossom,

1138
01:29:19,566 --> 01:29:20,500
Zhi Hua.

1139
01:29:21,333 --> 01:29:23,533
Mr. Mo, are you married?

1140
01:29:25,133 --> 01:29:28,033
I mean, the academy has rules.

1141
01:29:28,066 --> 01:29:30,866
We need info on every tutor.

1142
01:29:31,133 --> 01:29:33,000
Mr. Mo, don't take offense.

1143
01:29:35,933 --> 01:29:37,800
Yesterday she clung to Xiaoyao.

1144
01:29:38,633 --> 01:29:40,433
Today she's stuck to Senior.

1145
01:29:40,900 --> 01:29:43,600
She sure changes hearts fast.

1146
01:29:45,533 --> 01:29:46,666
Moonlight before my bed.

1147
01:29:46,700 --> 01:29:47,766
Seems like frost on the ground.

1148
01:29:48,433 --> 01:29:49,333
The sun sets behind the hills.

1149
01:29:49,333 --> 01:29:50,400
The Yellow River flows to the sea.

1150
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:52,233
Green sunflowers in the garden.

1151
01:29:52,266 --> 01:29:53,266
Dawn dew waits for sunlight.

1152
01:29:53,566 --> 01:29:54,366
Hoeing at noon in the field.

1153
01:29:54,366 --> 01:29:55,200
Sweat drips onto the soil.

1154
01:29:56,466 --> 01:29:56,933
Not bad.

1155
01:29:57,566 --> 01:29:58,566
You are all teachable children.

1156
01:29:59,133 --> 01:29:59,733
Go eat.

1157
01:30:01,133 --> 01:30:01,733
Great!

1158
01:30:01,966 --> 01:30:02,833
I'm starving.

1159
01:30:02,866 --> 01:30:04,366
Thank you, teacher.

1160
01:30:05,166 --> 01:30:05,600
Thanks, sir.

1161
01:30:05,633 --> 01:30:07,233
Come on, I'm starving!

1162
01:30:09,866 --> 01:30:10,333
Delicious!

1163
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:11,966
So good!

1164
01:30:12,233 --> 01:30:12,700
I want this!

1165
01:30:12,933 --> 01:30:13,400
Try this!

1166
01:30:13,433 --> 01:30:13,966
Amazing!

1167
01:30:13,966 --> 01:30:14,533
Taste this!

1168
01:30:14,866 --> 01:30:15,966
This rocks too!

1169
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:19,733
Smells divine!

1170
01:30:21,466 --> 01:30:22,200
Really tasty!

1171
01:30:23,633 --> 01:30:24,266
Your senior?

1172
01:30:27,466 --> 01:30:28,466
Came from the heavens?

1173
01:30:33,066 --> 01:30:34,266
Pardon me.

1174
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:36,733
Ling'er and I grew up together,

1175
01:30:36,733 --> 01:30:37,666
been side by side for eons.

1176
01:30:39,166 --> 01:30:40,533
She descended for her tribulation.

1177
01:30:40,866 --> 01:30:41,666
I was worried.

1178
01:30:41,966 --> 01:30:43,500
So I came to help.

1179
01:30:44,366 --> 01:30:45,433
I heard you just arrived

1180
01:30:45,466 --> 01:30:46,733
and got hired immediately.

1181
01:30:47,066 --> 01:30:49,400
He passed the test too.

1182
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:12,833
It's just that

1183
01:31:13,366 --> 01:31:14,500
he passed

1184
01:31:15,166 --> 01:31:16,100
a little

1185
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:17,366
faster.

1186
01:31:20,066 --> 01:31:22,666
Comparing a deity like me to a mortal like you

1187
01:31:23,166 --> 01:31:24,233
is indeed unfair.

1188
01:31:25,666 --> 01:31:26,533
Mr. Xia.

1189
01:31:27,333 --> 01:31:29,000
You're not mad, right?

1190
01:31:29,766 --> 01:31:31,233
Am I that petty?

1191
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:32,166
Yes.

1192
01:31:36,066 --> 01:31:36,566
Come.

1193
01:31:36,766 --> 01:31:37,400
Out.

1194
01:31:38,566 --> 01:31:39,466
Need to talk.

1195
01:31:46,633 --> 01:31:47,633
Don't be angry.

1196
01:31:47,866 --> 01:31:49,366
He'll only stay a few days.

1197
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:50,600
Just a few days.

1198
01:31:51,866 --> 01:31:53,400
Does he know I'm searching for tails?

1199
01:31:55,733 --> 01:31:57,800
He's a deity.

1200
01:31:58,433 --> 01:31:59,133
His power

1201
01:31:59,366 --> 01:32:00,366
far beyond mine.

1202
01:32:00,933 --> 01:32:02,033
So he knows.

1203
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:06,933
Relax, he's on our side.

1204
01:32:11,333 --> 01:32:13,200
Then you and him...

1205
01:32:13,666 --> 01:32:15,200
really just

1206
01:32:16,133 --> 01:32:17,166
fellow disciples?

1207
01:32:17,433 --> 01:32:18,266
What else?

1208
01:32:42,466 --> 01:32:45,066
I still prefer watching the moon here with you.

1209
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:47,966
If only it could stay like this.

1210
01:32:49,066 --> 01:32:50,500
Clouds envy her gown,

1211
01:32:51,266 --> 01:32:52,166
blooms envy her face.

1212
01:32:53,433 --> 01:32:56,300
Spring breeze reveals dewy grace.

1213
01:32:57,266 --> 01:32:59,300
If not glimpsed upon the Jade Mountain,

1214
01:33:00,933 --> 01:33:02,333
we'd have reunited

1215
01:33:03,266 --> 01:33:04,466
beneath the moon.

1216
01:33:06,566 --> 01:33:07,400
Liu…

1217
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:10,300
Can you not go back later?

1218
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:12,233
Stay with me a little longer.

1219
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:13,866
Silly girl.

1220
01:33:14,266 --> 01:33:15,466
What's wrong with you today?

1221
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:16,433
So sappy.

1222
01:33:17,066 --> 01:33:18,133
You know I've got

1223
01:33:18,333 --> 01:33:20,000
something big to finish.

1224
01:33:21,933 --> 01:33:22,833
It's late.

1225
01:33:23,300 --> 01:33:24,400
Get some rest.

1226
01:33:24,666 --> 01:33:25,433
Liu…

1227
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:33,400
You wretched woman. You ignored me.

1228
01:33:33,533 --> 01:33:34,366
For not listening.

1229
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:37,933
You vile woman.

1230
01:33:38,166 --> 01:33:39,866
Didn't you used to look down on me?

1231
01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:41,533
Said I had no money.

1232
01:33:41,666 --> 01:33:42,900
Well, I have money now.

1233
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:44,100
Lots of money.

1234
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:57,933
Realize your mistake?

1235
01:34:12,933 --> 01:34:13,733
My lord!

1236
01:34:14,266 --> 01:34:15,533
My lord!

1237
01:34:16,300 --> 01:34:17,566
My lord!

1238
01:34:57,266 --> 01:34:58,600
It even has a protective barrier.

1239
01:35:08,633 --> 01:35:10,700
This Secret Chamber is definitely suspicious.

1240
01:35:12,266 --> 01:35:13,133
What are you doing?

1241
01:35:14,466 --> 01:35:15,133
Who are you?

1242
01:35:16,733 --> 01:35:17,400
Master.

1243
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:19,000
I'm the new tutor.

1244
01:35:19,333 --> 01:35:21,133
Just passing by, curious.

1245
01:35:22,900 --> 01:35:24,300
You're the new tutor?

1246
01:35:24,833 --> 01:35:26,133
Learn the rules here.

1247
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:29,733
Only I can enter this chamber.

1248
01:35:30,133 --> 01:35:30,866
Others

1249
01:35:31,466 --> 01:35:32,533
are not allowed near it.

1250
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:34,100
My apologies.

1251
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:35,633
It's fine.

1252
01:35:35,866 --> 01:35:36,533
Go on with your work.

1253
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:56,266
Liu.

1254
01:36:00,233 --> 01:36:00,733
Come.

1255
01:36:04,066 --> 01:36:04,866
Liu!

1256
01:36:05,700 --> 01:36:07,533
Why are you so happy lately?

1257
01:36:08,466 --> 01:36:09,333
Lately I

1258
01:36:09,733 --> 01:36:11,766
found something really interesting.

1259
01:36:14,233 --> 01:36:15,166
What is it?

1260
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:17,733
I won't tell you.

1261
01:36:24,833 --> 01:36:25,900
Annoying!

1262
01:36:28,933 --> 01:36:32,333
[Longhu Academy]

1263
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:48,700
is up to the master.

1264
01:37:53,266 --> 01:37:54,566
This exam

1265
01:37:55,133 --> 01:37:56,366
is really suspicious.

1266
01:37:57,200 --> 01:37:58,466
You mean...

1267
01:37:58,833 --> 01:38:00,833
Someone must've cheated.

1268
01:38:01,333 --> 01:38:03,600
No way they'd improve this fast.

1269
01:38:04,133 --> 01:38:04,933
This matter

1270
01:38:04,933 --> 01:38:06,800
needs a full investigation first.

1271
01:38:07,033 --> 01:38:07,633
Master,

1272
01:38:08,333 --> 01:38:09,666
do you have proof

1273
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:10,600
these students cheated?

1274
01:38:11,433 --> 01:38:12,133
Mr. Xia.

1275
01:38:12,633 --> 01:38:15,266
I say this because I've heard some rumors.

1276
01:38:16,100 --> 01:38:18,033
If you let them cheat

1277
01:38:18,233 --> 01:38:20,166
just to pass the test,

1278
01:38:20,433 --> 01:38:20,900
then

1279
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:22,633
your morals are lacking

1280
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:24,100
and you're unfit to teach.

1281
01:38:25,533 --> 01:38:26,133
Of course.

1282
01:38:26,533 --> 01:38:28,866
About your past, Mr. Xia,

1283
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:30,133
I've also heard a bit.

1284
01:38:30,833 --> 01:38:32,900
After the family tragedy in your youth,

1285
01:38:33,100 --> 01:38:34,133
no one disciplined you,

1286
01:38:34,333 --> 01:38:35,400
so manners were missed.

1287
01:38:35,866 --> 01:38:37,266
I can understand.

1288
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:38,933
You accuse others without proof?

1289
01:38:39,033 --> 01:38:40,666
Is this how a master behaves?

1290
01:38:41,633 --> 01:38:42,633
Calm down.

1291
01:38:43,066 --> 01:38:43,866
Young man.

1292
01:38:44,033 --> 01:38:45,033
Easy now.

1293
01:38:45,233 --> 01:38:46,366
Don't get so worked up.

1294
01:38:47,633 --> 01:38:48,233
Confucius said,

1295
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:50,833
“Bad child, father's fault;

1296
01:38:51,333 --> 01:38:53,666
Lax teaching, teacher's blame.”

1297
01:38:54,033 --> 01:38:55,266
That's the truth.

1298
01:38:56,433 --> 01:38:58,133
I declare this test

1299
01:38:58,433 --> 01:38:59,100
null and void.

1300
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:00,066
Yes.

1301
01:39:17,833 --> 01:39:18,633
Senior.

1302
01:39:19,333 --> 01:39:22,166
I can handle this kind of thing myself.

1303
01:39:22,833 --> 01:39:24,666
If it were just three or five dishes,

1304
01:39:24,666 --> 01:39:25,800
I wouldn't have come.

1305
01:39:26,433 --> 01:39:28,733
There are so many in the academy,

1306
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:30,033
you alone

1307
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:31,133
can't manage it all.

1308
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:39,300
Come, Junior Sis.

1309
01:39:39,633 --> 01:39:40,666
Try my cooking.

1310
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:41,933
Senior Brother...

1311
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:42,800
This...

1312
01:39:42,833 --> 01:39:43,466
What?

1313
01:39:43,700 --> 01:39:44,766
You kitchen god,

1314
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:45,900
too proud to rate me?

1315
01:39:55,466 --> 01:39:56,100
Well?

1316
01:39:57,533 --> 01:39:58,266
Tasty!

1317
01:40:00,100 --> 01:40:01,366
We grew up together,

1318
01:40:01,900 --> 01:40:02,700
your taste,

1319
01:40:02,933 --> 01:40:04,233
I know best.

1320
01:40:07,633 --> 01:40:08,500
You came just in time.

1321
01:40:08,533 --> 01:40:09,866
Come in and try my dishes.

1322
01:40:13,666 --> 01:40:15,266
I heard he failed the test.

1323
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,200
Even if he did,

1324
01:40:17,433 --> 01:40:19,100
no need to vent on us.

1325
01:40:40,066 --> 01:40:40,700
Junior Sis,

1326
01:40:40,700 --> 01:40:41,500
you okay?

1327
01:40:44,133 --> 01:40:44,966
It's nothing.

1328
01:40:45,833 --> 01:40:46,966
Just a bit tired.

1329
01:40:47,633 --> 01:40:48,833
Let me check for you.

1330
01:40:52,733 --> 01:40:53,533
One piece is missing.

1331
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:57,066
You don't have much time left.

1332
01:40:57,300 --> 01:40:58,300
I'm fine, senior.

1333
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,233
Before the plum mark fades,

1334
01:41:00,533 --> 01:41:01,600
we must find Broken-Tail fast.

1335
01:41:15,633 --> 01:41:16,333
I understand.

1336
01:41:16,633 --> 01:41:17,533
You go first.

1337
01:41:20,533 --> 01:41:21,633
What's this?

1338
01:41:22,033 --> 01:41:23,333
I brewed it specially for you.

1339
01:41:23,333 --> 01:41:24,166
A beauty-boosting tonic.

1340
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:25,633
Drink it and I guarantee

1341
01:41:25,866 --> 01:41:26,800
you'll become everyone's dream.

1342
01:41:45,866 --> 01:41:46,766
I...

1343
01:41:47,300 --> 01:41:48,533
Do I look prettier?

1344
01:41:50,900 --> 01:41:52,133
Something about you has changed.

1345
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:54,300
So annoying.

1346
01:41:58,900 --> 01:41:59,766
That...

1347
01:41:59,900 --> 01:42:00,700
Zhi Hua.

1348
01:42:00,833 --> 01:42:01,833
Just let me gossip a bit.

1349
01:42:02,066 --> 01:42:04,300
This Longhu Academy's famous far and wide.

1350
01:42:04,466 --> 01:42:05,333
But why

1351
01:42:05,333 --> 01:42:06,966
can't you find a teacher?

1352
01:42:07,466 --> 01:42:09,566
We're always recruiting talent.

1353
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:12,700
Our master believes in ruling by non-action.

1354
01:42:13,066 --> 01:42:15,000
He forbids teachers from being strict.

1355
01:42:19,133 --> 01:42:19,766
Students.

1356
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,133
Keep it down.

1357
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:25,533
Don't be rude.

1358
01:42:27,066 --> 01:42:28,800
Class is starting.

1359
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:39,866
These little brats.

1360
01:42:43,133 --> 01:42:44,566
I can't teach them.

1361
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:45,733
Look.

1362
01:42:46,066 --> 01:42:47,400
What a mess they've made.

1363
01:42:47,866 --> 01:42:48,600
This is outrageous.

1364
01:42:48,766 --> 01:42:49,733
Sir.

1365
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:51,400
Stay calm, please.

1366
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:54,533
From my view,

1367
01:42:54,666 --> 01:42:57,266
these kids are good at heart.

1368
01:42:57,800 --> 01:42:59,500
With a little guidance from us,

1369
01:42:59,733 --> 01:43:00,666
they'll make something of themselves.

1370
01:43:00,933 --> 01:43:01,333
Come,

1371
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:03,133
cool down.

1372
01:43:03,266 --> 01:43:04,700
Whoever wants to teach can go ahead.

1373
01:43:05,300 --> 01:43:06,433
I quit.

1374
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:08,300
Sir.

1375
01:43:14,233 --> 01:43:15,166
I see.

1376
01:43:15,700 --> 01:43:18,800
But teachers who meet the master's standards

1377
01:43:19,466 --> 01:43:20,533
are far too few.

1378
01:43:22,100 --> 01:43:22,766
By the way, Librarian,

1379
01:43:23,533 --> 01:43:25,433
I hear the Secret Chamber in the academy

1380
01:43:25,466 --> 01:43:26,366
holds many rare books.

1381
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,500
Why doesn't the master open it to all?

1382
01:43:29,200 --> 01:43:30,000
Could it be

1383
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:31,500
there's a secret inside?

1384
01:43:32,100 --> 01:43:33,966
Don't ask what you shouldn't.

1385
01:43:53,066 --> 01:43:55,100
We have to get the key from him

1386
01:43:55,466 --> 01:43:56,866
to enter the Secret Chamber.

1387
01:44:12,600 --> 01:44:13,433
Liu.

1388
01:44:14,066 --> 01:44:15,366
Why are you drawing her again?

1389
01:44:16,233 --> 01:44:18,366
The previous one is no longer usable.

1390
01:44:19,900 --> 01:44:20,800
Let me give it a try.

1391
01:44:23,666 --> 01:44:24,466
Liu...

1392
01:44:25,933 --> 01:44:27,133
I was wrong.

1393
01:44:28,033 --> 01:44:28,933
Naughty.

1394
01:44:30,066 --> 01:44:30,633
It's fine.

1395
01:44:45,233 --> 01:44:46,166
This mole

1396
01:44:46,600 --> 01:44:47,800
was actually dotted by you.

1397
01:45:11,633 --> 01:45:12,933
Once he drinks the Truth-Telling Soup,

1398
01:45:13,233 --> 01:45:14,733
I'll definitely get from Xu Qianliu

1399
01:45:14,933 --> 01:45:16,766
the secret of the Broken-Tail hidden in Secret Chamber.

1400
01:45:18,300 --> 01:45:19,500
I am truly brilliant.

1401
01:45:27,333 --> 01:45:28,233
Come in.

1402
01:45:31,466 --> 01:45:32,133
Master.

1403
01:45:32,266 --> 01:45:33,533
I am the new cook.

1404
01:45:33,733 --> 01:45:35,933
The librarian Zhi Hua said you like soup.

1405
01:45:36,233 --> 01:45:38,333
So I made this especially for you.

1406
01:45:39,900 --> 01:45:41,133
Lately my teeth are bad.

1407
01:45:41,266 --> 01:45:42,100
I can't have sweets.

1408
01:45:42,100 --> 01:45:42,733
Thank you.

1409
01:45:44,333 --> 01:45:45,466
You may not know,

1410
01:45:45,700 --> 01:45:47,266
this soup contains licorice,

1411
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:48,633
which helps treat dental issues.

1412
01:45:50,033 --> 01:45:51,533
Then leave it here.

1413
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:54,133
How cunning.

1414
01:45:54,466 --> 01:45:55,966
It seems I'll have to find another opportunity.

1415
01:45:58,666 --> 01:45:59,533
Master, please carry on with your work.

1416
01:45:59,733 --> 01:46:00,733
I'll take my leave now.

1417
01:46:14,700 --> 01:46:16,366
This woman is a bit strange.

1418
01:46:16,466 --> 01:46:18,000
Zhi Hua, keep a close eye on her.

1419
01:46:18,266 --> 01:46:18,733
Yes.

1420
01:46:19,066 --> 01:46:19,700
Zhi Hua.

1421
01:46:27,066 --> 01:46:27,700
Yes.

1422
01:46:39,666 --> 01:46:40,533
Please don't speak yet.

1423
01:46:40,733 --> 01:46:41,800
Listen to me first.

1424
01:46:42,633 --> 01:46:43,566
Congratulations, sir.

1425
01:46:43,833 --> 01:46:45,000
Your moral character is noble,

1426
01:46:45,033 --> 01:46:46,033
and your teaching is first-rate.

1427
01:46:46,466 --> 01:46:48,266
After our Longhu Academy's assessment,

1428
01:46:48,466 --> 01:46:50,733
you are officially hired as a teacher.

1429
01:46:52,866 --> 01:46:53,900
But earlier,

1430
01:46:54,166 --> 01:46:55,300
that's not what the master said.

1431
01:46:55,666 --> 01:46:56,766
You may not know.

1432
01:46:57,033 --> 01:46:58,133
The master's words

1433
01:46:58,466 --> 01:46:59,700
were also part of the assessment.

1434
01:47:00,333 --> 01:47:02,533
He wanted to see if you could remain calm

1435
01:47:02,633 --> 01:47:04,766
after being falsely accused.

1436
01:47:05,066 --> 01:47:07,333
And indeed, you passed the test.

1437
01:47:07,833 --> 01:47:09,466
That counts as calm?

1438
01:47:09,666 --> 01:47:10,366
It's pretty good.

1439
01:47:10,733 --> 01:47:13,400
The previous teachers lost their composure,

1440
01:47:13,766 --> 01:47:14,866
and even fought with the master.

1441
01:47:15,066 --> 01:47:16,566
They almost stabbed him with a knife.

1442
01:47:18,266 --> 01:47:19,700
Your master's assessment

1443
01:47:20,066 --> 01:47:22,000
is truly unique.

1444
01:47:24,133 --> 01:47:25,000
Though...

1445
01:47:25,733 --> 01:47:27,866
It's not good to inquire about others,

1446
01:47:28,233 --> 01:47:29,366
but I do have something

1447
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:31,166
I'd like to ask.

1448
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:32,700
Do you know

1449
01:47:32,700 --> 01:47:34,700
what the relationship is

1450
01:47:34,933 --> 01:47:36,033
between Miss Yao and Mr. Mo?

1451
01:47:39,266 --> 01:47:40,900
To be honest with you, sir,

1452
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:42,600
I have secretly admired Mr. Mo

1453
01:47:42,766 --> 01:47:44,633
for a long time.

1454
01:47:44,866 --> 01:47:47,500
But he only gets close to Miss Yao.

1455
01:47:47,866 --> 01:47:49,100
Aren't they just fellow disciples?

1456
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:51,400
Are they really just that?

1457
01:47:51,633 --> 01:47:52,633
I see the two of them

1458
01:47:52,900 --> 01:47:54,600
together every day,

1459
01:47:54,900 --> 01:47:56,400
inseparable and affectionate.

1460
01:47:56,900 --> 01:47:58,500
The way they look at each other

1461
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,133
is quite ambiguous.

1462
01:48:00,933 --> 01:48:01,566
I even saw them

1463
01:48:01,700 --> 01:48:03,433
cozying up in the study.

1464
01:48:04,066 --> 01:48:04,800
Not sure doing what.

1465
01:48:21,233 --> 01:48:22,333
Why are you telling me all this?

1466
01:48:22,700 --> 01:48:24,966
I just wanted someone to talk to.

1467
01:48:25,433 --> 01:48:28,733
It seems they really are a perfect match.

1468
01:48:29,066 --> 01:48:30,433
I and Mr. Mo

1469
01:48:30,700 --> 01:48:32,000
have no hope left.

1470
01:48:43,133 --> 01:48:44,300
Where have you been?

1471
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:45,866
I haven't seen you these past few days.

1472
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:47,833
My sweet soup plan failed.

1473
01:48:48,033 --> 01:48:48,633
It seems

1474
01:48:48,900 --> 01:48:50,300
we'll have to find another way.

1475
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:51,233
What sweet soup?

1476
01:48:52,266 --> 01:48:54,200
I tried to trick Xu Qianliu into drinking the Truth-Telling Soup,

1477
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:55,833
then ask about the Secret Chamber's secret.

1478
01:48:56,233 --> 01:48:58,033
This wouldn't be another brilliant idea

1479
01:48:58,900 --> 01:49:00,300
from your dear senior brother, would it?

1480
01:49:00,466 --> 01:49:01,800
Senior brother?

1481
01:49:02,933 --> 01:49:03,633
That's right.

1482
01:49:04,033 --> 01:49:05,066
I'll go ask senior brother

1483
01:49:05,066 --> 01:49:06,266
to see if he has any good ideas.

1484
01:49:06,533 --> 01:49:07,533
Then go find your senior brother.

1485
01:49:08,266 --> 01:49:09,100
Why come looking for me?

1486
01:49:13,066 --> 01:49:14,366
How absurd.

1487
01:49:14,833 --> 01:49:16,200
What's there to be angry about?

1488
01:49:34,033 --> 01:49:34,933
the other is a demon.

1489
01:49:35,400 --> 01:49:36,700
Their resentment

1490
01:49:36,866 --> 01:49:39,400
is far stronger than ordinary people's.

1491
01:49:41,666 --> 01:49:42,400
This time,

1492
01:49:43,100 --> 01:49:45,133
I will definitely paint a perfect woman.

1493
01:49:46,133 --> 01:49:46,933
Keep an eye on them.

1494
01:49:47,300 --> 01:49:48,433
It's best if they keep arguing.

1495
01:49:48,900 --> 01:49:49,433
Yes.

1496
01:50:32,900 --> 01:50:34,433
My lord, I was wrong.

1497
01:50:36,133 --> 01:50:38,166
My lord, I was wrong.

1498
01:50:42,966 --> 01:50:43,700
Cry!

1499
01:50:44,133 --> 01:50:45,566
My lord, I was wrong.

1500
01:50:45,633 --> 01:50:46,366
Shed tears.

1501
01:50:46,466 --> 01:50:48,733
Why is this woman acting so strangely?

1502
01:50:49,300 --> 01:50:49,933
Louder!

1503
01:50:51,966 --> 01:50:52,833
I was wrong.

1504
01:50:52,866 --> 01:50:53,700
Louder!

1505
01:50:53,700 --> 01:50:55,400
I was wrong.

1506
01:50:55,433 --> 01:50:56,666
Leave me alone?

1507
01:50:57,066 --> 01:50:58,400
I'll beat you, you wretched woman.

1508
01:50:59,666 --> 01:51:00,400
I was wrong.

1509
01:51:00,433 --> 01:51:01,466
I'll beat you, you wretched woman.

1510
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:51,933
Ling'er.

1511
01:51:54,233 --> 01:51:55,100
It's late.

1512
01:51:55,500 --> 01:51:56,600
Go back and rest early.

1513
01:52:03,900 --> 01:52:05,433
I feel like something's off,

1514
01:52:07,966 --> 01:52:09,466
but I can't say what.

1515
01:52:15,633 --> 01:52:17,733
That fox demon already carries heavy resentment.

1516
01:52:19,300 --> 01:52:19,833
Junior sister,

1517
01:52:20,633 --> 01:52:21,500
don't take it to heart.

1518
01:52:24,766 --> 01:52:25,800
It's so late.

1519
01:52:26,700 --> 01:52:28,133
Why hasn't he come back yet?

1520
01:52:28,933 --> 01:52:29,933
Where on earth has he gone?

1521
01:52:34,466 --> 01:52:35,200
No.

1522
01:52:35,533 --> 01:52:36,433
I'm going to look for him.

1523
01:52:38,333 --> 01:52:38,866
Junior sister.

1524
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:41,966
Senior brother, hurry up.

1525
01:52:45,833 --> 01:52:46,666
Who are you?

1526
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:47,933
Is there something?

1527
01:52:48,266 --> 01:52:49,800
Don't go to that academy anymore.

1528
01:52:50,233 --> 01:52:50,933
It's dangerous.

1529
01:52:51,366 --> 01:52:52,833
What danger does the academy face?

1530
01:52:53,633 --> 01:52:54,566
How do you know?

1531
01:53:09,166 --> 01:53:10,133
Perfect.

1532
01:53:36,100 --> 01:53:37,433
What on earth is going on?

1533
01:53:38,466 --> 01:53:39,366
Back then,

1534
01:53:40,133 --> 01:53:41,133
he and I eloped

1535
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:43,266
We lived in hardship for a time.

1536
01:53:44,366 --> 01:53:45,700
We were constantly quarreling.

1537
01:53:48,100 --> 01:53:50,133
Can such an expensive brush be eaten as food?

1538
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:53,100
My dear,

1539
01:53:53,900 --> 01:53:55,533
if I buy a better brush,

1540
01:53:55,966 --> 01:53:57,533
I can paint better paintings.

1541
01:53:57,700 --> 01:53:58,800
And if I paint well,

1542
01:53:59,533 --> 01:54:00,166
we can

1543
01:54:00,166 --> 01:54:01,900
sell them for a good price, right?

1544
01:54:02,500 --> 01:54:03,433
Return this brush

1545
01:54:03,466 --> 01:54:04,166
and get a refund.

1546
01:54:04,333 --> 01:54:05,266
No, no, no.

1547
01:54:05,300 --> 01:54:06,100
Keep it so I can paint!

1548
01:54:06,100 --> 01:54:07,133
This brush is truly excellent!

1549
01:54:07,133 --> 01:54:07,633
I...

1550
01:54:07,666 --> 01:54:09,133
I feel inspired when I hold it.

1551
01:54:09,133 --> 01:54:09,600
We can

1552
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:10,800
sell the paintings for lots of money!

1553
01:54:12,366 --> 01:54:13,966
Are you done yet or not?

1554
01:54:13,966 --> 01:54:14,966
You dare hit me?

1555
01:54:15,133 --> 01:54:15,966
Who gave you the guts?

1556
01:54:16,166 --> 01:54:16,833
I must keep it.

1557
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:17,900
How dare you!

1558
01:54:17,933 --> 01:54:18,600
Enough!

1559
01:54:18,666 --> 01:54:20,566
Who gave you the courage to hit me?

1560
01:54:20,733 --> 01:54:21,800
Hit me? I'll beat you to death!

1561
01:54:22,366 --> 01:54:23,433
How dare you hit me!

1562
01:54:24,100 --> 01:54:24,900
And just like that,

1563
01:54:25,900 --> 01:54:27,233
he grew more and more disgusted with me.

1564
01:54:28,066 --> 01:54:29,500
Whenever I didn't obey him,

1565
01:54:30,900 --> 01:54:32,566
he would beat and kick me.

1566
01:54:33,500 --> 01:54:34,600
But strangely enough,

1567
01:54:35,333 --> 01:54:36,666
after we had a big fight that day,

1568
01:54:37,100 --> 01:54:37,966
that brush

1569
01:54:38,133 --> 01:54:40,233
actually began painting on its own.

1570
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:42,733
Alright, alright, enough.

1571
01:54:49,700 --> 01:54:50,833
The brush painted!

1572
01:54:52,700 --> 01:54:53,900
Paint a few more strokes!

1573
01:54:53,966 --> 01:54:54,766
Just a few more!

1574
01:54:56,466 --> 01:54:57,766
Come on, paint a few more!

1575
01:55:05,066 --> 01:55:06,266
It's all your fault!

1576
01:55:07,300 --> 01:55:08,233
Who asked you to interfere?

1577
01:55:09,900 --> 01:55:10,600
It painted again!

1578
01:55:10,966 --> 01:55:11,766
My dear, look!

1579
01:55:11,933 --> 01:55:13,533
Whenever I beat or scold you, it paints!

1580
01:55:13,866 --> 01:55:15,266
You wretched woman!

1581
01:55:15,266 --> 01:55:16,400
Don't you love money?

1582
01:55:16,566 --> 01:55:18,033
Then suffer a bit more for the money!

1583
01:55:18,733 --> 01:55:19,733
Why shouldn't I buy a brush?

1584
01:55:19,733 --> 01:55:20,866
I'm trying to find ways to earn money.

1585
01:55:21,133 --> 01:55:22,200
What's wrong with that?

1586
01:55:24,133 --> 01:55:24,666
Hurry, hurry!

1587
01:55:26,466 --> 01:55:27,733
I could no longer endure the humiliation,

1588
01:55:28,766 --> 01:55:29,900
so I fled.

1589
01:55:31,300 --> 01:55:32,300
I see… so that's how it was.

1590
01:55:33,866 --> 01:55:34,800
Then now,

1591
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:36,633
who is the lady living now in Xu Qianliu's household?

1592
01:55:56,733 --> 01:55:58,000
So it was all a painting.

1593
01:56:01,066 --> 01:56:02,466
Then who is this one?

1594
01:56:14,766 --> 01:56:15,800
I finally found you.

1595
01:56:28,266 --> 01:56:29,200
So it really was you.

1596
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:31,800
Who would've thought everything here

1597
01:56:32,700 --> 01:56:33,800
was drawn by you?

1598
01:56:36,366 --> 01:56:37,633
You're not wrong.

1599
01:56:38,300 --> 01:56:39,633
Everything here

1600
01:56:40,166 --> 01:56:41,666
was given to me by it.

1601
01:56:42,333 --> 01:56:44,066
With nothing but this brush in my hand,

1602
01:56:44,466 --> 01:56:46,200
I obtained everything in this place.

1603
01:56:47,200 --> 01:56:48,333
So Zhi Hua deliberately

1604
01:56:48,366 --> 01:56:49,633
sowed discord between Ling'er and me

1605
01:56:50,500 --> 01:56:51,333
because this brush

1606
01:56:51,666 --> 01:56:52,900
feeds on resentment

1607
01:56:53,166 --> 01:56:54,066
to gain its power.

1608
01:56:55,066 --> 01:56:56,133
Everything that happened

1609
01:56:56,366 --> 01:56:58,000
at the academy was also arranged by you

1610
01:56:58,000 --> 01:56:59,033
to harvest resentment.

1611
01:57:01,700 --> 01:57:03,033
And that fake puppet lady.

1612
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:05,466
She was just another pawn you used.

1613
01:57:08,133 --> 01:57:10,166
Resentment didn't begin because of me.

1614
01:57:10,466 --> 01:57:11,466
What does it have to do with me?

1615
01:57:11,933 --> 01:57:13,866
You've really washed your hands clean of it.

1616
01:57:14,866 --> 01:57:17,100
You're no good person yourself.

1617
01:57:17,600 --> 01:57:19,200
The little fairy doesn't know

1618
01:57:19,200 --> 01:57:21,133
that you deliberately argued with her, angering her.

1619
01:57:21,666 --> 01:57:22,766
Isn't that the same?

1620
01:57:23,133 --> 01:57:24,466
You were using her too.

1621
01:57:32,166 --> 01:57:33,300
This brush

1622
01:57:33,766 --> 01:57:35,400
recognizes only me as its master.

1623
01:57:45,733 --> 01:57:46,766
That painting is of her.

1624
01:57:47,733 --> 01:57:49,266
Liu, go! Hurry!

1625
01:57:51,933 --> 01:57:53,966
Liu, go! Don't worry about me!

1626
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:58,266
He never treated you as a human being,

1627
01:57:58,300 --> 01:57:59,200
yet you risked your life to save him.

1628
01:58:00,700 --> 01:58:01,400
Liu...

1629
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:03,100
I know.

1630
01:58:03,966 --> 01:58:06,300
You have always wanted to create the perfect work.

1631
01:58:07,300 --> 01:58:08,366
I know that

1632
01:58:09,133 --> 01:58:12,033
I'm not the perfect painting in your mind, as well.

1633
01:58:12,466 --> 01:58:13,000
You…

1634
01:58:13,366 --> 01:58:14,366
You actually understand me.

1635
01:58:17,100 --> 01:58:18,166
You always said

1636
01:58:19,300 --> 01:58:21,533
that there is no true affection in this world.

1637
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:23,133
But toward you…

1638
01:58:23,800 --> 01:58:25,733
I have always been sincere.

1639
01:58:26,666 --> 01:58:27,966
Liu, I…

1640
01:58:37,133 --> 01:58:37,566
No…

1641
01:58:37,800 --> 01:58:38,600
This isn't real.

1642
01:58:39,200 --> 01:58:39,633
Dan Qing!

1643
01:58:40,400 --> 01:58:41,233
Dan Qing!

1644
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:53,333
Xiaoyao didn't return all night.

1645
01:58:54,300 --> 01:58:55,733
Could he still be angry?

1646
01:58:56,300 --> 01:58:57,400
That guy is unreliable.

1647
01:58:57,500 --> 01:58:58,200
Forget him.

1648
01:58:59,366 --> 01:58:59,966
Right.

1649
01:59:00,266 --> 01:59:01,166
What do you plan to do?
