1
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,096
Happy New Year, Jay.

2
00:02:05,898 --> 00:02:07,900
I feel like I’m going crazy.

3
00:02:08,126 --> 00:02:09,753
Or am I already crazy?

4
00:02:14,532 --> 00:02:17,785
So much has happened ever since
I wore this uniform.

5
00:02:45,117 --> 00:02:47,370
Section E!!!

6
00:03:25,895 --> 00:03:27,730
Why did you even do that, Jay-jay?

7
00:03:27,897 --> 00:03:29,648
You almost got carried away!

8
00:03:30,733 --> 00:03:31,709
You really are crazy!

9
00:03:31,734 --> 00:03:32,835
You’re weak!

10
00:03:52,713 --> 00:03:55,007
Later I’m going to
see the King of Assholes,

11
00:03:55,424 --> 00:03:57,009
and after that…

12
00:04:11,482 --> 00:04:13,192
I already accepted Yuri’s proposal,

13
00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:15,986
so I shouldn’t have done that to Keifer.

14
00:04:16,403 --> 00:04:17,905
Control yourself, Jay.

15
00:04:18,072 --> 00:04:19,323
Jay?

16
00:04:20,241 --> 00:04:21,242
Yes?

17
00:04:23,548 --> 00:04:24,549
Wow!

18
00:04:24,995 --> 00:04:27,039
Jay, the room looks so nice.

19
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:29,335
Is this part of your New Year's resolution?

20
00:04:30,211 --> 00:04:33,840
Yes, Auntie.
A new look for a new life.

21
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,734
By the way,
Yuri asked for permission.

22
00:04:38,923 --> 00:04:41,801
He said he'll pick you up,
he's probably downstairs already.

23
00:04:41,971 --> 00:04:44,490
Ah okay, I'll go down in a while.

24
00:04:44,515 --> 00:04:45,515
Alright.

25
00:04:52,273 --> 00:04:53,816
Yuri…

26
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:55,359
Right.

27
00:04:55,609 --> 00:04:58,821
I’m already engaged, so I shouldn’t be
thinking about Keifer anymore.

28
00:05:08,693 --> 00:05:09,968
You can do this, Jay-jay.

29
00:05:14,253 --> 00:05:16,547
Let’s just forget
what happened on New Year’s.

30
00:07:06,657 --> 00:07:07,658
Good morning.

31
00:07:09,451 --> 00:07:11,287
Give that to me, I’ll carry it.

32
00:07:12,204 --> 00:07:14,498
No, it’s fine.
It's not heavy.

33
00:07:17,501 --> 00:07:20,838
Why did you pick me up?
I can bike on my own.

34
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,255
Of course—fiancé duties.

35
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:26,468
Fiancé…

36
00:07:27,052 --> 00:07:29,346
Shit, it sounds so heavy.

37
00:07:29,427 --> 00:07:30,511
I’m not used to it.

38
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,101
Let’s go.

39
00:07:34,727 --> 00:07:35,737
No.

40
00:07:36,603 --> 00:07:38,063
She’s not going with you.

41
00:07:38,314 --> 00:07:39,189
Leave.

42
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:40,899
You're not the one
who's going to decide here.

43
00:07:41,525 --> 00:07:45,487
Aries, it’s okay.
I also want to talk to Yuri.

44
00:07:45,863 --> 00:07:48,866
If you had just listened to me,

45
00:07:49,127 --> 00:07:51,629
you wouldn’t have been
set up in that engagement.

46
00:07:51,744 --> 00:07:52,720
Right?

47
00:07:52,745 --> 00:07:54,121
Engagement...

48
00:07:54,496 --> 00:07:55,539
Set-up...

49
00:07:55,539 --> 00:07:56,540
Let's go.

50
00:08:28,663 --> 00:08:29,745
Are you okay?

51
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,272
You’ve been quiet.

52
00:08:32,842 --> 00:08:34,682
Of course, I’m fine.

53
00:08:35,204 --> 00:08:36,997
Have you talked to Angelo yet?

54
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:41,927
I'm not ready to talk to him yet.

55
00:08:47,091 --> 00:08:48,092
I'm sorry, Jay.

56
00:08:48,634 --> 00:08:50,979
I wasn’t honest about
my feelings for you.

57
00:08:51,917 --> 00:08:55,003
But from now on,
I’ll be more honest.

58
00:08:57,059 --> 00:08:58,477
We’re engaged.

59
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,462
So I should also be honest with him
about what happened on New Year’s.

60
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:04,550
Uhmm, I need to confess something—

61
00:09:04,575 --> 00:09:06,535
Is it about Keifer?

62
00:09:08,704 --> 00:09:09,705
It's okay, Jay.

63
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,417
I don’t want to hear it anymore.

64
00:09:15,795 --> 00:09:16,796
I'm sorry.

65
00:09:17,046 --> 00:09:18,547
You don’t need to apologize.

66
00:09:19,131 --> 00:09:20,591
I understand you,

67
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,854
but I’ll wait for you Jay
no matter how long.

68
00:09:25,056 --> 00:09:26,766
Even until the day of our wedding.

69
00:09:27,265 --> 00:09:28,724
If that's what it takes.

70
00:09:28,749 --> 00:09:29,750
Yuri.

71
00:09:35,398 --> 00:09:36,524
I'm okay, Jay.

72
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:38,776
Don't worry.

73
00:09:40,751 --> 00:09:44,156
My only wish is that
you give me a chance.

74
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,492
Please don't close off your heart.

75
00:09:47,368 --> 00:09:49,287
I hope you still choose me in the end.

76
00:09:57,211 --> 00:09:58,421
Honestly,

77
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:01,382
I don’t even know what I feel for Yuri.

78
00:10:01,842 --> 00:10:03,177
Is it guilt?

79
00:10:03,426 --> 00:10:05,011
Because he’s kind to me?

80
00:10:05,598 --> 00:10:08,226
Or is it because of
my obligation to my family?

81
00:10:08,806 --> 00:10:10,892
Ugh, whatever.
Whatever happens, happens.

82
00:10:12,893 --> 00:10:13,894
Uhm...

83
00:10:15,313 --> 00:10:18,357
How are we going to
tell our classmates?

84
00:10:18,858 --> 00:10:20,818
I don’t think they need to know.

85
00:10:21,485 --> 00:10:22,564
Why?

86
00:10:22,611 --> 00:10:24,238
It’ll just cause chaos if they find out—

87
00:10:24,238 --> 00:10:26,907
especially since they know
Keifer has feelings for you.

88
00:10:28,284 --> 00:10:31,996
Yeah, you’re right.
It might cause trouble.

89
00:10:46,927 --> 00:10:48,262
Great idea.

90
00:10:51,182 --> 00:10:52,308
There.

91
00:10:53,184 --> 00:10:54,602
That’s good.

92
00:10:57,621 --> 00:10:58,706
Ouch!

93
00:10:58,731 --> 00:10:59,940
What was that for?

94
00:11:01,734 --> 00:11:03,798
I don’t want things
to be awkward between us, Jay.

95
00:11:03,986 --> 00:11:06,530
Act like the same Jay you are
whenever we’re together,

96
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,740
and I'll do the same.

97
00:11:09,241 --> 00:11:10,329
You’re right.

98
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:12,203
Ouch! That really hurts!

99
00:11:12,995 --> 00:11:15,079
That’s not enough—
want one on your forehead too?

100
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:17,291
Come on, let’s go.
We might be late.

101
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,350
Wait, wait, wait.

102
00:11:18,376 --> 00:11:19,126
- What?
- I forgot something.

103
00:11:19,126 --> 00:11:20,087
What?

104
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:28,094
I'll go ahead.

105
00:11:30,554 --> 00:11:32,056
Can I ask for one more favor?

106
00:11:33,182 --> 00:11:34,212
What?

107
00:11:34,517 --> 00:11:36,352
Can you stop picking me up
and taking me home?

108
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:40,356
Someone might,
you know, notice.

109
00:11:41,565 --> 00:11:42,566
Okay.

110
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,901
Alright.

111
00:12:14,348 --> 00:12:16,725
Okay, Jay-jay.
We'll do what is right.

112
00:12:16,825 --> 00:12:19,495
You're already engaged to Yuri,
time to forget about Keif—

113
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,525
Fuck!

114
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,901
Tss. Profanity on
the first day back?

115
00:12:26,694 --> 00:12:28,446
Or did you just miss my lips?

116
00:12:29,738 --> 00:12:31,031
What? Keifer!

117
00:12:31,949 --> 00:12:33,784
- Stop this.
- Why?

118
00:12:33,951 --> 00:12:36,537
- What do you mean "why"? Keifer, please.
- Stop what?

119
00:12:37,288 --> 00:12:41,459
This! What you're doing right now.
Stop flirting with me.

120
00:12:42,334 --> 00:12:45,504
What's wrong if I flirt with you?

121
00:12:47,047 --> 00:12:49,341
What's wrong if I flirt
with the one I love?

122
00:12:52,803 --> 00:12:54,388
It's wrong.

123
00:12:55,389 --> 00:12:57,141
It's as if I'm cheating on Yuri.

124
00:12:58,017 --> 00:12:59,337
We're already engaged,

125
00:12:59,393 --> 00:13:00,478
stay away from me.

126
00:13:02,229 --> 00:13:03,439
Cheating?

127
00:13:04,288 --> 00:13:06,206
We're not in a relationship.

128
00:13:06,734 --> 00:13:08,527
So how are we cheating on him?

129
00:13:09,153 --> 00:13:11,113
You're not cheating on Yuri

130
00:13:11,822 --> 00:13:13,949
because we're not in a relationship.

131
00:13:20,623 --> 00:13:23,375
If that's the case,
then leave me alone!

132
00:13:25,211 --> 00:13:28,839
We're not in a relationship, but…

133
00:13:31,175 --> 00:13:32,510
you are mine.

134
00:13:33,093 --> 00:13:35,054
You know what, you're crazy.

135
00:13:35,971 --> 00:13:37,264
Crazy for you?

136
00:13:37,264 --> 00:13:38,933
Yeah, I think so.

137
00:14:09,588 --> 00:14:11,882
I’ll wait for you Jay no matter how long.

138
00:14:11,882 --> 00:14:13,509
Even until the day of our wedding.

139
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,515
Fuck!

140
00:14:25,521 --> 00:14:26,897
You'll pay for this!

141
00:14:36,365 --> 00:14:39,076
Welcome back, bro!

142
00:14:39,994 --> 00:14:41,453
Come on, hurry, let’s play.

143
00:14:44,665 --> 00:14:45,374
Jay!

144
00:14:45,374 --> 00:14:46,458
How was vacation?

145
00:14:47,126 --> 00:14:48,752
It was okay.
How about you and Mica?

146
00:14:49,378 --> 00:14:50,754
Obviously they ran out of condoms again—

147
00:14:50,754 --> 00:14:52,423
he even asked me for some.
Said it wasn’t enough.

148
00:14:52,423 --> 00:14:53,799
- He asked you?
- Idiot!

149
00:14:54,883 --> 00:14:55,426
Asshole!

150
00:14:55,426 --> 00:14:56,510
Unbelievable!

151
00:14:57,386 --> 00:14:59,138
- Ouch!
- Hey, Jay!

152
00:14:59,305 --> 00:15:01,223
Everyone already went on vacation
but you're still sour.

153
00:15:01,223 --> 00:15:02,224
Didn't you—

154
00:15:02,433 --> 00:15:04,643
Stop it!
It’s New Year, have you changed?

155
00:15:04,643 --> 00:15:05,853
- Of course, man!
- Yeah right!

156
00:15:06,312 --> 00:15:07,730
He gambled all his Christmas money.

157
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,732
- Obviously.
- You're really something, huh.

158
00:15:10,328 --> 00:15:11,819
You don't have money!

159
00:15:12,401 --> 00:15:14,695
Hey, hey! What’s going on?

160
00:15:15,195 --> 00:15:16,488
How’s Grace?

161
00:15:17,156 --> 00:15:18,449
She has lots of cravings.

162
00:15:18,574 --> 00:15:19,700
- She's always hungry.
- That’s normal.

163
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,634
Just like you.

164
00:15:20,659 --> 00:15:21,510
Oh really?

165
00:15:21,535 --> 00:15:22,453
Ouch.

166
00:15:22,453 --> 00:15:25,205
- Too early in the morning.
- You’re already annoying this early!

167
00:15:27,082 --> 00:15:28,085
Jay!

168
00:15:30,044 --> 00:15:32,630
Collect everyone’s contribution
for the food.

169
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:42,348
Ignored? What’s his problem?

170
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,714
Hey, where’s Ci-N?

171
00:15:50,814 --> 00:15:53,275
He’s not here.
He’s not answering my calls.

172
00:15:53,692 --> 00:15:56,320
Huh? What happened to him?

173
00:15:56,612 --> 00:15:58,656
Should I go to their house later?

174
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:01,825
But what if his grumpy
brother is there?

175
00:16:06,705 --> 00:16:07,831
Hi, Jay!

176
00:16:19,051 --> 00:16:20,427
Damn!

177
00:16:20,761 --> 00:16:22,304
What happened to your lip, bro?

178
00:16:22,304 --> 00:16:23,423
Did you get into a fight?

179
00:16:23,722 --> 00:16:25,474
Looks like your lips
saw some action, Keif.

180
00:16:25,474 --> 00:16:26,680
You want some lip balm?

181
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,890
You deserve it.

182
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:32,731
Tss.

183
00:16:33,065 --> 00:16:34,066
Hey, what's up.

184
00:16:35,984 --> 00:16:37,611
- Rory!
- Hey!

185
00:16:42,741 --> 00:16:45,452
If you look at us,
it seems like nothing has changed.

186
00:16:45,452 --> 00:16:46,495
Hey, that didn’t hit!

187
00:16:46,495 --> 00:16:48,205
Throw it!

188
00:16:58,006 --> 00:17:00,342
Asshole! Hey asshole!

189
00:17:02,761 --> 00:17:03,798
Fuck!

190
00:17:05,097 --> 00:17:06,180
Chill with that.

191
00:17:12,062 --> 00:17:15,065
But the truth is,
a lot has already changed.

192
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,153
- Hey, bro.
- Ah!

193
00:17:20,112 --> 00:17:21,572
Settle down, settle down.

194
00:17:25,483 --> 00:17:26,860
Welcome back, class!

195
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:35,794
We’ve already started
planning your retreat.

196
00:17:36,128 --> 00:17:37,588
We’re included in that, Sir?

197
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:42,468
All students join the retreat
before graduating.

198
00:17:42,468 --> 00:17:44,970
For real?
So we’re actually graduating?

199
00:17:47,598 --> 00:17:49,683
All I can say is,

200
00:17:49,683 --> 00:17:51,704
there will be lots of activities
during the retreat.

201
00:17:52,728 --> 00:17:53,812
When is it, Sir?

202
00:17:53,812 --> 00:17:57,691
No definite date yet,
but earlier than the usual retreat.

203
00:17:57,691 --> 00:18:00,778
It’s just a bit tricky because
of the post-final exams.

204
00:18:03,614 --> 00:18:05,407
What’s the post-final exams?

205
00:18:05,908 --> 00:18:07,701
There’s a fifth exam.

206
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,496
And that determines whether
a student passes or not.

207
00:18:10,496 --> 00:18:11,298
Huh?

208
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,658
Why is there even a fifth exam?

209
00:18:13,081 --> 00:18:16,251
So if a student doesn’t pass,
they won’t graduate?

210
00:18:18,212 --> 00:18:20,547
Don’t worry Jay, I got you.

211
00:18:20,756 --> 00:18:21,805
You will graduate.

212
00:18:31,934 --> 00:18:33,894
Food, food, food!

213
00:18:34,478 --> 00:18:36,438
That's all?

214
00:18:36,605 --> 00:18:38,148
That’s all we have left.

215
00:18:38,398 --> 00:18:40,000
You guys still haven’t
pitched in for the groceries.

216
00:18:40,025 --> 00:18:41,585
- True!
- You’re really something, huh!

217
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:42,753
Alright, alright.

218
00:18:42,778 --> 00:18:45,727
Wow, you're quick to dodge
when it's time to chip in!

219
00:18:46,365 --> 00:18:47,241
Do you hear anything?

220
00:18:47,241 --> 00:18:48,408
One at a time!

221
00:18:51,428 --> 00:18:52,288
Fine, here.

222
00:18:52,313 --> 00:18:53,649
- Let's split it.
- Ah!

223
00:18:54,915 --> 00:18:55,916
Plate.

224
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,571
Dish.

225
00:18:59,837 --> 00:19:00,868
Rice.

226
00:19:01,964 --> 00:19:02,977
More.

227
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:07,911
Just eat it already.

228
00:19:13,934 --> 00:19:15,143
Move aside.

229
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:16,937
And if I don’t want to?

230
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,946
Do you want me to tell them what
we did last New Year’s Eve?

231
00:19:27,698 --> 00:19:28,991
What do you want?

232
00:19:30,117 --> 00:19:31,118
Nothing.

233
00:19:31,118 --> 00:19:32,411
You just look cute when you eat.

234
00:19:32,411 --> 00:19:33,704
Is it bad to watch?

235
00:19:34,413 --> 00:19:35,831
Yes! Go away!

236
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,001
Bro, let's share.

237
00:19:39,501 --> 00:19:40,669
All of that is yours?

238
00:19:43,589 --> 00:19:44,756
Is there a problem, Jay?

239
00:19:46,967 --> 00:19:49,803
Ah nothing, he’s just teasing me.

240
00:19:50,137 --> 00:19:51,166
You sure?

241
00:20:01,189 --> 00:20:03,817
Remember, you are mine.

242
00:20:09,448 --> 00:20:10,282
Jay!

243
00:20:10,282 --> 00:20:11,575
No one follow me!

244
00:20:11,575 --> 00:20:13,035
No one is following you.

245
00:20:28,258 --> 00:20:30,469
There, nice!

246
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,888
So refreshing!

247
00:20:33,764 --> 00:20:37,601
I'm sure nobody will bother me here.

248
00:20:39,144 --> 00:20:40,562
Let me call that brat.

249
00:20:52,282 --> 00:20:53,659
He won’t answer.

250
00:20:57,463 --> 00:20:58,646
Ugh!

251
00:20:59,348 --> 00:21:00,349
Fuck!

252
00:21:00,374 --> 00:21:01,416
Who’s that?

253
00:21:03,001 --> 00:21:05,212
Oh, Edrix!

254
00:21:05,837 --> 00:21:07,547
I thought it was someone else!

255
00:21:07,756 --> 00:21:09,049
What are you doing here?

256
00:21:16,056 --> 00:21:17,265
Sorry.

257
00:21:17,933 --> 00:21:19,393
I just couldn’t help it.

258
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,147
Do you have a problem?

259
00:21:27,317 --> 00:21:28,527
I’m mad at myself!

260
00:21:30,153 --> 00:21:31,238
I'm such a coward!

261
00:21:33,699 --> 00:21:34,716
Why?

262
00:21:36,702 --> 00:21:39,079
Unrequited love is just
so damn hard!

263
00:21:39,246 --> 00:21:40,622
I can’t even tell her…

264
00:21:41,623 --> 00:21:42,874
or show her.

265
00:21:46,169 --> 00:21:47,713
Yeah, that’s really hard.

266
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:50,924
But at least you’re sure.

267
00:21:51,508 --> 00:21:52,843
It’s only one person.

268
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:56,555
It's harder when you're stuck
between two.

269
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,019
But who is it anyway?

270
00:22:07,941 --> 00:22:10,610
Wow, she’s pretty!

271
00:22:11,236 --> 00:22:12,529
Freya really is pretty.

272
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,699
Yeah, she’s really—WHAT?

273
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:18,994
That's Freya?

274
00:22:22,456 --> 00:22:23,932
F-Freya is the one
you’re talking about?

275
00:22:23,957 --> 00:22:24,975
Yeah.

276
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,193
It's been a long time Jay.

277
00:22:27,794 --> 00:22:30,589
Wow, what a revelation.

278
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,716
But...

279
00:22:33,425 --> 00:22:35,010
let’s keep this between us, okay?

280
00:22:36,136 --> 00:22:37,201
Promise?

281
00:22:49,232 --> 00:22:50,484
You don’t have food?

282
00:22:52,069 --> 00:22:52,652
That’s food?

283
00:22:52,736 --> 00:22:55,297
Yeah, we were eating downstairs.

284
00:22:55,322 --> 00:22:56,873
And you’re here being dramatic.

285
00:23:08,126 --> 00:23:08,935
Whose is this?

286
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,546
- Auntie, I’m really starving promise.
- Looks like it.

287
00:23:11,713 --> 00:23:13,340
Don’t worry, there’s another box there.

288
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,674
All of that is for you.

289
00:23:14,966 --> 00:23:16,009
We have a visitor?

290
00:23:16,468 --> 00:23:19,179
Relax, there’s more in the kitchen.

291
00:23:20,013 --> 00:23:21,264
- This tastes so good, Auntie.
- Good?

292
00:23:21,515 --> 00:23:22,529
Ci-N?

293
00:23:25,894 --> 00:23:26,937
You idiot!

294
00:23:27,104 --> 00:23:28,357
What happened to you?

295
00:23:28,772 --> 00:23:31,233
Do you know how
worried I was, you brat?!

296
00:23:31,441 --> 00:23:32,275
Really?

297
00:23:32,275 --> 00:23:33,466
You were concerned about me?

298
00:23:33,652 --> 00:23:35,987
Wow, you’re so sweet, Jay.

299
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:37,656
Don’t be like that, Jay-jay!

300
00:23:37,656 --> 00:23:38,657
Sorry, Auntie.

301
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,492
This kid didn't attend school today.

302
00:23:42,244 --> 00:23:44,704
I’ll leave you two to catch up.

303
00:23:44,871 --> 00:23:46,248
I’ll prepare dinner.

304
00:23:46,289 --> 00:23:47,499
Thank you, Auntie.

305
00:23:51,128 --> 00:23:52,462
You've got some nerve!

306
00:23:52,504 --> 00:23:53,672
Enjoying the food too much, huh?

307
00:23:53,672 --> 00:23:54,631
Why weren’t you in class?

308
00:23:54,673 --> 00:23:55,522
It hurts, Jay!

309
00:23:55,547 --> 00:23:56,966
- Oh really!
- I’ll tell Auntie!

310
00:23:57,342 --> 00:23:58,607
What happened to you?

311
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,182
What’s the problem?

312
00:24:06,393 --> 00:24:07,396
Because…

313
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,688
my brother locked me up.

314
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:11,740
He said...

315
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:15,110
he’s sending me to London
because I keep on causing trouble.

316
00:24:15,402 --> 00:24:17,487
Said I’m wasting my potential.

317
00:24:18,238 --> 00:24:19,823
Of course
I wasn’t going to allow that.

318
00:24:19,823 --> 00:24:22,367
So yeah,
he locked me in my room.

319
00:24:24,327 --> 00:24:25,829
I was worried about you.

320
00:24:27,289 --> 00:24:27,956
Sorry…

321
00:24:27,956 --> 00:24:29,833
He confiscated my gadgets,

322
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:30,959
I couldn’t message you.

323
00:24:31,418 --> 00:24:32,836
Is that all he did?

324
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:34,087
He didn't hit you?

325
00:24:34,087 --> 00:24:35,105
No!

326
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:36,006
You know why?

327
00:24:36,006 --> 00:24:36,464
Why?

328
00:24:36,464 --> 00:24:37,757
Because I ran away.

329
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,051
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

330
00:24:40,552 --> 00:24:43,430
He said if I won’t listen,
I should just leave.

331
00:24:44,139 --> 00:24:45,765
Where would you go?

332
00:24:45,932 --> 00:24:46,933
Here. With you!

333
00:24:47,142 --> 00:24:49,035
That’s not allowed, are you crazy?!

334
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,854
Why not?
Angelo said it was okay.

335
00:24:50,854 --> 00:24:52,105
What Angelo?

336
00:24:52,189 --> 00:24:53,023
You made that up!

337
00:24:53,023 --> 00:24:54,983
Right Angelo, it’s okay?

338
00:24:55,275 --> 00:24:56,443
Yes, that’s true.

339
00:24:57,152 --> 00:24:58,945
Oh—see?

340
00:25:00,113 --> 00:25:01,698
That hurts!

341
00:25:09,915 --> 00:25:11,166
My new home.

342
00:25:14,336 --> 00:25:15,629
Won’t they look for you?

343
00:25:15,837 --> 00:25:17,297
No, Mom knows.

344
00:25:17,297 --> 00:25:18,373
I told her.

345
00:25:18,506 --> 00:25:19,507
Wow.

346
00:25:19,966 --> 00:25:21,760
Of all the people who left home, you're
the only one who asked for permission.

347
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,444
Amazing.

348
00:25:22,469 --> 00:25:24,137
Of course—
so Mom knows where I’m going.

349
00:25:26,806 --> 00:25:28,279
Where are you even going to sleep?

350
00:25:28,642 --> 00:25:29,851
Angelo said in your room.

351
00:25:30,185 --> 00:25:31,353
My room?

352
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,897
- Do you want some?
- Yeah.

353
00:25:34,522 --> 00:25:36,233
Race you to your room!

354
00:25:36,233 --> 00:25:38,985
Idiot! No eating there!

355
00:25:38,985 --> 00:25:39,986
Hey!

356
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,076
Ci-N!

357
00:25:43,198 --> 00:25:45,951
[Ci-N singing]

358
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:55,210
Ci-N!

359
00:26:10,141 --> 00:26:12,394
Good morning.

360
00:26:14,521 --> 00:26:17,440
Get up!
Your pillow is soaked with your drool.

361
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,078
Ci-N, you're so noisy!

362
00:26:30,078 --> 00:26:31,329
So early in the morning!

363
00:26:40,005 --> 00:26:40,714
I'll go ahead, Jay.

364
00:26:40,714 --> 00:26:41,798
Going downstairs to eat.

365
00:26:47,095 --> 00:26:49,848
Wow, feel at home.

366
00:27:00,358 --> 00:27:01,373
Ouch.

367
00:27:21,546 --> 00:27:23,173
Did Aries do something to you?

368
00:27:26,926 --> 00:27:29,054
What? What did he do?

369
00:27:33,975 --> 00:27:35,091
Let’s go.

370
00:27:35,143 --> 00:27:36,162
Huh?

371
00:27:49,282 --> 00:27:52,452
Ci, wait—talk to me.

372
00:27:52,994 --> 00:27:55,038
What did Aries do to you?

373
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:57,107
Is it true, Jay?

374
00:27:57,415 --> 00:27:58,630
You’re leaving Section E?

375
00:28:00,377 --> 00:28:01,920
Did Aries tell you that?

376
00:28:02,879 --> 00:28:06,508
He said I should stay away
from you because you’re leaving.

377
00:28:07,884 --> 00:28:09,694
No, don’t stay away from me.

378
00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:11,679
- Crazy.
- Don’t listen to him.

379
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,264
Who said that?

380
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:15,299
Who said you'll leave Section E?

381
00:28:18,103 --> 00:28:18,912
Who's fighting?

382
00:28:18,937 --> 00:28:20,313
Is there a cockfight?

383
00:28:20,397 --> 00:28:22,565
Jay, you’re leaving Section E?

384
00:28:23,191 --> 00:28:24,667
No!

385
00:28:24,692 --> 00:28:26,361
But that’s what he said!

386
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:28,655
Why would he say that?

387
00:28:28,947 --> 00:28:30,615
You don’t want to be with
us anymore, Jay?

388
00:28:30,657 --> 00:28:32,909
We can still tolerate your sour attitude.

389
00:28:32,992 --> 00:28:35,161
I thought we were solid Section E.

390
00:28:35,328 --> 00:28:37,580
- Ouch!
- Yeah.

391
00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:41,584
We thought nothing could break us.

392
00:28:41,793 --> 00:28:43,294
- Exactly.
- So dramatic!

393
00:28:43,294 --> 00:28:44,479
It’s not like that!

394
00:28:44,504 --> 00:28:45,513
Was it Aries?!

395
00:28:46,256 --> 00:28:47,841
Keifer, stop!

396
00:28:47,841 --> 00:28:50,552
Jay, don’t leave!
Stay in Section E!

397
00:28:50,552 --> 00:28:52,345
- Don’t leave!
- Ci, enough!

398
00:28:52,345 --> 00:28:53,863
- I don’t care!
- Jay, please don’t!!

399
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,198
What is happening here?!

400
00:28:55,223 --> 00:28:56,975
Jay-jay is leaving Section E!

401
00:28:57,142 --> 00:28:58,268
- Stop!
- Jay, please!

402
00:28:58,268 --> 00:28:59,285
Is that true?

403
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,061
I’m not!

404
00:29:00,061 --> 00:29:01,896
Look—I’ll explain later!

405
00:29:01,896 --> 00:29:04,691
Go to Keifer first,
he might go after Aries! Hurry!

406
00:29:05,024 --> 00:29:06,860
- Ci, no one's leaving!
- Jay please please!

407
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,027
I’m not leaving!

408
00:29:09,571 --> 00:29:10,780
- So dramatic!
- Really?

409
00:29:11,021 --> 00:29:12,940
Yes! That's what I've been saying!

410
00:29:13,158 --> 00:29:14,367
Aries told me to choose:

411
00:29:14,367 --> 00:29:15,618
Either I leave Section E,

412
00:29:15,618 --> 00:29:17,454
or he won't give me
my Dad's number.

413
00:29:17,454 --> 00:29:20,165
But I chose you guys, okay?!
Happy now?!

414
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,667
Let's go, we need to follow Keifer!

415
00:29:22,667 --> 00:29:23,710
Hurry!

416
00:29:23,751 --> 00:29:25,837
- Let’s go!
- I don’t want to! Why?

417
00:29:25,837 --> 00:29:27,505
Are you paying me for this?
I don't want to!

418
00:29:31,217 --> 00:29:32,263
Get up!

419
00:29:43,021 --> 00:29:44,037
Come here.

420
00:30:02,081 --> 00:30:03,541
Is that it, huh?!

421
00:30:10,465 --> 00:30:11,758
Let's go, quickly!

422
00:30:15,094 --> 00:30:16,846
What?
Let's finish this here now!

423
00:30:16,846 --> 00:30:17,764
Okay, let's end it here.

424
00:30:17,764 --> 00:30:18,640
Can someone stop them?!

425
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,267
Enough!
Stop it already!

426
00:30:21,518 --> 00:30:24,854
I guess the rumors are true,
it's really a mess here.

427
00:30:25,396 --> 00:30:27,690
Can those losers get out of here already?

428
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:28,358
Especially you!

429
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,027
Enough!
Don't you dare speak to Jay-jay like that!

430
00:30:31,236 --> 00:30:32,904
Jay-jay, you need to leave.

431
00:30:33,196 --> 00:30:35,169
Things are getting out of
control because of you.

432
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,130
As if.

433
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:42,413
Stop it already, let's go.

434
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,290
Not until you swear!

435
00:30:44,457 --> 00:30:46,834
Swear in front of Aries,
you'll never leave us!

436
00:30:48,795 --> 00:30:50,004
Now!

437
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:55,553
Sorry.

438
00:31:03,768 --> 00:31:05,103
I'm sorry, Aries.

439
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,816
I've said this before,
and I'll say it again.

440
00:31:11,317 --> 00:31:12,986
I'm not leaving Section E.

441
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,866
Yes!

442
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,474
Won’t karma get you for that?

443
00:31:20,743 --> 00:31:22,161
That's your decision.

444
00:31:22,161 --> 00:31:24,163
I hope you won't regret it.

445
00:31:25,248 --> 00:31:27,542
You just lost your chance to
be with your father.

446
00:31:29,752 --> 00:31:30,962
So stupid!

447
00:31:33,089 --> 00:31:35,216
That's what you used to blackmail Jay-jay?

448
00:31:37,927 --> 00:31:39,429
Are you forgetting who I am?

449
00:31:39,721 --> 00:31:41,222
I always get what I want.

450
00:31:42,473 --> 00:31:43,521
Tss.

451
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:47,145
Don't worry, Jay.

452
00:31:47,145 --> 00:31:49,522
I promise I'm gonna
connect you to your father.

453
00:32:19,302 --> 00:32:21,220
How did you know I was here?

454
00:32:21,811 --> 00:32:25,273
Uhh, Edrix said you're hanging out
here to get some air.

455
00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:30,813
It hasn't even been a week of classes,
yet you got into a fight already.

456
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,278
My hands hurt.

457
00:32:38,237 --> 00:32:39,405
Do it for me.

458
00:32:48,956 --> 00:32:49,932
Ouch!

459
00:32:49,957 --> 00:32:51,167
Be gentle!

460
00:32:51,918 --> 00:32:54,545
Who told you to get into a fight then?

461
00:32:55,004 --> 00:32:56,339
Always losing your temper.

462
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:03,705
I'm sorry.

463
00:33:06,307 --> 00:33:09,686
Wow!
You're getting good at apologizing, huh.

464
00:33:09,977 --> 00:33:10,895
"I'm sorry".
Say it one more time.

465
00:33:10,895 --> 00:33:12,480
One more, come on.
One more time.

466
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,773
Stop making fun of me.

467
00:33:13,898 --> 00:33:15,233
I only apologize to you.

468
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,318
Why just me?

469
00:33:17,318 --> 00:33:20,154
I'm sure you've got a long list of people
you need to apologize to.

470
00:33:20,154 --> 00:33:22,073
Who's first?
Aries, and then—

471
00:33:22,073 --> 00:33:23,199
I don't care.

472
00:33:23,533 --> 00:33:25,451
I don't have feelings for any of them.

473
00:33:26,327 --> 00:33:27,412
Only for you.

474
00:33:40,967 --> 00:33:42,049
Whatever!

475
00:33:45,596 --> 00:33:47,014
Please stay.

476
00:33:56,107 --> 00:33:57,859
Please stay.

477
00:33:58,234 --> 00:33:59,252
Keifer…

478
00:34:07,243 --> 00:34:08,911
I'm not giving up on you, Jay.

479
00:34:12,665 --> 00:34:14,250
I'll fight for you.

480
00:34:28,055 --> 00:34:29,515
What kind of dream was that?

481
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,562
That didn't happen,
but it felt so real.

482
00:34:36,063 --> 00:34:38,608
Enough, Jay-jay!

483
00:34:44,605 --> 00:34:47,149
Good morning, Jay! See you.

484
00:34:57,543 --> 00:34:58,572
Ci-N?

485
00:35:14,852 --> 00:35:16,037
I went ahead, Jay!

486
00:35:16,062 --> 00:35:18,439
You’re impossible to wake,
you just kept on groaning.

487
00:35:19,482 --> 00:35:20,525
Shit!

488
00:35:23,694 --> 00:35:25,655
That brat's really gonna get
it from me later.

489
00:35:27,532 --> 00:35:29,242
He actually left me?

490
00:35:29,242 --> 00:35:31,260
And even brought my bike with him!

491
00:35:34,494 --> 00:35:36,541
- What?
- Looks like you're late too.

492
00:35:36,916 --> 00:35:39,335
I woke up late,
how about you?

493
00:35:39,502 --> 00:35:40,962
I woke up late, too.

494
00:35:41,712 --> 00:35:42,922
Okay, let's go.

495
00:35:46,384 --> 00:35:47,401
What’s with you?

496
00:35:47,426 --> 00:35:48,427
Don’t look back.

497
00:35:48,594 --> 00:35:50,221
- Why?
- Someone's following us.

498
00:35:51,389 --> 00:35:53,683
Wait, don't look.

499
00:35:54,482 --> 00:35:55,511
What?

500
00:35:58,437 --> 00:35:59,522
Call Keifer.

501
00:35:59,856 --> 00:36:00,863
Huh?

502
00:36:02,108 --> 00:36:03,136
Quickly.

503
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:04,371
Wait, wait.

504
00:36:12,827 --> 00:36:14,203
There's the girl.

505
00:36:14,203 --> 00:36:15,413
Jay, run!

506
00:36:16,455 --> 00:36:17,348
Hey!

507
00:36:17,373 --> 00:36:19,750
Jay-jay, I told you to leave,
why are you still here?

508
00:36:20,668 --> 00:36:21,752
Jay, leave!

509
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:24,922
The girl!

510
00:36:28,009 --> 00:36:29,594
I won't leave you alone here!

511
00:36:34,682 --> 00:36:36,267
Go!

512
00:36:39,353 --> 00:36:40,313
Are you okay?

513
00:36:40,313 --> 00:36:42,189
I'm good, are you okay?

514
00:36:43,566 --> 00:36:44,901
What was that?!

515
00:36:48,905 --> 00:36:50,865
You thought you won already?

516
00:36:50,865 --> 00:36:52,332
That's just a hint of what's about to come.

517
00:36:52,533 --> 00:36:53,659
What do you need from us?

518
00:36:54,368 --> 00:36:55,536
Her.

519
00:36:56,162 --> 00:36:58,055
We know she's Keifer's girlfriend.

520
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,541
Huh?! He's not my boyfriend!

521
00:37:00,541 --> 00:37:02,627
He said it so himself that
we're not in a relationship!

522
00:37:03,169 --> 00:37:05,004
Do you think we'll believe you?

523
00:37:06,088 --> 00:37:08,424
Jay, we need to escape them.

524
00:37:08,799 --> 00:37:09,483
How?

525
00:37:09,508 --> 00:37:12,845
Just surrender Keifer's girlfriend
to us so it's over with.

526
00:37:13,054 --> 00:37:14,055
This guy's annoying.

527
00:37:14,055 --> 00:37:16,515
Insist it all you want,
I'm not his girlfriend!

528
00:37:17,725 --> 00:37:20,353
And it'll be a bigger mess
if I give her to you.

529
00:37:23,189 --> 00:37:24,253
Jay!

530
00:37:36,619 --> 00:37:38,204
We’ll go ahead.

531
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,472
Where are you?

532
00:37:53,177 --> 00:37:55,554
Why do I feel like something is wrong?

533
00:38:11,484 --> 00:38:13,355
Were you able to contact her?

534
00:38:22,621 --> 00:38:24,709
You don't have to hide it from me.

535
00:38:25,001 --> 00:38:26,127
I already know.

536
00:38:26,585 --> 00:38:28,587
I'm saying this so it's clear…

537
00:38:29,088 --> 00:38:30,339
I'm not backing down.

538
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:33,009
Even if we're engaged already?

539
00:38:33,384 --> 00:38:34,677
I don't care.

540
00:38:34,969 --> 00:38:36,554
Let Jay-jay decide.

541
00:38:36,929 --> 00:38:38,816
I'll only stop when she tells me to.

542
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,652
Why is Jay-jay still not here?

543
00:38:52,778 --> 00:38:54,280
Do you know where she is?

544
00:38:54,822 --> 00:38:55,715
No.

545
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,199
Keifer!

546
00:38:57,658 --> 00:38:59,869
The tracker shows Jay-jay
is in the hospital.

547
00:39:01,078 --> 00:39:02,079
What?!

548
00:39:07,293 --> 00:39:08,627
Drix, go!

549
00:39:10,546 --> 00:39:11,756
What?!

550
00:39:12,173 --> 00:39:14,592
Boys, over here!

551
00:39:22,266 --> 00:39:23,517
Where are you Jay?

552
00:39:23,684 --> 00:39:24,935
I'm going crazy.

553
00:39:26,979 --> 00:39:29,023
Miss, is there a Jasper
Jean Mariano here?

554
00:39:29,023 --> 00:39:30,566
Wait Sir, I'll check.

555
00:39:31,817 --> 00:39:33,110
Faster, Miss!

556
00:39:33,527 --> 00:39:34,503
I don't have time!

557
00:39:34,528 --> 00:39:36,072
Sir, there's no Jasper
Jean Mariano admitted here.

558
00:39:36,072 --> 00:39:37,698
- Huh?
- What time was she admitted?

559
00:39:37,698 --> 00:39:40,576
A while ago, check it again!
Faster!

560
00:39:40,743 --> 00:39:41,660
Sorry Sir, but there's—

561
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,704
Miss, check it again please.

562
00:39:44,872 --> 00:39:46,332
Guys, here!

563
00:39:47,958 --> 00:39:48,980
Jay!

564
00:39:50,902 --> 00:39:51,754
Jay, I’m coming.

565
00:39:51,754 --> 00:39:53,422
Good thing the wound isn't that deep.

566
00:39:53,422 --> 00:39:57,134
You shouldn't be lifting
heavy things for one week.

567
00:40:05,267 --> 00:40:06,727
Where's Jay-jay?

568
00:40:10,356 --> 00:40:11,824
She was right there a while ago.

569
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:14,810
She disappeared all of a sudden,
she was probably shocked by all the blood.

570
00:40:15,444 --> 00:40:16,570
What did you say?

571
00:40:16,904 --> 00:40:17,571
I don't know, bro.

572
00:40:17,571 --> 00:40:20,324
She just started shaking
when she saw me bleeding.

573
00:40:20,616 --> 00:40:22,660
She didn't talk...

574
00:40:23,244 --> 00:40:24,453
she just kept on crying.

575
00:40:24,495 --> 00:40:25,503
Fuck.

576
00:40:25,871 --> 00:40:28,415
Ever since Ram's gang weakened,

577
00:40:28,958 --> 00:40:30,709
everyone popped out of nowhere.

578
00:40:30,709 --> 00:40:32,920
And they all want to get Jay-jay

579
00:40:34,171 --> 00:40:35,923
because she's Keifer's girlfriend.

580
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,847
I don't even know.

581
00:40:39,093 --> 00:40:42,429
I'm just grateful that
David came to help us.

582
00:40:43,389 --> 00:40:45,975
If it wasn't for him,
we wouldn't even reach the hospital.

583
00:40:47,434 --> 00:40:49,228
Rory, your coffee.

584
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:57,111
Next time, call me.

585
00:40:57,111 --> 00:40:59,196
Don't try to be a fucking hero.

586
00:41:13,544 --> 00:41:14,558
Hello?

587
00:41:15,303 --> 00:41:16,472
How is she?

588
00:41:17,173 --> 00:41:19,383
She looked terrified
when I found them.

589
00:41:19,842 --> 00:41:22,261
With all that blood,
I thought it was her who got stabbed.

590
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,555
But she was just hugging Rory.

591
00:41:24,763 --> 00:41:26,348
Why did this happen?

592
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:30,060
What stupid shit did Keifer do this time
for Jay-jay to get involved again?

593
00:41:30,728 --> 00:41:33,981
They all want to use
Jay-jay to beat Keifer.

594
00:41:34,398 --> 00:41:35,433
Huh?

595
00:41:35,691 --> 00:41:37,902
Keifer never uses his head!

596
00:41:39,026 --> 00:41:42,082
So, what's your plan?

597
00:41:42,823 --> 00:41:44,158
None yet.

598
00:41:44,158 --> 00:41:48,204
But when I get back,
they better prepare themselves.

599
00:42:00,466 --> 00:42:02,092
Why?

600
00:42:02,218 --> 00:42:04,470
Why didn't I black out?

601
00:42:05,179 --> 00:42:09,099
Why didn't I attack them
like how I did to Cyrus and Ram?

602
00:42:11,685 --> 00:42:14,188
A lot has happened ever since
I wore this uniform.

603
00:42:14,188 --> 00:42:16,106
Stop it!

604
00:42:16,941 --> 00:42:20,152
Stop it!

605
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:30,829
But among all of them,
this one's the worst.

606
00:42:37,836 --> 00:42:39,672
Jay!

607
00:42:46,845 --> 00:42:48,347
Keifer…

608
00:42:49,431 --> 00:42:50,724
No, no.

609
00:42:51,225 --> 00:42:54,061
Don't cry.

610
00:42:54,061 --> 00:42:56,772
I'm here, don't cry.

611
00:42:57,815 --> 00:42:59,526
Please don't cry, I'm here.

612
00:43:07,408 --> 00:43:10,494
Don't cry, it's okay.

613
00:43:10,661 --> 00:43:11,662
I'm here.

614
00:43:11,954 --> 00:43:12,963
Don't cry.

615
00:43:13,539 --> 00:43:15,165
It's okay.

616
00:43:22,923 --> 00:43:24,550
Is this your blood?

617
00:43:24,925 --> 00:43:26,302
Are you hurt?

618
00:43:27,678 --> 00:43:28,768
No.

619
00:43:30,389 --> 00:43:33,267
I thought the same incident
with Ram would happen again.

620
00:43:34,018 --> 00:43:35,690
I was scared.

621
00:43:36,145 --> 00:43:38,063
It's okay, everything's okay.

622
00:43:38,147 --> 00:43:39,315
Everything’s okay.

623
00:43:39,732 --> 00:43:40,816
Stop crying.

624
00:43:42,276 --> 00:43:43,210
It's okay.

625
00:43:43,235 --> 00:43:45,654
I saw lots of blood

626
00:43:46,238 --> 00:43:50,034
but I didn't faint nor harm anyone.

627
00:43:50,385 --> 00:43:52,411
And we'll figure out why.

628
00:43:53,954 --> 00:43:57,750
But for now,
let's get you cleaned up.

629
00:43:58,307 --> 00:44:01,754
I know this is wrong because
Yuri's my fiancé already.

630
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:06,425
But why do I feel this way?

631
00:44:07,092 --> 00:44:09,011
When it comes to Keifer,

632
00:44:09,553 --> 00:44:11,764
my feelings are certain.

633
00:44:25,319 --> 00:44:27,988
Wait, what are you going to do?

634
00:44:28,739 --> 00:44:30,157
You need rest.

635
00:44:30,157 --> 00:44:31,825
Just shut up and let me.

636
00:45:28,715 --> 00:45:32,386
I'm not giving up on you, Jay.

637
00:45:35,764 --> 00:45:37,182
I'll fight for you.

638
00:45:41,478 --> 00:45:43,147
Is this still a dream?

639
00:45:43,856 --> 00:45:45,899
Shit, someone wake me up!

640
00:45:47,192 --> 00:45:48,861
Game on.

641
00:46:52,674 --> 00:46:54,843
Don’t just let them take what’s yours.

642
00:46:55,029 --> 00:46:57,031
Just because they dared
to make a bold move.

643
00:47:01,135 --> 00:47:02,009
Follow your heart.

644
00:47:02,034 --> 00:47:04,648
Don't listen to distractions
and don't give them an inch.

645
00:47:04,673 --> 00:47:06,007
Were you the one who taught them?

646
00:47:06,188 --> 00:47:08,857
Out of all the boys in Section E,
five of us can do Martial Arts.

647
00:47:08,957 --> 00:47:10,907
Six if you include Mayo too.

648
00:47:10,932 --> 00:47:11,860
Oh "kapour"!

649
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:14,696
- "Kapour!"
- Parkour!

650
00:47:14,696 --> 00:47:15,364
You said "kapour"!

651
00:47:15,364 --> 00:47:16,715
Stupid, it's parkour!

652
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,116
If I'm the stupid one,
then what are you?

653
00:47:18,116 --> 00:47:18,742
Attention-seeker!

654
00:47:18,742 --> 00:47:19,368
Asshole!

655
00:47:19,368 --> 00:47:20,471
Profanity.

656
00:47:23,872 --> 00:47:25,207
I'm jealous.

657
00:47:25,457 --> 00:47:27,042
I can't help it, Jay.

658
00:47:27,042 --> 00:47:29,503
You agreed to be my fiancée.

659
00:47:34,316 --> 00:47:35,734
Fuck, it's because of Jay-jay?!

660
00:47:35,759 --> 00:47:36,876
Wait, no!

661
00:47:36,901 --> 00:47:37,678
It isn't what it looks like!

662
00:47:37,678 --> 00:47:38,971
Kit!

663
00:47:38,971 --> 00:47:40,339
Even blaming Kit!

664
00:47:40,364 --> 00:47:42,283
Stop talking to Jay-jay like that!

665
00:47:42,349 --> 00:47:45,727
Go flirt with everybody in Section E!

666
00:47:46,566 --> 00:47:48,807
You're no different from Ella,
anyway!
