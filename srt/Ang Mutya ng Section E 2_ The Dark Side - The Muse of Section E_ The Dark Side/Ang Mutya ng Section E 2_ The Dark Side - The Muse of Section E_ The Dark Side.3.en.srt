1
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,225
Don't let them
take what's yours.

2
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,685
Don't be fooled.

3
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:20,382
Show them who's in charge.

4
00:00:20,477 --> 00:00:23,105
And you don't wait for
weakness, you create it.

5
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:24,642
Follow your heart.

6
00:00:24,642 --> 00:00:26,352
Parkour, parkour, parkour!

7
00:00:26,352 --> 00:00:27,728
Kapour, kapour, asshole!!!

8
00:00:27,853 --> 00:00:28,857
Profanity.

9
00:00:32,316 --> 00:00:33,317
I'm jealous.

10
00:00:33,317 --> 00:00:35,152
You agreed to be my fiancée.

11
00:00:37,863 --> 00:00:39,560
What do you think
you're doing here?!

12
00:00:40,449 --> 00:00:42,593
It hurts, I didn't do anything!

13
00:00:42,618 --> 00:00:44,036
I told you, you're mine.

14
00:00:47,498 --> 00:00:49,333
You really targeted
Jay-jay, huh?

15
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:50,918
Why did you do that to Kiko?

16
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:51,835
Kiko.

17
00:00:51,835 --> 00:00:53,170
Please forgive me, Jay-jay.

18
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,214
Just don't do it again, Kiko.

19
00:00:55,965 --> 00:00:57,800
Why weren't you
answering your phone?

20
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,718
What if the incident with
Rory happens again?

21
00:00:59,718 --> 00:01:01,136
You're too attached to Jay-jay.

22
00:01:01,136 --> 00:01:02,596
That's too much.

23
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:03,889
Falling in love is so hard.

24
00:01:03,889 --> 00:01:05,599
There are two guys
chasing after you.

25
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:06,684
What are you talking about?

26
00:01:06,684 --> 00:01:08,185
Keifer ain't shit.

27
00:01:08,185 --> 00:01:09,895
He's selfish when
it comes to girls.

28
00:01:09,895 --> 00:01:10,980
Yuri's a coward.

29
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,564
Jay, he doesn't fight fair too.

30
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:14,483
He makes a move
without us knowing.

31
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,571
As time passes,

32
00:01:19,571 --> 00:01:22,241
I'm filled with so many
questions in my mind,

33
00:01:28,122 --> 00:01:29,456
...and my feelings.

34
00:01:30,374 --> 00:01:32,209
As well as economic classes,

35
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,962
we shall never be
free of dominations.

36
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:38,799
What message do you think
the author is trying to convey?

37
00:01:39,591 --> 00:01:40,801
Ms. Mariano.

38
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:43,137
Ms. Mariano!

39
00:01:44,082 --> 00:01:45,156
Sir?

40
00:01:45,644 --> 00:01:46,672
What's the answer?

41
00:01:48,934 --> 00:01:50,035
Huh?

42
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,133
I'm supposed to answer now?

43
00:01:51,562 --> 00:01:53,022
Can I have more time to think?

44
00:01:53,654 --> 00:01:54,864
My question is

45
00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:58,059
what message do you think
the author is trying to convey?

46
00:02:05,284 --> 00:02:06,160
Sorry, Sir.

47
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,494
I don't know.

48
00:02:10,624 --> 00:02:14,837
Why are there still questions I don't 
know how to answer up until now?

49
00:02:18,674 --> 00:02:19,356
Class!

50
00:02:19,381 --> 00:02:20,507
Class, reminder.

51
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:23,927
Reminder, you have your
upcoming outdoor retreat.

52
00:02:23,927 --> 00:02:24,946
Okay?

53
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:28,149
Huh?

54
00:02:30,476 --> 00:02:32,094
Shall we go on a date at the retreat?

55
00:02:32,978 --> 00:02:34,354
It's a retreat!

56
00:02:34,897 --> 00:02:36,023
I'm out of here.

57
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,665
Jay give that to me, I'll carry it.

58
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:38,358
Oh!

59
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:39,276
It's just light.

60
00:02:39,276 --> 00:02:40,277
There's nothing inside, see?

61
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,780
Oh, whatever!

62
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,323
I don't know anymore!

63
00:02:44,323 --> 00:02:46,492
I'll just avoid these two for now!

64
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,303
Okay.

65
00:04:29,595 --> 00:04:31,013
Hmm.

66
00:04:31,013 --> 00:04:33,098
I feel like,
this should be here.

67
00:04:33,884 --> 00:04:34,825
There!

68
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:35,916
Oh, I have an idea!

69
00:04:36,768 --> 00:04:37,815
Okay.

70
00:04:39,188 --> 00:04:39,872
Hey!

71
00:04:39,897 --> 00:04:41,064
Jay, let's buy Yogorino please!

72
00:04:41,064 --> 00:04:42,441
I've been craving it
for so long, please Jay!

73
00:04:42,441 --> 00:04:43,901
Please, please, please.

74
00:04:43,901 --> 00:04:44,985
Jay, Yogorino!

75
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:45,819
- Shh!
- Please.

76
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:46,945
- Just one.
- You wish!

77
00:04:46,945 --> 00:04:48,363
You don't even
clean up after yourself,

78
00:04:48,363 --> 00:04:49,489
and now you're
making requests.

79
00:04:49,907 --> 00:04:51,909
Look at this,
you're adding more mess.

80
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:53,785
Wow, you even brought lights.

81
00:04:54,286 --> 00:04:55,621
Amazing, you're turning
my room into a storage unit.

82
00:04:55,621 --> 00:04:57,789
Jay, come on it's just Yogorino!

83
00:04:58,165 --> 00:04:59,124
- Whatever!
- Wow, so selfish.

84
00:04:59,124 --> 00:05:00,876
Jay, please!

85
00:05:00,876 --> 00:05:03,086
Just Yogorino, please!

86
00:05:03,212 --> 00:05:05,672
I'm begging you Jay,
please, just one Yogorino!

87
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:06,673
Just one, please.

88
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,467
I've been craving it
forever, Jay.

89
00:05:08,467 --> 00:05:11,178
You know what, what if
the rabies reached your brain?

90
00:05:11,303 --> 00:05:12,471
It wasn't treated in time.

91
00:05:12,471 --> 00:05:13,722
You're seriously
something else now.

92
00:05:13,722 --> 00:05:15,807
Then that's more reason
for you to buy me Yogorino.

93
00:05:15,807 --> 00:05:17,517
What if that's my last wish?

94
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,645
You'll feel guilty
for the rest of your life!

95
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:21,313
Fine, forget it!

96
00:05:21,313 --> 00:05:22,648
I'll just leave if that's
how you're going to be!

97
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:25,097
Wow.

98
00:05:25,734 --> 00:05:26,860
Fine, take this!

99
00:05:27,277 --> 00:05:28,403
So dramatic.

100
00:05:29,488 --> 00:05:30,530
- You're always like that.
- Wow, amazing!

101
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,823
You’re packing my stuff!

102
00:05:31,823 --> 00:05:33,909
- This is mine!
- You're shameless, that's mine!

103
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:35,077
You've got some nerve!

104
00:05:35,077 --> 00:05:36,036
- Fine Jay, forget it!
- But that's really mine!

105
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:37,537
Don't talk to me anymore,
I'm leaving-

106
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:38,622
Okay, okay!

107
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:40,082
I'll buy it for you!

108
00:05:41,105 --> 00:05:41,892
Really?

109
00:05:41,917 --> 00:05:42,687
Yes!

110
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,311
Promise?

111
00:05:44,336 --> 00:05:45,313
Yes, promise!

112
00:05:45,796 --> 00:05:47,005
Thank you, Jay!

113
00:05:48,465 --> 00:05:49,258
Buy your own snacks too,

114
00:05:49,258 --> 00:05:50,259
so we can eat together.

115
00:05:50,842 --> 00:05:52,135
Wow.

116
00:05:52,135 --> 00:05:53,136
Why don't you come
with me instead?

117
00:05:54,972 --> 00:05:55,722
No need.

118
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:56,990
You can handle that already.

119
00:05:57,015 --> 00:05:58,570
You survived
seventeen years without me,

120
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:00,143
you can handle this too.

121
00:06:01,453 --> 00:06:02,454
You're such a pain the ass!

122
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:03,188
Annoying!

123
00:06:04,982 --> 00:06:05,649
So annoying!

124
00:06:05,649 --> 00:06:06,275
That hurt.

125
00:06:06,275 --> 00:06:07,651
I'm going broke because of you.

126
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,153
You're treating me next time.

127
00:06:21,623 --> 00:06:22,624
Smells so good!

128
00:06:30,674 --> 00:06:32,759
Are you going with Eman tomorrow?

129
00:06:34,553 --> 00:06:36,722
Do you have plans on Sunday, Jay?

130
00:06:38,307 --> 00:06:39,975
These two annoying boys again.

131
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:42,020
Can you let me think for a moment?

132
00:06:45,522 --> 00:06:46,540
Oh.

133
00:06:46,565 --> 00:06:47,441
I'll go change first!

134
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:49,109
I love you, Jay!

135
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,079
Damn you!

136
00:06:53,034 --> 00:06:54,535
What flavor would he like?

137
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:57,909
Good thing there's a pint for takeout.

138
00:07:05,613 --> 00:07:07,014
You're taking forever to choose.

139
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:08,562
David!!!

140
00:07:08,587 --> 00:07:09,354
Ouch!

141
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:10,385
What was that for?

142
00:07:10,714 --> 00:07:11,506
What do you mean "what was that for"?

143
00:07:11,506 --> 00:07:12,855
You scared me, you jerk!

144
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,092
You looked so serious.

145
00:07:14,676 --> 00:07:15,886
I'm choosing, okay?

146
00:07:16,178 --> 00:07:17,182
Hurry up already.

147
00:07:17,429 --> 00:07:18,180
My treat.

148
00:07:19,556 --> 00:07:20,553
Really?

149
00:07:21,183 --> 00:07:22,236
No takebacks!

150
00:07:23,602 --> 00:07:24,978
Hmm...

151
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:26,730
One large...

152
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,522
Mango....

153
00:07:27,522 --> 00:07:29,191
- ... Speculoos.
- Speculoos.

154
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:30,125
Yes.

155
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:34,905
And one pint
of Berry Choco Crunch.

156
00:07:34,905 --> 00:07:35,906
But this one...

157
00:07:36,531 --> 00:07:38,241
let's get it later
since it's for takeout.

158
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:38,909
Okay.

159
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:39,898
I'll be back.

160
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:45,749
Hi, Ma'am.

161
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:47,751
One Mango Speculoos please.

162
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:51,421
one Berry Choco Crunch.

163
00:07:51,421 --> 00:07:53,048
Where's my Yogorino, Jay?

164
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,720
You wait!

165
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:01,348
Thank you, Ma'am!

166
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:02,641
Okay, thank you!

167
00:08:03,308 --> 00:08:05,310
One Mango Speculoos for the lady.

168
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,312
Thank you!

169
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:10,065
So you went out just for Yogorino?

170
00:08:11,316 --> 00:08:12,859
I've got a pest at home.

171
00:08:13,735 --> 00:08:14,836
Where is that kid anyway?

172
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:15,821
Why didn't you bring him along?

173
00:08:15,821 --> 00:08:17,322
That brat is too lazy.

174
00:08:17,489 --> 00:08:19,950
He even pestered me into
buying Yogorino for him.

175
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:21,410
How about you?

176
00:08:21,473 --> 00:08:22,474
Why are you here?

177
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:24,145
Uhm...

178
00:08:25,263 --> 00:08:26,278
Unwinding.

179
00:08:26,498 --> 00:08:27,666
- Hmm?
- I've been overthinking.

180
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:29,752
Why?

181
00:08:30,252 --> 00:08:31,253
I don't know.

182
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,403
About what?

183
00:08:36,258 --> 00:08:37,384
A lot of things.

184
00:08:39,136 --> 00:08:40,011
Just tell me.

185
00:08:42,848 --> 00:08:43,765
It's just...

186
00:08:44,474 --> 00:08:45,642
you wouldn't understand, Jay.

187
00:08:45,642 --> 00:08:46,977
It's just random thoughts.

188
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:53,984
Where are you?

189
00:08:54,151 --> 00:08:55,735
Why aren't you replying?

190
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,988
Why do you care where I am?

191
00:08:58,238 --> 00:08:59,271
Are you my boyfriend?

192
00:08:59,917 --> 00:09:00,851
What is it?

193
00:09:01,616 --> 00:09:02,624
Oh, nothing.

194
00:09:02,951 --> 00:09:03,952
Must be a wrong send.

195
00:09:04,369 --> 00:09:05,473
It's Keifer, isn't it?

196
00:09:07,539 --> 00:09:08,550
I knew it.

197
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:10,569
Are you and Keifer together?

198
00:09:13,503 --> 00:09:14,004
Sorry.

199
00:09:14,004 --> 00:09:15,547
- This is your fault!
- Sorry.

200
00:09:21,303 --> 00:09:22,220
So fussy.

201
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,219
It's just a little.

202
00:09:23,638 --> 00:09:24,848
It's fine, it's just a few.

203
00:09:27,851 --> 00:09:29,227
I'll poke your eyes out!

204
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,521
Huh?!

205
00:09:30,562 --> 00:09:32,189
Your eyes, you're staring so hard!

206
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:33,291
No!

207
00:09:34,232 --> 00:09:35,066
The necklace!

208
00:09:35,091 --> 00:09:36,476
I was looking at your necklace.

209
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,533
Why is there a ring on it?

210
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:41,524
Ah...

211
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:45,076
Uhm, it was just given to me.

212
00:09:46,036 --> 00:09:47,811
I can't wear it yet, so...

213
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:49,301
I just placed it here for now.

214
00:09:50,999 --> 00:09:52,023
I see.

215
00:09:52,874 --> 00:09:53,935
Thank you.

216
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,045
That's not from me.

217
00:09:55,045 --> 00:09:55,837
Who is it from?

218
00:09:55,837 --> 00:09:56,838
I don't know.

219
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,051
Who told you to give
this necklace to me anyway?

220
00:10:02,177 --> 00:10:03,428
Don't mind it.

221
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,931
Come on, tell me.

222
00:10:06,348 --> 00:10:08,308
Or at least give me a clue.

223
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:09,331
A clue?

224
00:10:09,768 --> 00:10:11,728
Okay, here's a clue.

225
00:10:12,354 --> 00:10:14,147
Do you know any child of Poseidon?

226
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:17,651
You don't know anyone?

227
00:10:17,859 --> 00:10:18,808
Even from books?

228
00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:20,106
Films?

229
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:23,490
Oh, maybe...

230
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,909
maybe I know
a fictional character uh...

231
00:10:26,868 --> 00:10:27,877
Percy-

232
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:29,204
Percy!

233
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,456
Have you been
meeting up with Percy?

234
00:10:31,456 --> 00:10:32,462
No.

235
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,459
He just sent it to me.

236
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:35,752
But you guys talk?

237
00:10:35,971 --> 00:10:38,098
He only calls whenever he wants.

238
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:39,506
That's it.

239
00:10:42,425 --> 00:10:44,511
Maybe you can try to contact him now?

240
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:45,845
Because...

241
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:47,639
he called me before,

242
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:49,558
but the number he used
doesn't work anymore.

243
00:10:49,558 --> 00:10:51,351
Please, David.

244
00:10:51,893 --> 00:10:52,936
Please.

245
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:55,689
I really need to talk to him.

246
00:10:55,814 --> 00:10:57,482
I can send him a message instead.

247
00:10:58,233 --> 00:10:59,943
But I can't guarantee he'll respond.

248
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,013
- Okay?
- Yeah.

249
00:11:03,071 --> 00:11:03,989
Smile.

250
00:11:03,989 --> 00:11:04,364
Hey!

251
00:11:04,739 --> 00:11:05,782
Wait, I'm not ready yet.

252
00:11:05,782 --> 00:11:06,746
Sent.

253
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:08,593
You're good, huh.

254
00:11:08,618 --> 00:11:09,661
Now we wait.

255
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:10,893
We wait?

256
00:11:11,454 --> 00:11:12,706
Does he reply quickly?

257
00:11:12,914 --> 00:11:13,832
We'll find out.

258
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:17,419
There!

259
00:11:22,507 --> 00:11:24,509
Remove that ring from her necklace.

260
00:11:25,176 --> 00:11:27,220
Or I will kill Yuri once I get back.

261
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:51,431
Ahhh!

262
00:11:52,101 --> 00:11:53,599
Why do your eyes look like that, Jay?

263
00:11:54,706 --> 00:11:55,782
You look scary.

264
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:01,421
Your eyebags have
eyebags of their own too.

265
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:04,382
I didn't sleep well!

266
00:12:06,134 --> 00:12:09,638
Percy didn't reply
after his last message.

267
00:12:09,638 --> 00:12:10,930
What was that about?

268
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,807
Why did he say that about Yuri?

269
00:12:17,145 --> 00:12:18,313
Wow, you even took a picture.

270
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:19,522
Look at yourself.

271
00:12:21,232 --> 00:12:22,275
[phone buzzing]

272
00:12:23,902 --> 00:12:24,742
What's that?

273
00:12:27,906 --> 00:12:29,115
Is it yours?

274
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,375
- You're making a mess.
- Sorry.

275
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:41,878
Just put it there.

276
00:12:43,713 --> 00:12:45,173
Did you throw away your phone, Jay?

277
00:12:46,591 --> 00:12:47,555
Uhm...

278
00:12:48,218 --> 00:12:49,237
Nothing,

279
00:12:49,678 --> 00:12:50,804
I'm just annoyed.

280
00:12:51,554 --> 00:12:55,183
The person I wanted to text
and explain isn't replying.

281
00:12:55,183 --> 00:12:57,977
But the people
I'm avoiding keep texting!

282
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,821
Do you have rabies
in your brain too?

283
00:13:02,255 --> 00:13:03,492
Give that to me.

284
00:13:10,115 --> 00:13:11,007
Hello?

285
00:13:11,032 --> 00:13:14,077
Kindly explain to me why
you're not answering my calls

286
00:13:14,077 --> 00:13:15,412
or my messages?

287
00:13:17,372 --> 00:13:19,040
I just saw my phone now.

288
00:13:21,948 --> 00:13:23,407
Are you going to
the grocery with Eman?

289
00:13:25,046 --> 00:13:26,089
Ah yes, I'm going. Why?

290
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:32,846
Wow, amazing.

291
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:36,975
What?

292
00:13:37,861 --> 00:13:38,902
Ah,

293
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:41,229
I won't be able to join you later.

294
00:13:41,604 --> 00:13:43,648
I'll meet up with Rakki and my sister.

295
00:13:43,648 --> 00:13:44,649
What time will you be home?

296
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:45,525
Will you be late?

297
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,569
I'm not sure but...

298
00:13:47,569 --> 00:13:48,486
I'll call you right away.

299
00:13:48,903 --> 00:13:50,655
Okay, see you later then.

300
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:52,323
Where are you going?

301
00:13:52,323 --> 00:13:53,450
I'll take a shower, duh.

302
00:13:53,616 --> 00:13:54,909
Okay. I'll go first!

303
00:13:55,021 --> 00:13:55,842
Hey!

304
00:13:56,786 --> 00:13:57,704
Wow, amazing!

305
00:13:57,704 --> 00:13:58,788
You're so annoying!

306
00:13:59,456 --> 00:14:01,207
Look at that, now he's gonna sing!

307
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,334
[Ci-N singing]

308
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:07,714
Good morning!

309
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,467
Why do you have to
open the gate so wide!

310
00:14:10,467 --> 00:14:11,301
Sorry.

311
00:14:11,301 --> 00:14:12,218
I'll go ahead, Jay.

312
00:14:12,927 --> 00:14:13,928
Okay, text me!

313
00:14:14,304 --> 00:14:15,305
Alright!

314
00:14:19,934 --> 00:14:20,769
You know what man,

315
00:14:21,144 --> 00:14:23,062
her arm is only about as big as this bat.

316
00:14:26,858 --> 00:14:29,694
This bat is solid, but that
girl’s face is on another level.

317
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,571
Tell me about it.

318
00:14:32,655 --> 00:14:34,365
Here we go again.

319
00:14:35,033 --> 00:14:36,534
Don't tell me...

320
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:45,794
Get in!

321
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:52,717
What, do you have a problem?

322
00:14:53,718 --> 00:14:54,886
Do you need back up?

323
00:14:55,678 --> 00:14:57,222
Early in the morning, and
you're thinking about fighting.

324
00:14:57,222 --> 00:14:58,848
They're not doing
anything anyways, let's go.

325
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:21,329
Some of the boys are sulking,

326
00:15:21,329 --> 00:15:22,455
they wanted to come along.

327
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,166
Good thing it's just the three of us.

328
00:15:26,042 --> 00:15:27,794
It's hard to do the groceries
when there are too many people.

329
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:29,671
They all want
different things, right?

330
00:15:33,883 --> 00:15:34,781
Who's that?

331
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,387
Uhm.. m-my

332
00:15:37,387 --> 00:15:38,221
best friend.

333
00:15:38,221 --> 00:15:39,097
Ah!

334
00:15:39,097 --> 00:15:40,139
- Keigan's girlfriend!
- Yeah!

335
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,867
Here.

336
00:15:42,892 --> 00:15:44,727
Let's split up so it'll be faster.

337
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:48,648
Then we'll meet
at the cashier, okay?

338
00:15:48,773 --> 00:15:49,941
- Oh, okay.
- Sure.

339
00:15:50,024 --> 00:15:50,817
I'll get this one,

340
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:51,860
you grab a new cart!

341
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:53,903
You're so sneaky.

342
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:55,822
This looks delicious.

343
00:16:05,582 --> 00:16:07,250
This is a good distraction.

344
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,918
At least I won't be thinking
about the engagement,

345
00:16:08,918 --> 00:16:09,961
as well as the King of Assholes-

346
00:16:10,211 --> 00:16:11,212
Oh my God!

347
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,926
What is this I'm seeing?!

348
00:16:19,053 --> 00:16:20,805
Jay-jay, you’re going crazy!

349
00:16:21,131 --> 00:16:22,083
Huh?!

350
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:24,726
I thought it was
the King of Assholes.

351
00:16:27,478 --> 00:16:28,521
What was that?

352
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,447
It doesn't even look like him.

353
00:16:40,742 --> 00:16:41,784
Oh shit!

354
00:16:44,245 --> 00:16:46,497
Darling, are you okay?

355
00:16:46,497 --> 00:16:48,791
Ah yes, sorry.

356
00:16:53,254 --> 00:16:54,727
I literally just said so.

357
00:16:54,752 --> 00:16:56,045
Yet here you are
bugging my mind again!

358
00:16:57,592 --> 00:16:58,593
Tss.

359
00:17:11,856 --> 00:17:13,024
Is that for me?

360
00:17:17,612 --> 00:17:18,696
Whatever.

361
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:21,449
So it is for me?

362
00:17:22,325 --> 00:17:23,217
No!

363
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:24,619
It's for everyone!

364
00:17:25,536 --> 00:17:26,788
Ugh, it fell.

365
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:31,501
Thanks anyways,
but it would be a waste.

366
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:33,419
A waste?

367
00:17:35,546 --> 00:17:36,798
Isn't that your favorite?

368
00:17:37,173 --> 00:17:38,123
Yeah,

369
00:17:38,216 --> 00:17:39,092
I like sweets.

370
00:17:39,752 --> 00:17:40,669
But...

371
00:17:41,678 --> 00:17:43,137
I like a different kind of sweet now.

372
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,306
What?

373
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:49,727
Your lips.

374
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:56,901
Why are you blushing?

375
00:17:58,778 --> 00:17:59,685
No, I'm not.

376
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:01,308
It's hot!

377
00:18:04,325 --> 00:18:05,827
Why were you
ignoring my messages?

378
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:11,666
It's all crumpled now.

379
00:18:13,251 --> 00:18:14,460
Did I do something wrong?

380
00:18:18,917 --> 00:18:19,799
Jay!

381
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:20,967
Tss.

382
00:18:23,052 --> 00:18:23,928
I got this!

383
00:18:24,012 --> 00:18:25,013
I can do this!

384
00:18:25,013 --> 00:18:25,847
Give it to me!

385
00:18:25,847 --> 00:18:26,889
I said I got it!

386
00:18:26,889 --> 00:18:27,724
Let me.

387
00:18:27,724 --> 00:18:28,808
I got this, you're so annoying.

388
00:18:30,184 --> 00:18:31,310
Give it to me!

389
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:40,778
Fine, let's push it together.

390
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,418
Oh wait, grab that.

391
00:18:55,418 --> 00:18:56,127
This one?

392
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,003
Yeah.

393
00:18:57,086 --> 00:18:58,004
Can't reach it?

394
00:18:58,421 --> 00:19:00,173
I can reach it, you're just closer.

395
00:19:01,382 --> 00:19:02,508
Okay, if you say so.

396
00:19:02,925 --> 00:19:03,718
What else?

397
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:07,680
I think we got it all,

398
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,015
I'll pay now.

399
00:19:10,224 --> 00:19:11,350
Okay. I'll go first!

400
00:19:11,601 --> 00:19:12,769
I'll wait for you outside.

401
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,979
Why, where are we going?

402
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,357
I found out something
about your father.

403
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:23,362
Tss.

404
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,576
Where did he go?

405
00:19:29,452 --> 00:19:30,661
We bought everything
already, right?

406
00:19:30,661 --> 00:19:31,530
Yeah,

407
00:19:31,788 --> 00:19:33,122
it's all complete.

408
00:19:36,501 --> 00:19:37,668
What happened to you, Jay?

409
00:19:37,668 --> 00:19:38,669
Look!

410
00:19:43,925 --> 00:19:45,843
This kid is really something else!

411
00:19:45,843 --> 00:19:47,845
You'd think he doesn't
drool in his sleep.

412
00:19:48,137 --> 00:19:50,264
Looks like Section E's
youngest is all grown up now.

413
00:19:50,848 --> 00:19:52,141
"Grown up," huh?

414
00:19:55,686 --> 00:19:56,938
Hey, what are you doing?

415
00:19:56,938 --> 00:19:57,939
Let's take a picture.

416
00:19:58,231 --> 00:19:59,607
Don't make it too obvious!

417
00:20:00,024 --> 00:20:00,858
Don't move.

418
00:20:06,989 --> 00:20:07,865
Send it to me!

419
00:20:07,865 --> 00:20:09,117
- Send it to me, okay!
- Okay!

420
00:20:09,117 --> 00:20:10,660
- Yo,yo!
- Send it to me immediately!

421
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:14,080
Hey, bro!

422
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:16,958
Ci-N got more rizz than you.

423
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,584
While this guy right here,

424
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:20,878
can only hold hands
while walking with his girlfriend.

425
00:20:20,878 --> 00:20:21,838
Stop it!

426
00:20:21,838 --> 00:20:22,922
Admit it!

427
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:24,132
Weak!

428
00:20:24,632 --> 00:20:25,800
Asshole, stop it!

429
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,552
- Bro, you have no game.
- Stop it, the both of you!

430
00:20:27,552 --> 00:20:28,761
I'll knock both of you together.

431
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:30,096
- He started it!
- What?

432
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:31,389
- Jay, shall we go?
- Weak! Weak!

433
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:32,807
Uhm...

434
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:33,891
you guys go ahead.

435
00:20:33,891 --> 00:20:34,809
Here, take this.

436
00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:36,602
I still have somewhere to go.

437
00:20:36,853 --> 00:20:37,620
Where?

438
00:20:37,645 --> 00:20:38,521
I'll just take you there.

439
00:20:39,272 --> 00:20:40,565
No it's fine, it's nearby.

440
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,641
- Bring this.
- Are you sure?

441
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,443
Just text us when you get home.

442
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:45,486
If I have load.

443
00:20:45,991 --> 00:20:46,950
You take care!

444
00:20:47,405 --> 00:20:49,073
- Take care, Jay!
- Okay.

445
00:20:49,157 --> 00:20:50,158
Behave.

446
00:20:50,658 --> 00:20:52,243
They better watch out for you two.

447
00:20:57,498 --> 00:20:59,208
[phone buzzing]

448
00:21:03,171 --> 00:21:04,172
Hello?

449
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,633
Let's go together.

450
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:07,091
Wait for me.

451
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,260
Where are we going?

452
00:21:09,886 --> 00:21:11,596
What did you learn about my father?

453
00:21:11,596 --> 00:21:13,347
I'll explain later.

454
00:21:26,324 --> 00:21:28,243
- Hello, Sir.
- Good afternoon.

455
00:21:29,363 --> 00:21:31,032
- Thank you.
- Wow!!!

456
00:21:31,032 --> 00:21:33,201
You use a different car
every time!

457
00:21:33,201 --> 00:21:34,076
Lend me one!

458
00:21:34,076 --> 00:21:34,911
Which one?

459
00:21:35,018 --> 00:21:36,561
The one we used today?

460
00:21:36,859 --> 00:21:38,194
The one for Mondays?

461
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,416
The Tuesday car suits you better.

462
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:41,375
Tuesday?

463
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,376
Which one's the Tuesday car?

464
00:21:42,376 --> 00:21:44,420
The other cars
are on the other side.

465
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,714
So, just pick any.

466
00:21:47,089 --> 00:21:48,090
Are you serious?

467
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,735
Yeah.

468
00:21:51,928 --> 00:21:54,931
I'm actually even willing
to give you my entire house.

469
00:21:56,432 --> 00:21:59,477
Just make sure
you won't marry Yuri.

470
00:21:59,477 --> 00:22:00,645
Tss, whatever!

471
00:22:01,306 --> 00:22:02,222
Tss!

472
00:22:02,628 --> 00:22:04,253
Even without all that...

473
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,360
you're still gonna end up with me.

474
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:10,738
Cause remember,

475
00:22:12,573 --> 00:22:13,574
you're mine.

476
00:22:19,413 --> 00:22:22,208
I'm not a thing
that anyone can own.

477
00:22:25,086 --> 00:22:26,337
Okay, fine.

478
00:22:26,796 --> 00:22:28,547
If you don't like that,

479
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:29,715
I'll change it.

480
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:37,890
I'm yours then.

481
00:22:47,275 --> 00:22:48,359
W-where is it anyway?

482
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:49,777
What did you find?

483
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:01,205
Nice one.

484
00:23:01,831 --> 00:23:03,457
- Nice one.
- Damn!

485
00:23:03,457 --> 00:23:04,467
Nice one.

486
00:23:05,459 --> 00:23:07,503
- 1,000 laps.
- Hey!

487
00:23:07,878 --> 00:23:08,938
Hi, Jay!

488
00:23:08,963 --> 00:23:10,131
What's going on?

489
00:23:10,131 --> 00:23:11,156
Why are you guys here?

490
00:23:11,632 --> 00:23:12,883
Are you feeling better?

491
00:23:12,883 --> 00:23:13,676
Why are you drinking?

492
00:23:13,676 --> 00:23:14,719
Of course I'm okay.

493
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:15,469
I'm strong, duh.

494
00:23:15,469 --> 00:23:16,362
Let's go!

495
00:23:16,387 --> 00:23:17,322
Ouch!

496
00:23:17,422 --> 00:23:18,560
- What was that for?!
- Hey!

497
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,683
- Asshole!
- Edrix, stop that!

498
00:23:20,808 --> 00:23:22,476
- You're here to hang out,
- Ouch!

499
00:23:22,476 --> 00:23:23,561
if something happens to him I swear!

500
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,281
Why is it bad?

501
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:27,606
I think you just want Keifer
all to yourself, that's why!

502
00:23:28,482 --> 00:23:29,483
Hey!!!

503
00:23:29,692 --> 00:23:31,694
- Okay, continue!
- Ouch!

504
00:23:31,694 --> 00:23:33,779
- Ouch!
- You're so dramatic, I wasn't even close!

505
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:34,530
Go over there!

506
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:35,281
You want me to punch you?

507
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:37,575
You deserve it, you're
impossible to talk to!

508
00:23:37,885 --> 00:23:39,017
I'm just kidding!

509
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,494
- I'm kidding!
- Yeah, sure!

510
00:23:40,745 --> 00:23:41,495
Enough.

511
00:23:43,873 --> 00:23:45,041
Why are you so quiet?

512
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,834
Drix.

513
00:23:48,377 --> 00:23:49,170
Get it.

514
00:23:52,214 --> 00:23:53,215
Is it here?

515
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:55,051
What is it?

516
00:23:55,968 --> 00:23:56,886
Let me see.

517
00:23:57,553 --> 00:23:58,554
Hurry up!

518
00:23:58,554 --> 00:24:00,264
Wait, I can't open it.

519
00:24:01,849 --> 00:24:02,850
There.

520
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:09,982
It's your father, Jay.

521
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:12,985
W-where did you
get these pictures?

522
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,571
Well here's the thing...

523
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,157
we found out that your
father is the son of uh...

524
00:24:18,449 --> 00:24:19,742
business tycoon?

525
00:24:19,742 --> 00:24:21,285
And he’s currently in New York.

526
00:24:21,494 --> 00:24:22,828
Aside from that, Jay...

527
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:25,915
there's something else
we wanted to show you.

528
00:24:39,322 --> 00:24:40,686
He's with Percy?

529
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,893
Why are they together?

530
00:24:53,317 --> 00:24:54,556
I don't know, Jay.

531
00:24:55,986 --> 00:24:57,231
I'm confused too.

532
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:01,325
That's all the information we could find.

533
00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:09,625
I just want to get to know my dad.

534
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,211
But Percy...

535
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:15,840
he's with him?

536
00:25:18,926 --> 00:25:20,594
What's really the truth?

537
00:25:23,139 --> 00:25:24,140
Jay...

538
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:34,358
It just raised more questions for me.

539
00:25:35,095 --> 00:25:37,309
I want answers.

540
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:43,751
Hey.

541
00:25:46,412 --> 00:25:47,705
I promised, right?

542
00:25:49,457 --> 00:25:50,791
Whatever happens,

543
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:52,768
we’ll figure it out.

544
00:25:53,794 --> 00:25:55,087
We’ll find the answers.

545
00:25:57,423 --> 00:25:58,799
Thank you, Keifer.

546
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:00,926
For helping me look for my dad.

547
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:05,097
You’re welcome.

548
00:26:23,699 --> 00:26:26,293
If my eyes had a mouth,
they'd be cursing me by now.

549
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:29,544
At this rate, all this thinking
will just add to my eyebags.

550
00:26:43,636 --> 00:26:44,665
What happened, Jay?

551
00:26:45,763 --> 00:26:46,978
Don't you want me here anymore?

552
00:26:48,557 --> 00:26:49,580
So dramatic.

553
00:26:50,226 --> 00:26:51,393
Then why are you crying?

554
00:26:52,186 --> 00:26:53,222
Did something happen?

555
00:26:54,187 --> 00:26:55,193
What happened?

556
00:27:00,347 --> 00:27:02,555
I found out something about my dad.

557
00:27:03,906 --> 00:27:05,491
Shouldn't you be
happy if that's the case?

558
00:27:08,702 --> 00:27:10,287
I am, but...

559
00:27:10,871 --> 00:27:11,830
but...

560
00:27:13,374 --> 00:27:15,384
our situation is complicated.

561
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:22,512
It's okay, Jay.

562
00:27:25,803 --> 00:27:28,430
The electricity bill will
decrease, don't worry.

563
00:27:29,443 --> 00:27:30,449
You jerk!

564
00:27:30,474 --> 00:27:31,934
- I'm talking about my feelings here!
- You're too-

565
00:27:31,934 --> 00:27:32,768
You're too serious Jay,

566
00:27:32,768 --> 00:27:34,019
I'm just trying to make you laugh.

567
00:27:34,937 --> 00:27:35,931
Sorry.

568
00:27:36,397 --> 00:27:37,898
- I'm not used to seeing you sad, Jay.
-Sir...

569
00:27:37,898 --> 00:27:39,441
- would you like some drinks?
- Thank you.

570
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:41,193
What if you buy us two some yogurt,
so we'll both be happy.

571
00:27:41,527 --> 00:27:42,361
Wow!

572
00:27:42,486 --> 00:27:43,946
Is it really for me or for you?

573
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,781
For us.

574
00:27:53,455 --> 00:27:54,206
What's that?

575
00:27:54,206 --> 00:27:55,124
Why do you have that?

576
00:27:55,749 --> 00:27:57,957
Look, my sister gave it to me.

577
00:27:58,168 --> 00:27:59,934
She said she's getting me a condo unit.

578
00:28:00,004 --> 00:28:01,422
Huh, getting you one?

579
00:28:01,422 --> 00:28:02,631
- Yeah.
- Why?

580
00:28:04,508 --> 00:28:06,010
I can't come home anymore.

581
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:09,291
And Mom wants me
to mature already, so...

582
00:28:09,961 --> 00:28:11,448
this is the solution they thought of.

583
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:14,810
What's your plan?

584
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:20,060
I don't know yet.

585
00:28:21,312 --> 00:28:22,326
But...

586
00:28:23,212 --> 00:28:24,630
I think this is for the best.

587
00:28:25,029 --> 00:28:27,740
I mean, I was basically
alone at home anyway.

588
00:28:28,532 --> 00:28:31,243
Except for the fact that I had
lots of helpers to mess with,

589
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:32,494
and boss around.

590
00:28:38,167 --> 00:28:39,201
Jay...

591
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:41,587
I have a favor.

592
00:28:41,962 --> 00:28:42,969
What is it?

593
00:28:44,632 --> 00:28:46,300
Apply as my helper.

594
00:28:47,635 --> 00:28:48,510
You're impossible!

595
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,678
You're already
treating me as one!

596
00:28:49,678 --> 00:28:50,429
I'm just kidding, Jay!

597
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:51,430
You're so mad.

598
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,098
- "You're so mad", my ass.
- I'm just trying to make you laugh.

599
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:54,600
Have you seen my room?

600
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,809
It got messy because of you!

601
00:28:55,809 --> 00:28:57,019
- It smells!
- Wow, the nerve!

602
00:28:57,019 --> 00:28:58,312
- You got some nerve!
- It was already like that before I came!

603
00:28:58,312 --> 00:28:59,605
- No it wasn't!
- Yes it was!

604
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:01,106
- Liar!
- You're unbelievable!

605
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:02,566
- It stinks!
- You stink!

606
00:29:02,566 --> 00:29:03,442
- You stink, too!
- Oh, that smells good!

607
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:04,526
You can smell it cleary, stinky!

608
00:29:04,526 --> 00:29:05,778
- Oh!
- That's what my room smells like now!

609
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:07,029
- Just like that!
- That's what your breath smells like too!

610
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:07,821
Like a sewer!

611
00:29:07,821 --> 00:29:08,989
- Oh!
- Then yours too!

612
00:29:09,657 --> 00:29:11,283
Whatever, you stink.

613
00:29:18,332 --> 00:29:20,000
Tell him this.

614
00:29:30,052 --> 00:29:31,261
Tell him this.

615
00:29:32,012 --> 00:29:35,006
If you have no intention of
telling me who you really are,

616
00:29:35,516 --> 00:29:37,512
don't show up or
contact me anymore.

617
00:30:11,468 --> 00:30:12,476
David.

618
00:30:12,553 --> 00:30:13,576
Have you read it?

619
00:30:16,824 --> 00:30:18,326
I can't blame her.

620
00:30:19,393 --> 00:30:21,061
If this reaches Keifer,

621
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:23,397
he definitely won't let me
get close to Jay-jay,

622
00:30:23,397 --> 00:30:24,345
you know this.

623
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:25,482
I know.

624
00:30:25,858 --> 00:30:26,707
I know.

625
00:30:27,234 --> 00:30:28,131
Thank you, David.

626
00:30:28,569 --> 00:30:29,820
For taking care of Jay-jay.

627
00:30:30,612 --> 00:30:31,592
That was our deal.

628
00:30:32,322 --> 00:30:34,533
You take care of my girlfriend's
treatment in New York.

629
00:30:36,326 --> 00:30:37,536
And I look after Jay-jay.

630
00:30:38,162 --> 00:30:40,775
Good thing you accepted
my offer for Cheon Sa.

631
00:30:41,957 --> 00:30:44,334
Even though you were
shocked to see me alive.

632
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:46,211
I have no choice.

633
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:49,173
No other hospital
wanted to operate on her.

634
00:30:50,424 --> 00:30:51,400
Don't worry.

635
00:30:51,425 --> 00:30:52,593
You'll see Cheon Sa soon.

636
00:30:53,093 --> 00:30:54,050
Just...

637
00:30:54,428 --> 00:30:55,613
take care of Jay-jay.

638
00:30:55,971 --> 00:30:56,864
Okay?

639
00:30:56,997 --> 00:30:58,035
And remember...

640
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:00,934
don't fall in love with her.

641
00:31:12,905 --> 00:31:14,698
Just get back here
as soon as you can.

642
00:31:15,157 --> 00:31:16,033
Okay.

643
00:31:33,133 --> 00:31:34,092
Son!

644
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:35,511
Sorry for dropping by.

645
00:31:36,011 --> 00:31:37,930
You left your lunch at home so...

646
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,265
I brought you some
vegetables for you to eat.

647
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:43,435
Uhm, Mom...

648
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:44,436
Yeah?

649
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:46,563
Can I go home already?

650
00:31:48,357 --> 00:31:49,414
No.

651
00:31:49,608 --> 00:31:51,026
You know you can't, right?

652
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:53,634
We still have to monitor your health.

653
00:31:53,659 --> 00:31:55,703
Especially since you felt pain again.

654
00:31:55,989 --> 00:31:57,366
Stupid accident.

655
00:31:58,575 --> 00:32:00,035
Which reminds me,

656
00:32:00,035 --> 00:32:01,912
what did the doctors say yesterday?

657
00:32:03,831 --> 00:32:05,707
Just same old, same old.

658
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:08,168
Did they give you new medicine?

659
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:10,808
No.

660
00:32:11,004 --> 00:32:13,924
They said my body responds
well with the one I have now.

661
00:32:13,924 --> 00:32:14,925
That's good.

662
00:32:15,175 --> 00:32:16,199
Just let me know

663
00:32:16,718 --> 00:32:18,512
when your spine hurts again, okay?

664
00:32:21,348 --> 00:32:22,377
Your Dad's here.

665
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:23,897
Oh, really?

666
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,246
Hey, Dad.

667
00:32:27,271 --> 00:32:28,272
Hey.

668
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:49,668
Hey, what are you doing there?

669
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:50,919
Don't mind me!

670
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:52,629
Don't tell me you're
writing nonsense again!

671
00:32:52,629 --> 00:32:53,297
No, I'm not.

672
00:32:53,297 --> 00:32:55,716
That's minus points in heaven, kid.

673
00:32:55,716 --> 00:32:56,383
Minus points huh,

674
00:32:56,383 --> 00:32:57,651
that's why I'm attending church.

675
00:32:57,676 --> 00:32:58,969
To get additional points.

676
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,721
You go to church?

677
00:33:01,388 --> 00:33:02,401
Of course!

678
00:33:02,556 --> 00:33:04,057
Well, sometimes.

679
00:33:04,224 --> 00:33:05,434
Someone invited me today.

680
00:33:06,727 --> 00:33:10,230
You should attend too Jay,
to reduce your sins.

681
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,343
The nerve!

682
00:33:11,523 --> 00:33:12,443
Just leave already!

683
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:15,694
You went to church once
and now you act holy.

684
00:33:25,913 --> 00:33:26,860
Hello?

685
00:33:27,414 --> 00:33:28,350
Are you busy?

686
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:33,462
Not really, why?

687
00:33:34,129 --> 00:33:36,298
Let's go to church, I'm almost there.

688
00:33:36,465 --> 00:33:37,539
Hey, wait!

689
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:38,795
See you, Jay!

690
00:33:39,092 --> 00:33:40,033
Huh.

691
00:33:45,432 --> 00:33:46,934
What are you doing today?

692
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,145
You both always contact me
at the same time, huh?

693
00:33:54,066 --> 00:33:55,067
It's annoying.

694
00:34:02,574 --> 00:34:03,784
Hey,

695
00:34:04,284 --> 00:34:05,260
Jay!

696
00:34:05,285 --> 00:34:06,286
Oh.

697
00:34:06,662 --> 00:34:07,829
Where are you going?

698
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,139
Uhm...

699
00:34:09,164 --> 00:34:10,248
- Ma'am.
- I'm going to-

700
00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:13,752
Ma'am, someone's waiting
for her outside.

701
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:15,321
Who?

702
00:34:15,514 --> 00:34:16,415
Who?

703
00:34:16,463 --> 00:34:17,547
Is it Keifer?

704
00:34:17,631 --> 00:34:18,256
No, Sir.

705
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:19,424
It's Yuri.

706
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:23,971
Okay, make sure to
come home early.

707
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:26,848
I'll go ahead.

708
00:34:26,848 --> 00:34:29,184
Okay, you guys take care.

709
00:34:40,404 --> 00:34:43,566
I still can't picture
myself getting married.

710
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:47,828
But what choice do I have?

711
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,375
My family needs it.

712
00:34:59,089 --> 00:35:00,674
Are we attending mass here?

713
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:02,479
Yes,

714
00:35:02,509 --> 00:35:03,518
don't you want to?

715
00:35:04,511 --> 00:35:05,514
It's not that.

716
00:35:06,346 --> 00:35:07,889
I was just expecting Buddha.

717
00:35:08,724 --> 00:35:09,738
Buddha?

718
00:35:10,183 --> 00:35:11,184
Why?

719
00:35:12,845 --> 00:35:13,972
Why are you laughing?

720
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:15,731
You're Japanese right?

721
00:35:15,731 --> 00:35:16,523
Buddhism.

722
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:20,819
What year were you born?

723
00:35:22,112 --> 00:35:24,781
You know some Japanese are Catholic.

724
00:35:26,074 --> 00:35:26,986
How would I know?

725
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:36,460
He's so cute!

726
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,137
Is he with his girlfriend?

727
00:35:39,897 --> 00:35:40,928
I don't think so.

728
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,311
She looks ugly!

729
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,342
True, but look at him
so handsome.

730
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:46,511
I agree, compared to Ella.

731
00:35:47,261 --> 00:35:50,195
I don't know why these two like me.

732
00:35:52,941 --> 00:35:54,234
Don't listen to them,

733
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:56,205
okay?

734
00:35:56,825 --> 00:35:58,869
For me, you're the most beautiful.

735
00:36:02,234 --> 00:36:03,242
Where will we go later?

736
00:36:04,702 --> 00:36:05,676
Anywhere.

737
00:36:06,192 --> 00:36:07,193
Anywhere?

738
00:36:07,629 --> 00:36:08,630
How about to...

739
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,619
- Where?
- To-

740
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:11,620
Where?

741
00:36:12,287 --> 00:36:13,163
To a motel.

742
00:36:13,163 --> 00:36:14,164
Hey!

743
00:36:14,211 --> 00:36:15,045
Are you crazy?!

744
00:36:15,254 --> 00:36:16,577
- Inside the church of all places!
- Why?

745
00:36:17,733 --> 00:36:19,234
I'm just kidding, relax.

746
00:36:19,795 --> 00:36:21,171
What if I kick you?

747
00:36:21,863 --> 00:36:22,989
Oh, I know.

748
00:36:23,256 --> 00:36:24,466
Let's just cook instead.

749
00:36:26,093 --> 00:36:27,010
Are you in?

750
00:36:34,476 --> 00:36:36,770
Welcome home, young master.

751
00:36:43,395 --> 00:36:45,064
Sit down there
first before we cook.

752
00:36:45,357 --> 00:36:46,499
Oh, okay.

753
00:36:52,994 --> 00:36:54,121
Can I look at this?

754
00:36:55,205 --> 00:36:56,139
Sure.

755
00:37:06,925 --> 00:37:08,343
Here, you eat first.

756
00:37:09,077 --> 00:37:10,093
Wow!

757
00:37:10,804 --> 00:37:11,888
You still remember?

758
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,932
Go, eat.

759
00:37:15,498 --> 00:37:16,750
This is delicious!

760
00:37:17,936 --> 00:37:19,185
I'll get one.

761
00:37:20,157 --> 00:37:21,033
This is you?

762
00:37:21,058 --> 00:37:22,226
Don't look at that.

763
00:37:22,649 --> 00:37:24,776
Wait, I didn't even start yet.

764
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:26,444
It's all embarrassing stuff anyway!

765
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:27,612
You're overreacting!

766
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:28,989
It looks decent!

767
00:37:28,989 --> 00:37:30,198
What do you mean decent?

768
00:37:30,198 --> 00:37:31,783
See, this one looks nice.

769
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:35,495
- Model.
- Wow, making fun of me now huh.

770
00:37:35,745 --> 00:37:36,580
Go, eat some more.

771
00:37:38,373 --> 00:37:40,458
So this is how you smile.

772
00:37:41,084 --> 00:37:42,419
Ahh.

773
00:37:42,419 --> 00:37:43,378
Let me see.

774
00:37:44,087 --> 00:37:47,048
- You're just making fun of me, Jay!
- You really smiled, so gullible.

775
00:37:47,686 --> 00:37:48,792
Wait.

776
00:37:50,802 --> 00:37:52,679
Why do you look
mad in this picture?

777
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:54,264
Look, you're the only
one who looks mad.

778
00:37:54,431 --> 00:37:56,266
You know what
you should stop now, Jay.

779
00:38:01,013 --> 00:38:02,556
Did you guys
serve at the church?

780
00:38:02,772 --> 00:38:03,857
Good thing you didn't burn.

781
00:38:04,149 --> 00:38:05,901
Angelo got us in there.

782
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:08,195
He said maybe we'd behave.

783
00:38:08,403 --> 00:38:09,417
What happened?

784
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:11,322
Well.

785
00:38:11,347 --> 00:38:12,640
We got kicked out right away.

786
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:14,951
Because Keifer punched
the Head Sacristan.

787
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,458
You know,

788
00:38:17,483 --> 00:38:18,888
he's really crazy huh?

789
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:37,500
That's the last picture
of us together.

790
00:38:46,453 --> 00:38:47,454
Let's go!

791
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:49,502
Let's cook.

792
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:51,250
- Huh?
- Come on.

793
00:38:51,784 --> 00:38:52,813
But I'm still eating.

794
00:39:04,459 --> 00:39:05,283
Oh.

795
00:39:05,835 --> 00:39:06,920
- Ouch!
- Damn you!

796
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,213
What, is that how you cook?

797
00:39:08,297 --> 00:39:10,132
I know the
meaning of "baka"!

798
00:39:10,298 --> 00:39:11,750
I just realized it now!

799
00:39:11,775 --> 00:39:12,734
What "baka"?

800
00:39:12,843 --> 00:39:14,386
You said that to me before!

801
00:39:14,761 --> 00:39:15,553
When...

802
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:17,305
when it was raining before,
then we slipped in the mud!

803
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:18,642
Baka?

804
00:39:19,516 --> 00:39:20,892
Hey, what are you doing?!

805
00:39:21,518 --> 00:39:23,687
I'm going to carry you, stupid!

806
00:39:24,062 --> 00:39:25,063
Where?

807
00:39:25,647 --> 00:39:26,648
Where's the cow?

808
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,316
- Ahh!
- Oh!

809
00:39:28,608 --> 00:39:29,734
Right, I remember now, sorry.

810
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:31,027
I was just hot-headed back then.

811
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:34,030
[in Japanese] "Stupid, stupid, stupid".

812
00:39:36,992 --> 00:39:38,991
I miss being friends with Yuri.

813
00:39:39,803 --> 00:39:42,765
Why do things have
to be so complicated?

814
00:39:45,667 --> 00:39:46,707
I know.

815
00:39:47,419 --> 00:39:49,844
I'll teach you some
Japanese words.

816
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,545
Why?

817
00:39:52,278 --> 00:39:53,733
So when we go to Japan,

818
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:56,094
you won't say random stuff
to the people there.

819
00:39:59,472 --> 00:40:00,403
Okay.

820
00:40:00,807 --> 00:40:01,875
Fine, hit me with it.

821
00:40:02,225 --> 00:40:03,269
Hmm, okay.

822
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:06,021
Let's do greetings first.

823
00:40:06,659 --> 00:40:07,993
Say, "konnichiwa."

824
00:40:08,183 --> 00:40:09,784
That means, "Good day".

825
00:40:11,859 --> 00:40:12,944
[In Japanese] Good day.

826
00:40:13,069 --> 00:40:14,904
Wow! You're good.

827
00:40:14,904 --> 00:40:16,197
Nice, right?

828
00:40:16,531 --> 00:40:17,512
Alright, now this one.

829
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:19,200
Say...

830
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,868
What?

831
00:40:19,868 --> 00:40:20,818
"Konbanwa".

832
00:40:21,494 --> 00:40:23,204
It means, "Good evening".

833
00:40:23,913 --> 00:40:25,081
Konban-

834
00:40:25,081 --> 00:40:26,207
[in Japanese] Good evening.

835
00:40:26,207 --> 00:40:28,126
Wow, so proud of yourself.

836
00:40:28,126 --> 00:40:29,878
- Acting all smug.
- See?

837
00:40:29,878 --> 00:40:31,421
That was easy.

838
00:40:32,005 --> 00:40:33,381
What about "thank you"?

839
00:40:33,757 --> 00:40:34,883
Ah, okay here.

840
00:40:34,908 --> 00:40:35,986
Say...

841
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,671
"arigato gozaimasu".

842
00:40:38,887 --> 00:40:39,946
What?

843
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:41,306
"Aribato ni Lamas"?

844
00:40:41,306 --> 00:40:42,974
What's "aribato ni Lamas"?

845
00:40:43,433 --> 00:40:45,745
[In Japanese] Thank you.

846
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:47,270
arigato-

847
00:40:48,247 --> 00:40:49,790
Where are your plates?

848
00:40:50,065 --> 00:40:51,649
There, over there.

849
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,293
- There.
- Here?

850
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:55,779
Arigato, arigato!

851
00:40:56,154 --> 00:40:57,947
Gozaimasu.

852
00:40:57,947 --> 00:41:00,200
Arigato go..

853
00:41:01,409 --> 00:41:02,952
Where's the knife?

854
00:41:02,952 --> 00:41:03,912
Here.

855
00:41:04,496 --> 00:41:06,498
- Arigato...
- My hands are dirty, sorry.

856
00:41:07,366 --> 00:41:09,827
Arigato go...

857
00:41:10,919 --> 00:41:11,920
Arigato...

858
00:41:13,046 --> 00:41:15,006
Ah, I know now!

859
00:41:15,632 --> 00:41:16,633
Arigato gulaymas.

860
00:41:17,425 --> 00:41:19,803
What "gulaymas"?
There’s no vegetables!

861
00:41:20,261 --> 00:41:22,098
I don't want to anymore,
you're laughing at me!

862
00:41:23,807 --> 00:41:24,974
No, let's do it this way.

863
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,318
Just copy my lips, okay?

864
00:41:27,477 --> 00:41:28,468
Like this.

865
00:41:28,812 --> 00:41:30,313
Arigato.

866
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:32,857
Arigato.

867
00:41:32,982 --> 00:41:34,692
- Go.
- Go.

868
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:36,069
- Zai.
- Zai.

869
00:41:36,444 --> 00:41:37,904
- Masu.
- Masu.

870
00:41:38,613 --> 00:41:40,407
[In Japanese] Thank you.

871
00:41:40,407 --> 00:41:41,366
There!

872
00:41:41,366 --> 00:41:42,450
Great, you did it!

873
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:44,077
[In Japanese] Thank you.

874
00:41:44,994 --> 00:41:46,749
[In Japanese] Thank you.

875
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,581
gomasu...

876
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:50,649
- Ah, how about this one.
- What?

877
00:41:51,626 --> 00:41:53,128
Say...

878
00:41:54,587 --> 00:41:56,089
[in Japanese] I love you.

879
00:42:01,344 --> 00:42:02,804
[in Japanese] I love you.

880
00:42:04,764 --> 00:42:06,485
I know this.

881
00:42:07,475 --> 00:42:09,394
But why can't I say it?

882
00:42:11,938 --> 00:42:13,106
Aishi..

883
00:42:13,773 --> 00:42:15,024
Aishite.. what?

884
00:42:15,024 --> 00:42:17,861
[in Japanese] I love you.

885
00:42:17,861 --> 00:42:18,925
Aishi-

886
00:42:22,031 --> 00:42:22,782
Never mind!

887
00:42:22,782 --> 00:42:23,950
Let's just cook.

888
00:42:25,629 --> 00:42:26,630
Yeah.

889
00:42:27,412 --> 00:42:28,705
That's hard.

890
00:42:35,378 --> 00:42:37,338
You're smiling silly,
are you going crazy?

891
00:42:38,047 --> 00:42:39,108
No.

892
00:42:39,466 --> 00:42:41,134
I'm just imagining our future.

893
00:42:48,975 --> 00:42:51,186
Jay, what’s happening?

894
00:42:52,437 --> 00:42:53,730
What’s happening?

895
00:42:55,106 --> 00:42:56,441
I'll get a towel, wait a moment.

896
00:42:56,441 --> 00:42:57,358
Don't!

897
00:42:57,358 --> 00:42:58,818
Please, don't leave!

898
00:42:58,818 --> 00:42:59,878
I'm not leaving,

899
00:42:59,903 --> 00:43:01,070
I'm just getting a towel.

900
00:43:01,446 --> 00:43:02,864
I'm scared.

901
00:43:02,864 --> 00:43:04,491
I don't want to hurt you.

902
00:43:04,824 --> 00:43:05,617
Hurt me?

903
00:43:05,617 --> 00:43:06,868
You're the one who's injured.

904
00:43:06,868 --> 00:43:08,328
Yuri please,

905
00:43:08,328 --> 00:43:09,913
call Keifer.

906
00:43:10,288 --> 00:43:12,582
Call Keifer.

907
00:43:12,582 --> 00:43:13,750
Jay, I'm right here.

908
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,627
Why would I call Keifer?

909
00:43:17,462 --> 00:43:19,589
K-Keifer...

910
00:43:31,184 --> 00:43:32,053
Jay...

911
00:43:42,111 --> 00:43:43,196
Are you okay now, Jay?

912
00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:47,611
I'm sorry, Yuri.

913
00:43:48,201 --> 00:43:50,119
I shouldn’t have said
what I said earlier.

914
00:43:50,553 --> 00:43:51,596
It's okay.

915
00:43:52,664 --> 00:43:54,666
But I wish you had explained it to me.

916
00:43:56,876 --> 00:43:58,711
I feel like I don't know
anything about you anymore.

917
00:43:59,879 --> 00:44:01,381
I'm still your friend, right?

918
00:44:05,343 --> 00:44:07,554
I'm scared to tell you.

919
00:44:08,346 --> 00:44:09,288
To tell everyone.

920
00:44:11,057 --> 00:44:11,957
Because

921
00:44:12,725 --> 00:44:14,602
Because, even I don't understand

922
00:44:14,602 --> 00:44:16,187
what's happening to me.

923
00:44:17,939 --> 00:44:19,524
You can tell me, Jay.

924
00:44:20,114 --> 00:44:21,157
Okay?

925
00:44:21,609 --> 00:44:23,153
Who knows, I might be
able to help you.

926
00:44:25,518 --> 00:44:27,019
Yuri...

927
00:44:30,285 --> 00:44:31,286
Uhm...

928
00:44:32,328 --> 00:44:33,830
there's something
wrong with me.

929
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:37,875
Whenever I see blood,

930
00:44:40,295 --> 00:44:42,255
something strange happens to me.

931
00:44:42,714 --> 00:44:44,007
- Enough!
- At first, I thought...

932
00:44:44,007 --> 00:44:45,592
it was just a phobia, but...

933
00:44:45,592 --> 00:44:47,260
over time it became
something else.

934
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,597
I lose consciousness.

935
00:44:51,906 --> 00:44:53,818
But they told me,
I still act as if I'm still present.

936
00:44:55,826 --> 00:44:58,371
I move and start hurting others.

937
00:45:00,023 --> 00:45:02,609
But no matter how hard I try...

938
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:06,576
I don't remember hurting anyone.

939
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,949
I don't know where I got it from.

940
00:45:12,577 --> 00:45:13,571
But...

941
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:16,164
it started

942
00:45:16,164 --> 00:45:18,249
when Aries' father kidnapped us.

943
00:45:19,459 --> 00:45:20,460
Then it happened again when...

944
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,879
when Cyrus and I fought.

945
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:25,798
And the last time was with Ram.

946
00:45:27,008 --> 00:45:29,385
Keifer said that you
teamed up against him.

947
00:45:32,472 --> 00:45:34,724
We only said it, but...

948
00:45:35,141 --> 00:45:37,644
Angelo and Aries know
what really happened.

949
00:45:38,519 --> 00:45:39,520
Keifer knows too?

950
00:45:39,854 --> 00:45:41,230
That's why you
wanted me to call him?

951
00:45:44,567 --> 00:45:46,110
If you don't want me
anymore because

952
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:47,362
of what you learned...

953
00:45:48,363 --> 00:45:50,344
- if you're going to call off-
- No.

954
00:45:52,568 --> 00:45:53,944
Don't say that, Jay.

955
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:57,080
I love you.

956
00:45:58,764 --> 00:46:00,808
And I will still love you,
no matter what.

957
00:46:01,834 --> 00:46:03,127
Remember that.

958
00:46:04,212 --> 00:46:05,254
But what if-

959
00:46:05,254 --> 00:46:06,204
Jay,

960
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:08,383
don't overthink.

961
00:46:09,384 --> 00:46:10,927
We'll figure this out.

962
00:46:14,722 --> 00:46:15,651
Come here.

963
00:46:28,486 --> 00:46:29,419
Jay...

964
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:31,747
can I kiss you again?

965
00:46:39,561 --> 00:46:40,470
Uhm,

966
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,458
I'll just get a new band-aid for you.

967
00:46:42,667 --> 00:46:43,751
I'll come back.

968
00:46:53,469 --> 00:46:55,296
How stupid of you, Jay-jay!

969
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,557
Can I slap you, just once!

970
00:46:58,057 --> 00:46:59,100
What are you doing?

971
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:00,476
It's a mess already!

972
00:47:29,547 --> 00:47:30,715
We're here.

973
00:47:32,919 --> 00:47:34,254
Thanks for today, Jay.

974
00:47:34,593 --> 00:47:35,582
I had fun.

975
00:47:36,012 --> 00:47:37,013
Thank you, too.

976
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:44,579
Uhm, see you tomorrow.

977
00:47:44,604 --> 00:47:45,646
I'll pick you up again.

978
00:47:45,646 --> 00:47:46,981
Oh, don't!

979
00:47:46,981 --> 00:47:48,232
No need.

980
00:47:48,232 --> 00:47:49,484
Ci-N and I will go together.

981
00:47:49,484 --> 00:47:50,777
He still doesn't know yet.

982
00:47:51,363 --> 00:47:52,211
Okay,

983
00:47:52,331 --> 00:47:53,666
maybe next time.

984
00:47:54,155 --> 00:47:55,156
I'll go ahead, Jay.

985
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,367
Take care going home.

986
00:48:11,881 --> 00:48:12,882
Oh!

987
00:48:27,724 --> 00:48:29,057
Why are you here?

988
00:48:31,692 --> 00:48:32,693
Get in.

989
00:48:32,693 --> 00:48:33,528
Huh?

990
00:48:33,528 --> 00:48:34,612
Where are we going?

991
00:49:17,613 --> 00:49:18,990
Where are we?

992
00:49:21,409 --> 00:49:22,785
What did you and Yuri do?

993
00:49:26,706 --> 00:49:27,707
We...

994
00:49:27,707 --> 00:49:29,125
went to church.

995
00:49:30,418 --> 00:49:31,419
What else?

996
00:49:34,297 --> 00:49:36,299
We went grocery shopping, we cooked...

997
00:49:37,365 --> 00:49:38,616
What else?

998
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:42,721
We talked, and we also
looked at pictures.

999
00:49:43,347 --> 00:49:45,182
What else?

1000
00:49:47,268 --> 00:49:48,644
Nothing else.

1001
00:49:48,644 --> 00:49:50,062
What else?

1002
00:49:51,105 --> 00:49:52,565
Nothing else.

1003
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:56,777
Don't lie to me, please.

1004
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:01,532
We...

1005
00:50:05,286 --> 00:50:06,996
he kissed me.

1006
00:50:10,166 --> 00:50:11,584
Keifer...

1007
00:50:12,543 --> 00:50:14,337
Why are you doing this to me, Jay?

1008
00:50:16,088 --> 00:50:17,340
I'm yours.

1009
00:50:18,507 --> 00:50:19,592
You're mine.

1010
00:50:20,343 --> 00:50:22,094
Why are you doing this to me?

1011
00:50:22,678 --> 00:50:23,763
Keifer...

1012
00:50:25,348 --> 00:50:27,600
you know my situation.

1013
00:50:27,892 --> 00:50:30,061
Please don't make this harder for me.

1014
00:50:31,854 --> 00:50:33,022
Do you like Yuri?

1015
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:43,115
Do you like Yuri?

1016
00:50:46,077 --> 00:50:47,078
Yes!

1017
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:54,794
That's why I accepted
the engagement!

1018
00:50:55,495 --> 00:50:56,433
Liar!

1019
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:58,464
I'm not lying.

1020
00:50:58,839 --> 00:51:01,467
Then why did you respond to
my kiss on New Year's Eve?

1021
00:51:03,344 --> 00:51:05,513
Why did you come here with me?

1022
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:07,124
Huh?

1023
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:09,089
What am I to you?!

1024
00:51:10,518 --> 00:51:11,644
What am I to you, Jay?!

1025
00:51:14,397 --> 00:51:15,856
Tell me that night was a lie.

1026
00:51:16,649 --> 00:51:17,611
Say it.

1027
00:51:18,609 --> 00:51:20,820
Tell me that it meant nothing to you!

1028
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:23,906
Tell me and I'll leave you alone!

1029
00:51:23,906 --> 00:51:25,199
Fine!

1030
00:51:26,659 --> 00:51:28,202
Okay, fine!

1031
00:51:29,499 --> 00:51:31,376
I'm not sure about what I feel,

1032
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:34,141
but this is what's right,
it should be Yuri!

1033
00:51:34,166 --> 00:51:36,252
Because of that
fucking engagement?

1034
00:51:37,104 --> 00:51:39,398
That's what's right, Keifer!

1035
00:51:41,215 --> 00:51:43,884
I can't stand thinking
about or seeing Yuri hurt

1036
00:51:43,884 --> 00:51:45,695
for the same reason.

1037
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:48,139
So even if I'm not sure,

1038
00:51:48,556 --> 00:51:51,017
even if I can't get you
out of my head,

1039
00:51:51,017 --> 00:51:53,227
even if I know my heart
has a different answer,

1040
00:51:53,227 --> 00:51:54,979
I'm holding myself back!

1041
00:51:55,271 --> 00:51:57,898
I want to experience being happy.

1042
00:52:00,192 --> 00:52:01,527
Yuri again?

1043
00:52:07,241 --> 00:52:08,281
Why?

1044
00:52:09,452 --> 00:52:10,313
Jay,

1045
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:11,996
do you really think

1046
00:52:11,996 --> 00:52:14,040
I'm the one who always gets chosen?

1047
00:52:15,541 --> 00:52:16,473
Hmm?

1048
00:52:18,669 --> 00:52:20,921
Do you think I was the first
one they cared about

1049
00:52:20,921 --> 00:52:22,590
when we got into that accident?

1050
00:52:23,716 --> 00:52:25,593
They said he should be the priority,

1051
00:52:25,593 --> 00:52:27,094
because he's the weaker one.

1052
00:52:29,096 --> 00:52:30,181
What about me?

1053
00:52:33,601 --> 00:52:37,104
Did any of you ever think that...

1054
00:52:37,897 --> 00:52:39,648
maybe I'm not as strong?

1055
00:52:40,983 --> 00:52:43,027
Me, huh?

1056
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:45,488
Who grew up without a mom.

1057
00:52:46,781 --> 00:52:48,741
Was abandoned by my dad.

1058
00:52:49,325 --> 00:52:52,369
And who raised my siblings
on my fucking own.

1059
00:52:53,579 --> 00:52:55,581
Did any of you ever think

1060
00:52:55,581 --> 00:52:56,749
if I was okay?

1061
00:52:58,959 --> 00:53:00,044
Stop it...

1062
00:53:00,044 --> 00:53:01,045
And now you?

1063
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:05,466
Please don't be like them, Jay.

1064
00:53:08,177 --> 00:53:09,123
Please.

1065
00:53:09,512 --> 00:53:10,763
Not you, too.

1066
00:53:12,264 --> 00:53:13,155
No.

1067
00:53:13,891 --> 00:53:14,850
Not me.

1068
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:17,186
Not me.

1069
00:53:33,828 --> 00:53:35,746
I don't care about anything else.

1070
00:53:37,289 --> 00:53:38,791
Let them choose Yuri.

1071
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:43,462
Just don't let me lose you too.

1072
00:53:46,048 --> 00:53:47,299
I love you, Jay.

1073
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,098
What Keifer said wasn't a question.

1074
00:53:54,932 --> 00:53:56,976
But I already knew the answer.

1075
00:54:02,356 --> 00:54:04,275
I love you too, Keifer.

1076
00:55:28,234 --> 00:55:29,610
Good night.

1077
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:33,364
I love you,
to infinity and beyond.

1078
00:55:33,739 --> 00:55:35,699
I love...

1079
00:55:36,158 --> 00:55:36,909
me!

1080
00:55:36,909 --> 00:55:38,077
- Who's that?
- Huh, where?

1081
00:55:38,077 --> 00:55:40,829
You said I love you, I love you huh!

1082
00:55:41,413 --> 00:55:42,323
He's absent.

1083
00:55:42,348 --> 00:55:44,642
Keifer's not going to school today
if he's the one you're looking for.

1084
00:55:44,667 --> 00:55:46,418
Huh, what do I care about him?

1085
00:55:46,418 --> 00:55:47,544
Did that man come here?

1086
00:55:47,544 --> 00:55:48,921
Keiren! Where's Keiren?

1087
00:55:49,171 --> 00:55:50,214
Where did you go?

1088
00:55:51,382 --> 00:55:52,190
Fuck!

1089
00:55:54,131 --> 00:55:56,095
You lost again to that Hanamitchi kid.

1090
00:55:56,553 --> 00:55:57,972
They're just kids!

1091
00:55:57,972 --> 00:55:59,431
You're spoiling that kid!

1092
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:02,101
That habit will stick with him
for the rest of his life!

1093
00:56:03,477 --> 00:56:05,980
Serina, where the hell are you?!

1094
00:56:06,647 --> 00:56:08,440
That's my money, it's not yours!

1095
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:09,942
Remember this!

1096
00:56:09,942 --> 00:56:11,402
I'm the one who's in charge!

1097
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:13,153
Are you Jasper Jean Mariano?

1098
00:56:13,153 --> 00:56:14,947
The Watson Family is asking for you.

1099
00:56:15,406 --> 00:56:16,407
Are you all complete?

1100
00:56:16,407 --> 00:56:17,408
Sign this.

1101
00:56:18,492 --> 00:56:19,910
I'm not signing anything!

1102
00:56:22,871 --> 00:56:23,580
No!

1103
00:56:23,622 --> 00:56:24,623
Keifer!!!

1104
00:56:24,873 --> 00:56:26,458
Go on, pull that trigger.
