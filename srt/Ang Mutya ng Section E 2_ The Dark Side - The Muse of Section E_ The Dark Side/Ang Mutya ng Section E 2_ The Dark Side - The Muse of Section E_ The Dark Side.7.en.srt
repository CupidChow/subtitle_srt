Why were you guys fighting last time?

2
00:00:49,788 --> 00:00:50,913
We each supported different sides,
so it turned into a fight.

00:00:50,914 --> 00:00:52,039
Shut up, Ci-N!

4
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,916
You'll regret being with Keifer.

00:01:00,548 --> 00:01:03,050
I'll pass by my old school
tomorrow morning.

11

It's near here.

12
00:01:04,552 --> 00:01:05,678
Let go of me.

13
00:01:05,845 --> 00:01:07,097
No one's going to help you!

14
00:01:07,263 --> 00:01:08,623
This one for sure,
will finish you!

You owe me a kiss.

18
00:01:14,354 --> 00:01:15,980
Yes, I'm fucking jealous!

Tell me guys, am I right?

20
00:01:17,315 --> 00:01:18,315
What would you feel?

21
00:01:18,441 --> 00:01:20,150
I'd feel extremely jealous!

22
00:01:20,151 --> 00:01:20,819

23
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,361

get back at Section A.

What those two did to me.

32
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:37,961
Yuri was the first one
who came to me.

33
00:01:38,044 --> 00:01:39,461
And he left me.

34
00:01:39,462 --> 00:01:40,672
Then Keifer showed up.

35
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,631
He laid a hand on me.

36
00:01:42,632 --> 00:01:44,216
If only you knew the truth.

37
00:01:44,217 --> 00:01:46,427
Would you still be so
quick to judge me?

38
00:02:01,256 --> 00:02:03,199
Freya fell in love with Yuri,

39
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:07,016
but he just took what
he wanted and then left her.

40
00:02:07,662 --> 00:02:08,913
As for Keifer,

41
00:02:09,325 --> 00:02:12,662
it was suffocating having him as a
boyfriend, and he was capable of hurting her.

42
00:02:13,286 --> 00:02:15,883
I can't believe he could do that.

43
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:20,962
- How can you compute that?
- You’re all so slow!

somewhere else.

Oh right, the others stayed
behind at the camp.

to guard our stuff.

00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:31,395
I thought the river was going to be
cold, but the pee warmed it up!

184
00:09:31,396 --> 00:09:33,898
Yes! He made the water warm.

185
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:35,942
- I think it’s Eren!
- You're all disgusting!

186
00:09:36,651 --> 00:09:39,863
You all smell so good now! Perfect!

187
00:09:40,322 --> 00:09:42,031
He was drowning a while ago.

188
00:09:42,032 --> 00:09:43,138
He drowned.

189
00:09:49,907 --> 00:09:51,016
Where have you been?

190
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,417
- Oh no!
- Oh shit!

191
00:09:52,442 --> 00:09:54,068
That’s what I’m talking about.

192
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:55,461
Angelo.

193
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:56,471
Where have you been?

194
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,798
- I’m out of here.
- Ci-N, wait!

195
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,133
We were out swimming.

196
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:03,132
- We’ll just eat.
- We just swam.

197
00:10:04,429 --> 00:10:05,388
Please excuse us.

198
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:06,514
We'll talk about that later.

199
00:10:06,515 --> 00:10:08,433
For now, we need to talk
about something else.

200
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:10,434
Why? What happened?

201
00:10:10,435 --> 00:10:12,353
Angelo, excuse me. I have to go.

202
00:10:12,354 --> 00:10:13,361
Excuse me.

203
00:10:14,749 --> 00:10:16,253
Cyrus' parents called me.

204
00:10:16,358 --> 00:10:18,532
They told me Cyrus and
his friends are in the hospital.

205
00:10:18,557 --> 00:10:19,891
Do you know anything about that?

206
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:25,367
- It’s just that.
- Damn it!

207
00:10:25,686 --> 00:10:26,853
What the hell happened?

208
00:10:29,964 --> 00:10:30,964
Jay-jay.

209
00:10:32,255 --> 00:10:34,091
What? Did your craziness act up again?

210
00:10:34,507 --> 00:10:35,507
Huh?

211
00:10:35,851 --> 00:10:36,851
I'm not crazy.

212
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,522
What’s happening to you, then?

213
00:10:38,547 --> 00:10:40,867
You're changing into someone,
and you start hurting people.

214
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,944
You don't even listen to anyone anymore.

215
00:10:46,388 --> 00:10:47,305
I don't know.

216
00:10:47,393 --> 00:10:48,560
Then you are crazy!

217
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,100
Enough!

218
00:10:51,671 --> 00:10:52,755
Answer me.

219
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,671
Does that have anything to do with you?

220
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:56,855
I did it.

221
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,345
It was me, not Jay-jay.

222
00:11:03,377 --> 00:11:04,462
Excuse me?

223
00:11:06,172 --> 00:11:08,007
Tell me exactly what happened.

224
00:11:09,915 --> 00:11:12,918
Hey! If you have nothing
good to say, just leave!

225
00:11:17,082 --> 00:11:18,291
When we arrived,

226
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,460
they were already hurting Jay-jay.

227
00:11:24,923 --> 00:11:26,383
So I did what I had to do.

228
00:11:27,175 --> 00:11:28,175
What?

229
00:11:28,885 --> 00:11:30,303
Why did Cyrus hurt you?

230
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:34,057
He said...

231
00:11:35,434 --> 00:11:37,102
he wanted to get even.

232
00:11:45,777 --> 00:11:47,154
Thanks for clarifying.

233
00:11:50,323 --> 00:11:52,117
You two can go back
to your camp now.

234
00:12:20,353 --> 00:12:21,353
Spill it.

235
00:12:21,772 --> 00:12:22,772
Huh?

236
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:24,940
Spit it out.

237
00:12:25,567 --> 00:12:26,568
What do you mean?

238
00:12:28,153 --> 00:12:30,864
I know you have
something to say, so…

239
00:12:31,573 --> 00:12:32,573
tell me.

240
00:12:35,619 --> 00:12:37,788
I have a lot of questions to ask you.

241
00:12:38,038 --> 00:12:39,160
So...

242
00:12:39,185 --> 00:12:41,395
promise me you'll answer everything.

243
00:12:42,501 --> 00:12:45,378
I can't promise, but for you

244
00:12:46,237 --> 00:12:47,446
I'll try my best.

245
00:12:51,718 --> 00:12:53,887
Did you really hurt Freya?

246
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,310
I did.

247
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,564
Why?

248
00:13:04,856 --> 00:13:06,191
Why did you do that?

249
00:13:09,236 --> 00:13:12,656
Freya was my first in everything.

250
00:13:14,115 --> 00:13:15,115
But,

251
00:13:15,867 --> 00:13:16,993
I wasn't hers.

252
00:13:20,747 --> 00:13:22,332
I didn't mean to hurt her.

253
00:13:24,543 --> 00:13:25,627
It's just that,

254
00:13:26,753 --> 00:13:29,923
when I found out that
she still liked Yuri.

255
00:13:31,341 --> 00:13:32,467
I got jealous,

256
00:13:33,927 --> 00:13:36,388
and I couldn’t control myself.

257
00:13:37,556 --> 00:13:39,140
But she still got hurt.

258
00:13:39,683 --> 00:13:41,601
That's not a valid reason, Keifer.

259
00:13:46,106 --> 00:13:47,106
I don't know.

260
00:13:48,024 --> 00:13:49,609
Maybe I'm just like my father.

261
00:13:57,117 --> 00:13:58,243
No.

262
00:13:59,536 --> 00:14:00,829
You're not like your father.

263
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,877
You're different, Keifer.

264
00:14:15,719 --> 00:14:16,719
Jay.

265
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,556
I'm sorry.

266
00:14:20,557 --> 00:14:22,267
Believe me, please.

267
00:14:23,643 --> 00:14:24,977
It never happened again,

268
00:14:24,978 --> 00:14:27,480
and I promise it won't ever happen again.

269
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:41,411
Why did you split up?

270
00:14:44,372 --> 00:14:45,582
Because of Aries.

271
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:47,834
Aries?

272
00:14:49,794 --> 00:14:51,796
Remember Mykel Mitchell?

273
00:14:54,174 --> 00:14:55,174
Well,

274
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:58,552
he showed me a photo of them kissing

275
00:14:58,553 --> 00:15:00,512
and even told me they were together,

276
00:15:00,513 --> 00:15:01,513
so...

277
00:15:02,641 --> 00:15:03,934
What did you do?

278
00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:07,269
Nothing.

279
00:15:07,729 --> 00:15:08,729
Nothing.

280
00:15:09,981 --> 00:15:10,982
I just let her go.

281
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:19,574
Still any questions?

282
00:15:23,328 --> 00:15:25,413
According to Freya,

283
00:15:27,082 --> 00:15:30,543
Yuri left once he got
what he wanted.

284
00:15:30,794 --> 00:15:31,920
Is that true?

285
00:15:33,421 --> 00:15:34,421
I don't know.

286
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:36,466
I can't speak for Yuri.

287
00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:41,051
Do you have other questions?

288
00:15:44,058 --> 00:15:45,058
No more.

289
00:15:49,104 --> 00:15:51,731
Jay, in the future,

290
00:15:53,566 --> 00:15:55,443
just ask me. Okay?

291
00:15:56,695 --> 00:15:59,864
And I will try my best to
give you the answers.

292
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,271
I don't like feeling cramped!

293
00:16:31,771 --> 00:16:33,914
I don't like it when it's hot!

294
00:16:36,818 --> 00:16:39,362
Jay, you dumbass.
You really went all out.

295
00:16:39,821 --> 00:16:41,239
You drank too much!

296
00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:44,033
Huh?

297
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:45,744
Why am I tied up?

298
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,913
What the fuck?!

299
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,086
Keifer! Yuri!

300
00:16:57,297 --> 00:17:00,091
You animals! Why don't you untie me!

301
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:01,759
Good morning.

302
00:17:02,135 --> 00:17:03,970
Go back to sleep, it's 3AM.

303
00:17:04,269 --> 00:17:06,605
That's your last, Jay.
Never drink again.

304
00:17:12,187 --> 00:17:13,967
Holy cow!

305
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:15,742
What did I do last night?

306
00:17:15,815 --> 00:17:17,275
Nice one, Barracuda.

307
00:17:19,716 --> 00:17:21,071
Shit!

308
00:17:21,071 --> 00:17:22,071
Barracuda?

309
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:26,409
Are you guys having a great time?

- I’m eating marshmallows.

Shit. It's so hot.

313
00:17:34,959 --> 00:17:35,959
What is that?

314
00:17:35,984 --> 00:17:38,111
- What the fuck?
- Felix!

Hey, Jay-jay!

316
00:17:40,381 --> 00:17:41,633
Look at Jay-jay.

317
00:17:42,801 --> 00:17:44,052
Look at Jay-jay.

318
00:17:45,637 --> 00:17:47,722
She's about to start.

319
00:17:51,601 --> 00:17:54,561
- Jay.
- Karate master.

320
00:17:54,562 --> 00:17:55,772
Jay, are you okay?

321
00:17:56,356 --> 00:17:57,356
What's that?

322
00:17:58,233 --> 00:18:00,026
- What are you doing?
- Open your eyes, Jay!

323
00:18:06,574 --> 00:18:08,325
Let the ritual begin.

That's enough, Jay.

Wait a minute.

- Wait, Jay.
- I’m taking it off, just wait.

Watch your head.

So, who's Barracuda?

360

It's a character from a

You stink.

This guy right here!

Jay, what's up with you?

552
00:29:30,007 --> 00:29:31,925
Nothing. It was too late
when they found out.

553
00:29:31,926 --> 00:29:35,011
The play was finished when
I threw up in the bathroom.

554
00:29:35,012 --> 00:29:35,513
Yuck!

555
00:29:35,514 --> 00:29:37,055
They even started rumors
about me being pregnant.

556
00:29:37,056 --> 00:29:38,241
Yuck!

557
00:29:38,641 --> 00:29:39,641
Wow.

558
00:29:39,934 --> 00:29:42,019
Laughing too loud there, huh?

559
00:29:42,513 --> 00:29:43,906
They thought you were pregnant.

560
00:29:44,063 --> 00:29:45,397
Tell me some updates.

561
00:29:46,023 --> 00:29:47,399
How is your new condo?

562
00:29:50,569 --> 00:29:52,905
The cleaner at my
condo has a kind niece.

563
00:29:53,656 --> 00:29:54,782
Her name's Veronica.

564
00:29:55,866 --> 00:29:59,160
Why are you telling me this?
You like her, don't you?

565
00:29:59,161 --> 00:30:00,745
Hey! No!

566
00:30:00,746 --> 00:30:02,330
She's my friend.
Don't be like that, Jay.

567
00:30:02,331 --> 00:30:03,207
You'll start rumors.

568
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:04,248
Rakki might hear about it!

569
00:30:08,379 --> 00:30:09,379
Ci.

570
00:30:10,673 --> 00:30:14,051
Remember what you told me before?

571
00:30:15,386 --> 00:30:16,320
What?

572
00:30:16,345 --> 00:30:17,638
When...

573
00:30:18,097 --> 00:30:20,807
when you told me

574
00:30:20,808 --> 00:30:23,768
that I need to forgive you
even if you guys did me dirty.

575
00:30:23,769 --> 00:30:24,853
What was that about?

576
00:30:24,854 --> 00:30:25,855
Tell me.

577
00:30:26,657 --> 00:30:27,754
Ma'am!

578
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:29,148
Why are we not included in the activites?

579
00:30:29,149 --> 00:30:31,401
Have mercy on us,
we have nothing to do.

580
00:30:31,402 --> 00:30:33,236
Look at Jay-jay, ma'am.
She has nothing to eat.

581
00:30:33,237 --> 00:30:34,989
You're actually asking that?

582
00:30:35,114 --> 00:30:35,823
Please, ma'am.

583
00:30:35,824 --> 00:30:39,034
Even if it's just hide and seek, please!

584
00:30:40,202 --> 00:30:43,079
- It's because you're too rowdy!
- We have nothing to do.

585
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,123
The blindfold game looks fun.
- No, it doesn’t.

586
00:30:45,124 --> 00:30:46,750
Come on. Let them be.

587
00:30:47,042 --> 00:30:48,252
So unfair.

588
00:30:48,544 --> 00:30:50,230
- I can't deal with these Section E kids.
- They're troublemakers.

589
00:30:50,254 --> 00:30:52,047
You're so judgmental, ma'am.

590
00:30:52,256 --> 00:30:55,133
- Let them be.
- We won't come back here again!

591
00:30:55,134 --> 00:30:58,219
We're just happy.
It's more fun in Section E.

592
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,680
Hey! About the thing
I was asking you about.

593
00:31:00,681 --> 00:31:01,681
Answer it.

594
00:31:06,136 --> 00:31:07,954
I know what we should play!

595
00:31:08,277 --> 00:31:09,612
Let's play truth or dare!

596
00:31:10,232 --> 00:31:13,319
Guys! Jay-jay said we
should play truth or dare!

597
00:31:14,445 --> 00:31:15,445
I said that?

598
00:31:18,699 --> 00:31:20,367
What are you guys hiding from me?

599
00:31:21,911 --> 00:31:23,621
What do you mean truth or dare?

600
00:31:23,787 --> 00:31:24,872
I want to join!

601
00:31:31,045 --> 00:31:32,086
Your turn!

602
00:31:32,087 --> 00:31:40,087
[Section E singing Kembot]

603
00:31:51,523 --> 00:31:52,942
- Cheers!
- Your turn!

604
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,823
I hope you guys are always happy.

605
00:31:58,364 --> 00:32:00,491
Don't fight because of me.

606
00:32:01,367 --> 00:32:02,993
Cheers, bro!

607
00:32:08,666 --> 00:32:10,084
Guys, wait.

608
00:32:10,376 --> 00:32:12,670
Jay-jay hasn't played yet.

609
00:32:14,964 --> 00:32:15,923
Am I the only one, huh?

610
00:32:15,923 --> 00:32:16,674
Oh, Jay.

611
00:32:16,675 --> 00:32:17,883
Truth or dare?

612
00:32:19,635 --> 00:32:22,011
- Or!
- Lame.

613
00:32:22,012 --> 00:32:22,905
Truth.

614
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:24,097
I go with truth!

615
00:32:24,098 --> 00:32:26,558
Truth. Okay,
I will ask the question.

616
00:32:28,602 --> 00:32:30,354
If there was no Keifer,

617
00:32:34,024 --> 00:32:35,192
do I have a chance with you?

618
00:32:37,486 --> 00:32:38,696
What did David say?

619
00:32:40,406 --> 00:32:42,074
That's different, bro.

620
00:32:42,533 --> 00:32:43,866
Don't you have a girlfriend?

621
00:32:43,867 --> 00:32:45,451
I'm kidding. It's a joke!

622
00:32:45,452 --> 00:32:49,081
- Jay-jay looks giddy!
- You're stupid!

623
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,084
It’s a joke!

624
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,919
What kind of joke was that?

625
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,212
You're an idiot, David.

626
00:32:55,754 --> 00:32:58,757
You really are an asshole,
just like them!

627
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:02,330
Wait, what's the real
meaning of 'ulupong', anyways?

628
00:33:04,388 --> 00:33:05,388
Why are you laughing?

629
00:33:05,556 --> 00:33:06,598
I just want to.

630
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:09,184
It means...

631
00:33:09,351 --> 00:33:10,477
snake.

632
00:33:12,354 --> 00:33:13,313
Snake?

633
00:33:13,314 --> 00:33:14,356
But,

634
00:33:15,357 --> 00:33:16,357
But,

635
00:33:17,526 --> 00:33:20,696
we use it to call
some people, uhm...

636
00:33:21,405 --> 00:33:23,240
you know, assholes.

637
00:33:23,782 --> 00:33:25,200
Wait, what?

638
00:33:25,284 --> 00:33:27,327
You've been calling
me King of Assholes?

639
00:33:29,496 --> 00:33:32,081
- Wait, let me get this straight.
- Asshole! Asshole!

640
00:33:32,082 --> 00:33:35,793
You've been calling me
the King of Assholes?

641
00:33:35,794 --> 00:33:39,048
Asshole!

642
00:33:40,257 --> 00:33:42,892
I'm just kidding!

643
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,992
Joke!

644
00:33:45,721 --> 00:33:47,848
Here, I'll ask the question.

645
00:33:49,725 --> 00:33:51,185
The scar on your back,

646
00:33:51,727 --> 00:33:52,727
where did you get it?

647
00:33:57,232 --> 00:33:58,859
This is only a game.

648
00:33:59,568 --> 00:34:00,568
What scar?

649
00:34:11,413 --> 00:34:12,873
Jay, you don't have to answer.

650
00:34:20,589 --> 00:34:23,175
When I was a child,

651
00:34:24,093 --> 00:34:26,053
I woke up in a hospital bed.

652
00:34:28,592 --> 00:34:31,345
I don't know what...

653
00:34:32,034 --> 00:34:35,495
No, I don't know what
really happened to me.

654
00:34:36,605 --> 00:34:37,773
I don't remember.

655
00:34:41,276 --> 00:34:44,321
But I had many
bruises on my body.

656
00:34:44,947 --> 00:34:46,532
Including...

657
00:34:47,491 --> 00:34:49,159
the scar that you saw.

658
00:34:52,121 --> 00:34:54,289
They let me live with my grandmother.

659
00:34:55,624 --> 00:34:58,877
Then we realized,

660
00:35:00,546 --> 00:35:04,591
my mom's last husband
was abusing me.

661
00:35:09,388 --> 00:35:10,847
Also...

662
00:35:10,848 --> 00:35:12,266
the first husband.

663
00:35:14,726 --> 00:35:16,478
But no matter how hard I try,

664
00:35:18,981 --> 00:35:20,399
I don't remember.

665
00:35:21,066 --> 00:35:22,066
What's that?

666
00:35:22,776 --> 00:35:24,903
Episodic amnesia?

667
00:35:28,282 --> 00:35:29,366
I don't know.

668
00:35:30,075 --> 00:35:32,119
Were you able to get
a check up again?

669
00:35:38,558 --> 00:35:41,383
That's enough.
Let's go back to playing.

670
00:35:41,623 --> 00:35:43,004
Yes! Let's play.

671
00:35:43,005 --> 00:35:44,673
Happy thoughts.

672
00:35:47,259 --> 00:35:48,719
Truth or dare, right?

673
00:35:49,303 --> 00:35:51,179
- Yes.
- Whose turn is it?

674
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,556
- Throat or Dare.
- Throat!

675
00:35:53,612 --> 00:35:55,178
How about you Edrix?

676
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,161
Come on.

677
00:35:57,192 --> 00:35:59,585
Denzel should go first.

678
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,988
You're the one we're asking,
why should I answer?

679
00:36:02,983 --> 00:36:05,277
Continue the game!
I have to get even!

680
00:36:05,444 --> 00:36:07,278
You haven't asked Yuri yet.

681
00:36:07,279 --> 00:36:08,155
Why is it me again?

682
00:36:08,156 --> 00:36:09,198
Yuri.

683
00:36:09,448 --> 00:36:10,615
Okay, truth.

684
00:36:10,616 --> 00:36:12,491
I will be the one to ask.

685
00:36:12,492 --> 00:36:13,993
I'm actually curious about this one.

686
00:36:13,994 --> 00:36:14,994
Okay.

687
00:36:16,121 --> 00:36:17,998
When did you start liking Jay-jay?

688
00:36:20,834 --> 00:36:22,252
Good question.

689
00:36:24,249 --> 00:36:28,045
I don't know. Maybe during her
first few weeks in Section E.

690
00:36:29,009 --> 00:36:31,970
- There you go!
- I told you so.

691
00:36:31,995 --> 00:36:32,995
I knew it.

692
00:36:34,412 --> 00:36:35,496
How about this, Yuri.

693
00:36:36,325 --> 00:36:39,995
When do you plan on telling us
about your engagement with Jay-jay?

694
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,438
Huh?!

695
00:36:42,439 --> 00:36:45,358
- Engagement?
- You guys are engaged?

696
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:46,235
What are you talking about?

697
00:36:46,236 --> 00:36:48,320
I’ve heard you guys talk
about it multiple times.

698
00:36:50,697 --> 00:36:52,823
Wait! Can you guys calm down.

699
00:36:52,824 --> 00:36:54,243
- That's so sudden!
- What?

700
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:56,828
Are you not going
to say anything, Keifer?

701
00:36:57,496 --> 00:37:01,832
That engagement is nothing but an agreement
between Jay-jay and Yuri's family.

702
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:02,876
That's all.

703
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,223
Of course you know!

704
00:37:04,461 --> 00:37:05,629
How could you not?

705
00:37:06,004 --> 00:37:07,546
But you're still making
things hard for Jay.

706
00:37:07,547 --> 00:37:09,382
Don't you fucking dare talk to me

707
00:37:09,383 --> 00:37:11,759
when you're working with
Percy behind our backs.

708
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,886
What? Percy?

709
00:37:13,685 --> 00:37:15,228
Percy?

710
00:37:17,391 --> 00:37:19,031
We'll get in trouble
when Felix finds out.

711
00:37:19,476 --> 00:37:20,686
Felix might wake up.

712
00:37:24,147 --> 00:37:25,732
Well, fuck! What else
do we not know?

713
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,150
Fuck you!
Why don't you answer that?

714
00:37:28,151 --> 00:37:30,319
Do you think we don't know
you started gambling again?

715
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,320
Hey.

716
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:32,823
What?

717
00:37:32,823 --> 00:37:33,823
Let's just play.

718
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:34,992
Asshole!

719
00:37:34,992 --> 00:37:35,659
What?

720
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,827
What? Go ahead!

721
00:37:37,452 --> 00:37:39,203
You too, you asshole! Go!

722
00:37:39,204 --> 00:37:40,122
Asshole!

723
00:37:40,123 --> 00:37:41,873
The fuck do you care?

724
00:37:45,127 --> 00:37:47,421
I just said you guys should not fight.

725
00:37:48,547 --> 00:37:50,090
How did it come to this?

726
00:37:52,092 --> 00:37:53,927
You have no idea,
you piece of shit!

727
00:37:54,594 --> 00:37:55,594
You know what?

728
00:37:55,721 --> 00:37:57,139
This is all your fault!

729
00:37:57,347 --> 00:38:00,134
You should have left our section
when you had the chance.

730
00:38:01,922 --> 00:38:02,922
Because of you,

731
00:38:03,413 --> 00:38:04,831
our section was ruined!

732
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:07,847
He's right.

733
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:09,787
It is my fault.

734
00:38:10,652 --> 00:38:12,446
Why? It's true, right?!

735
00:38:16,902 --> 00:38:19,279
Don't you ever talk
to Jay-jay like that!

736
00:38:19,536 --> 00:38:22,122
And none of you can
talk to Jay-jay like that!

737
00:38:26,376 --> 00:38:27,376
What?

738
00:38:27,753 --> 00:38:29,378
Why do you care
about me gambling?

739
00:38:29,379 --> 00:38:31,298
- Drew, enough!
- Drew.

740
00:38:31,798 --> 00:38:32,716
Eren, hey!

741
00:38:32,775 --> 00:38:33,775
Shit!

742
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,677
Fuck all of you!

743
00:38:36,053 --> 00:38:37,928
Enough! That's enough!

744
00:38:37,929 --> 00:38:39,305
Damn it!

745
00:38:39,306 --> 00:38:41,683
Enough!

746
00:38:44,478 --> 00:38:46,145
Stop it!

747
00:38:46,146 --> 00:38:47,986
- You're an asshole!
- Eren, shut up.

748
00:38:48,523 --> 00:38:50,441
- Eren, stop!
- You can’t beat me, asshole!

749
00:38:50,442 --> 00:38:51,610
Hey, stop it already.

750
00:38:53,862 --> 00:38:54,862
That’s enough!

751
00:38:55,655 --> 00:38:56,655
Fucking assholes!

752
00:38:58,082 --> 00:38:59,208
Enough!

753
00:39:03,497 --> 00:39:04,497
Enough!

754
00:39:07,876 --> 00:39:10,754
Section E!

755
00:39:15,509 --> 00:39:16,551
Section E!

756
00:39:22,015 --> 00:39:23,015
Stop!

757
00:39:23,907 --> 00:39:25,242
What's going on with you?

758
00:39:26,728 --> 00:39:27,979
I was right about you guys.

759
00:40:14,151 --> 00:40:15,694
Ci.

760
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:33,318
Josh is right.

761
00:40:34,029 --> 00:40:37,824
Why didn't I leave
when I had the chance?

762
00:40:38,696 --> 00:40:40,531
Now, I feel lost.

763
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,573
I don't know the way back.

764
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:48,649
You look so kind when you are sleep.

765
00:41:53,291 --> 00:41:56,127
Is this really how you love, Keifer?

766
00:42:01,299 --> 00:42:04,135
Because this is the first time
I’ve experienced this.

767
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,824
It doesn't matter if I feel lost.

768
00:42:27,742 --> 00:42:30,453
I just don't want to lose you again.

769
00:42:44,718 --> 00:42:46,052
If you're gonna kiss me,

770
00:42:47,334 --> 00:42:48,398
do it now.

771
00:42:50,473 --> 00:42:51,683
You jerk.

772
00:42:52,767 --> 00:42:54,144
Why are you even here?

773
00:42:56,479 --> 00:42:57,480
Sleeping.

774
00:42:58,148 --> 00:42:59,232
Why here?

775
00:43:03,903 --> 00:43:05,280
'Cause I miss you.

776
00:43:08,992 --> 00:43:10,368
I missed you too.

777
00:43:20,128 --> 00:43:21,128
Please.

778
00:43:21,921 --> 00:43:23,381
Can I kiss you?

779
00:44:23,592 --> 00:44:25,801
Yuri is missing!

780
00:44:25,902 --> 00:44:28,153
- Yuri!
- Hey, redhead!

781
00:44:28,154 --> 00:44:29,154
Huh?

782
00:44:29,906 --> 00:44:30,906
Huh?

783
00:44:31,658 --> 00:44:32,425
Wait.

784
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:33,243
I'll go and find him.

785
00:44:33,244 --> 00:44:34,452
I'll go with you.

786
00:44:34,744 --> 00:44:35,786
No. Just stay here.

787
00:44:35,787 --> 00:44:36,996
No. I'll come with you.

788
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:41,751
Where is Yuri?

789
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:43,395
What?

790
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,713
Where did Yuri go?

791
00:44:46,756 --> 00:44:49,050
What do you need?
Does Aries know you're here?

792
00:44:50,135 --> 00:44:51,594
It's Yuri.

793
00:44:52,387 --> 00:44:53,762
I want to talk to you.

794
00:44:53,763 --> 00:44:54,763
About what?

795
00:44:55,515 --> 00:44:57,809
Can't it wait until
we're back at school?

796
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:03,605
You have nothing to say.
I'll go now, Ella.

797
00:45:03,606 --> 00:45:04,858
Yuri, please.

798
00:45:10,447 --> 00:45:12,240
Do you really love Jay-jay?

799
00:45:12,699 --> 00:45:14,451
You called me here to ask me that?

800
00:45:14,951 --> 00:45:15,951
What did they say?

801
00:45:19,289 --> 00:45:20,289
Please.

802
00:45:20,915 --> 00:45:22,041
Just answer it.

803
00:45:24,627 --> 00:45:25,627
Yes.

804
00:45:29,299 --> 00:45:30,467
Okay? I'll go ahead.

805
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:33,510
Please, Yuri.

806
00:45:33,803 --> 00:45:34,803
I'm sorry.

807
00:45:36,681 --> 00:45:37,681
I'm sorry.

808
00:45:38,391 --> 00:45:39,391
I lied.

809
00:45:40,143 --> 00:45:41,770
She said, "I'm sorry, I lied."

810
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:45,690
Your mom talked to me.

811
00:45:47,108 --> 00:45:48,651
She told me to
stay away from you.

812
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:51,946
And that she won't
allow us to date.

813
00:45:53,406 --> 00:45:55,366
I don't understand you.
What do you mean?

814
00:45:56,785 --> 00:45:57,785
She said,

815
00:45:59,496 --> 00:46:01,122
I'm not right for you.

816
00:46:02,665 --> 00:46:04,167
She blackmailed me, Yuri.

817
00:46:05,752 --> 00:46:06,752
She said,

818
00:46:08,546 --> 00:46:10,256
if I don't stay away from you,

819
00:46:12,592 --> 00:46:15,595
my family won’t be able
to enter Korea anymore.

820
00:46:16,721 --> 00:46:18,961
Ella, what are you talking about?
I don't understand you.

821
00:46:19,182 --> 00:46:22,268
That you're the one I loved,
and not Keifer!

822
00:46:30,235 --> 00:46:31,903
Why are you saying this now?

823
00:46:35,782 --> 00:46:37,033
Because I was scared.

824
00:46:40,078 --> 00:46:42,162
You know that my family
was struggling, right?

825
00:46:42,163 --> 00:46:43,581
So you chose to betray me?

826
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,669
Ella, I don't believe you anymore.

827
00:46:48,628 --> 00:46:49,628
Yuri,

828
00:46:49,712 --> 00:46:51,047
it's the truth.

829
00:46:52,173 --> 00:46:53,967
And Keifer knows it.

830
00:46:56,761 --> 00:46:58,263
That I chose him,

831
00:46:58,638 --> 00:47:00,807
because I couldn't choose you.

832
00:47:04,018 --> 00:47:05,144
That's enough.

833
00:47:07,272 --> 00:47:09,232
I couldn't hide it from you anymore,

834
00:47:10,316 --> 00:47:12,109
so I left Section E.

835
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:13,820
Why didn't you fight for me?

836
00:47:14,571 --> 00:47:15,571
Huh?

837
00:47:20,451 --> 00:47:21,619
I'm sorry.

838
00:47:21,977 --> 00:47:23,737
Will your 'sorry' even
change anything, Ella?

839
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,338
Ella Dianne.

840
00:47:38,344 --> 00:47:39,554
- Aries.
- Aries, stop.

841
00:47:40,138 --> 00:47:41,264
Aries, stop!

842
00:47:43,224 --> 00:47:44,601
Aries, stop.

843
00:47:46,728 --> 00:47:49,522
Didn't you beg me, huh?!

844
00:47:50,106 --> 00:47:52,442
You asked me to help
you get away from Keifer,

845
00:47:52,692 --> 00:47:54,569
and in return you'll
forget about Yuri.

846
00:47:55,153 --> 00:47:56,153
Right?

847
00:47:57,739 --> 00:47:59,032
I'm sorry, Aries.

848
00:47:59,699 --> 00:48:01,659
He needs to know the truth.

849
00:48:01,951 --> 00:48:03,036
For what?

850
00:48:03,909 --> 00:48:04,912
Why?

851
00:48:04,996 --> 00:48:07,123
Do you still have feelings for Yuri?

852
00:48:07,457 --> 00:48:08,541
It's not like that.

853
00:48:09,709 --> 00:48:11,377
I'm sorry, Aries.

854
00:48:15,715 --> 00:48:16,715
Sorry.

855
00:48:27,685 --> 00:48:28,685
Keifer.

856
00:48:30,688 --> 00:48:31,688
You knew about this?

857
00:48:36,527 --> 00:48:39,113
You knew about this and
didn't care enough to tell me?

858
00:48:40,406 --> 00:48:41,406
For what?

859
00:48:41,699 --> 00:48:42,742
What do you mean for what?

860
00:48:43,326 --> 00:48:44,744
Why should I tell you?

861
00:48:46,204 --> 00:48:47,413
What did my mom say?

862
00:48:50,833 --> 00:48:52,313
That I should take
Ella away from you.

863
00:48:52,835 --> 00:48:53,835
That's all.

864
00:48:55,296 --> 00:48:56,296
Fuck.

865
00:49:04,681 --> 00:49:06,349
Aries.

866
00:49:12,021 --> 00:49:13,021
Keifer,

867
00:49:13,189 --> 00:49:14,816
bring Aries to the office, okay?

868
00:49:15,316 --> 00:49:16,316
Carry him.

869
00:49:17,527 --> 00:49:18,903
Yuri!

870
00:49:31,374 --> 00:49:32,917
Yuri!

871
00:49:56,899 --> 00:49:58,443
Yuri!

872
00:50:03,072 --> 00:50:04,949
Yuri!

873
00:50:08,828 --> 00:50:10,621
Yuri!

874
00:50:18,796 --> 00:50:19,881
Yuri!

875
00:50:23,718 --> 00:50:24,718
Yuri!

876
00:50:25,571 --> 00:50:27,054
What happened to you?

877
00:50:27,055 --> 00:50:28,598
I’m sorry, Jay. I tripped.

878
00:50:37,315 --> 00:50:38,357
Hey!

879
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:40,777
You're burning up!

880
00:50:43,404 --> 00:50:44,715
Just hang in there
a bit longer, okay?

881
00:50:44,739 --> 00:50:46,099
We'll be back at camp soon enough.

882
00:50:47,033 --> 00:50:48,076
Jesus Christ.

883
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:50,470
Jay.

884
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,621
Why?

885
00:50:53,206 --> 00:50:54,665
I'll fight for you.

886
00:50:57,126 --> 00:50:59,921
Never again will I allow myself
to lose the one I love.

887
00:51:08,054 --> 00:51:09,472
Yuri,

888
00:51:10,223 --> 00:51:11,307
I'm sorry.

889
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:15,448
If only I can teach my heart,
I would've done it a long time ago.

890
00:51:16,104 --> 00:51:17,277
But no.

891
00:51:17,855 --> 00:51:19,375
This is not as easy as a math problem.

892
00:51:21,915 --> 00:51:23,775
Get some rest, okay?

893
00:51:30,535 --> 00:51:31,702
Did you know,

894
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:34,747
my mom doesn't like
it when I get sick.

895
00:51:36,207 --> 00:51:37,750
I think it's applicable to all moms.

896
00:51:38,459 --> 00:51:41,003
Would every mother do
what she did, too?

897
00:51:45,633 --> 00:51:47,885
Hanamitchi is a well-known
family in Japan.

898
00:51:49,137 --> 00:51:50,680
They have many businesses there.

899
00:51:52,598 --> 00:51:54,267
And because of their reputation,

900
00:51:54,934 --> 00:51:56,894
they didn't accept my mom.

901
00:51:58,104 --> 00:52:00,356
Especially when they
found out she's half Pinoy.

902
00:52:00,523 --> 00:52:02,316
And she didn't come
from a prominent family.

903
00:52:06,195 --> 00:52:07,905
It was so painful for her.

904
00:52:11,909 --> 00:52:14,162
They were watching her every move.

905
00:52:15,163 --> 00:52:17,723
Especially when they found out
that she's struggling to conceive.

906
00:52:19,876 --> 00:52:21,502
That's why, when she had me,

907
00:52:22,712 --> 00:52:24,755
she was very protective of me.

908
00:52:25,506 --> 00:52:28,134
She would not go out just
to make sure I'm okay.

909
00:52:32,929 --> 00:52:34,722
Yoichi is adopted.

910
00:52:35,183 --> 00:52:36,183
Huh?

911
00:52:37,059 --> 00:52:39,770
She was adopted to fill
the void in our family.

912
00:52:44,358 --> 00:52:46,234
Our family is a mess, huh?

913
00:52:46,235 --> 00:52:47,278
It's too complicated.

914
00:52:49,155 --> 00:52:50,990
My family is complicated, too.

915
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:52,912
Is this a contest?

916
00:53:03,758 --> 00:53:04,758
Jay.

917
00:53:07,186 --> 00:53:08,799
I still owe you.

918
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:17,299
It wasn't my grandfather who
set up the engagement.

919
00:53:21,504 --> 00:53:23,756
Angelo already declined the offer.

920
00:53:25,483 --> 00:53:28,069
My grandfather does not
believe in second chances,

921
00:53:28,402 --> 00:53:30,321
so the offer fell through.

922
00:53:33,908 --> 00:53:36,410
But when I learned that
Fer Corp. was going bankrupt,

923
00:53:37,703 --> 00:53:39,705
I myself presented the offer to Angelo.

924
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:41,791
What-

925
00:53:41,792 --> 00:53:43,626
I was the one who set it up, Jay.

926
00:53:47,698 --> 00:53:49,946
I was the one who
arranged our engagement.

927
00:53:54,019 --> 00:53:55,396
In exchange,

928
00:53:56,113 --> 00:53:58,115
we kept Angelo's company afloat.

929
00:54:00,601 --> 00:54:03,020
They had no choice but to accept.

930
00:54:03,938 --> 00:54:05,690
Even if they did not want to.

931
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:08,205
He needed to.

932
00:54:12,238 --> 00:54:15,324
You told me you couldn't
stop the engagement.

933
00:54:15,866 --> 00:54:16,951
I lied.

934
00:54:17,368 --> 00:54:18,703
I'm sorry, Jay.

935
00:54:19,319 --> 00:54:20,736
Why did you do it?

936
00:54:20,871 --> 00:54:22,164
Because I love you, Jay.

937
00:54:24,083 --> 00:54:26,127
I can't afford losing to Keifer again.

938
00:54:28,203 --> 00:54:29,746
I'll save you from him.

939
00:54:31,453 --> 00:54:32,955
What are you saying?

940
00:54:34,524 --> 00:54:35,633
No.

941
00:54:36,345 --> 00:54:38,014
That's not love.

942
00:54:39,056 --> 00:54:40,516
Don't say that, Jay.

943
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,184
That's your ego.

944
00:54:43,185 --> 00:54:45,521
You're not saving me,
you're just selfish.

945
00:55:29,732 --> 00:55:32,401
Yuri, it's morning already.

946
00:55:33,569 --> 00:55:34,769
Can you walk?

947
00:55:40,618 --> 00:55:41,660
Jay.

948
00:55:42,661 --> 00:55:43,996
I'm sorry.

949
00:55:45,206 --> 00:55:46,957
I just love you.

950
00:55:49,418 --> 00:55:50,418
Come on.

951
00:55:50,586 --> 00:55:52,128
Stand up.
We have to go.

952
00:55:52,129 --> 00:55:53,129
Jay.

953
00:56:12,733 --> 00:56:13,943
Keifer.

954
00:56:16,404 --> 00:56:18,781
I was looking for you all night.

955
00:56:19,782 --> 00:56:21,534
I thought something happened to you.

956
00:56:22,493 --> 00:56:23,619
Because…

957
00:56:24,036 --> 00:56:26,580
Because it rained, and then Yuri was sick.

958
00:56:28,916 --> 00:56:29,916
Jay-jay!

959
00:56:30,084 --> 00:56:33,045
What the hell? We've been looking for you
and you were here the whole time?

960
00:56:33,337 --> 00:56:34,463
Are you okay?

961
00:56:34,588 --> 00:56:35,381
What happened here?

962
00:56:35,382 --> 00:56:37,091
- Yuri's sick.
- You’re filthy!

963
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:38,550
- Jay.
- Are you okay?

964
00:56:38,551 --> 00:56:39,551
Were you wounded?

965
00:56:39,593 --> 00:56:40,886
Yuri is over there.
Go help him.

966
00:56:41,303 --> 00:56:42,221
You were gone for a long time.

967
00:56:42,222 --> 00:56:43,347
Look after Yuri.

968
00:56:43,722 --> 00:56:44,722
Jay!

969
00:56:46,016 --> 00:56:47,016
Bro talk to-

970
00:56:47,351 --> 00:56:48,561
- Bro!
- Drix.

971
00:56:51,313 --> 00:56:52,313
Keifer!

972
00:56:54,525 --> 00:56:55,609
Keifer!

973
00:56:55,818 --> 00:56:56,610
Do you have medicines with you?

974
00:56:56,610 --> 00:56:57,319
None.

975
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,570
Are you sick, bro?

976
00:56:58,571 --> 00:56:59,696
What did Jay say?

977
00:56:59,697 --> 00:57:00,823
Yuri's sick?

978
00:57:25,389 --> 00:57:26,389
Keifer!

979
00:57:27,183 --> 00:57:28,183
Keifer!

980
00:57:29,435 --> 00:57:30,435
Keifer!

981
00:57:44,658 --> 00:57:46,842
I'll pretend I didn't see anything.

982
00:58:05,053 --> 00:58:07,521
I don't know what to do anymore.

983
00:58:08,349 --> 00:58:10,851
How long will I wander in the dark?

984
00:58:11,616 --> 00:58:14,118
Will the path I choose lead me to you?

985
00:59:04,113 --> 00:59:04,863
Aries?

986
00:59:04,864 --> 00:59:06,197
Aries, I'm glad you're awake.

987
00:59:06,198 --> 00:59:06,949
Out!

988
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:08,658
Why are you always mad at me?

989
00:59:08,659 --> 00:59:09,993
I'm just worried about you.

990
00:59:09,994 --> 00:59:11,536
Jay-jay!

991
00:59:11,537 --> 00:59:12,579
Mom!

992
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:13,747
Hello.

993
00:59:15,332 --> 00:59:16,875
I brought you something.

994
00:59:17,334 --> 00:59:20,129
Give mommy a kiss.

995
00:59:21,338 --> 00:59:23,339
I want to go to school!

996
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:26,426
If you wanted to, then you should've
taken better care of Jay-jay!

997
00:59:26,427 --> 00:59:28,928
I wanna go to school!

998
00:59:28,929 --> 00:59:30,847
You're really such a stubborn child!

999
00:59:30,848 --> 00:59:31,973
So stubborn!

1000
00:59:31,974 --> 00:59:34,684
I already told you,
you're not going to school!

1001
00:59:34,685 --> 00:59:36,478
Why are you hurting the child?

1002
00:59:36,937 --> 00:59:37,937
Why are you so thin?

1003
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:39,230
I could easily break your bones.

1004
00:59:39,231 --> 00:59:41,190
- Shh!
- Hey, watch it.

1005
00:59:41,191 --> 00:59:42,775
You're not wearing your slippers again.

1006
00:59:42,776 --> 00:59:43,569
Where is it?

1007
00:59:43,570 --> 00:59:45,820
Huh? Are you speaking in English?

1008
00:59:45,821 --> 00:59:47,364
Where's mom?

1009
00:59:47,489 --> 00:59:50,783
I don't know. But I'll tell
mom to call her, okay?

1010
00:59:50,784 --> 00:59:53,537
Damn it, you're a girl and
you're getting into fistfights?

1011
00:59:54,038 --> 00:59:55,122
Are you even thinking?

1012
00:59:58,083 --> 00:59:58,751
All of you!

1013
00:59:58,752 --> 00:59:59,959
Jay, it's me!

1014
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,586
You'll hurt me too!

1015
01:00:01,587 --> 01:00:04,173
- You're all the same!
- Jay!
