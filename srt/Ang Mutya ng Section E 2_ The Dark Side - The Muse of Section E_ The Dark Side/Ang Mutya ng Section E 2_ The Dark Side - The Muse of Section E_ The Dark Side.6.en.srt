1
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,260
Hey.

2
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,436
You're just too beautiful, aren't you?

3
00:01:05,436 --> 00:01:07,730
You're marrying Yuri and
yet you also have Keifer.

4
00:01:09,023 --> 00:01:10,691
Damn it!

5
00:01:10,691 --> 00:01:11,484
What's wrong?

6
00:01:11,818 --> 00:01:13,361
I've been thinking of
telling Yuri about us.

7
00:01:13,736 --> 00:01:15,029
It's really Keifer.

8
00:01:15,238 --> 00:01:16,906
I knew from the start
it was Keifer.

9
00:01:17,073 --> 00:01:19,742
But on our wedding day,
you will say "I do."

10
00:01:19,742 --> 00:01:20,840
Because if you don't,

11
00:01:20,865 --> 00:01:22,245
I'll destroy Fer Corp.

12
00:01:22,578 --> 00:01:23,496
Hey, three dumbos!

13
00:01:23,496 --> 00:01:25,790
I just hope you won't regret
choosing him over Yuri.

14
00:01:26,233 --> 00:01:27,918
Section E is divided once again.

15
00:01:28,042 --> 00:01:29,919
Jay, get dressed.
We're going somewhere.

16
00:01:30,586 --> 00:01:34,132
Why don't we talk about
the upcoming wedding?

17
00:01:35,007 --> 00:01:35,716
Oh my gosh.

18
00:01:35,716 --> 00:01:38,636
Can you at least try not to show them
that you don't want to marry me.

19
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:41,556
I don't deserve this.
I don't deserve your love.

20
00:01:41,889 --> 00:01:42,849
You're not…

21
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:44,308
even pretty.

22
00:01:44,308 --> 00:01:45,852
But the way you
flirt with everyone,

23
00:01:45,852 --> 00:01:47,395
it's as if you'll
run out of boys.

24
00:01:47,395 --> 00:01:49,063
You got that from your mom,
didn't you?

25
00:01:49,063 --> 00:01:49,981
You're just like your-

26
00:01:50,663 --> 00:01:51,998
What the fuck?!

27
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,447
How long do you plan to fool, Jay huh?

28
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,908
Wow, bonding with Jay
like you don't know anything!

29
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,327
[Section E fighting]

30
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,579
What's happening,
why are you all fighting?!

31
00:02:03,889 --> 00:02:04,973
What's going on?

32
00:02:05,891 --> 00:02:07,267
Why did they end up fighting?

33
00:02:07,893 --> 00:02:09,436
When I left them,
everything was alright.

34
00:02:09,436 --> 00:02:10,729
But when I came back,
it was a mess.

35
00:02:11,605 --> 00:02:15,359
Getting into fights is
nothing new for these boys.

36
00:02:15,818 --> 00:02:17,319
But why does this feel different?

37
00:02:18,112 --> 00:02:19,196
It feels heavy,

38
00:02:19,404 --> 00:02:21,031
and I can't quite figure out why.

39
00:02:22,282 --> 00:02:24,118
Should I talk to them?

40
00:02:24,952 --> 00:02:27,579
I should, I need to know.

41
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,873
They shouldn't be hiding
anything from me.

42
00:02:32,501 --> 00:02:35,170
I know something's wrong
even if they don't say it.

43
00:02:35,963 --> 00:02:38,465
I hate it when something
is being kept from me.

44
00:02:39,508 --> 00:02:41,552
I need to know what
they're hiding from me.

45
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,096
Huh?

46
00:02:47,474 --> 00:02:48,642
Why are there so many chocolates?

47
00:02:54,523 --> 00:02:55,523
Oh, okay.

48
00:02:56,316 --> 00:02:58,360
Auntie Gemma put these here.

49
00:02:58,615 --> 00:03:01,493
I saw her earlier carrying
a bag of chocolates.

50
00:03:09,084 --> 00:03:10,084
Ci-N!

51
00:03:12,045 --> 00:03:13,045
Is that for me?

52
00:03:14,005 --> 00:03:15,005
Yes,

53
00:03:15,381 --> 00:03:18,009
if you answer my question.

54
00:03:18,843 --> 00:03:20,095
I already know what
you're going to ask, Jay.

55
00:03:20,095 --> 00:03:21,471
I'm not answering you.
Do whatever you want.

56
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,775
Hey!

57
00:03:39,954 --> 00:03:40,954
Jay!!!

58
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:47,268
Wow, it's so…

59
00:03:48,204 --> 00:03:49,607
- sweet!
- It's sweet?

60
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,648
Mmm!

61
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:53,584
- Jay, just one please.
- It’s easy on the palate.

62
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:57,196
They say it's good to eat
sweets while reviewing.

63
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:01,033
If you eat chocolates
before an exam,

64
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:03,285
it makes you smarter.

65
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:04,662
Really?

66
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,622
You’ll pass with flying colors.

67
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,832
Mmm!

68
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:12,378
Best chocolate ever!

69
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:22,179
Sure, you can have the wrapper.

70
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:23,388
Jay!!!

71
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,892
Stop it, it's not funny.

72
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,680
He's getting annoyed.

73
00:04:34,624 --> 00:04:37,001
- Jay, please.
- That's my favorite.

74
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:39,212
It’s easy on the palate!

75
00:04:40,922 --> 00:04:42,173
Okay fine, I'll talk!

76
00:04:42,173 --> 00:04:43,382
Just give me one, please!

77
00:04:43,382 --> 00:04:45,426
Just one, Jay.

78
00:04:45,426 --> 00:04:47,720
Please, Jay.

79
00:04:48,212 --> 00:04:49,212
See this?

80
00:04:51,299 --> 00:04:54,302
And this?

81
00:04:56,429 --> 00:05:02,810
Just answer my question
and you'll get all of these.

82
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,605
Don't fall for it, Ci!
We can buy that later.

83
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,148
Everything!

84
00:05:07,398 --> 00:05:08,398
Damn it!

85
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:10,985
Tell me, Ci.

86
00:05:12,904 --> 00:05:14,614
Why were you guys fighting?

87
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:18,033
Tell me, Ci.

88
00:05:22,442 --> 00:05:23,442
Mmm.

89
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:27,030
I can still taste
the sweetness of the chocolate!

90
00:05:30,682 --> 00:05:32,892
It's because Keifer
and Yuri were arguing.

91
00:05:34,157 --> 00:05:38,703
We chose sides,
so it turned into a bigger fight.

92
00:05:42,737 --> 00:05:43,738
It's happening.

93
00:05:44,405 --> 00:05:45,281
This is it.

94
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:46,281
You said that's mine!

95
00:05:47,867 --> 00:05:49,285
Section E is getting divided.

96
00:05:49,785 --> 00:05:51,120
This isn't right.

97
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
Give it!

98
00:05:54,936 --> 00:05:55,937
What was the fight about?

99
00:05:56,104 --> 00:05:57,314
Shut up, Ci-N!

100
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,481
You shut it!

101
00:06:00,275 --> 00:06:02,193
For fuck's sake, just speak up!

102
00:06:02,193 --> 00:06:03,945
Shut up, stop interfering!

103
00:06:03,945 --> 00:06:05,780
You're just making
things harder for Ci-N!

104
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,948
Just mind your own business!

105
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:12,804
Here, you can have it.

106
00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:15,332
Thank you so much, Jay!

107
00:06:15,332 --> 00:06:16,332
Thank you, Jay!

108
00:06:19,627 --> 00:06:22,005
I'll kick your ass if you get one!

109
00:06:22,756 --> 00:06:24,090
I really don't know
with these people.

110
00:06:24,341 --> 00:06:26,092
After everything, they're choosing
to fight each other now?

111
00:06:26,926 --> 00:06:28,219
The retreat is coming up.

112
00:06:29,512 --> 00:06:31,014
Bring out your papers, guys.

113
00:06:32,265 --> 00:06:33,600
The exam will start in a minute.

114
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,352
Ah, whatever.
Do what you guys want!

115
00:06:35,977 --> 00:06:38,730
The retreat will be fun, so I'm
sure they'll be okay soon enough.

116
00:06:39,022 --> 00:06:41,274
I'm sure they'll make up again

117
00:06:41,274 --> 00:06:42,525
once we start enjoying
at the retreat.

118
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:45,733
Ah, Sir! I'm feeling smart today,

119
00:06:45,733 --> 00:06:47,318
- I ate chocolate.
- Are you sure about that, Ms. Mariano?

120
00:06:47,926 --> 00:06:48,926
Sir.

121
00:06:49,272 --> 00:06:50,732
But before we have fun,

122
00:06:51,343 --> 00:06:53,679
time to face this exam first.

123
00:06:53,762 --> 00:06:54,762
Good luck, class.

124
00:08:34,212 --> 00:08:35,212
Time's up!

125
00:08:35,672 --> 00:08:36,715
Basic.

126
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:40,259
Until what page were you on?

127
00:08:40,635 --> 00:08:41,635
Shit!

128
00:08:42,692 --> 00:08:43,692
Stupid!

129
00:08:45,194 --> 00:08:48,155
Huh? You were able to answer?

130
00:08:50,932 --> 00:08:51,932
Thank you.

131
00:08:52,684 --> 00:08:54,561
Sir! Are we dismissed?

132
00:08:54,561 --> 00:08:55,561
Yes.

133
00:08:55,848 --> 00:08:57,275
- Really?
- Pass your papers, now.

134
00:08:58,434 --> 00:08:59,434
Are you going home?

135
00:09:00,588 --> 00:09:01,625
Where are you going after this?

136
00:09:02,448 --> 00:09:03,543
Bye, Sir!

137
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,920
- Let's hang out.
- Okay, where?

138
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,920
Anywhere.

139
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,342
Ms. Mariano,

140
00:09:10,604 --> 00:09:13,649
Don't forget to have your paperwork
signed by your previous school.

141
00:09:13,789 --> 00:09:14,873
I need them by Monday.

142
00:09:15,582 --> 00:09:16,917
Wait, Sir! I'm not finished yet.

143
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,293
- Time's up.
- Huh?

144
00:09:23,365 --> 00:09:24,365
So annoying!

145
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,390
I almost forgot about that.

146
00:09:25,968 --> 00:09:27,678
One more thing to worry about.

147
00:09:43,134 --> 00:09:44,134
This sucks!

148
00:09:44,677 --> 00:09:46,304
Those idiots still
won't answer me,

149
00:09:46,304 --> 00:09:48,267
and I come home
to find Ella in here!

150
00:09:53,745 --> 00:09:55,205
If you still won't answer me,

151
00:09:56,748 --> 00:09:58,500
don't bother talking
to me ever again.

152
00:10:04,455 --> 00:10:05,623
Hey, brat!

153
00:10:06,415 --> 00:10:08,208
Jay, I don't want to talk about it.

154
00:10:08,792 --> 00:10:10,461
It shouldn't come from me.

155
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,020
What do you mean?

156
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:14,381
What is it really about?

157
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:16,074
Ah, nevermind.

158
00:10:16,088 --> 00:10:18,257
But I hope you can forgive me.

159
00:10:18,257 --> 00:10:20,036
We made a huge mistake.

160
00:10:20,735 --> 00:10:21,819
Huge.

161
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:23,446
Forgive you?
What are you talking about?

162
00:10:24,864 --> 00:10:26,115
Ci-N! Hello?!

163
00:10:28,951 --> 00:10:29,994
So annoying.

164
00:10:39,253 --> 00:10:40,922
Wait, no.

165
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,309
Why would I talk to her?

166
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:45,935
No,

167
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,355
I have to do this.

168
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:20,759
Nice room.

169
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,309
What are you doing here?

170
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,052
So you and Keifer are
together now, huh?

171
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,030
What about Yuri?

172
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:40,573
What about him?

173
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,618
You don't even like him,

174
00:11:43,952 --> 00:11:45,913
so why are you still marrying him?

175
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,707
Tell that to him, not to me.

176
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:54,880
I know Yuri.

177
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,675
He's still hoping.

178
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,308
And he wouldn't hold on,

179
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,435
if he wasn't being led on.

180
00:12:09,556 --> 00:12:10,556
What are you trying to say?

181
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,518
Leave Yuri alone.

182
00:12:13,727 --> 00:12:14,978
You're just hurting him.

183
00:12:18,315 --> 00:12:21,610
Wow! Look who's talking!

184
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,111

You don't know anything
about me either.

So you also don't have the
right to talk to me like that.

00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,251
I'm still talking to you!

368
00:21:29,813 --> 00:21:30,814
Cyrus!

369
00:21:30,939 --> 00:21:32,232
Good thing you came back,

370
00:21:32,482 --> 00:21:34,609
because I really missed you.

371
00:21:34,943 --> 00:21:36,611
Let go of me.

372
00:21:36,611 --> 00:21:37,529
What, does it hurt?

373
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:38,530
It hurts, right?!

374
00:21:38,822 --> 00:21:40,407
That's exactly how
I felt back then!

375
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:44,745
Let go of me.

376
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:23,367
Mariano?

377
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,786
I just need these signed, ma'am.

378
00:22:28,934 --> 00:22:30,894
Wow, you've become so polite.

379
00:22:31,312 --> 00:22:34,189
You used to yell at me
like we're the same age.

380
00:22:35,566 --> 00:22:37,985
Alright, let me check your
records with the registrar.

381
00:22:57,296 --> 00:22:59,006
Jay, can we talk?

382
00:23:05,512 --> 00:23:06,555
She still got it, huh?

383
00:23:07,097 --> 00:23:08,599
Cyrus, please.

384
00:23:09,892 --> 00:23:11,643
I don't want any trouble.
What do you want from me?

385
00:23:12,227 --> 00:23:13,145
Simple.

386
00:23:13,771 --> 00:23:14,938
I want you to feel

387
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:17,621
what I went through before.

388
00:23:26,588 --> 00:23:27,615
Help me-

389
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:29,508
No one's going to help you!

390
00:23:30,258 --> 00:23:31,718
"Help" my ass...

391
00:23:32,135 --> 00:23:33,220
Get her up!

392
00:23:34,471 --> 00:23:35,222
Pull her up.

393
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:39,434
That's not enough.

394
00:23:39,832 --> 00:23:41,125
This one will end it!

395
00:23:46,179 --> 00:23:47,388
Jay!!!

396
00:23:54,652 --> 00:23:55,152
Jay!

397
00:24:03,137 --> 00:24:04,388
Jay! I got you.

398
00:24:05,403 --> 00:24:05,946
Are you okay?

399
00:24:11,005 --> 00:24:11,756
Jay, are you alright?

400
00:24:12,331 --> 00:24:13,457
Where did you get hit?

401
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:15,876
What do you want from me, huh?

402
00:24:15,876 --> 00:24:16,960
So we finally meet!

403
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,253
What the fuck are you doing?

404
00:24:18,921 --> 00:24:21,632
- And who the fucking hell are you?
- Yuri Hanamitchi.

405
00:24:22,508 --> 00:24:23,675
Mark Keifer Watson.

406
00:24:23,675 --> 00:24:25,135
Nice to fucking meet you!

407
00:24:40,901 --> 00:24:42,069
So you want to fight, huh?

408
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,686
The tall one's handsome.

409
00:24:49,686 --> 00:24:51,521
The red-haired one
is even hotter.

410
00:24:54,244 --> 00:24:55,704
He's hotter.

411
00:24:56,158 --> 00:24:56,825
Who?

412
00:24:57,464 --> 00:24:58,132
Him.

413
00:25:05,472 --> 00:25:06,307
My stuff…

414
00:25:07,028 --> 00:25:08,488
We'll look for it later.

415
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:10,935
Let's finish this first.

416
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:14,647
Go finish them off!

417
00:25:18,567 --> 00:25:19,902
Get up!

418
00:25:20,402 --> 00:25:21,445
What now, asshole?

419
00:25:21,445 --> 00:25:22,655
I don't know, we might
get dragged into this.

420
00:25:32,787 --> 00:25:33,746
You can’t move already, can you?

421
00:25:33,746 --> 00:25:34,705
You deserve that punch.

422
00:25:34,705 --> 00:25:35,539
Kick him, bro.

423
00:25:36,091 --> 00:25:37,676
You really won’t stop, huh?

424
00:25:37,676 --> 00:25:39,094
You still got the guts to fight back.

425
00:25:39,928 --> 00:25:41,888
So brave, huh?

426
00:25:43,348 --> 00:25:43,932
What?

427
00:25:46,184 --> 00:25:47,018
How was that, bro?

428
00:25:48,311 --> 00:25:49,437
Nice one!

429
00:25:50,063 --> 00:25:50,772
Solid!

430
00:25:55,151 --> 00:25:56,486
He's bleeding.

431
00:25:57,028 --> 00:25:57,821
Wait,

432
00:25:58,613 --> 00:25:59,948
who is Jay-jay to you anyways?

433
00:26:03,451 --> 00:26:04,536
Why do you care

434
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,246
what I do to her?!

435
00:26:06,746 --> 00:26:07,789
She's our classmate.

436
00:26:09,249 --> 00:26:10,250
She's our friend.

437
00:26:12,335 --> 00:26:13,670
She's part of our family.

438
00:26:15,088 --> 00:26:16,881
She belongs to Section E.

439
00:26:18,592 --> 00:26:20,093
And she's mine.

440
00:26:21,636 --> 00:26:23,013
You're the one she
replaced me with?

441
00:26:23,513 --> 00:26:25,015
You got played by
that woman too, huh?!

442
00:26:26,725 --> 00:26:27,726
Fucking asshole!

443
00:26:28,685 --> 00:26:30,478
Go, Keifer!

444
00:26:30,478 --> 00:26:31,271
Yuri!

445
00:26:32,022 --> 00:26:33,940
Stop him, Yuri.

446
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,609
Cyrus might seriously get hurt!

447
00:26:36,192 --> 00:26:38,403
Keifer, that's enough!

448
00:26:38,695 --> 00:26:39,404
Why?

449
00:26:39,821 --> 00:26:41,031
He just got out from the hospital.

450
00:26:41,031 --> 00:26:42,449
Something might happen
to him again!

451
00:26:43,116 --> 00:26:45,910
Then let's put him
back in the hospital!

452
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,162
Right!

453
00:26:51,041 --> 00:26:52,208
This poor bastard.

454
00:27:23,418 --> 00:27:24,586
What was that for?

455
00:27:25,538 --> 00:27:26,623
You owe me a kiss.

456
00:27:27,206 --> 00:27:30,501
You used profanity in the
classroom while eating chocolates.

457
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,255
Keifer, can we please
get out of here.

458
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:42,221
He's gonna cry.

459
00:27:42,513 --> 00:27:43,765
Are you crying?

460
00:27:45,183 --> 00:27:46,225
Can't get up, huh?

461
00:27:50,021 --> 00:27:51,522
Food, food!

462
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,445
Let's eat already,
it's past lunch.

463
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,656
We're the only ones left,
food's almost gone.

464
00:27:59,656 --> 00:28:01,240
Oh, fit check!

465
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,035
Catwalk! Model!

466
00:28:04,869 --> 00:28:06,579
Hey, let's eat already!

467
00:28:06,579 --> 00:28:07,914
Wait, we'll just pose.

468
00:28:08,122 --> 00:28:09,332
Three, Two, One, go.

469
00:28:10,726 --> 00:28:11,852
You're so cringe!

470
00:28:11,877 --> 00:28:12,419
Whatever!

471
00:28:13,186 --> 00:28:14,271
Your shorts are ugly as hell.

472
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:15,689
Wait a minute.

473
00:28:16,064 --> 00:28:17,190
Food!

474
00:28:19,109 --> 00:28:22,404
Wow, you forgot about me
already just because there's food.

475
00:28:24,197 --> 00:28:27,498
Here you go, Keifer—two pieces.

476
00:28:29,077 --> 00:28:29,870
Jay, hey.

477
00:28:30,829 --> 00:28:33,415
Are you sure you don't
want to go to the hospital?

478
00:28:34,207 --> 00:28:36,043
It might reach the organizers,

479
00:28:36,043 --> 00:28:37,377
and then things could get messy.

480
00:28:38,003 --> 00:28:40,172
The situation might get worse,
so don't bother.

481
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:43,300
If you need anything,
just tell us.

482
00:28:55,654 --> 00:28:56,488
Are you hungry?

483
00:28:57,031 --> 00:28:58,407
Do you want me to get you-

484
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:11,583
Eat.

485
00:29:13,426 --> 00:29:14,552
I'm not hungry.

486
00:29:16,012 --> 00:29:17,764
If you don't eat,

487
00:29:17,934 --> 00:29:19,310
I'll take you to the hospital.

488
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,219
Why?

489
00:29:35,937 --> 00:29:37,772
Hey, where are you going, David?

490
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,372
- Eat, Jay.
- He might be getting more food.

491
00:29:50,827 --> 00:29:52,579
You're asking for more
when there's barely anything left.

492
00:29:52,579 --> 00:29:53,955
I'm giving it away already.

493
00:29:58,251 --> 00:29:59,210
From now on,

494
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:02,046
you are no longer allowed to go
out without someone by your side.

495
00:30:02,464 --> 00:30:05,383
Someone has to be with
you wherever you go.

496
00:30:05,842 --> 00:30:06,384
Got it?

497
00:30:07,969 --> 00:30:10,513
Huh? What for?

498
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,598
Look at what happened to you!

499
00:30:11,598 --> 00:30:12,724
What if we hadn't come earlier?

500
00:30:13,057 --> 00:30:14,855
You might've ended
up in the hospital!

501
00:30:15,852 --> 00:30:18,021
I didn't know that was
going to happen, okay.

502
00:30:18,021 --> 00:30:21,191
Besides, no one at
Holy Saints could hurt me.

503
00:30:21,191 --> 00:30:22,066
Really?

504
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,402
What would you call what
that Cyrus guy did to you?

505
00:30:24,694 --> 00:30:26,404
I thought he was
confined in the hospital?

506
00:30:30,158 --> 00:30:31,993
He's been out for a few weeks already,

507
00:30:32,675 --> 00:30:35,136
and they let him back in school.

508
00:30:35,637 --> 00:30:36,512
You knew?

509
00:30:38,222 --> 00:30:39,682
Maybe you actually
planned to meet up!

510
00:30:40,391 --> 00:30:40,892
What?

511
00:30:42,143 --> 00:30:44,437
How would that even happen?
We don't communicate anymore,

512
00:30:44,437 --> 00:30:45,730
and we're not okay.

513
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:46,773
So why did you go?

514
00:30:47,357 --> 00:30:49,776
Maybe you really
wanted to see Cyrus.

515
00:30:50,944 --> 00:30:53,071
And why would I
want to meet that-

516
00:30:57,533 --> 00:30:58,242
Wait.

517
00:30:59,827 --> 00:31:00,954
Are you guys jealous?

518
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,163
- No!
- Yes!

519
00:31:03,623 --> 00:31:04,916
You two are so confusing.

520
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:07,377
What's the real
reason you're angry?

521
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:08,586
Isn't it obvious?

522
00:31:08,836 --> 00:31:10,546
We're mad because you got hurt,

523
00:31:10,546 --> 00:31:12,048
and we weren't there to protect you.

524
00:31:12,757 --> 00:31:13,466
Exactly.

525
00:31:15,468 --> 00:31:16,094
That's right.

526
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:19,722
How about you?

527
00:31:22,725 --> 00:31:23,351
Fine!

528
00:31:23,351 --> 00:31:25,103
Yes, I'm fucking jealous!

529
00:31:25,979 --> 00:31:26,562
Tell me,

530
00:31:26,562 --> 00:31:29,065
what guy would be happy
to hear that the girl he likes

531
00:31:29,065 --> 00:31:30,483
met up with her ex?

532
00:31:33,236 --> 00:31:34,570
Tell me, guys, am I right?

533
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:35,738
What would you feel?

534
00:31:35,738 --> 00:31:36,906
Rory, what would you feel?

535
00:31:36,906 --> 00:31:38,825
I'd feel extremely jealous!

536
00:31:38,825 --> 00:31:39,993
There you go.

537
00:31:40,535 --> 00:31:41,911
You, what would you feel?

538
00:31:41,911 --> 00:31:42,537
Felix?

539
00:31:42,537 --> 00:31:44,038
I'd cry.

540
00:31:45,456 --> 00:31:45,999
David?

541
00:31:46,153 --> 00:31:47,250
I'd feel the same.

542
00:31:47,667 --> 00:31:49,585
I'm with Keifer on this one.

543
00:31:51,546 --> 00:31:52,296
Thank you.

544
00:31:52,588 --> 00:31:53,006
Me?

545
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,508
I might even kill Grace's ex.

546
00:31:55,508 --> 00:31:56,467
Oh, so that's why you
got her pregnant.

547
00:31:56,467 --> 00:31:57,885
Good thing Mica
doesn't have an ex!

548
00:31:58,177 --> 00:31:59,554
But if that was me,

549
00:31:59,887 --> 00:32:01,389
I'd skin that guy alive

550
00:32:01,389 --> 00:32:03,099
and bathe him with
onions and garlic.

551
00:32:04,183 --> 00:32:05,226
You're all crazy!

552
00:32:05,393 --> 00:32:06,477
Let me ask you this,

553
00:32:06,477 --> 00:32:08,062
is there anything to
be jealous about Cyrus?

554
00:32:08,062 --> 00:32:09,313
- Yes.
- He's tall.

555
00:32:09,313 --> 00:32:11,524
- He has a nice built.
- Yeah.

556
00:32:11,524 --> 00:32:12,775
That's it.

557
00:32:12,775 --> 00:32:14,152
- Is he handsome?
- No, that's just it.

558
00:32:14,152 --> 00:32:14,652
Yes.

559
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:15,987
You guys are ridiculous.

560
00:32:19,699 --> 00:32:20,324
Jay,

561
00:32:21,034 --> 00:32:24,245
if you meet up with him
one more time and I find out

562
00:32:25,163 --> 00:32:27,415
I, myself, will lock
you in my house

563
00:32:27,415 --> 00:32:32,253
and make sure he does
not come anywhere near you.

564
00:32:32,253 --> 00:32:34,088
Let's just burn him alive.

565
00:32:35,173 --> 00:32:36,674
Perfect.

566
00:32:36,674 --> 00:32:38,176
Thank you so much. Exactly.

567
00:32:38,634 --> 00:32:40,178
That's what we'll do.

568
00:32:53,781 --> 00:32:55,067
I’m so bored.

569
00:32:55,068 --> 00:32:57,226
Why are not we
included in the activities?

570
00:32:59,072 --> 00:33:01,074
Edrix, the cooler it’s gone, bro!

571
00:33:01,074 --> 00:33:02,116
Wait, what? The cooler?!

572
00:33:02,116 --> 00:33:03,159
What do you mean?

573
00:33:04,508 --> 00:33:05,175
Damn it!

574
00:33:05,884 --> 00:33:07,135
- The cooler!
- What happened here?

575
00:33:07,135 --> 00:33:08,261
What are we going to drink?

576
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:09,513
What the fuck?

577
00:33:09,513 --> 00:33:10,931
They actually robbed us!

578
00:33:10,931 --> 00:33:12,057
- Huh?
- No!

579
00:33:12,057 --> 00:33:13,642
Look at our tents.

580
00:33:13,642 --> 00:33:14,851
Who did this?

581
00:33:14,851 --> 00:33:16,645
Section E, search the tents!

582
00:33:16,645 --> 00:33:17,980
We have to drink tonight!

583
00:33:18,504 --> 00:33:19,356
Fuck.

584
00:33:19,356 --> 00:33:20,065
Ci-N!

585
00:33:21,274 --> 00:33:23,944
- My magazines!
- Who did this?

586
00:33:24,361 --> 00:33:25,821
Should we tell the organizer?

587
00:33:26,446 --> 00:33:27,698
Fucking shit!

588
00:33:27,698 --> 00:33:28,365
Hey, what's this?

589
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:31,827
What?

590
00:33:31,827 --> 00:33:32,911
- What's that?
- It says "Marianel".

591
00:33:32,911 --> 00:33:33,453
Wait!

592
00:33:34,955 --> 00:33:35,998
"Marianel?"

593
00:33:36,497 --> 00:33:37,664
Ah, she's from Section A!

594
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,291
She used to be my crush.

595
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:41,960
How did a Section A
handkerchief end up here?

596
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,170
Why are you asking us?

597
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:45,798
- We came here at the same time.
- Did Section A steal from us?

598
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,758
Section A?

599
00:33:48,342 --> 00:33:49,593
Jay-jay, look at my tent!

600
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,386
Oh no, it's completely destroyed!

601
00:33:51,595 --> 00:33:52,846
Unbelievable!

602
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:55,057
They must really be jealous of you.

603
00:33:55,307 --> 00:33:56,767
I didn't even do anything to them.

604
00:33:56,767 --> 00:33:57,893
Should we report this?

605
00:33:58,185 --> 00:33:59,061
My stuff-

606
00:33:59,061 --> 00:34:00,646
It's gone.

607
00:34:00,646 --> 00:34:01,313
They took it.

608
00:34:01,688 --> 00:34:02,898
Even my stuffed toy?

609
00:34:03,524 --> 00:34:04,399
Gone too,

610
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:05,859
but wait, I'll check again.

611
00:34:05,859 --> 00:34:06,860
- Just stay here.
- Huh?

612
00:34:09,071 --> 00:34:11,240
My stuffed toy!

613
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:12,991
Please, check!

614
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:15,244
Check if my stuffed toy is there.

615
00:34:15,702 --> 00:34:17,454
Hurry, it might have
fallen somewhere!

616
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:20,666
I'm freaking out!

617
00:34:24,419 --> 00:34:25,170
Jay!!!

618
00:34:26,713 --> 00:34:28,006
There's a snake!!!

619
00:34:29,716 --> 00:34:31,218
What snake?!

620
00:34:31,802 --> 00:34:32,594
Are you sure?

621
00:34:32,594 --> 00:34:34,012
There really is, Jay!
I'm not joking!

622
00:34:34,012 --> 00:34:36,807
- Hey, careful Jay!
- Jay, watch out!

623
00:34:41,854 --> 00:34:42,271
Jay!

624
00:34:42,479 --> 00:34:43,981
- Wait!
- Move away from there!

625
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:45,023
It's dead, anyways!

626
00:34:45,023 --> 00:34:46,191
It's all coiled up.

627
00:34:46,191 --> 00:34:46,775
Even so!

628
00:34:46,775 --> 00:34:47,818
- Let me check.
- Gross!

629
00:34:47,818 --> 00:34:48,902
Look first.

630
00:34:50,112 --> 00:34:51,989
What is that?
Are those hotdogs or meatloaf?

631
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:53,782
Damn, it's huge.

632
00:34:54,032 --> 00:34:55,159
It's dead already.

633
00:35:00,539 --> 00:35:00,998
Jay!

634
00:35:01,915 --> 00:35:04,126
I know how we can
get back at Section A.

635
00:35:04,793 --> 00:35:05,460
How?

636
00:35:06,587 --> 00:35:07,379
Best friend,

637
00:35:08,297 --> 00:35:09,256
you handle this, okay?

638
00:35:10,674 --> 00:35:13,468
- Yuck!
- Disgusting, Ci!

639
00:35:13,468 --> 00:35:14,052
Disgusting.

640
00:35:14,303 --> 00:35:15,554
Guys!

641
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:17,306
Let's all wake up early tomorrow.

642
00:35:17,306 --> 00:35:18,515
I have a plan, okay?

643
00:35:18,515 --> 00:35:19,349
Here, I'll explain.

644
00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:19,892
Edrix,

645
00:35:20,309 --> 00:35:21,310
wake up early.

646
00:35:22,102 --> 00:35:23,729
Wake up early, okay!

647
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:29,985
Move quickly!

648
00:35:33,655 --> 00:35:34,907
Don’t make any noise.

649
00:35:37,451 --> 00:35:37,868
Shh!

650
00:35:37,868 --> 00:35:38,952
Ci-N, someone might see you.

651
00:35:38,952 --> 00:35:39,745
Get down.

652
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:41,205
You're so loud.

653
00:35:43,472 --> 00:35:44,557
This is pointless.

654
00:35:44,557 --> 00:35:46,892
I already know
I don't trust you guys.

655
00:35:47,419 --> 00:35:49,338
Like who even are these two girls?

656
00:35:49,463 --> 00:35:50,923
They're not a part of my clique.

657
00:35:52,299 --> 00:35:53,818
Alright, here's the plan.

658
00:35:54,259 --> 00:35:55,928
Keifer, you go there.

659
00:35:56,136 --> 00:35:57,429
Back us up if needed.

660
00:35:58,024 --> 00:35:59,734
Yuri, you stay here.

661
00:35:59,734 --> 00:36:01,368
Watch over Jay-jay.

662
00:36:02,278 --> 00:36:03,196
Ci-N, you're with me.

663
00:36:04,405 --> 00:36:05,156
I wanna join too.

664
00:36:06,282 --> 00:36:07,033
Let's stay here.

665
00:36:11,245 --> 00:36:13,206
I wonder where
my stuffed toy is.

666
00:36:13,206 --> 00:36:15,291
I'll get it later.
For now, just stay here.

667
00:36:15,791 --> 00:36:18,336
Girls, today's activity is
called the trust fall.

668
00:36:18,336 --> 00:36:20,213
This is where your trust with
each other will be tested.

669
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,554
Wait for me.

670
00:36:21,989 --> 00:36:24,408
So Freya, is the one in front.

671
00:36:25,284 --> 00:36:26,660
Uhh, fine.

672
00:36:27,369 --> 00:36:28,829
What’s the point?

673
00:36:31,999 --> 00:36:33,000
Faster.

674
00:36:34,749 --> 00:36:36,209
You guys better catch me,

675
00:36:36,209 --> 00:36:37,293
make sure you do.

676
00:36:37,293 --> 00:36:37,919
Ci-N!

677
00:36:38,669 --> 00:36:40,296
- The snake!
- Let's go? Okay!

678
00:36:40,755 --> 00:36:42,506
Wait, grab it!

679
00:36:44,133 --> 00:36:45,051
Wait!

680
00:36:45,259 --> 00:36:45,760
What?

681
00:36:47,094 --> 00:36:48,971
You got this, okay?

682
00:36:49,394 --> 00:36:51,354
We're counting on you,
get this done.

683
00:36:55,024 --> 00:36:55,733
Here we go.

684
00:36:55,733 --> 00:36:56,943
My gosh. Don't rush me.

685
00:36:56,943 --> 00:36:57,944
- Faster.
- Gosh, here it is.

686
00:36:57,944 --> 00:37:00,572
- Wait!
- On three, two…

687
00:37:00,572 --> 00:37:01,197
Okay.

688
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,411
Wait!

689
00:37:06,411 --> 00:37:07,745
Is this even important?

690
00:37:08,663 --> 00:37:11,082
Yes, of course. Just go!

691
00:37:13,572 --> 00:37:14,949
You got this.

692
00:37:15,825 --> 00:37:17,201
You're taking too long.

693
00:37:27,544 --> 00:37:28,962
Yeah, you’re the queen bee.

694
00:37:28,962 --> 00:37:30,047
Freya, faster!

695
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:31,590
I don't like this.

696
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:34,259
I'm literally like #TrustNoOne.

697
00:37:36,661 --> 00:37:39,956
- We've got you.
- Freya, we have to do this.

698
00:37:39,981 --> 00:37:40,690
Let's go.

699
00:37:45,037 --> 00:37:45,997
I'm brave,

700
00:37:46,128 --> 00:37:47,129
I'm bold,

701
00:37:47,523 --> 00:37:48,149
Yes, you are bold!

702
00:37:48,149 --> 00:37:51,235
- I'm not scared of anything!
- David, hurry up.

703
00:37:55,197 --> 00:37:56,365
The fuck?

704
00:38:05,166 --> 00:38:06,208
I'll go get your things.

705
00:38:13,674 --> 00:38:15,342
We're awesome, bro!

706
00:38:15,801 --> 00:38:17,845
Hey, I high-fived you!
Why’d you leave me hanging?

707
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:22,892
Yuri!

708
00:38:24,081 --> 00:38:25,458
Here it is! Jay!

709
00:38:28,187 --> 00:38:28,729
Look!

710
00:38:31,422 --> 00:38:32,047
Is it all complete?

711
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:39,249
Boys, where are you guys?

712
00:38:39,249 --> 00:38:39,791
Hello, Keifer.

713
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:41,293
We're already at the
Section A meeting hall.

714
00:38:42,419 --> 00:38:43,503
How are the other sections?

715
00:38:44,046 --> 00:38:46,340
We got back the other
stuff from their halls,

716
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,842
and confirmed,
our food is in Section D.

717
00:38:48,842 --> 00:38:51,094
Good thing Section C
didn't join in.

718
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:52,512
We're all together right now.

719
00:38:52,512 --> 00:38:53,096
All good?

720
00:38:53,096 --> 00:38:54,014
We’ll go there.

721
00:38:54,139 --> 00:38:54,806
Alright.

722
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,022
Yes.

723
00:39:02,356 --> 00:39:03,899
Nice!

724
00:39:13,857 --> 00:39:25,368
[Section E cheering]

725
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:30,285
Bestie! Bestie!

726
00:39:35,983 --> 00:39:36,943
What is this?

727
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:39,737
Hey, uglies!

728
00:39:46,536 --> 00:39:47,662
Hey, handsome.

729
00:39:47,662 --> 00:39:49,414
- Yes?
- Calling me, bro?

730
00:39:50,832 --> 00:39:53,126
The audacity!

731
00:39:53,126 --> 00:39:55,378
You're all so fake.

732
00:39:55,795 --> 00:39:57,755
You didn't even help Jay-jay.

733
00:39:57,755 --> 00:39:58,381
Right!

734
00:39:58,381 --> 00:39:59,298
Help this one.

735
00:39:59,549 --> 00:40:01,259
Hey, someone needs to share with

736
00:40:01,259 --> 00:40:02,718
Ci-N, Jay-jay, and David, okay?

737
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:03,719
I’ll handle it.

738
00:40:03,928 --> 00:40:05,471
I'll handle it so it doesn't get too messy.

739
00:40:06,472 --> 00:40:07,765
David, go with Kit & Josh.

740
00:40:07,765 --> 00:40:10,184
Then let's make a makeshift
tent for Jay over there.

741
00:40:10,685 --> 00:40:11,561
Do you all agree?

742
00:40:13,271 --> 00:40:14,439
Jay and I will just share a tent.

743
00:40:15,231 --> 00:40:15,731
Sure.

744
00:40:15,731 --> 00:40:17,150
I thought we were
going to play?

745
00:40:17,358 --> 00:40:18,901
You can handle that,
do it solo.

746
00:40:22,029 --> 00:40:22,613
No.

747
00:40:24,449 --> 00:40:25,283
Why?

748
00:40:25,783 --> 00:40:26,993
It's okay with me.

749
00:40:27,285 --> 00:40:29,620
Besides, Ci-N and I have already
stayed in a room together before.

750
00:40:29,745 --> 00:40:30,163
Jay,

751
00:40:31,164 --> 00:40:33,332
you're a girl and
Ci-N is still a guy.

752
00:40:33,332 --> 00:40:34,792
So it's a no for me.

753
00:40:36,878 --> 00:40:39,213
So what? It's Ci-N.

754
00:40:42,175 --> 00:40:43,050
Honestly,

755
00:40:43,455 --> 00:40:46,207
I miss my bonding nights with Ci.

756
00:40:46,833 --> 00:40:49,794
I would love to hear about
his life now at his condo.

757
00:40:52,922 --> 00:40:53,590
No.

758
00:40:54,758 --> 00:40:57,344
No one shares a tent with Jay-jay.

759
00:40:58,873 --> 00:40:59,332
Except...

760
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:01,876
me, of course.

761
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:05,129
How about no?

762
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:09,050
I think no one should
share a tent with Jay-jay.

763
00:41:10,756 --> 00:41:11,382
Enough!

764
00:41:11,716 --> 00:41:12,925
You better stop now.

765
00:41:15,177 --> 00:41:15,720
Fine.

766
00:41:17,346 --> 00:41:20,099
Nobody shares a tent with Jay-jay.

767
00:41:20,973 --> 00:41:24,769
Here's a better idea,
let Jay-jay decide.

768
00:41:24,794 --> 00:41:25,544
Makes sense.

769
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:32,281
Ah, Ci-N then.

770
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:33,866
If that's okay.

771
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:35,493
Fine.

772
00:41:35,881 --> 00:41:36,382
Fine.

773
00:41:40,261 --> 00:41:41,012
Whatever you want.

774
00:41:42,138 --> 00:41:43,014
Whatever I want.

775
00:41:45,349 --> 00:41:46,100
Whatever I want.

776
00:41:46,225 --> 00:41:47,101
Alright.

777
00:41:49,374 --> 00:41:50,333
[Jay-jay laughing]

778
00:41:51,167 --> 00:41:53,336
You’re just going to sleep there anyway.

779
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:11,020
There's actually a snake here?

780
00:42:11,145 --> 00:42:13,814
Yeah, one showed up at our campsite, too!

781
00:42:14,857 --> 00:42:16,984
Bestie is so popular.

782
00:42:42,093 --> 00:42:42,802
Hey,

783
00:42:43,511 --> 00:42:44,053
Rakki!

784
00:42:45,638 --> 00:42:46,556
Hey, Jay!

785
00:42:47,139 --> 00:42:48,099
How are you?

786
00:42:48,349 --> 00:42:49,100
I'm fine,

787
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,184
how about you?

788
00:42:50,518 --> 00:42:52,353
Do you have a snake
at your campsite too?

789
00:42:53,187 --> 00:42:53,646
Yeah.

790
00:42:54,313 --> 00:42:55,147
We don't!

791
00:42:58,359 --> 00:42:59,902
Hey, what's that on your neck?

792
00:43:01,028 --> 00:43:01,988
Is that a bruise?

793
00:43:03,406 --> 00:43:04,574
It is a bruise!

794
00:43:07,118 --> 00:43:08,369
Is someone hurting you?

795
00:43:10,329 --> 00:43:10,955
No!

796
00:43:11,872 --> 00:43:12,790
It’s just...

797
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:17,253
I got it during the
whole snake commotion.

798
00:43:18,379 --> 00:43:19,505
Keifer did that, am I right?

799
00:43:19,505 --> 00:43:20,506
Huh? No!

800
00:43:22,383 --> 00:43:24,969
You know, Jay, you don't have
to hide anything from me.

801
00:43:25,344 --> 00:43:27,013
I know you're in a relationship,

802
00:43:27,513 --> 00:43:28,973
and I know it's with Keifer.

803
00:43:30,141 --> 00:43:31,684
So if he's hurting you,

804
00:43:32,101 --> 00:43:33,728
it's better to let me know.

805
00:43:35,146 --> 00:43:37,273
Keifer didn't do this.

806
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:41,235
Someone did hurt me,
but it wasn't him.

807
00:43:42,236 --> 00:43:45,489
And why would you think that?

808
00:43:45,948 --> 00:43:47,158
That's just how he is.

809
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:49,327
He does that when he's jealous.

810
00:43:51,068 --> 00:43:51,902
Does what?

811
00:43:53,404 --> 00:43:54,071
To whom?

812
00:43:56,866 --> 00:43:57,783
To Freya.

813
00:44:00,536 --> 00:44:01,328
How?

814
00:44:02,913 --> 00:44:05,416
Well, Freya was already
being difficult back then.

815
00:44:05,416 --> 00:44:08,210
But that's not enough
reason to hurt someone.

816
00:44:08,794 --> 00:44:10,629
Keifer's crazy.

817
00:44:12,173 --> 00:44:13,841
But seriously,
have that checked, okay?

818
00:44:14,592 --> 00:44:17,511
Yes, it will go away anyways.
It will heal.

819
00:44:26,879 --> 00:44:28,297
You're sure, it wasn't Keifer?

820
00:44:28,589 --> 00:44:29,924
It's not him.

821
00:44:34,136 --> 00:44:36,430
Okay, fix yourself up.

822
00:44:47,281 --> 00:44:48,365
[Section E cheering]

823
00:44:48,365 --> 00:44:50,200
Food!

824
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,327
[Section E cheering]

825
00:44:52,425 --> 00:44:54,511
Hey! They might run
out of food again!

826
00:44:54,511 --> 00:44:57,013
They're really targeting the pancit,
hope you don't live long!

827
00:44:57,722 --> 00:44:58,640
Is this it?

828
00:45:01,977 --> 00:45:03,061
- Do you want vegetables?
- No!

829
00:45:03,497 --> 00:45:04,498
It's delicious!

830
00:45:07,293 --> 00:45:08,085
Too bad,

831
00:45:08,836 --> 00:45:10,129
it didn't spill.

832
00:45:10,713 --> 00:45:11,338
Freya,

833
00:45:12,173 --> 00:45:12,923
don't make a—

834
00:45:12,923 --> 00:45:13,883
Shut it, Mica.

835
00:45:15,593 --> 00:45:16,135
So,

836
00:45:17,805 --> 00:45:19,557
what's this I've been hearing?

837
00:45:20,205 --> 00:45:21,623
You and…

838
00:45:23,924 --> 00:45:26,343
What a great choice.

839
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:33,029
Freya, that's enough.

840
00:45:33,822 --> 00:45:35,031
I don't want trouble, Freya.

841
00:45:36,575 --> 00:45:37,659
Oh, really?

842
00:45:38,243 --> 00:45:40,787
Well, trouble is exactly what I want.

843
00:45:40,787 --> 00:45:41,538
Freya!

844
00:45:41,997 --> 00:45:42,831
Please!

845
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:46,829
You really think
you're so pretty, huh.

846
00:45:46,829 --> 00:45:48,039
Freya, stop it!

847
00:45:48,223 --> 00:45:51,518
Shut the fuck up and don't you
dare interrupt me while I'm talking!

848
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:56,420
You think I don't know
anything about you guys?

849
00:45:58,714 --> 00:45:59,757
What is your problem?!

850
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:00,924
You!

851
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,761
You're my problem because
you're such a flirt!

852
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:04,344
Wow!

853
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:06,221
Coming from you?

854
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:07,931
What the fuck is your problem, Freya?

855
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:09,099
Can you just stop already?!

856
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,520
Why are you talking
to me like that?

857
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:18,692
Your brother wouldn't like
that tone of yours.

858
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:20,319
Brother?

859
00:46:20,893 --> 00:46:22,478
Is she talking about Percy?

860
00:46:23,062 --> 00:46:24,522
Why is Percy being dragged into this?

861
00:46:24,939 --> 00:46:25,731
What's going on?

862
00:46:26,273 --> 00:46:27,817
Does she also know 
that Percy is alive?

863
00:46:27,817 --> 00:46:29,443
Freya, my brother's long gone.

864
00:46:30,111 --> 00:46:31,278
Your relationship ended
a long time ago too.

865
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:33,739
Relationship ended?

866
00:46:34,156 --> 00:46:34,949
What?!

867
00:46:37,507 --> 00:46:39,175
Percy?

868
00:46:45,515 --> 00:46:47,267
So you've heard of him, huh?

869
00:46:48,003 --> 00:46:49,296
Let me guess.

870
00:46:50,589 --> 00:46:52,174
You heard it from your...

871
00:46:53,341 --> 00:46:54,676
friends.

872
00:46:59,598 --> 00:47:02,934
So did your friends also
tell you what they did to me?

873
00:47:03,727 --> 00:47:04,227
Huh?

874
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:06,907
What they did to you?

875
00:47:09,303 --> 00:47:10,220
Yeah.

876
00:47:16,149 --> 00:47:17,150
That's enough, Freya.

877
00:47:17,567 --> 00:47:18,401
Enough?

878
00:47:19,277 --> 00:47:20,111
Why?

879
00:47:21,279 --> 00:47:22,489
You don't want others to hear?

880
00:47:24,407 --> 00:47:25,492
What do you want?

881
00:47:26,034 --> 00:47:28,870
I want to see your reaction

882
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:30,538
when you find out--

883
00:47:30,895 --> 00:47:31,563
Hey!

884
00:47:31,656 --> 00:47:33,783
… what those two did to me.

885
00:47:41,044 --> 00:47:41,753
Fuck!

886
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:52,096
What was that about?

887
00:47:54,265 --> 00:47:55,975
Jay, we're all tired and hungry.

888
00:47:56,392 --> 00:47:58,269
Can we please just
talk about it later?

889
00:47:58,269 --> 00:47:59,520
Why not now?

890
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,605
Jay, please.

891
00:48:01,189 --> 00:48:02,440
Why? What was that about?

892
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:03,816
Because that was a mistake!

893
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:06,361
It was just a mistake
we made back then!

894
00:48:07,111 --> 00:48:08,488
Why do you even need
to know about it?

895
00:48:09,989 --> 00:48:10,865
Right,

896
00:48:11,866 --> 00:48:13,368
why am I even asking?

897
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:15,954
Why am I even getting
myself involved again?

898
00:48:16,204 --> 00:48:17,288
Who am I to you anyways?!

899
00:48:19,374 --> 00:48:20,041
Hey, where are you gong?

900
00:48:20,166 --> 00:48:20,708
Jay!

901
00:48:21,334 --> 00:48:22,001
I don't know!

902
00:48:22,001 --> 00:48:23,086
Just somewhere far away from you!

903
00:48:48,069 --> 00:48:50,571
Good thing this is still here.

904
00:48:50,738 --> 00:48:51,948
There, this is how it should be.

905
00:48:51,948 --> 00:48:54,242
Relaxing, peaceful-

906
00:48:57,912 --> 00:48:58,621
Who's that?

907
00:48:59,831 --> 00:49:01,374
Looks like someone's relapsing.

908
00:49:04,836 --> 00:49:06,254
I'll join you, sis.

[girl sobbing]

910
00:49:19,308 --> 00:49:20,309
Freya?

911
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:33,223
Ahem!

912
00:49:39,437 --> 00:49:40,021
What?

913
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:41,728
What do you want?

914
00:49:52,033 --> 00:49:53,869
If you're here because of
what happened earlier,

915
00:49:55,245 --> 00:49:56,288
just leave.

916
00:49:57,539 --> 00:49:59,165
I'm not in the mood
to argue anymore.

917
00:50:05,797 --> 00:50:06,381
Freya.

918
00:50:08,245 --> 00:50:09,371
What?

919
00:50:11,748 --> 00:50:12,749
That thing...

920
00:50:15,463 --> 00:50:16,965
that thing you said earlier,

921
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:20,768
I didn't really understand.

922
00:50:27,937 --> 00:50:30,189
Didn't your friends already tell you?

923
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:34,489
Then again…

924
00:50:36,696 --> 00:50:39,532
I'd be more surprised
if they actually did tell you.

925
00:50:41,576 --> 00:50:42,493
What is it?

926
00:50:42,493 --> 00:50:44,537
Keifer and Yuri

927
00:50:46,778 --> 00:50:47,904
are my exes.

928
00:50:53,038 --> 00:50:54,790
After Percy died,

929
00:50:57,413 --> 00:50:59,665
Yuri was the first
one who came to me.

930
00:51:02,418 --> 00:51:03,878
He supported me.

931
00:51:04,754 --> 00:51:06,338
Showed me that he was
always there for me.

932
00:51:06,721 --> 00:51:07,639
Anytime.

933
00:51:07,639 --> 00:51:08,556
We get to go out for dinner.

934
00:51:09,208 --> 00:51:09,917
Do you wanna join?

935
00:51:13,074 --> 00:51:14,492
I really fell for him.

936
00:51:17,433 --> 00:51:18,225
And then...

937
00:51:18,225 --> 00:51:19,495
By the way, here's your drink.

938
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,147
...he took what he wanted.

939
00:51:22,773 --> 00:51:24,149
Let’s break up.

940
00:51:24,149 --> 00:51:26,818
Just like every guy wants.

941
00:51:34,534 --> 00:51:36,161
He left me.

942
00:51:37,829 --> 00:51:41,875
What he did was unforgivable.

943
00:51:49,927 --> 00:51:51,261
Then, Keifer showed up...

944
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:55,450
taking the spotlight.

945
00:51:55,475 --> 00:51:56,976
[students cheering for Freya]

946
00:51:56,976 --> 00:51:59,562
At first, I even thought
I should be grateful to him.

947
00:52:02,922 --> 00:52:05,675
But I was so fucking wrong.

948
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,872
He treated me like a queen.

949
00:52:11,872 --> 00:52:14,166
He saved me.

950
00:52:15,047 --> 00:52:18,675
Only a few people knew
we were together.

951
00:52:20,635 --> 00:52:22,721
But all changed,

952
00:52:23,638 --> 00:52:24,890
when he realized

953
00:52:25,734 --> 00:52:27,111
that it was still Yuri.

954
00:52:27,319 --> 00:52:29,113
Congrats, Freya!
You did so well!

955
00:52:31,907 --> 00:52:35,452
He was so consumed by jealousy.

956
00:52:36,662 --> 00:52:40,165
That's enough! Everyone out!

957
00:52:40,165 --> 00:52:42,793
Get out! Out, now!

958
00:52:44,347 --> 00:52:45,264
Keifer…

959
00:52:46,294 --> 00:52:47,546
what's your problem?

960
00:52:47,546 --> 00:52:49,131
So you're enjoying it, aren't you?

961
00:52:50,298 --> 00:52:51,007
They were just greeting me.

962
00:52:51,007 --> 00:52:51,925
Just greeting you?!

963
00:52:51,925 --> 00:52:53,969
It got to a point where...

964
00:52:55,637 --> 00:52:57,430
He laid a hand on me.

965
00:52:57,848 --> 00:53:00,350
You don't go anywhere
without my permission!

966
00:53:00,767 --> 00:53:03,019
And you're not allowed to leave
the house unless I'm with you!

967
00:53:05,522 --> 00:53:06,690
Don't you ever

968
00:53:06,982 --> 00:53:08,733
ever try to disobey me!

969
00:53:14,373 --> 00:53:14,999
So,

970
00:53:16,042 --> 00:53:17,084
what did I do?

971
00:53:22,548 --> 00:53:24,216
I went out with other guys.

972
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:27,803
We fought all the time,

973
00:53:28,554 --> 00:53:29,581
every day.

974
00:53:30,723 --> 00:53:32,183
Until he got tired of it...

975
00:53:35,436 --> 00:53:36,896
and broke up with me.

976
00:53:40,941 --> 00:53:43,819
In wanting to know the truth,

977
00:53:44,695 --> 00:53:46,405
here I am, getting hurt.

978
00:53:47,156 --> 00:53:49,909
It hurts when secrets
are kept from you.

979
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:53,245
But it hurts even more
to hear the truth.

980
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,999
It feels so heavy.

981
00:54:00,252 --> 00:54:03,089
And then people started
calling me a bitch,

982
00:54:03,422 --> 00:54:04,715
a slut, a whore.

983
00:54:09,553 --> 00:54:10,971
If only they knew the truth.

984
00:54:10,971 --> 00:54:12,473
If only you knew the truth.

985
00:54:16,185 --> 00:54:18,312
Would you still be so
quick to judge me?

986
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:21,816
What did Keifer use to say again?

987
00:54:22,817 --> 00:54:26,112
Ah, curiosity kills the cat.

988
00:54:28,864 --> 00:54:30,282
Fucking pathetic.

989
00:54:38,290 --> 00:54:38,749
Don't.

990
00:54:41,127 --> 00:54:42,753
I don't need your fake sympathy.

991
00:55:41,438 --> 00:55:42,147
There she is!

992
00:55:42,356 --> 00:55:42,856
Jay!

993
00:55:49,486 --> 00:55:50,487
Three, two, one!

994
00:55:54,618 --> 00:55:55,327
Where have you been?

995
00:55:55,744 --> 00:55:56,495
Angelo.

996
00:55:56,495 --> 00:55:57,871
Cyrus' parents called me.

997
00:55:58,288 --> 00:55:59,289
They said he was taken
to the hospital,

998
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:00,248
along with his friends.

999
00:56:00,374 --> 00:56:01,375
Did you have anything
to do with that?

1000
00:56:01,375 --> 00:56:02,376
Well—

1001
00:56:02,376 --> 00:56:03,960
You're having one of your
crazy episodes, aren't you?

1002
00:56:04,211 --> 00:56:05,796
I know you have
something to say.

1003
00:56:06,046 --> 00:56:07,964
Did you really hurt Freya?

1004
00:56:09,841 --> 00:56:10,592
I did.

1005
00:56:11,385 --> 00:56:13,929
You animal!
Why don't you untie me!

1006
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:15,205
Nice one, barracuda.

1008
00:56:23,438 --> 00:56:28,068
Ci-N!

00:56:28,068 --> 00:56:28,902
Truth or dare?

1010
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:30,404
Fine, truth.

1011
00:56:30,654 --> 00:56:32,489
When did you start liking Jay-jay?

1012
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:35,534
Maybe during her first
few weeks in Section E.

1013
00:56:35,534 --> 00:56:37,327
When are you planning to tell us

1014
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:39,204
about your engagement to Jay-jay?

1015
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:41,540
Huh?!
