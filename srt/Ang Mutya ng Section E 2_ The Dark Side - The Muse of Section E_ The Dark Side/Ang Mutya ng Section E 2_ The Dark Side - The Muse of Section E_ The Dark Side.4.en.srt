1
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,179
- Is that for me?
- No!

2
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,515
Thanks anyways, but
it would be a waste.

3
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:58,058
I like a different kind of sweet now.

4
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,018
What?

5
00:00:59,018 --> 00:01:00,185
Your lips.

6
00:01:02,121 --> 00:01:04,123
You use a different
car every time!

7
00:01:04,289 --> 00:01:07,286
I'm actually even willing to
give you my entire house.

8
00:01:07,311 --> 00:01:10,490
Just make sure you won't marry Yuri.

9
00:01:10,515 --> 00:01:11,516
Cause remember,

10
00:01:11,698 --> 00:01:12,699
you're mine.

11
00:01:13,616 --> 00:01:14,592
Hi, Jay!

12
00:01:14,617 --> 00:01:16,535
We found out that your
father is the son of uh...

13
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:17,845
business tycoon?

14
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,079
Why are they together?

15
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,067
I'm confused, too.

16
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,958
We’ll figure it out.

17
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,200
Hey, dad.

18
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:27,421
I'll teach you some
Japanese words.

19
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:28,923
Say...

20
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:30,341
[in Japanese] I love you.

21
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:32,250
Can I kiss you again?

22
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,237
Why are you doing this to me, Jay?

23
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,805
Tell me and I'll leave you alone!

24
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,015
Fine!

25
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,975
I'm not sure
about what I feel,

26
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:43,039
but this is what's right,
it should be Yuri!

27
00:01:43,064 --> 00:01:45,154
Because of that
fucking engagement?

28
00:01:45,816 --> 00:01:46,901
No.

29
00:01:46,926 --> 00:01:48,010
Not me.

30
00:01:48,498 --> 00:01:49,707
I love you, Jay.

31
00:01:50,013 --> 00:01:51,628
I love you too, Keifer.

32
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:54,615
[Ci-N snoring]

33
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:02,456
[Ci-N snoring]

34
00:02:22,727 --> 00:02:24,270
I love you, Jay.

35
00:02:33,498 --> 00:02:35,125
I love you too, Keifer.

36
00:02:43,974 --> 00:02:45,079
Oh sh-

37
00:02:46,153 --> 00:02:48,489
You idiot, you scared me.

38
00:03:06,876 --> 00:03:07,877
Hello?

39
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,190
How are you?

40
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,630
I got scolded because
I went home late.

41
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:18,663
What if we just tell them?

42
00:03:18,962 --> 00:03:20,214
Tell them what?

43
00:03:21,262 --> 00:03:23,598
That you're pregnant and we'll get married.

44
00:03:24,542 --> 00:03:25,961
Shut up.

45
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:27,877
You're crazy.

46
00:03:28,231 --> 00:03:29,649
Let's go to sleep.

47
00:03:30,805 --> 00:03:32,431
Okay, you go ahead.

48
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:34,165
I still have something else to do.

49
00:03:34,633 --> 00:03:35,676
I've got to go.

50
00:03:36,528 --> 00:03:38,430
You might end up having
wet dreams about me.

51
00:03:38,455 --> 00:03:39,915
Wow, bold of you to say.

52
00:03:44,383 --> 00:03:45,384
Well then,

53
00:03:46,213 --> 00:03:47,464
good night,

54
00:03:48,781 --> 00:03:49,782
my life.

55
00:03:50,619 --> 00:03:51,620
Good night.

56
00:03:55,341 --> 00:03:56,342
I love you.

57
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,653
To infinity,

58
00:04:03,473 --> 00:04:04,474
and beyond.

59
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,503
I...

60
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,298
I love...

61
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,259
myself!

62
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:21,553
Who's that?

63
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:22,137
What?

64
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:24,431
Where? Do you see someone?

65
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,950
Go on, keep playing dumb.

66
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,103
I'll tell Keifer that you
have a boyfriend!

67
00:04:29,864 --> 00:04:30,938
What boyfriend are
you talking about?

68
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,152
Go on, tell everybody!

69
00:04:32,192 --> 00:04:33,216
Huh?

70
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,000
So who is that? Let me see.

71
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,694
Nothing, huh? "I love you!"

72
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,120
So what?

73
00:04:40,145 --> 00:04:41,146
Let's just go to sleep.

74
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,118
- Why won't you show it to me?
- Because I don't want to!

75
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:44,910
Let me see, Jay.

76
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,870
Wow, it's like you'll die
if you won't find out.

77
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,347
Just let me see it.

78
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:49,373
Give it to me.

79
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:50,749
- I'll bite you!
- Just one peek, Jay!

80
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,251
- Gross, let me see!
- Why, did you tell me

81
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:53,769
what you talked
about with Rakki?

82
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,713
[ARIES] Hey! If you don't
want to sleep, let others sleep.

83
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:00,384
There you go, loudmouth!

84
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:02,386
Why me?

85
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:04,071
Go back to your bed.

86
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:05,472
- Okay fine.
- Go to sleep.

87
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:06,056
Wow!

88
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,641
- You’re so noisy!
- You're treating me like this now?

89
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,851
I won’t forget this!

90
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:10,476
Just go to sleep.

91
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,480
- Go on, throw that pillow.
- Whatever, this is mine now!

92
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,690
You don't have a pillow anymore.

93
00:05:19,442 --> 00:05:21,288
- Give it back!
- No!

94
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:24,199
Okay, whatever.

95
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,033
What!?

96
00:07:11,371 --> 00:07:12,433
Can I borrow?

97
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:13,803
I'm so sleepy.

98
00:07:15,858 --> 00:07:16,859
Me too.

99
00:07:18,193 --> 00:07:19,820
This is your fault!

100
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,542
You were so
annoying last night,

101
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,652
you wouldn't let me sleep.

102
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:25,821
If you had just told me
who that "I love you" was for,

103
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:27,406
we could've fallen
asleep properly.

104
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:28,971
Quiet!

105
00:07:28,996 --> 00:07:31,290
You're so annoying, that's
why I don't want to tell you.

106
00:07:32,444 --> 00:07:34,160
I'll tell Keifer on you.

107
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:35,372
Go ahead, tell him!

108
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,710
What happened to your eyes?

109
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,003
It's his fault.

110
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:43,672
My fault? You're the
reason I woke up!

111
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:44,631
As if!

112
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:45,841
- It's your fault!
- No, it's yours!

113
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,259
You're so noisy!

114
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:48,368
Enough.

115
00:07:48,393 --> 00:07:49,687
Stop bickering.

116
00:07:49,712 --> 00:07:51,005
You sound so dumb.

117
00:07:58,327 --> 00:07:59,328
Boys.

118
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:01,648
You brought food!

119
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:07,154
Oh, hey hey!

120
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:10,324
Yay!

121
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:11,158
Wait, calm down.

122
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:11,867
Whatever.

123
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:13,076
This is mine.

124
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,458
I'm not yet ready to face Yuri.

125
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,710
I feel awkward around him.

126
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,420
I don't want to hurt him,

127
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,547
but I also don't want
to give him false hope.

128
00:08:26,601 --> 00:08:28,777
I don't know anymore.

129
00:08:31,382 --> 00:08:33,827
Why isn't the King
of Assholes here yet?

130
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:38,393
I don't know if it would be easier
to tell Yuri the truth

131
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:39,561
if he were here.

132
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:43,982
Thank you guys.

133
00:08:44,137 --> 00:08:45,597
He won't come in.

134
00:08:45,622 --> 00:08:46,724
Huh?

135
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:48,487
Keifer's not going
to school today

136
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:49,831
if he's the one
you're looking for.

137
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:53,325
His dad went home, and
he's dealing with a lot.

138
00:08:54,586 --> 00:08:56,045
Huh, what do I care about him?

139
00:08:56,538 --> 00:08:58,623
Besides, Keifer isn't
the one I'm looking for.

140
00:09:01,994 --> 00:09:03,245
So annoying,

141
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,462
is it that obvious that
I'm looking for him?

142
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:17,866
Hey.

143
00:09:18,004 --> 00:09:19,130
Why are you so quiet?

144
00:09:20,207 --> 00:09:21,078
Huh?

145
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:23,580
She's definitely spaced out.

146
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:26,400
Maybe she just misses someone.

147
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,736
Or maybe it's not
Keifer she's missing.

148
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,004
Who?

149
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,239
Maybe the one she was saying "I love-"

150
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,782
Hey! Shut your mouth!

151
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:35,033
Why are you defensive?

152
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:35,992
Whatever!

153
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,285
Why won't you say it?

154
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,321
You want to know what
Jay-jay did last night?

155
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:41,889
It was bad. You want to know?

156
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:43,110
Don't you dare.

157
00:09:43,135 --> 00:09:44,470
Meow!

158
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:45,836
Who's that?

159
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:49,381
Edy!

160
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:50,715
You're dead!

161
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,511
Hey! That cat's name
is not Edy!

162
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,932
Good thing Edy saved me.

163
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,058
Give me some.

164
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:04,537
[background chattering]

165
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:06,106
Hey, give me some of that too!

166
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:08,066
Fuck you, you're so stingy!

167
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,865
Hey! Me too!

168
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:22,663
No, Edy.

169
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:24,458
No, Edy.

170
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,642
Stop.

171
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:26,877
No, Edy!

172
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,171
Stop!

173
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:32,174
Hey!

174
00:10:34,046 --> 00:10:36,132
No!

175
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:39,931
He hasn't been coming
to school for days, is he okay?

176
00:10:40,885 --> 00:10:42,095
Meow!

177
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,560
Meow!

178
00:10:44,342 --> 00:10:45,843
Meow!

179
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,274
Edy.

180
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:50,484
What happened to this guy?

181
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:51,943
Meow!

182
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:54,885
Now I can’t sleep even more.

183
00:10:56,808 --> 00:10:57,850
I'm so annoyed.

184
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,826
After saying "I love you" the other day,

185
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,369
he suddenly disappeared.

186
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,330
No updates at all.

187
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,710
[phone buzzing]

188
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,296
[phone buzzing]

189
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:13,632
I miss you.

190
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,803
What happened?

191
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,514
Why did it take you so long to call?

192
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,503
Long story.

193
00:11:25,824 --> 00:11:26,825
How are you?

194
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,523
Is Yuri making moves
while I'm gone?

195
00:11:30,602 --> 00:11:31,812
Stupid.

196
00:11:31,837 --> 00:11:33,485
I was worried about you.

197
00:11:33,783 --> 00:11:34,986
You didn't message me
for days,

198
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,113
and that's what you're
worried about?

199
00:11:38,225 --> 00:11:39,476
I told you.

200
00:11:40,054 --> 00:11:41,889
I have a lot on
my plate right now.

201
00:11:41,914 --> 00:11:42,874
And…

202
00:11:42,874 --> 00:11:45,626
I'm not sure when
I'll be able to come back.

203
00:11:47,628 --> 00:11:48,629
Really?

204
00:11:49,422 --> 00:11:51,174
What is it about?

205
00:11:51,771 --> 00:11:55,470
You couldn't even send
one text, one update?

206
00:11:59,974 --> 00:12:01,976
You need me to
update you so bad?

207
00:12:03,144 --> 00:12:04,353
No.

208
00:12:05,188 --> 00:12:07,482
I just want to know
how big that problem is

209
00:12:07,482 --> 00:12:09,442
that you can't even send a message.

210
00:12:15,031 --> 00:12:16,032
Just…

211
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:18,242
family problems.

212
00:12:18,785 --> 00:12:22,413
Can't even send a text?

213
00:12:27,835 --> 00:12:28,836
Hey.

214
00:12:29,504 --> 00:12:31,088
What happened to you?

215
00:12:36,803 --> 00:12:38,763
You're kind of cute
when you're like that.

216
00:12:43,434 --> 00:12:44,435
I like it.

217
00:12:49,857 --> 00:12:52,109
I wish I could see
your face right now.

218
00:12:54,654 --> 00:12:56,739
I can send a picture if you want?

219
00:12:58,606 --> 00:12:59,367
Sure.

220
00:12:59,367 --> 00:13:00,618
Nude photo, please.

221
00:13:02,245 --> 00:13:04,497
Maybe I should just
stop talking to you forever.

222
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:08,960
Just kidding.

223
00:13:09,502 --> 00:13:11,838
But seriously, Keifer.

224
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,757
What's going on?

225
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,385
Are you okay?

226
00:13:25,351 --> 00:13:32,108
3 days ago

227
00:13:33,609 --> 00:13:35,319
Girls.

228
00:13:36,237 --> 00:13:37,530
What happened?

229
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,198
It's because of Sir…

230
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:40,366
Did you get hurt?

231
00:13:40,366 --> 00:13:41,926
We're okay.

232
00:13:41,951 --> 00:13:43,244
How about the kids?

233
00:13:43,244 --> 00:13:44,745
They're alright.

234
00:13:45,121 --> 00:13:47,915
Alright then, we need to
clean up the mess immediately.

235
00:13:47,915 --> 00:13:49,625
Did that man come here?

236
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:50,852
Sir.

237
00:13:50,877 --> 00:13:52,753
Where's Keiren?

238
00:13:53,838 --> 00:13:55,756
- Go on, clean up.
- Keiren!

239
00:13:56,215 --> 00:13:57,216
Keifer.

240
00:13:58,426 --> 00:14:00,052
Sir, excuse me.

241
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,755
Keifer.

242
00:14:11,657 --> 00:14:12,741
It's okay.

243
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:13,974
I'm here now.

244
00:14:15,064 --> 00:14:16,148
I'm here now.

245
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,922
Where did you go?

246
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:22,033
You know dad already
went back to the country.

247
00:14:22,033 --> 00:14:23,951
But you still chose to leave.

248
00:14:23,951 --> 00:14:25,995
Good thing he didn't take us.

249
00:14:28,748 --> 00:14:30,499
I don't want to go with him.

250
00:14:32,268 --> 00:14:33,394
He won't be able to
take you away from us

251
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:35,129
as long as we're here.

252
00:14:37,673 --> 00:14:39,216
So what's your plan now?

253
00:14:43,554 --> 00:14:45,473
I'm almost of legal age.

254
00:14:49,143 --> 00:14:51,604
I will fight for your custody.

255
00:14:52,318 --> 00:14:54,821
So we'll just wait for your birthday?

256
00:14:54,941 --> 00:14:56,233
Is that it?

257
00:14:56,567 --> 00:14:58,986
What if they take Keiren
before that happens?

258
00:14:58,986 --> 00:15:00,154
No.

259
00:15:00,154 --> 00:15:03,449
That will never happen.

260
00:15:05,117 --> 00:15:06,178
Okay?

261
00:15:06,327 --> 00:15:09,163
I hope you really mean
what you're saying.

262
00:15:09,747 --> 00:15:12,375
Come on. Let's go to sleep.

263
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,627
Are you okay?

264
00:15:14,627 --> 00:15:16,128
You rest now.

265
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,551
Hello?

266
00:15:42,738 --> 00:15:44,448
Good evening, Mr. Ryder.

267
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:46,117
I'm sorry to disturb.

268
00:15:46,409 --> 00:15:48,411
I just need to talk
to you about something.

269
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,077
Is this about your legal rights?

270
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,291
Yes.

271
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:58,129
I fear that this is what I
dreaded since mom's death.

272
00:15:58,462 --> 00:16:00,172
It's finally beginning.

273
00:16:00,172 --> 00:16:01,340
I guess he’s back again.

274
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:04,051
Don’t worry, I'll prepare
the necessary paperwork

275
00:16:04,051 --> 00:16:05,761
and update you once
everything is ready.

276
00:16:05,761 --> 00:16:06,836
Thank you.

277
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,418
Come on, you're so slow.

278
00:16:37,752 --> 00:16:39,086
At least, it's not that hot.

279
00:16:39,086 --> 00:16:41,547
What do you mean "not hot"?
I'm already drenched in sweat.

280
00:16:41,547 --> 00:16:43,549
- It's because you don't shower!
- Yuck.

281
00:16:46,052 --> 00:16:47,053
Oh, is this your ride?

282
00:16:47,678 --> 00:16:50,973
- Nice timing, it's really hot today.
- That's not my ride.

283
00:16:56,395 --> 00:16:57,897
Oh, they're in uniform.

284
00:16:58,773 --> 00:17:00,649
Are you Jasper Jean Mariano?

285
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:03,235
Ci-N Peralta and
Michael Aries Fernandez?

286
00:17:03,235 --> 00:17:05,488
Uh yes, that's us. Why?

287
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:10,242
Aries!

288
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:12,870
That's Ella.

289
00:17:13,287 --> 00:17:15,539
The Watson Family is asking for you.

290
00:17:16,415 --> 00:17:17,541
Watson Family?

291
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,210
Is this Keifer's doing?

292
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:22,338
We were strictly told not
to give any information.

293
00:17:23,506 --> 00:17:25,174
Jay, this isn't Keifer's doing.

294
00:17:25,674 --> 00:17:27,468
This might be his dad.

295
00:17:27,802 --> 00:17:29,136
Let's not get in,
we should leave.

296
00:17:29,136 --> 00:17:30,387
Just get in.

297
00:17:30,387 --> 00:17:31,013
No.

298
00:17:31,013 --> 00:17:32,431
- He says get in.
- Jay!

299
00:17:35,142 --> 00:17:35,851
Come on, let's go.

300
00:17:35,851 --> 00:17:37,019
Hey, careful!

301
00:17:40,773 --> 00:17:42,691
- Ouch!
- Why did you get in?

302
00:17:54,722 --> 00:17:56,099
Damn, it'so hot in here.

303
00:17:56,124 --> 00:17:58,170
This is really my house.

304
00:17:58,724 --> 00:18:00,058
You're broke!

305
00:18:00,476 --> 00:18:01,837
What, am I not allowed to dream?

306
00:18:03,254 --> 00:18:04,588
Another black van?

307
00:18:04,588 --> 00:18:05,923
I wonder who this is.

308
00:18:09,981 --> 00:18:11,190
Oh, they're here.

309
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,051
- Ouch.
- It's Ci-N.

310
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,292
It's actually bigger in person.

311
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,086
Why? Where did you
see this before?

312
00:18:19,111 --> 00:18:20,648
In a picture.

313
00:18:21,146 --> 00:18:22,201
Wait,

314
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,603
why are we here anyways?

315
00:18:23,876 --> 00:18:24,877
I don't know.

316
00:18:24,902 --> 00:18:26,236
Wait, where's Keifer?

317
00:18:32,603 --> 00:18:34,067
That's Keifer's dad.

318
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,383
That's Keifer's dad.

319
00:18:35,408 --> 00:18:36,867
That's his dad?

320
00:18:46,046 --> 00:18:47,047
Good morning.

321
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,632
Are we all complete?

322
00:18:52,011 --> 00:18:53,387
Why are we here?

323
00:18:53,387 --> 00:18:54,597
Is Keifer here too?

324
00:18:59,351 --> 00:19:00,728
Mr. Watson.

325
00:19:02,396 --> 00:19:03,397
Why are we here?

326
00:19:06,066 --> 00:19:07,610
Aries Fernandez.

327
00:19:07,963 --> 00:19:09,798
You still haven't changed.

328
00:19:09,845 --> 00:19:11,430
Still impatient.

329
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,201
Why?

330
00:19:16,911 --> 00:19:20,831
Am I not allowed to have lunch
with my son's friends?

331
00:19:23,876 --> 00:19:25,544
Welcome to my home, guys.

332
00:19:38,057 --> 00:19:41,393
They even arrived together.
I can't focus.

333
00:19:42,427 --> 00:19:46,922
But since they came together,
I guess they're okay now?

334
00:19:47,942 --> 00:19:49,735
I hope they're both okay.

335
00:19:50,194 --> 00:19:53,614
Even if it feels like I'm the one who
won't be okay seeing them together.

336
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:10,573
Why did your dad bring us here?

337
00:20:49,008 --> 00:20:49,947
Psst!

338
00:21:11,442 --> 00:21:12,741
What's going on?

339
00:21:12,788 --> 00:21:13,628
Why?

340
00:21:13,652 --> 00:21:15,029
Why is it just us?

341
00:21:15,827 --> 00:21:17,411
Good thing no one else followed.

342
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:23,954
Jay.

343
00:21:24,663 --> 00:21:25,789
Wait.

344
00:21:25,831 --> 00:21:27,333
What is this?

345
00:21:28,965 --> 00:21:30,175
What's happening?

346
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,576
Did you get here earlier?

347
00:21:33,049 --> 00:21:34,973
We need your cooperation.

348
00:21:35,649 --> 00:21:37,067
Dad is up to something.

349
00:21:37,092 --> 00:21:39,803
He wouldn't bring us
here without a reason.

350
00:21:39,803 --> 00:21:41,786
We don't know what it is.

351
00:21:41,811 --> 00:21:43,772
But one thing's for sure,

352
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,103
Keiren is his target.

353
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:50,006
He can use us anytime, Jay.

354
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,495
Wait.

355
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,443
I don't understand anything.

356
00:21:54,443 --> 00:21:56,028
What do you mean "kidnapped"?

357
00:21:56,028 --> 00:21:57,529
You were kidnapped?

358
00:21:58,322 --> 00:22:01,658
Well, he already kidnapped
Keigan before.

359
00:22:01,992 --> 00:22:03,952
So if something bad
happens today,

360
00:22:04,473 --> 00:22:05,971
he'd go for Keiren.

361
00:22:06,202 --> 00:22:07,888
Yeah.

362
00:22:07,915 --> 00:22:09,683
Good thing he didn't take our phones yet.

363
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:11,904
We were able to roam
around the house,

364
00:22:12,002 --> 00:22:13,608
and I managed to contact Keifer.

365
00:22:14,296 --> 00:22:15,655
But I do know,

366
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:17,383
that if dad doesn't
get what he wants,

367
00:22:18,675 --> 00:22:19,968
he'll do whatever it takes.

368
00:22:26,308 --> 00:22:28,519
I'm begging you, Jay.

369
00:22:29,061 --> 00:22:30,646
If something happens,

370
00:22:31,855 --> 00:22:33,732
get Keiren out of here.

371
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,610
Keigan will bring you
guys both to safety.

372
00:22:37,528 --> 00:22:38,362
Okay?

373
00:22:38,904 --> 00:22:40,823
I'm scared.

374
00:22:41,073 --> 00:22:43,033
What do you mean "if something happens?”

375
00:22:43,033 --> 00:22:45,744
I'll leave you? Is something bad
going to happen?

376
00:22:45,744 --> 00:22:48,455
Jay, don't worry
about your friends.

377
00:22:48,455 --> 00:22:49,790
They'll be safe.

378
00:22:50,374 --> 00:22:52,751
But I can't make that
same promise to Keifer.

379
00:22:52,751 --> 00:22:54,002
What do you mean?

380
00:22:54,002 --> 00:22:56,713
- Keifer?
- Please, Jay. Just do what I say.

381
00:22:56,713 --> 00:22:57,714
Okay?

382
00:22:57,714 --> 00:22:59,800
Don't think about anything else.

383
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:01,802
Do this for Keiren.

384
00:23:02,136 --> 00:23:03,637
Do this for me.

385
00:23:06,598 --> 00:23:07,850
Okay.

386
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,476
I'll do it.

387
00:23:11,603 --> 00:23:12,633
Good.

388
00:23:13,397 --> 00:23:15,607
Keigan, you know what to do.

389
00:23:16,542 --> 00:23:18,252
Let's go back before
we get noticed.

390
00:23:18,277 --> 00:23:19,278
Come on.

391
00:23:33,917 --> 00:23:35,043
Let's go.

392
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,300
Keifer?

393
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,596
I fucking miss you.

394
00:23:47,598 --> 00:23:52,060
I know I've been busy lately, but…

395
00:23:52,603 --> 00:23:53,770
I promise

396
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:55,314
I'll make it up to you.

397
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,615
Please say something.

398
00:24:05,699 --> 00:24:07,159
Keifer.

399
00:24:27,304 --> 00:24:28,764
Thank you for being here.

400
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:41,652
Before you go.

401
00:24:57,834 --> 00:24:59,127
Shot!

402
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,437
Making yourself at home, huh?

403
00:25:01,713 --> 00:25:03,090
Where have you been, Jay?

404
00:25:03,423 --> 00:25:04,758
Just somewhere.

405
00:25:06,218 --> 00:25:07,219
So, are you going to tell him,

406
00:25:07,219 --> 00:25:09,555
or should I tell Keifer that you
already have a boyfriend?

407
00:25:10,264 --> 00:25:11,682
So should I tell him?

408
00:25:11,848 --> 00:25:12,766
Don't bother.

409
00:25:12,766 --> 00:25:13,815
What are you talking about?

410
00:25:14,309 --> 00:25:15,852
Oh, nothing.

411
00:25:16,687 --> 00:25:19,356
- He's just hungry.
- There's dessert!

412
00:25:19,356 --> 00:25:20,857
That's what I like.

413
00:25:21,275 --> 00:25:22,484
Give me some.

414
00:25:22,568 --> 00:25:23,860
Bro, can you give me some.

415
00:25:35,747 --> 00:25:37,291
Shh! Be quiet.

416
00:25:46,925 --> 00:25:48,218
So, Keifer,

417
00:25:48,218 --> 00:25:49,886
are you studying well?

418
00:25:50,387 --> 00:25:51,847
It's none of your business.

419
00:25:53,056 --> 00:25:55,726
I still have obligations toward
you and your siblings.

420
00:25:56,226 --> 00:25:57,644
Bullshit!

421
00:25:58,729 --> 00:26:00,105
Watch your language.

422
00:26:01,189 --> 00:26:03,025
You're in my house.

423
00:26:09,406 --> 00:26:12,200
You used to come here to pick Keifer up.

424
00:26:12,868 --> 00:26:15,037
Too bad, you're incomplete now.

425
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:20,417
Ella.

426
00:26:21,335 --> 00:26:23,086
Back then, you were with my son.

427
00:26:23,337 --> 00:26:24,838
Now, things seem different.

428
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:40,520
You.

429
00:26:41,647 --> 00:26:42,731
What's your name?

430
00:26:49,237 --> 00:26:51,782
Uh, Jasper Jean Mariano, Sir.

431
00:26:52,407 --> 00:26:53,575
You can call me Jay-jay.

432
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,244
Mariano…

433
00:26:58,121 --> 00:27:00,165
I think I have a business
partner named Mariano.

434
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:02,584
Who are your parents?

435
00:27:04,169 --> 00:27:05,295
Hey, jackass.

436
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,131
They're none of your business.

437
00:27:09,508 --> 00:27:11,677
I'm just asking her parents' names.

438
00:27:12,594 --> 00:27:15,138
There's nothing wrong with that, is there?

439
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:21,061
My father is Jasfher Mariano.

440
00:27:21,937 --> 00:27:24,439
My mother is Jeana Fernandez.

441
00:27:25,273 --> 00:27:27,317
The world really is small, huh?

442
00:27:28,485 --> 00:27:29,820
They have a child?

443
00:27:35,242 --> 00:27:38,370
You know, your father
sounds familiar to me.

444
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:41,456
He's a stockholder in our telecom
company, your mother too.

445
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:45,502
She's the sister of…

446
00:27:46,294 --> 00:27:47,302
what's her name?

447
00:27:50,173 --> 00:27:53,301
Gemma? Gemma Fernandez, right?

448
00:27:55,846 --> 00:27:56,847
Yes.

449
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,098
Okay.

450
00:27:58,765 --> 00:28:01,977
So you two are cousins, right?

451
00:28:05,147 --> 00:28:06,898
Wait, they had a child?

452
00:28:07,149 --> 00:28:08,150
I'm sorry.

453
00:28:08,403 --> 00:28:09,613
No offense meant.

454
00:28:09,693 --> 00:28:10,694
Because

455
00:28:11,367 --> 00:28:13,911
your mom is kind of tactless, isn't she?

456
00:28:28,128 --> 00:28:31,214
Oh my God, did you just
invite them over to insult?

457
00:28:33,383 --> 00:28:35,135
Why are you so affected?

458
00:28:37,137 --> 00:28:38,138
Just relax.

459
00:28:39,325 --> 00:28:40,974
What do you need from all of us?

460
00:28:41,475 --> 00:28:42,893
We still have classes.

461
00:28:44,019 --> 00:28:45,187
I'm glad you mentioned that.

462
00:28:45,729 --> 00:28:46,730
Bring me the papers.

463
00:28:50,927 --> 00:28:51,928
Sign them.

464
00:28:52,694 --> 00:28:54,738
If you don't sign it,

465
00:28:55,989 --> 00:28:57,991
I'll take full custody of Keiren.

466
00:28:58,575 --> 00:28:59,576
Or…

467
00:29:00,452 --> 00:29:02,245
give me your inheritance instead.

468
00:29:02,496 --> 00:29:04,080
That's my mom's money!

469
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,333
She worked hard for it,
and she gave it to me!

470
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:08,210
She doesn't have money!

471
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,881
She stole that from the
company, from me to be exact!

472
00:29:14,966 --> 00:29:16,468
I won't sign anything!

473
00:29:23,433 --> 00:29:24,684
If that's what you want.

474
00:29:55,006 --> 00:29:56,383
Keiren, run!

475
00:30:11,356 --> 00:30:12,858
Enough!

476
00:30:14,484 --> 00:30:15,819
Get down!

477
00:30:19,406 --> 00:30:20,699
Get them all out!

478
00:30:20,699 --> 00:30:21,992
Get out!

479
00:30:24,619 --> 00:30:25,620
Hurry up!

480
00:30:26,496 --> 00:30:27,497
Stand up!

481
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:29,624
Get out, hurry!

482
00:30:36,256 --> 00:30:37,841
Hurry up!

483
00:31:00,363 --> 00:31:02,324
Where's my son?

484
00:31:04,868 --> 00:31:05,869
Huh?!

485
00:31:09,164 --> 00:31:12,792
Did it really have to come to this?

486
00:31:17,797 --> 00:31:19,299
Bring out my son!

487
00:31:22,654 --> 00:31:23,655
This girl right here.

488
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,858
Jay!

489
00:31:25,221 --> 00:31:26,723
She knows where Keiren is.

490
00:31:26,973 --> 00:31:28,683
Yes, drinking coffee
in my pocket!

491
00:31:31,227 --> 00:31:32,812
In your pocket?

492
00:31:32,812 --> 00:31:34,064
Drinking coffee?

493
00:31:37,192 --> 00:31:39,027
I know what kind of woman you are.

494
00:31:39,569 --> 00:31:41,321
You're just after my son's money.

495
00:31:43,865 --> 00:31:44,866
And you…

496
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,078
you really take after your mother.

497
00:31:49,621 --> 00:31:51,081
You're so stubborn.

498
00:31:51,414 --> 00:31:52,624
You son of a bitch!

499
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:55,794
Watch your language.

500
00:31:56,127 --> 00:31:57,712
You're in my place.

501
00:31:59,965 --> 00:32:01,591
You won't bring my son out?

502
00:32:02,801 --> 00:32:04,094
Everyone, kneel!

503
00:32:04,094 --> 00:32:05,095
Get down on your knees!

504
00:32:09,182 --> 00:32:10,183
You think you're brave?

505
00:32:10,725 --> 00:32:11,977
Bring him here.

506
00:32:15,522 --> 00:32:16,523
Beat him up.

507
00:32:18,817 --> 00:32:19,818
Keifer!

508
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,328
Stop it! Have mercy.

509
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:32,080
Mercy?

510
00:32:32,872 --> 00:32:35,166
That word doesn't exist
in my son's vocabulary.

511
00:32:35,166 --> 00:32:37,127
He needs to be taught a lesson.

512
00:33:01,651 --> 00:33:03,862
You're all so brave, huh?

513
00:33:05,572 --> 00:33:07,240
So stubborn!

514
00:33:08,742 --> 00:33:10,410
You think you're tough, huh?

515
00:33:11,619 --> 00:33:13,496
You know what I need, don't you?

516
00:33:14,873 --> 00:33:15,874
The papers.

517
00:33:20,754 --> 00:33:21,827
You!

518
00:33:24,674 --> 00:33:25,675
Sign this!

519
00:33:26,217 --> 00:33:27,802
Keifer, don't!

520
00:33:47,197 --> 00:33:48,198
Keifer!

521
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:51,618
Don't.

522
00:33:54,704 --> 00:33:55,705
No.

523
00:34:02,796 --> 00:34:04,172
Go on, pull that trigger.

524
00:34:06,841 --> 00:34:08,042
Go ahead.

525
00:34:08,068 --> 00:34:09,569
Pull it.

526
00:34:09,594 --> 00:34:10,762
Jay, shut up!

527
00:34:12,222 --> 00:34:12,972
Do it.

528
00:34:12,972 --> 00:34:14,224
Jay, what are you doing?!

529
00:34:16,267 --> 00:34:17,352
Pull it already.

530
00:34:19,437 --> 00:34:20,897
You can't do it, can you?

531
00:34:23,066 --> 00:34:24,484
What do you think people will say

532
00:34:24,484 --> 00:34:27,946
when they find out a student
died because of a Watson?

533
00:34:29,697 --> 00:34:30,865
Wouldn't that ruin your name?

534
00:34:33,993 --> 00:34:36,496
Can you really kill a defenseless student?

535
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:41,417
What will your business partners say?

536
00:34:45,421 --> 00:34:47,340
What will all those people say

537
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,425
and what will my dad say?

538
00:34:54,973 --> 00:34:55,849
You're something else.

539
00:34:55,849 --> 00:34:56,933
You're brave.

540
00:34:59,394 --> 00:35:00,687
Put the gun down.

541
00:35:07,819 --> 00:35:10,488
Looks like I
underestimated all of you.

542
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:16,452
Well, class is adjourned.

543
00:35:17,245 --> 00:35:18,538
I'll see you all next time.

544
00:35:19,289 --> 00:35:20,290
Let's go boys.

545
00:35:44,439 --> 00:35:46,816
Jay!

546
00:35:48,318 --> 00:35:49,319
Are you okay?

547
00:35:49,444 --> 00:35:50,445
Good Lord.

548
00:35:51,196 --> 00:35:53,198
I thought I was going to die.

549
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,158
You were really brave earlier, Jay.

550
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,160
I'm proud of you.

551
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:58,353
Really?

552
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,246
Are you out of your mind?

553
00:36:01,122 --> 00:36:02,957
Do you know who you challenged?

554
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,085
That's Dylan!

555
00:36:06,085 --> 00:36:08,285
He’s a professional hitman!

556
00:36:10,462 --> 00:36:11,466
Where's Keiren?

557
00:36:12,008 --> 00:36:13,009
Keiren!

558
00:36:15,595 --> 00:36:16,596
Keifer!

559
00:36:21,227 --> 00:36:23,521
What are we still doing here?
Let's just leave.

560
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,691
Don't ever do that again.

561
00:36:29,192 --> 00:36:32,070
You just gave him a new idea
on what to do next!

562
00:36:35,073 --> 00:36:39,619
Next time, think before
taking some random action!

563
00:36:52,006 --> 00:36:53,675
Just let Keifer be.

564
00:36:53,675 --> 00:36:56,761
He's just worried about you, okay?

565
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,972
Felix, are you alright?

566
00:36:58,972 --> 00:37:00,223
It's okay, Jay.

567
00:37:05,603 --> 00:37:07,146
What a stressful day.

568
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:12,902
Oh wow, you're texting me
nonstop now?

569
00:37:13,319 --> 00:37:15,113
You were so mean earlier.

570
00:37:17,949 --> 00:37:18,950
Here.

571
00:37:19,575 --> 00:37:20,576
Look at this.

572
00:37:21,619 --> 00:37:23,663
This place looks cheap
and nice to live in.

573
00:37:23,663 --> 00:37:25,039
Check out this condo, Ci-N.

574
00:37:26,374 --> 00:37:27,959
- Right?
- Doesn't really suit my taste.

575
00:37:30,712 --> 00:37:33,756
Whatever. You really are
the King of Assholes.

576
00:37:35,133 --> 00:37:36,634
You're not going to answer that?

577
00:37:38,678 --> 00:37:40,096
Are you guys having an "LQ"?

578
00:37:42,181 --> 00:37:45,393
You're not even at L yet
and you're already at Q.

579
00:37:46,102 --> 00:37:47,103
What's "L"?

580
00:37:47,687 --> 00:37:48,688
Love.

581
00:37:49,397 --> 00:37:50,398
What's "Q"?

582
00:37:50,982 --> 00:37:51,983
Q?

583
00:37:54,652 --> 00:37:55,653
A booger!

584
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,031
Is it funny, huh?

585
00:37:58,364 --> 00:37:59,365
Whatever!

586
00:37:59,615 --> 00:38:01,868
Just go look for a place
to stay already!

587
00:38:01,868 --> 00:38:03,161
So you can finally leave!

588
00:38:04,245 --> 00:38:05,496
It's quarrel.

589
00:38:06,164 --> 00:38:07,498
Lovers' Quarrel.

590
00:38:07,498 --> 00:38:08,750
You and Keifer.

591
00:38:09,792 --> 00:38:11,169
We're not lovers.

592
00:38:11,419 --> 00:38:14,756
Exactly. You're not even at L
yet, already at Q.

593
00:38:15,173 --> 00:38:16,382
Moving fast, huh.

594
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:18,051
I don't know.

595
00:38:18,801 --> 00:38:20,470
I don't want to talk
about it right now.

596
00:38:21,971 --> 00:38:23,765
I almost died earlier, didn't I?

597
00:38:24,349 --> 00:38:25,892
And he was being so mean!

598
00:38:27,602 --> 00:38:30,772
I had a gun pointed at me and
I didn't even get a thank you?

599
00:38:33,024 --> 00:38:34,134
So annoying.

600
00:38:36,861 --> 00:38:38,363
Jay, Keifer asked me
to tell you something.

601
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,031
What?

602
00:38:41,407 --> 00:38:43,326
If you don't show up in 5 minutes,

603
00:38:43,326 --> 00:38:44,994
he said he'll talk to Angelo.

604
00:38:44,994 --> 00:38:46,262
What?

605
00:38:46,287 --> 00:38:50,208
He'll show up and talk?
What does that mean?

606
00:38:52,752 --> 00:38:54,170
Jay, he's downstairs.

607
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:55,797
- Downstairs?!
- Downstairs!

608
00:38:56,756 --> 00:38:58,216
- Hurry!
- Wait!

609
00:38:58,674 --> 00:38:59,867
Give me your Yogorino.

610
00:39:00,218 --> 00:39:02,136
- I'll eat that later!
- Go!

611
00:39:02,136 --> 00:39:03,429
I will eat that later!

612
00:39:43,177 --> 00:39:44,178
Jay.

613
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:45,680
I know you're mad, so…

614
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,306
please say something.

615
00:39:48,391 --> 00:39:50,518
So just because I'm mad,
I have to speak first?

616
00:39:50,518 --> 00:39:51,894
Is this about what I said earlier?

617
00:39:51,894 --> 00:39:54,689
And that's coming from the person who is
the reason why I'm mad in the first place!

618
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,649
At least you're aware!

619
00:39:56,649 --> 00:39:58,276
Now, you talk first.

620
00:39:58,276 --> 00:39:59,444
Why me?

621
00:39:59,444 --> 00:40:00,611
What should I tell you?

622
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:01,821
Tsss.

623
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:05,825
Apologize!

624
00:40:06,534 --> 00:40:07,243
Jay, look.

625
00:40:07,243 --> 00:40:08,619
I know I hurt your feelings,

626
00:40:09,203 --> 00:40:10,830
but what you did earlier was wrong.

627
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:12,331
What if Dylan has
done something?

628
00:40:12,331 --> 00:40:13,416
Did he? No, right?

629
00:40:13,416 --> 00:40:14,500
Still wrong!

630
00:40:15,543 --> 00:40:16,961
So what?

631
00:40:17,545 --> 00:40:18,921
That's my point!

632
00:40:19,338 --> 00:40:21,716
I already put my life on the line!

633
00:40:22,049 --> 00:40:24,719
And I don't even get a bit of credit?

634
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:26,137
Damn it.

635
00:40:26,137 --> 00:40:29,599
I should've just let you
sign that damn paper.

636
00:40:30,308 --> 00:40:31,309
What?!

637
00:40:31,517 --> 00:40:32,518
Three.

638
00:40:32,685 --> 00:40:33,686
What do you mean "three"?

639
00:40:34,187 --> 00:40:35,188
That was three words.

640
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:36,856
Profanity.

641
00:40:37,899 --> 00:40:40,067
- No!
- We had a deal.

642
00:40:41,444 --> 00:40:42,862
I know we had a deal,

643
00:40:43,112 --> 00:40:44,530
but since I'm mad,

644
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:45,907
kiss your own face!

645
00:40:47,774 --> 00:40:48,984
Fine, you win.

646
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:50,411
Thank you.

647
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:51,871
Thank you,

648
00:40:52,288 --> 00:40:54,749
for risking you life to
save me and my brothers.

649
00:40:54,749 --> 00:40:56,292
You worried me to death.

650
00:40:56,292 --> 00:40:57,418
Whatever!

651
00:40:58,169 --> 00:40:59,670
I'm still mad.

652
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,380
Huh? Why?

653
00:41:02,423 --> 00:41:03,716
Because I feel like

654
00:41:04,926 --> 00:41:07,094
I don't really know you that well.

655
00:41:09,764 --> 00:41:10,765
What do you mean?

656
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,729
What happened between
you and your dad.

657
00:41:18,981 --> 00:41:20,441
Okay fine, if you don't want to.

658
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,859
Fuck!

659
00:41:28,115 --> 00:41:29,174
Fuck!

660
00:41:29,867 --> 00:41:33,913
Traumatic would be an understatement 
to describe my childhood

661
00:41:33,913 --> 00:41:36,582
with the monster who
happens to be my father.

662
00:41:36,582 --> 00:41:40,962
Keifer, you lost to that
Hanamitchi kid again.

663
00:41:42,753 --> 00:41:45,591
When you show them that you're losing,

664
00:41:45,591 --> 00:41:48,594
they'll push you down even more.

665
00:41:48,594 --> 00:41:50,555
They'll use you.

666
00:41:50,555 --> 00:41:52,473
They'll break you.

667
00:41:55,434 --> 00:41:57,061
Mark Keifer Watson!

668
00:41:57,061 --> 00:41:58,312
To the Guidance Office!

669
00:41:58,312 --> 00:42:01,315
That's why the first time
I won against Yuri

670
00:42:01,315 --> 00:42:04,277
and we were taken to the
guidance office, I was happy

671
00:42:04,277 --> 00:42:06,571
because deep inside, I thought
my father would be proud of me.

672
00:42:06,571 --> 00:42:08,364
Why did you do that?

673
00:42:08,364 --> 00:42:10,658
Whatever it was, I apologize.

674
00:42:11,075 --> 00:42:12,577
If it really was my fault.

675
00:42:12,577 --> 00:42:14,954
I'm sorry Keifer, for what I've done.

676
00:42:18,916 --> 00:42:21,752
That was also the
first time I met Angelo.

677
00:42:23,129 --> 00:42:25,172
Angelo is as
terrifying as my father,

678
00:42:26,495 --> 00:42:28,676
- but that's where the comparison ends.
- You're brave, starting a fight like that.

679
00:42:28,676 --> 00:42:30,219
- Ouch!
- What?!

680
00:42:30,219 --> 00:42:31,512
He taught me to be strong

681
00:42:31,512 --> 00:42:33,472
and use that power
to protect others.

682
00:42:34,515 --> 00:42:36,976
Especially my loved ones.

683
00:42:36,976 --> 00:42:38,978
Serina! Where the hell are you?!

684
00:42:39,438 --> 00:42:40,896
Stay here for now, okay?

685
00:42:42,732 --> 00:42:43,733
What is this?

686
00:42:44,483 --> 00:42:46,819
That man had been hurting
my mom since I was young.

687
00:42:48,154 --> 00:42:50,740
You're stealing from me, huh?

688
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,617
He was always just
about the money.

689
00:42:52,617 --> 00:42:55,409
He'd accuse her of stealing from him.

690
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:57,204
And then he'd hurt her.

691
00:42:58,497 --> 00:42:59,624
He'd hurt us.

692
00:42:59,624 --> 00:43:02,001
Kaizer, the kids are here.

693
00:43:02,001 --> 00:43:03,711
Not here.

694
00:43:06,005 --> 00:43:07,381
Even you?

695
00:43:07,381 --> 00:43:08,758
When you were a kid?

696
00:43:09,675 --> 00:43:10,676
Yeah.

697
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,282
Damn, you dad did that?

698
00:43:17,975 --> 00:43:19,435
He hurt you too?

699
00:43:19,435 --> 00:43:21,979
My mom promised we'd leave soon.

700
00:43:21,979 --> 00:43:23,689
You really should leave.

701
00:43:23,689 --> 00:43:27,652
It's not good to stay in
a house with an abusive father.

702
00:43:27,985 --> 00:43:30,946
Angelo, teach me how to be strong.

703
00:43:30,946 --> 00:43:33,032
I want to fight for my mom.

704
00:43:36,243 --> 00:43:39,580
After three years, my mom,
Keigan, and I finally moved out.

705
00:43:39,914 --> 00:43:41,832
For a moment, I thought we were free.

706
00:43:42,792 --> 00:43:45,670
On the same year, we welcomed
a new member of our family,

707
00:43:46,472 --> 00:43:47,487
Keiren.

708
00:43:47,797 --> 00:43:48,887
Unfortunately,

709
00:43:49,033 --> 00:43:51,118
It also made my mom 
forgive my father,

710
00:43:51,801 --> 00:43:53,969
welcoming him back into our life.

711
00:43:54,332 --> 00:43:57,930
I braved a few more years
after Dad came back.

712
00:44:00,229 --> 00:44:01,828
But after Keiren was born,

713
00:44:01,852 --> 00:44:03,771
everything went back to how it was before.

714
00:44:05,272 --> 00:44:07,566
It even got worse.

715
00:44:08,499 --> 00:44:09,666
Keiren was 4,

716
00:44:09,957 --> 00:44:13,001
when my worst nightmare happened.

717
00:44:13,948 --> 00:44:15,491
You're such a meddler!

718
00:44:15,491 --> 00:44:16,992
It’s my father.

719
00:44:17,843 --> 00:44:20,184
I allowed that monster
to do this to my mom.

720
00:44:20,209 --> 00:44:21,806
That was inherited by your eldest child!

721
00:44:21,831 --> 00:44:25,751
I will never let him  take my siblings.

722
00:44:26,544 --> 00:44:28,003
Over my dead body.

723
00:44:28,003 --> 00:44:29,380
You're so greedy!

724
00:44:31,716 --> 00:44:32,717
What did you say?

725
00:44:33,718 --> 00:44:34,786
You're so fucking gree-

726
00:44:39,348 --> 00:44:39,890
Enough!

727
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:41,100
You're interfering again?!

728
00:44:46,522 --> 00:44:47,732
Why?

729
00:44:49,108 --> 00:44:51,944
What are you showing off for?
You're just my child!

730
00:44:51,944 --> 00:44:53,112
Do you understand?!

731
00:44:53,571 --> 00:44:56,115
You think you'll get the inheritance?

732
00:44:56,145 --> 00:45:01,108
Stupid, I'll die first before
you get all of that!

733
00:45:01,328 --> 00:45:02,747
Do you understand?!

734
00:45:09,086 --> 00:45:09,837
You go ahead!

735
00:45:09,837 --> 00:45:10,755
I’ll handle things here.

736
00:45:10,755 --> 00:45:12,757
- Mom, please. I won't leave you.
- Please, go.

737
00:45:12,757 --> 00:45:15,718
- Please, go.
- I won't leave you.

738
00:45:15,718 --> 00:45:16,798
It’s okay.

739
00:45:43,621 --> 00:45:45,164
My dad killed my mom.

740
00:45:46,499 --> 00:45:47,500
It was all him.

741
00:45:55,549 --> 00:45:56,550
Mom!

742
00:45:56,575 --> 00:45:58,243
Answer me please.

743
00:46:03,647 --> 00:46:04,648
Mom.

744
00:46:08,729 --> 00:46:12,858
But, I failed to protect my mom.

745
00:46:16,111 --> 00:46:18,072
And I can't let that happen.

746
00:46:18,906 --> 00:46:19,907
But now,

747
00:46:20,533 --> 00:46:22,159
I will do more.

748
00:46:22,952 --> 00:46:26,288
I will never let him take my siblings.

749
00:46:38,926 --> 00:46:41,720
You already know
he kidnapped Keigan before.

750
00:46:42,847 --> 00:46:45,683
And I still don't know
what really happened to him.

751
00:46:46,767 --> 00:46:48,143
And even after all that,

752
00:46:48,143 --> 00:46:49,812
he was never the same.

753
00:46:51,385 --> 00:46:52,982
It's all my fault.

754
00:46:54,024 --> 00:46:55,776
And now, he wants Keiren?

755
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,530
I can't let that happen.

756
00:47:01,073 --> 00:47:02,491
Do you understand?

757
00:47:05,327 --> 00:47:06,829
Hey.

758
00:47:07,246 --> 00:47:08,372
No.

759
00:47:08,372 --> 00:47:09,748
Sorry.

760
00:47:09,748 --> 00:47:11,292
No, Jay.

761
00:47:11,876 --> 00:47:13,752
I just can't help it.

762
00:47:15,629 --> 00:47:17,965
Your dad is horrible.

763
00:47:19,758 --> 00:47:23,429
I can't believe how much
you went through, Keifer.

764
00:47:27,349 --> 00:47:28,976
Jay, please stop crying.

765
00:47:29,935 --> 00:47:30,728
Please?

766
00:47:30,728 --> 00:47:31,937
You're so brave.

767
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:34,690
I thought…

768
00:47:36,942 --> 00:47:38,903
I thought my life story was already bad.

769
00:47:40,321 --> 00:47:42,239
Turns out yours is worse.

770
00:47:50,581 --> 00:47:52,166
How did you get Keigan back?

771
00:47:53,292 --> 00:47:54,585
I didn't.

772
00:47:56,462 --> 00:47:57,922
After a few years,

773
00:47:58,672 --> 00:47:59,673
he came back.

774
00:48:00,841 --> 00:48:03,344
With his new wife.

775
00:48:08,307 --> 00:48:09,975
That's when I had enough.

776
00:48:10,184 --> 00:48:12,019
And then, I forced him out.

777
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:16,231
How?

778
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:20,152
You're the only child who
kicked their own father out.

779
00:48:26,408 --> 00:48:27,993
It's getting late, we should go back.

780
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:32,581
But Jay…

781
00:48:33,457 --> 00:48:34,917
don't ever do that again.

782
00:48:36,627 --> 00:48:39,421
I won't let that man
touch the people I love.

783
00:48:40,255 --> 00:48:41,256
Including you.

784
00:48:48,514 --> 00:48:50,182
Maybe we could-

785
00:48:50,516 --> 00:48:51,892
No.

786
00:49:31,181 --> 00:49:32,349
Thank you.

787
00:49:35,731 --> 00:49:36,732
Bye.

788
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:39,313
- Good night.
- Good night. Take care.

789
00:49:51,201 --> 00:49:52,202
Bye.

790
00:50:11,346 --> 00:50:12,390
What?

791
00:50:14,016 --> 00:50:15,726
What was that?
Where have you been?

792
00:50:22,316 --> 00:50:23,484
So you're not gonna say anything?

793
00:50:24,443 --> 00:50:25,903
Jay, that's the second time.

794
00:50:26,403 --> 00:50:27,654
I've seen the one before it.

795
00:50:28,405 --> 00:50:29,406
Saw what?

796
00:50:29,406 --> 00:50:30,407
Jay.

797
00:50:33,952 --> 00:50:34,953
Jay-jay, seriously!

798
00:50:34,953 --> 00:50:36,330
Are you ever going
to get it together?

799
00:50:36,999 --> 00:50:38,333
I'm fine.

800
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:40,125
Are you even listening?

801
00:50:41,043 --> 00:50:42,586
What's going on between
you and Keifer?

802
00:50:45,058 --> 00:50:46,590
Make it clear then.

803
00:50:47,591 --> 00:50:49,760
Are you really pushing me
to my limit?

804
00:50:50,135 --> 00:50:51,553
No.

805
00:50:51,929 --> 00:50:55,265
Answer the question unless
you want me to tell Angelo.

806
00:51:02,898 --> 00:51:04,316
I don't know.

807
00:51:06,068 --> 00:51:08,946
We don't have a clear understanding
of what we are. We just like each other.

808
00:51:08,946 --> 00:51:10,864
Like each other?

809
00:51:11,448 --> 00:51:12,866
You actually believed that?

810
00:51:16,954 --> 00:51:18,455
He's just fooling you.

811
00:51:19,998 --> 00:51:21,298
You know what, Jay.

812
00:51:21,792 --> 00:51:23,252
You're so stupid.

813
00:51:24,336 --> 00:51:25,796
We're cousins.

814
00:51:26,088 --> 00:51:29,049
He's obviously using you
to get back at me.

815
00:51:34,346 --> 00:51:35,973
I don't believe you.

816
00:51:37,266 --> 00:51:38,684
You don't believe me.

817
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:43,480
What did he tell you,
"I love you, to infinity and beyond."?

818
00:51:44,523 --> 00:51:45,524
Huh?

819
00:51:46,692 --> 00:51:47,484
That's-

820
00:51:47,484 --> 00:51:49,862
Those were the exact words
he told you, am I right?

821
00:51:49,862 --> 00:51:51,280
I'm right, aren't I?

822
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,739
So predictable.

823
00:51:55,325 --> 00:51:57,244
Cause those are the exact words,

824
00:51:57,244 --> 00:51:58,954
that he told Ella.

825
00:53:14,613 --> 00:53:15,030
Hey!

826
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:16,323
You're too pretty, huh?

827
00:53:16,323 --> 00:53:18,825
You're engaged to Yuri,
but you also have Keifer?

828
00:53:21,161 --> 00:53:22,162
What's bothering you?

829
00:53:22,162 --> 00:53:23,622
I want to…

830
00:53:23,622 --> 00:53:25,207
I don't want to deceive Yuri anymore.

831
00:53:25,207 --> 00:53:26,875
I'm sorry, Yuri.

832
00:53:27,991 --> 00:53:30,326
Believe me, I really tried.

833
00:53:30,921 --> 00:53:32,339
But I still choose Keifer.

834
00:53:34,341 --> 00:53:35,342
Keifer…

835
00:53:35,342 --> 00:53:38,762
We still have enough time,
to figure out how to stop them.

836
00:53:39,429 --> 00:53:40,305
Ma'am!

837
00:53:40,305 --> 00:53:41,640
May I go out?

838
00:53:43,058 --> 00:53:44,268
Ms. Mariano!

839
00:53:44,268 --> 00:53:46,603
Actually ma'am, it's Mrs. Watson.

840
00:53:50,899 --> 00:53:56,405
Jasper Jean Mariano-Watson.

841
00:53:56,405 --> 00:53:57,406
Are you dating Keifer?

842
00:53:57,406 --> 00:53:58,865
- No.
- What about Yuri?

843
00:53:58,865 --> 00:54:00,200
Huh… I don't under-

844
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,494
I hope you don't regret
not choosing Yuri.

845
00:54:02,744 --> 00:54:04,288
Jay, get dressed.

846
00:54:04,288 --> 00:54:05,205
We're going somewhere.

847
00:54:06,331 --> 00:54:07,749
I want your full attention.

848
00:54:07,749 --> 00:54:08,583
Only mine.

849
00:54:08,583 --> 00:54:09,751
You're so funny.

850
00:54:12,087 --> 00:54:13,380
You're so ugly!
