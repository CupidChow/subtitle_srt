1
00:02:46,102 --> 00:02:47,896
He was drowning a while ago.

2
00:02:48,032 --> 00:02:49,032
Where have you been?

3
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:49,950
Angelo.

4
00:02:49,951 --> 00:02:51,494
Cyrus' parents called me.

5
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:53,663
They told me Cyrus and his friends
are in the hospital.

6
00:02:53,687 --> 00:02:54,829
Does that have anything to do with you?

7
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,373
What? Did your craziness act up again?

8
00:02:56,499 --> 00:02:57,374
I'm not crazy.

9
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:58,876
Nice one, Barracuda.

10
00:02:59,001 --> 00:03:02,505
I need a virgin to gain eternal life.

11
00:03:02,922 --> 00:03:04,214
Give her Ci-N!

12
00:03:04,215 --> 00:03:07,217
Remember what you told me before?

13
00:03:07,218 --> 00:03:10,554
That I need to forgive you even
if you guys did me dirty.

14
00:03:10,764 --> 00:03:11,930
Truth or dare?

15
00:03:11,931 --> 00:03:12,848
How about this, Yuri.

16
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:16,476
When do you plan on telling us about
your engagement with Jay-jay?

17
00:03:16,477 --> 00:03:18,770
- Huh?!
- Fuck! What else do we not know?

18
00:03:18,771 --> 00:03:20,080
Eren, hey!

19
00:03:20,105 --> 00:03:22,024
- Fuck!
- Fuck, get the fuck out of the way!

20
00:03:22,191 --> 00:03:23,692
Do you really love Jay-jay?

21
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:25,777
Ella, what are you talking about?
I don't understand you.

22
00:03:25,778 --> 00:03:28,447
That you're the one I loved,
and not Keifer!

23
00:03:29,093 --> 00:03:30,136
Aries, stop!

24
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,410
Jay, I still owe you.

25
00:03:33,445 --> 00:03:35,656
I was the one who arranged our engagement.

26
00:03:35,788 --> 00:03:36,871
I'm sorry.

27
00:03:36,872 --> 00:03:38,207
I just really love you.

28
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,694
Keifer?

29
00:03:40,167 --> 00:03:41,210
Keifer!

30
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,754
I'll pretend I didn't see anything.

31
00:05:24,438 --> 00:05:25,438
Jay.

32
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:28,692
Yuri!

33
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,739
I was the one who
arranged our engagement.

34
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:36,950
I'm sorry.

35
00:05:37,368 --> 00:05:38,827
I just really love you.

36
00:05:38,994 --> 00:05:39,994
Keifer?

37
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:42,373
I was looking for you all night.

38
00:05:47,544 --> 00:05:49,755
I'll pretend I didn't see anything.

39
00:05:51,298 --> 00:05:53,801
I’ve already talked to the school
board about what happened.

40
00:05:53,842 --> 00:05:55,302
You don’t have to worry.

41
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:56,398
I’ll take care of it.

42
00:05:56,595 --> 00:05:57,846
Aries needs to rest.

43
00:05:58,664 --> 00:05:59,974
Please don't stress him out.

44
00:06:01,092 --> 00:06:02,885
I need you to stay away from any trouble.

45
00:06:03,803 --> 00:06:06,430
Even just this once, for Aries' sake.

46
00:06:07,481 --> 00:06:08,649
Okay?

47
00:06:10,818 --> 00:06:12,277
Do you understand me, Jay?

48
00:06:14,446 --> 00:06:15,446
Yes.

49
00:06:15,823 --> 00:06:16,906
Good.

50
00:06:17,032 --> 00:06:18,409
Now I need to leave for a bit.

51
00:06:18,784 --> 00:06:20,327
But mom will be here later.

52
00:06:20,786 --> 00:06:22,413
You take care of Aries.

53
00:06:22,621 --> 00:06:23,711
Take care of him.

54
00:06:25,457 --> 00:06:27,418
We'll talk about
everything when I get back.

55
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:38,449
Right, a lot has happened.

56
00:06:39,722 --> 00:06:44,351
Aries got hurt, but I'm still
thinking about my own problems.

57
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,773
- Aries, stop!
- Aries!

58
00:06:50,691 --> 00:06:51,191
Stop.

59
00:06:51,316 --> 00:06:53,148
Didri't you beg me, huh?!

60
00:06:53,861 --> 00:06:56,196
Do you still have feelings for Yuri?

61
00:06:56,447 --> 00:06:57,447
It's not like that.

62
00:07:03,579 --> 00:07:07,416
Maybe you're also thinking
about everything that happened.

63
00:07:11,503 --> 00:07:12,503
No.

64
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,757
Please, no.

65
00:07:16,341 --> 00:07:17,342
Aries!

66
00:07:21,513 --> 00:07:23,098
Aries, it's good that you're awake.

67
00:07:27,186 --> 00:07:28,228
Good?

68
00:07:29,469 --> 00:07:30,804
Does anything hurt?

69
00:07:32,357 --> 00:07:33,776
Just please get out.

70
00:07:34,615 --> 00:07:35,908
- Why?
- Out!

71
00:07:38,906 --> 00:07:40,491
Why are you always mad at me?

72
00:07:40,741 --> 00:07:42,409
I'm just worried about you.

73
00:07:58,092 --> 00:07:59,551
I'm not mad at you

74
00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:03,060
I just don't understand why I'm the
only one who remembers everything.

75
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,581
Who I really am to you.

76
00:08:06,725 --> 00:08:08,352
What happened between us.

77
00:08:08,727 --> 00:08:10,354
What you did to me.

78
00:08:11,688 --> 00:08:13,857
Why am I the only one carrying all of this?

79
00:08:15,025 --> 00:08:16,568
It feels too heavy, Jay.

80
00:08:16,902 --> 00:08:18,946
Tag, you're it!

81
00:08:20,364 --> 00:08:23,242
Don't you remember that the
two of us lived under one roof?

82
00:08:23,367 --> 00:08:24,367
With your mom.

83
00:08:24,618 --> 00:08:25,702
Arie!

84
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,620
Aries!

85
00:08:27,621 --> 00:08:29,248
Where's mom?

86
00:08:30,082 --> 00:08:32,125
Let go. That's dirty.

87
00:08:32,126 --> 00:08:33,794
I'm just checking it out.

88
00:08:38,382 --> 00:08:39,675
Jay-jay.

89
00:08:40,175 --> 00:08:43,679
- Mom!
- Jay!

90
00:08:43,971 --> 00:08:45,055
What took you so long?

91
00:08:45,264 --> 00:08:48,475
I'm sorry, mom still had to work.
Did you miss me?

92
00:08:50,185 --> 00:08:52,019
Aries, prepare this.

93
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,690
That’s food.

94
00:08:55,065 --> 00:08:56,441
Look.

95
00:08:58,277 --> 00:08:59,277
Aries.

96
00:09:00,237 --> 00:09:04,116
Jay-jay, you should call him "kuya".

97
00:09:04,491 --> 00:09:08,203
Because Aries is older than you, okay?

98
00:09:08,495 --> 00:09:09,121
Say it again.

99
00:09:09,122 --> 00:09:11,330
- "Kuya"
- "Kuya" Aries.

100
00:09:11,331 --> 00:09:12,916
Very good.

101
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:17,421
Give mommy a kiss.

102
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,091
I'm your brother, Jay.

103
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,178
And your mom, is also my mother.

104
00:09:25,262 --> 00:09:27,305
You're not the only one who hates her.

105
00:09:27,306 --> 00:09:30,309
Because I've always felt the same way.

106
00:09:31,518 --> 00:09:36,064
The truth is, you were
the only one she loved.

107
00:09:44,907 --> 00:09:45,907
Give that to me.

108
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,760
You're still playing with my powder
when there's hardly any left!

109
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,663
You know that guy
really gets on my nerves.

110
00:09:51,872 --> 00:09:55,375
He thought he could butter
me up with his cheap tricks!

111
00:09:55,751 --> 00:09:56,627
What an animal.

112
00:09:56,628 --> 00:09:59,128
Turns out he had other intentions,

113
00:09:59,129 --> 00:10:01,631
that's why he kept giving
groceries and all that.

114
00:10:01,632 --> 00:10:02,549
What did he think?

115
00:10:02,575 --> 00:10:04,378
Just because my kids
have different fathers,

116
00:10:04,402 --> 00:10:05,995
he can win me over
with those things?

117
00:10:06,929 --> 00:10:08,471
I was getting there.

118
00:10:08,472 --> 00:10:09,932
You have a point.

119
00:10:10,432 --> 00:10:15,479
But why did you have to slam
that guy's head against the wall?

120
00:10:23,237 --> 00:10:24,904
That jerk slapped me!

121
00:10:24,905 --> 00:10:26,073
Look!

122
00:10:26,782 --> 00:10:29,993
Did he think that I'd
be scared of his abuse?

123
00:10:30,494 --> 00:10:32,371
So, what are you planning to do now?

124
00:10:32,454 --> 00:10:34,539
How are you going
to take care of the kids?

125
00:10:35,207 --> 00:10:36,708
You have kids, Jeana.

126
00:10:36,917 --> 00:10:38,037
Whatever, I'll deal with it.

127
00:10:38,252 --> 00:10:41,672
Maybe I'll just look for another job.
One where I can bring Jay-jay with me.

128
00:10:42,381 --> 00:10:45,132
Because Aries needs
to start school already.

129
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:46,133
He's big now.

130
00:10:46,176 --> 00:10:47,469
What about the money?

131
00:10:47,844 --> 00:10:53,350
You have to pay for school,
then buy supplies and uniforms.

132
00:10:54,309 --> 00:10:55,477
I still have some.

133
00:10:56,603 --> 00:10:57,603
Really?

134
00:10:58,814 --> 00:11:01,692
How long do you think
that money will last, huh?

135
00:11:02,442 --> 00:11:05,529
I don't know. You're so negative!

136
00:11:07,531 --> 00:11:09,366
Why don't you just go home?

137
00:11:09,825 --> 00:11:10,909
Go home,

138
00:11:11,076 --> 00:11:14,496
Then introduce your kids to your mother.

139
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:22,421
How many times do I have to tell you,
she isn't really my mother.

140
00:11:22,796 --> 00:11:27,175
I'm just my demonic
father's illegitimate child.

141
00:11:27,801 --> 00:11:30,761
She was just kind
enough to take me in.

142
00:11:30,762 --> 00:11:32,388
But no, I don't want to.

143
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:34,390
You said she's kind.

144
00:11:34,391 --> 00:11:37,685
If she's that kind, why not just go back?

145
00:11:37,686 --> 00:11:39,312
You shouldn't have left!

146
00:11:39,313 --> 00:11:40,439
I don't want it.

147
00:11:41,023 --> 00:11:42,232
And another thing,

148
00:11:42,691 --> 00:11:46,277
when I got pregnant with Aries,
my siblings talked so much behind my back.

149
00:11:46,278 --> 00:11:47,820
They said so many things.

150
00:11:47,821 --> 00:11:50,949
I just left, so I wouldn't
have to deal with them.

151
00:11:52,451 --> 00:11:54,411
Let's change the topic.

152
00:11:55,037 --> 00:11:59,124
Right, the money.
You need that, Jeana.

153
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:02,336
Just call Jay-jay's father.

154
00:12:02,461 --> 00:12:03,669
Isn't he rich?

155
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,672
Didn't he buy you that apartment?

156
00:12:06,048 --> 00:12:07,674
Just ask him for money.

157
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:09,759
Right?

158
00:12:16,016 --> 00:12:18,477
It's not good to eavesdrop
on adult conversations.

159
00:12:18,685 --> 00:12:20,103
Take care of Jay inside.

160
00:12:22,272 --> 00:12:23,607
Can I have some candy?

161
00:12:26,234 --> 00:12:28,820
Even if we have different fathers,

162
00:12:29,696 --> 00:12:31,364
I'm still your brother.

163
00:12:31,365 --> 00:12:32,991
We're siblings.

164
00:12:45,538 --> 00:12:47,415
You're burning up, Jay.

165
00:12:47,881 --> 00:12:49,206
Where's mom?

166
00:12:50,675 --> 00:12:51,926
She's not here yet.

167
00:12:51,997 --> 00:12:54,416
I want her.

168
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:56,138
Stop crying.

169
00:12:56,139 --> 00:13:01,853
I want to say that too.
That I want mom, but she's not here.

170
00:13:02,145 --> 00:13:04,231
I don't know where she is.

171
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,566
She'll be here soon.

172
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,911
But I got used to not having her around.

173
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,657
I'm hungry.

174
00:13:15,925 --> 00:13:18,678
I want to eat.

175
00:13:18,703 --> 00:13:20,955
What do you want?
I can buy biscuits.

176
00:13:20,956 --> 00:13:25,252
I don't want biscuits.
I want porridge.

177
00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:38,139
Porridge.

178
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:01,955
Where did you go?

179
00:14:02,581 --> 00:14:05,041
Didn't I tell you not to
leave your sister alone?

180
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:09,171
Jay-jay's fever is so high,
you're so stubborn!

181
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,233
It was supposed to be
my first day of school,

182
00:14:31,234 --> 00:14:33,569
but your stomach flu still
hadn’t gone away yet.

183
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,363
So we went to the hospital.

184
00:14:36,698 --> 00:14:39,074
She has urinary tract infection.

185
00:14:39,075 --> 00:14:43,705
This is what's causing her stomach
pain and high fever.

186
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:46,499
Girls are more prone to this.

187
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,462
Sometimes, it's due to improper cleaning
after using the bathroom,

188
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:53,215
or not drinking enough water.

189
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,174
In Jay-jay's case,

190
00:14:55,175 --> 00:15:00,013
are we making sure the child practices
proper hygiene and regular urination?

191
00:15:00,931 --> 00:15:02,474
Uhm, Doc...

192
00:15:04,392 --> 00:15:07,103
I'll go ahead now.
I'll come back later.

193
00:15:22,911 --> 00:15:24,913
Weren't you watching your sister?

194
00:15:25,747 --> 00:15:28,208
Why didn't you make Jay-jay drink water?

195
00:15:28,409 --> 00:15:29,701
That's not true.

196
00:15:31,336 --> 00:15:33,964
Stop doing that, it's irritating me.

197
00:15:34,506 --> 00:15:35,549
Stand up.

198
00:15:38,158 --> 00:15:39,909
You're not going to school for now, okay?

199
00:15:40,136 --> 00:15:41,137
Why?

200
00:15:41,513 --> 00:15:42,513
What do you mean why?

201
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:44,515
We don't have any money left.

202
00:15:44,516 --> 00:15:46,016
What am I supposed to give you
for allowance?

203
00:15:46,017 --> 00:15:48,103
How am I supposed to pay
for these hospital bills?

204
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,938
But I want to go to school.

205
00:15:50,939 --> 00:15:54,568
If you really wanted to,
you should've taken care of Jay-jay.

206
00:15:56,778 --> 00:15:59,113
I want to go to school!

207
00:15:59,114 --> 00:16:00,990
You're such a stubborn kid!

208
00:16:00,991 --> 00:16:02,324
You're really so stubborn!

209
00:16:02,325 --> 00:16:04,326
You never listen to me, huh?

210
00:16:04,327 --> 00:16:05,619
Such a brat!

211
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:08,539
I already told you,
you're not going to school!

212
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,374
Do you understand me, Aries?

213
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,377
You're so stubborn!

214
00:16:12,586 --> 00:16:14,795
Listen to me, you're not going to school!

215
00:16:14,796 --> 00:16:15,876
What are you trying to say?

216
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,881
You're such a brat!

217
00:16:17,882 --> 00:16:19,884
Why are you hurting the child?

218
00:16:23,903 --> 00:16:25,739
I'm just disciplining him.

219
00:16:32,003 --> 00:16:34,506
It was the first time I saw grandma.

220
00:16:35,739 --> 00:16:39,034
The first time I had
someone on my side.

221
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:44,576
Mom, where are we?

222
00:16:45,285 --> 00:16:46,645
We're at your grandmother's place.

223
00:16:46,786 --> 00:16:47,871
You stay here first, okay?

224
00:16:48,121 --> 00:16:49,121
Only me?

225
00:16:49,414 --> 00:16:51,041
What about Jay-jay?

226
00:16:51,249 --> 00:16:54,085
You can't even take care of your sister.

227
00:16:56,921 --> 00:16:58,506
Grandma.

228
00:17:06,123 --> 00:17:07,208
Jeana.

229
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,781
What are they doing here?

230
00:17:10,806 --> 00:17:12,515
Ah, they'll be staying here for now.

231
00:17:12,687 --> 00:17:16,664
So that Aries can have some company.

232
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:17,890
Oh, I see.

233
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:22,572
Mom, why isn't Jay-jay here?

234
00:17:26,493 --> 00:17:27,869
Have some shame.

235
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,581
Stop it. Don't cry.

236
00:17:31,896 --> 00:17:35,185
Stop crying already.

237
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:37,145
You're going to be with us.

238
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,213
Me, and your Kuya Angelo.

239
00:17:39,214 --> 00:17:42,425
I’m your Auntie Gemma,
your mom’s sister.

240
00:17:42,967 --> 00:17:44,427
What's your name again?

241
00:17:45,845 --> 00:17:47,971
Aries.

242
00:17:47,972 --> 00:17:49,848
Aries, don't cry, okay?

243
00:17:49,849 --> 00:17:51,643
You'll stay here with us.

244
00:17:54,312 --> 00:17:55,312
Aries.

245
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,482
Why so thin? I can easily break your bones.

246
00:17:58,483 --> 00:18:00,527
- Shh.
- Hey, watch it.

247
00:18:00,985 --> 00:18:02,570
Don't talk to him like that.

248
00:18:02,821 --> 00:18:05,489
Aries, he's your Kuya Angelo, okay?

249
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,491
Remember that.

250
00:18:06,991 --> 00:18:08,176
Alright then.

251
00:18:08,201 --> 00:18:11,620
Aries, behave while you're here.

252
00:18:11,621 --> 00:18:12,747
Be good.

253
00:18:13,456 --> 00:18:18,420
You'll come back for me once
Jay-jay gets better, right?

254
00:18:22,257 --> 00:18:23,466
I'll go ahead.

255
00:18:30,473 --> 00:18:33,935
Mom!

256
00:18:35,478 --> 00:18:37,604
That was probably the last time

257
00:18:37,605 --> 00:18:40,399
I got to call her "mom".

258
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,694
And Grandma, and...

259
00:18:47,198 --> 00:18:48,198
Pst!

260
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,200
Hey.

261
00:18:51,578 --> 00:18:52,871
Do you want to play?

262
00:18:54,727 --> 00:18:56,541
Are you still waiting for your mom?

263
00:18:58,782 --> 00:19:00,422
Looks like she's not coming back anymore.

264
00:19:01,337 --> 00:19:02,756
You poor thing.

265
00:19:07,802 --> 00:19:09,179
Aries.

266
00:19:10,638 --> 00:19:12,432
I have something to tell you.

267
00:19:13,641 --> 00:19:15,226
Do you want...

268
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,811
to live with me instead?

269
00:19:17,812 --> 00:19:22,650
I'll enroll you in the same school
as Angelo, so you can be together.

270
00:19:23,151 --> 00:19:26,738
And when your sister gets better,
then I'll bring you back to them.

271
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,877
I don't want to.
I want to be with Jay-jay.

272
00:19:33,244 --> 00:19:37,582
No, Mom will come back for me.

273
00:19:38,082 --> 00:19:40,667
Come on, Aries. Just stay with us.

274
00:19:40,668 --> 00:19:41,961
Say yes already.

275
00:19:46,633 --> 00:19:48,468
Mom!

276
00:19:49,844 --> 00:19:51,638
I told you so.

277
00:19:51,805 --> 00:19:53,765
My mom will come get me.

278
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:56,434
Are we going home now?

279
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,395
Aries, listen to me, okay?

280
00:20:00,078 --> 00:20:02,789
You'll stay with Aunt Gemma for now.

281
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:05,594
She'll send you to school.

282
00:20:06,069 --> 00:20:11,741
She'll buy you lots of toys,
clothes, and feed you good food.

283
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,828
You already told me that before.

284
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:17,681
It's because I'm responsible
for Jay-jay, right?

285
00:20:17,997 --> 00:20:21,417
She's the only one you love.
You're just giving me away.

286
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,711
You don't love me.

287
00:20:24,212 --> 00:20:25,964
Aries, that's not true.

288
00:20:26,965 --> 00:20:29,926
You're still young,
you wouldn't understand just yet.

289
00:20:30,301 --> 00:20:32,971
You're just giving me away!

290
00:20:33,847 --> 00:20:35,974
She's the only one you love.

291
00:20:45,984 --> 00:20:48,945
Jay-jay...

292
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,367
Don't cry.

293
00:20:55,326 --> 00:20:57,161
Jay-jay!

294
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:01,374
My sister!

295
00:21:01,457 --> 00:21:04,377
Stop crying, Aries, I'm here.

296
00:21:16,848 --> 00:21:21,059
But the day eventually came
when I finally got news about you, Jay.

297
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:24,355
When you got better,
and you recovered.

298
00:21:27,572 --> 00:21:30,116
I was so happy then.

299
00:21:30,528 --> 00:21:31,987
I came to visit you from time to time.

300
00:21:31,988 --> 00:21:36,533
But my desire to live with you faded,

301
00:21:36,534 --> 00:21:38,953
because a lot had changed.

302
00:21:40,405 --> 00:21:42,907
Your mom remarried.

303
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:45,335
I grew up too. I matured.

304
00:21:45,835 --> 00:21:47,545
We eventually grew apart.

305
00:21:48,296 --> 00:21:53,383
I later found out that you moved
to a house closer to grandma's.

306
00:21:53,384 --> 00:21:56,596
So, I was able to see you again.

307
00:21:57,446 --> 00:21:59,265
And I was happy with how things were.

308
00:21:59,766 --> 00:22:02,477
You could already say my name properly.

309
00:22:03,686 --> 00:22:04,771
Aries!

310
00:22:05,396 --> 00:22:06,230
Who is she?

311
00:22:06,231 --> 00:22:07,732
You called me your cousin.

312
00:22:08,066 --> 00:22:09,191
He's my cousin.

313
00:22:09,192 --> 00:22:12,946
I couldn't understand why
you thought that way, but...

314
00:22:13,404 --> 00:22:16,741
I know you were only three when I left.

315
00:22:16,866 --> 00:22:23,413
But I never thought
you'd forget me so quickly.

316
00:22:23,414 --> 00:22:24,808
You're not wearing your slippers again?

317
00:22:24,832 --> 00:22:25,541
Where is it?

318
00:22:25,667 --> 00:22:28,002
What was that?
Are you speaking in English?

319
00:22:28,336 --> 00:22:29,671
Where are your slippers?

320
00:22:29,963 --> 00:22:33,216
Ah, they threw them onto
the roof of the plaza.

321
00:22:33,841 --> 00:22:34,926
Them or you?

322
00:22:36,302 --> 00:22:37,302
Both.

323
00:22:37,595 --> 00:22:38,595
You know what?

324
00:22:38,846 --> 00:22:40,556
Before, you were always sick.

325
00:22:41,224 --> 00:22:43,664
Now, you're so mischievous.
You always wander around now, too.

326
00:22:44,268 --> 00:22:46,979
Good thing I found you here.
What if you got lost?

327
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,147
I won't get lost.

328
00:22:49,148 --> 00:22:51,317
The plaza is my favorite place to go to.

329
00:22:51,567 --> 00:22:54,779
It's nice here,
lots of kids are playing.

330
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,001
Here, wear this.

331
00:23:08,876 --> 00:23:10,854
Wear this first. I don't like
seeing you barefoot, okay?

332
00:23:10,878 --> 00:23:12,005
It's too big.

333
00:23:13,339 --> 00:23:14,339
Don't be picky.

334
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,425
Come on, hurry up.

335
00:23:16,342 --> 00:23:19,219
Your shoes will get dirty,
because my feet are dirty.

336
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:22,598
If you don't want those to get dirty,
then don't walk barefoot.

337
00:23:23,224 --> 00:23:24,517
So you won't get dirty either.

338
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,396
Hurry up.

339
00:23:35,945 --> 00:23:37,071
There.

340
00:23:39,323 --> 00:23:40,323
Get on.

341
00:23:44,328 --> 00:23:45,328
Can you do it?

342
00:23:46,956 --> 00:23:47,665
Yes.

343
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:48,915
I'll take the stand off now, okay?

344
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:49,916
Go.

345
00:23:51,794 --> 00:23:52,794
Let's go.

346
00:23:52,795 --> 00:23:53,795
Hey.

347
00:23:54,047 --> 00:23:55,840
- What?
- What's this?

348
00:23:56,174 --> 00:23:57,174
It hurts.

349
00:23:57,216 --> 00:23:59,343
That's nothing, don't mind it.

350
00:23:59,886 --> 00:24:00,970
Where did that come from?

351
00:24:03,097 --> 00:24:05,349
Is your stepfather hurting you?

352
00:24:05,808 --> 00:24:06,808
I'll head home.

353
00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:08,728
Let's ride our bikes tomorrow.

354
00:24:23,451 --> 00:24:26,370
That day, I kept seeing
that car everywhere.

355
00:24:26,871 --> 00:24:28,081
Until I saw it at school,

356
00:24:28,372 --> 00:24:30,249
and wherever I went.

357
00:24:40,635 --> 00:24:42,553
I have to go home now.

358
00:24:43,805 --> 00:24:46,807
It's late, I might get scolded
by my mom. [In Japanese]

359
00:24:46,808 --> 00:24:47,809
[in Japanese] Mom?

360
00:24:48,184 --> 00:24:50,103
That's mother in nihongo.

361
00:24:52,563 --> 00:24:55,358
Is that your ride, Aries? Who's that?

362
00:25:10,081 --> 00:25:11,791
That man is still there.

363
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:13,835
Always following us.

364
00:25:19,882 --> 00:25:21,050
Mom?

365
00:25:21,259 --> 00:25:23,761
Aries, where are you?

366
00:25:24,913 --> 00:25:27,164
You need to come home right away.
We're going to your grandma.

367
00:25:27,306 --> 00:25:28,474
Why?

368
00:25:28,963 --> 00:25:30,923
Your sister is missing, Aries.

369
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:34,772
What happened?

370
00:25:41,612 --> 00:25:43,780
We weren’t able to find you that night.

371
00:25:43,805 --> 00:25:45,849
But I didn’t give up.

372
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:57,253
I don't know why it didn't immediately
occur to me to go to your favorite plaza.

373
00:25:59,255 --> 00:26:02,049
Because everything
suddenly became a mess.

374
00:26:03,384 --> 00:26:07,929
I found out from mom and grandma
that they were physically abusing you,

375
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:10,892
all the men who've been with your mom.

376
00:26:15,923 --> 00:26:18,760
They said you just ran away,
blood on your clothes,

377
00:26:19,609 --> 00:26:21,694
and no slippers on.

378
00:26:54,268 --> 00:26:55,519
Jay!

379
00:26:55,853 --> 00:26:57,104
Aries.

380
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,981
Jay!

381
00:27:00,691 --> 00:27:01,691
Jay-jay!

382
00:27:09,617 --> 00:27:10,660
Jay.

383
00:27:11,911 --> 00:27:16,874
If only I told them right away about
what I saw on your neck,

384
00:27:17,708 --> 00:27:19,068
would you have ended up like this?

385
00:27:20,127 --> 00:27:21,712
Mom is at the police station,

386
00:27:22,046 --> 00:27:24,005
they said that the guy
who did this to you is already dead.

387
00:27:24,006 --> 00:27:26,050
The reason for all this chaos.

388
00:27:26,259 --> 00:27:28,927
It's clearly a sign of traumatic disorder.

389
00:27:28,928 --> 00:27:33,432
Dissociative amnesia can sometimes
be experienced by the victim.

390
00:27:35,184 --> 00:27:37,770
How long will she stay like this?

391
00:27:39,563 --> 00:27:45,360
It depends, but I suggest that
the child be brought to a psychologist

392
00:27:45,361 --> 00:27:47,321
for treatment of her trauma.

393
00:27:47,655 --> 00:27:50,408
Some wounds aren't physical.

394
00:27:50,533 --> 00:27:51,659
What's important is that

395
00:27:51,951 --> 00:27:55,413
we don't force her to remember
what she's not ready to face yet.

396
00:27:55,788 --> 00:27:57,373
It might be harmful to her.

397
00:27:57,832 --> 00:27:58,832
Thank you.

398
00:27:58,833 --> 00:28:00,250
- Thank you, Doc.
- I’ll go ahead.

399
00:28:00,251 --> 00:28:01,752
I'll walk you out.

400
00:28:06,382 --> 00:28:07,466
Jay,

401
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:12,054
get some rest for now.

402
00:28:12,638 --> 00:28:13,764
Yes.

403
00:28:32,992 --> 00:28:34,410
What are you doing?

404
00:28:35,369 --> 00:28:38,539
What did they treat on my back?

405
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:42,501
You have wounds.

406
00:28:44,086 --> 00:28:45,963
Where did I get hurt?

407
00:28:46,589 --> 00:28:47,923
Why don't I know?

408
00:28:50,718 --> 00:28:52,344
You'll remember eventually.

409
00:28:54,722 --> 00:28:57,516
Just rest, so you can recover faster.

410
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:05,710
Where's mom?

411
00:29:07,151 --> 00:29:08,486
I don't know.

412
00:29:08,903 --> 00:29:10,488
But maybe she's on her way.

413
00:29:11,614 --> 00:29:14,075
I'll tell you when she's here, okay?

414
00:29:14,776 --> 00:29:16,903
Thank you.

415
00:29:25,127 --> 00:29:27,797
After that, you started
living with grandma.

416
00:29:28,506 --> 00:29:30,548
Both of us were now
separated from our mother.

417
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:32,843
So, I wondered...

418
00:29:34,136 --> 00:29:35,804
whose fault was this, really?

419
00:29:35,805 --> 00:29:38,056
Mine or mom's?

420
00:29:38,057 --> 00:29:41,811
Or did all of us have our own problems,
which is why we were never okay?

421
00:29:44,021 --> 00:29:45,647
What if something bad happened?

422
00:29:45,648 --> 00:29:46,982
You’ve got a bigger problem!

423
00:29:47,233 --> 00:29:49,068
Many years passed..

424
00:29:49,707 --> 00:29:51,751
And a lot happened
to me, and to you.

425
00:29:53,114 --> 00:29:55,533
There are many things
I still don't understand.

426
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:01,414
Are you listening?

427
00:30:02,206 --> 00:30:05,543
Damn it, you're a girl and
you're getting into fistfights?

428
00:30:06,502 --> 00:30:07,420
Do you even think?

429
00:30:07,421 --> 00:30:09,130
That's enough, stop it.

430
00:30:10,631 --> 00:30:11,631
Jay?

431
00:30:14,844 --> 00:30:16,970
I'm not done yet! Get back here!

432
00:30:16,971 --> 00:30:18,431
Angelo.

433
00:30:19,265 --> 00:30:22,476
- Hey, Aries.
- I'll follow her.

434
00:30:23,352 --> 00:30:24,770
Talk to her.

435
00:30:42,288 --> 00:30:43,289
Are you Jay-jay?

436
00:30:43,831 --> 00:30:44,697
Yes.

437
00:30:44,722 --> 00:30:45,842
You live around here, right?

438
00:30:46,917 --> 00:30:48,377
Maybe you know my son?

439
00:30:48,794 --> 00:30:50,504
- Can you help me, please?
- Your son?

440
00:30:50,796 --> 00:30:51,796
Yes, Aries.

441
00:30:51,797 --> 00:30:53,466
Jay-jay?

442
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:56,010
- You're the father of Aries?
- Jay-jay!

443
00:30:59,805 --> 00:31:00,805
Let go of her!

444
00:31:02,725 --> 00:31:04,477
Get inside!

445
00:31:05,462 --> 00:31:06,588
Hold him, hurry!

446
00:31:08,105 --> 00:31:09,105
Get inside!

447
00:31:37,968 --> 00:31:38,968
Jay?

448
00:31:39,345 --> 00:31:40,513
Jay, where are you?

449
00:31:40,804 --> 00:31:41,847
Aries?

450
00:31:43,349 --> 00:31:44,807
Aries, where are you?

451
00:31:44,808 --> 00:31:47,353
Where did those men take us?

452
00:31:47,811 --> 00:31:48,787
Jay.

453
00:31:48,812 --> 00:31:50,689
Jay-jay, did they hurt you?

454
00:31:51,273 --> 00:31:52,525
No.

455
00:32:00,282 --> 00:32:01,282
Here's some food.

456
00:32:01,367 --> 00:32:03,786
I'm sure you're both very hungry.

457
00:32:05,996 --> 00:32:07,206
Who are you?

458
00:32:12,625 --> 00:32:13,876
Aries?

459
00:32:14,755 --> 00:32:16,382
Our names are pretty similar.

460
00:32:18,509 --> 00:32:20,718
Your mother really took it seriously,

461
00:32:20,719 --> 00:32:22,513
never introducing me to you.

462
00:32:24,807 --> 00:32:28,227
Just from my name alone,
you should know who I am.

463
00:32:29,478 --> 00:32:30,604
Right.

464
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:35,818
I recognized him because he was
the guy who used to follow me.

465
00:32:35,985 --> 00:32:36,986
You guys eat, okay?

466
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,506
Eat until you're full.

467
00:32:41,824 --> 00:32:42,824
I'll be back.

468
00:32:53,127 --> 00:32:56,296
That was the first
time I met my father.

469
00:32:56,297 --> 00:33:00,384
I've thought about meeting
my real father many times,

470
00:33:00,509 --> 00:33:02,779
and I've always wanted you to be
beside me when it happened.

471
00:33:02,803 --> 00:33:05,931
But I never imagined it
would happen like this.

472
00:33:06,348 --> 00:33:09,893
I never wished for it to be this way.

473
00:33:12,479 --> 00:33:13,564
I'm sorry,

474
00:33:14,231 --> 00:33:16,065
but I'm really desperate.

475
00:33:16,066 --> 00:33:16,917
Jay.

476
00:33:16,942 --> 00:33:19,819
The ransom I'm asking for is just
spare change to Angelo.

477
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,820
Please, Jay, wake up.

478
00:33:20,988 --> 00:33:22,448
So, come on. Let's go.

479
00:33:23,532 --> 00:33:24,700
I said let's go.

480
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:26,327
Let's go!

481
00:33:26,535 --> 00:33:28,324
I'm not going with
you! I won't leave Jay-jay!

482
00:33:28,348 --> 00:33:29,296
You're so stubborn!

483
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:30,950
You're really stubborn, huh?

484
00:33:31,457 --> 00:33:32,540
Come with me!

485
00:33:32,541 --> 00:33:34,001
- Let’s go!
- I'm not going with you!

486
00:33:34,376 --> 00:33:36,253
What are you doing?!

487
00:33:44,803 --> 00:33:45,803
Jay!

488
00:33:46,138 --> 00:33:46,722
Jay!

489
00:33:46,723 --> 00:33:49,515
- There's blood?!
- Relax. Don't be scared.

490
00:33:49,516 --> 00:33:51,310
I told you to come with me already!

491
00:33:51,477 --> 00:33:52,477
You kids are so stubborn!

492
00:33:52,502 --> 00:33:54,837
You're both so hard-headed!

493
00:33:55,131 --> 00:33:56,706
You should obey right away!

494
00:34:06,408 --> 00:34:07,408
Jay.

495
00:34:07,951 --> 00:34:09,453
Jay, what’s happening to you?

496
00:34:11,705 --> 00:34:12,706
Jay?

497
00:34:19,797 --> 00:34:21,590
You’re useless!

498
00:34:22,758 --> 00:34:24,551
You’re nothing but a burden!

499
00:34:25,594 --> 00:34:27,388
Fuck you!

500
00:34:34,728 --> 00:34:35,813
Jay?

501
00:34:41,902 --> 00:34:43,195
You'll hurt me too.

502
00:34:44,238 --> 00:34:45,364
All of you!

503
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:45,989
Jay?

504
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:46,949
It's me!

505
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:48,409
You'll hurt me too.

506
00:34:48,826 --> 00:34:49,826
Jay.

507
00:34:50,327 --> 00:34:51,661
All of you.

508
00:34:51,662 --> 00:34:53,789
Jay, don't you recognize me?

509
00:34:58,836 --> 00:34:59,837
Jay, it's me.

510
00:35:04,258 --> 00:35:06,468
You’re all going to hurt me!

511
00:35:08,387 --> 00:35:09,387
Jay.

512
00:35:10,806 --> 00:35:11,806
Jay.

513
00:35:14,435 --> 00:35:16,937
I won't do that to you, Jay.

514
00:35:24,528 --> 00:35:26,822
You will all hurt me.

515
00:35:28,365 --> 00:35:30,284
I won't do that to you.

516
00:35:30,576 --> 00:35:31,576
Jay.

517
00:35:33,704 --> 00:35:34,830
Jay.

518
00:35:36,457 --> 00:35:37,457
Jay.

519
00:35:51,597 --> 00:35:52,597
Jay.

520
00:36:00,664 --> 00:36:04,125
I still don’t know why
you did that to me, Jay.

521
00:36:05,277 --> 00:36:07,069
It hurts so much.

522
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,864
Why?

523
00:36:30,552 --> 00:36:33,889
I spent a month in the
hospital just to recover.

524
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:38,018
But I didn't know what to
feel towards you then.

525
00:36:38,672 --> 00:36:46,388
Fear? Anxiety? All I was sure of was
I wasn't ready to you see you just yet.

526
00:36:48,403 --> 00:36:52,199
The handsome guys are here!

527
00:36:52,825 --> 00:36:54,575
Aries. What's up, bro?
How are you?

528
00:36:54,576 --> 00:36:55,993
Looks like you just got circumcised, huh?

529
00:36:55,994 --> 00:36:56,787
Asshole!

530
00:36:56,788 --> 00:36:58,205
- Ouch!
- Give that to me.

531
00:36:58,956 --> 00:37:00,582
I'm just going to take a look.

532
00:37:01,917 --> 00:37:02,918
Are you okay?

533
00:37:03,836 --> 00:37:05,127
I'm okay.

534
00:37:05,128 --> 00:37:08,131
The doctor said,
I have one week more to go.

535
00:37:08,549 --> 00:37:10,800
Before full recovery,
and my lungs are okay now.

536
00:37:10,801 --> 00:37:12,261
I'll be discharged soon.

537
00:37:14,471 --> 00:37:15,551
Here, I'll take it out now.

538
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:17,432
- Take it out.
- Here.

539
00:37:18,642 --> 00:37:20,227
- It's so good.
- Yuck, wait a second.

540
00:37:20,936 --> 00:37:22,104
There.

541
00:37:22,646 --> 00:37:24,606
I stole this from the guard downstairs.

542
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:25,607
Okay, fine.

543
00:37:25,608 --> 00:37:26,608
We're gonna eat here.

544
00:37:26,859 --> 00:37:28,068
- Okay?
- Okay.

545
00:37:29,611 --> 00:37:32,238
There.

546
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:33,365
Wait a minute.

547
00:37:34,241 --> 00:37:35,491
We rehearsed this.

548
00:37:35,492 --> 00:37:36,869
This is what we practiced.

549
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,954
- Hey, our harmonization.
- Okay, game.

550
00:37:39,955 --> 00:37:41,122
- Watch this.
- Everyone.

551
00:37:41,123 --> 00:37:43,333
3, 2, 1. Go.

552
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:49,714
♪ Happy recovery to you. ♪

553
00:37:49,715 --> 00:37:54,510
♪ Happy recovery to you.. ♪

554
00:37:54,511 --> 00:38:00,225
♪ Happy recovery, happy recovery... ♪

555
00:38:00,517 --> 00:38:05,730
♪ Happy recovery to you... ♪

556
00:38:05,731 --> 00:38:07,231
You guys are so corny.

557
00:38:07,232 --> 00:38:09,525
- There's even a candle.
- He's gonna blow it out!

558
00:38:09,526 --> 00:38:10,816
Just do it.

559
00:38:10,861 --> 00:38:11,320
Come on.

560
00:38:11,321 --> 00:38:12,361
- Just do it.
- Go.

561
00:38:12,362 --> 00:38:13,362
Okay, okay.

562
00:38:14,573 --> 00:38:15,699
I beat you to it.

563
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,074
You’re such an asshole, Percy.

564
00:38:19,995 --> 00:38:20,829
Come on.

565
00:38:20,829 --> 00:38:21,455
Let's eat.

566
00:38:21,455 --> 00:38:22,164
Shall we?

567
00:38:22,164 --> 00:38:23,056
Alright.

568
00:38:23,081 --> 00:38:24,081
Ready?

569
00:38:26,084 --> 00:38:28,002
That surprised me.

570
00:38:28,003 --> 00:38:29,546
Come on, let's eat.

571
00:38:41,475 --> 00:38:43,685
This part is mine, okay?

572
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,272
Bro, split it fairly.

573
00:38:47,773 --> 00:38:48,982
Like half.

574
00:38:50,317 --> 00:38:51,317
Who's that?

575
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:55,197
- No one.
- Who's the girl by the door a while ago?

576
00:38:56,198 --> 00:38:57,198
No one.

577
00:38:58,659 --> 00:38:59,910
You even brought that.

578
00:39:01,078 --> 00:39:03,663
But we didn't even bother to bring a knife.
How am I supposed to cut this?

579
00:39:03,664 --> 00:39:06,064
- Let's just use our hands.
- You might not light it anymore.

580
00:39:15,092 --> 00:39:16,134
Aries.

581
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,429
How are you?

582
00:39:22,766 --> 00:39:26,144
I want to visit you all the time,
but you always have visitors.

583
00:39:33,235 --> 00:39:35,028
Are you not feeling well?

584
00:39:35,112 --> 00:39:37,030
Do you want me to call a doctor?

585
00:39:44,955 --> 00:39:48,041
I wanted to ask
what happened to your dad.

586
00:39:48,542 --> 00:39:50,627
I don't really remember much.

587
00:39:53,797 --> 00:39:55,090
Are you okay?

588
00:39:55,836 --> 00:39:57,116
- What are you-
- Don't touch me!

589
00:39:57,342 --> 00:39:58,777
Huh?

590
00:39:58,802 --> 00:40:00,012
- What do you mean?
- No!

591
00:40:00,846 --> 00:40:01,847
Don't touch me.

592
00:40:08,228 --> 00:40:10,230
Please, Jay-jay.

593
00:40:10,313 --> 00:40:11,231
I'm begging you.

594
00:40:11,232 --> 00:40:14,818
Don't ever come near me,
and don't ever talk to me.

595
00:40:27,122 --> 00:40:28,122
Please.

596
00:40:35,005 --> 00:40:38,050
Even if I try to bring everything back to
how it was, it won't be the same.

597
00:40:38,675 --> 00:40:41,136
My mind always goes
back to that night,

598
00:40:42,054 --> 00:40:45,057
the night you almost killed me.

599
00:40:47,934 --> 00:40:49,245
Hey, are you sure you can handle this?

600
00:40:49,269 --> 00:40:50,829
You even forced yourself to drive, huh?

601
00:40:51,229 --> 00:40:54,106
I've been telling you for weeks that
I can handle it, okay?

602
00:40:54,107 --> 00:40:55,609
Do I have to keep repeating myself?

603
00:40:57,903 --> 00:40:59,946
Just make sure we're safe, Aries.

604
00:41:00,614 --> 00:41:01,948
Why? Are you scared?

605
00:41:03,408 --> 00:41:04,409
Focus on the road.

606
00:41:06,536 --> 00:41:07,912
Try speeding up.

607
00:41:07,913 --> 00:41:10,123
- Stop it!
- Speed it up!

608
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:13,293
No hands, see?

609
00:41:17,255 --> 00:41:18,339
You're really crazy.

610
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,591
One eye.

611
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:29,101
One eye.

612
00:41:32,354 --> 00:41:33,354
Aries?

613
00:41:34,397 --> 00:41:36,108
Ever since you got out of the hospital,

614
00:41:36,858 --> 00:41:38,902
it feels like you've changed a lot.

615
00:41:39,569 --> 00:41:40,545
Huh?

616
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:42,030
It’s nothing.

617
00:41:42,739 --> 00:41:45,450
I just haven't been sleeping well.

618
00:41:46,326 --> 00:41:47,326
Okay.

619
00:41:50,914 --> 00:41:53,500
Hey, we need to get there already.

620
00:41:53,875 --> 00:41:55,960
Don't you miss our old hangout spot?

621
00:41:55,961 --> 00:41:57,587
That awesome spot.

622
00:41:59,131 --> 00:42:00,757
Lots of pretty girls there.

623
00:42:05,095 --> 00:42:06,813
- Game!
- You like the pretty ones, huh?

624
00:42:09,289 --> 00:42:10,392
You guys, seriously.

625
00:42:11,476 --> 00:42:12,560
I missed you guys.

626
00:42:12,561 --> 00:42:13,687
We missed you too.

627
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:14,563
We miss you, bro.

628
00:42:14,564 --> 00:42:15,564
Happy you're here.

629
00:42:15,565 --> 00:42:16,982
It's a good thing you're here.

630
00:42:17,774 --> 00:42:19,067
Bad weeds never die.

631
00:42:23,321 --> 00:42:25,157
But seriously, guys.

632
00:42:25,991 --> 00:42:27,159
If anything happens to me,

633
00:42:27,784 --> 00:42:29,202
take care of my siblings.

634
00:42:29,578 --> 00:42:30,704
And Freya too.

635
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,580
No way.

636
00:42:33,957 --> 00:42:34,957
If I say yes,

637
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:38,044
it's like I'm agreeing that
I want something bad to happen.

638
00:42:38,295 --> 00:42:39,712
It's not like that.

639
00:42:39,713 --> 00:42:41,463
Nothing bad will happen to you,

640
00:42:41,464 --> 00:42:44,134
because you're already the
worst thing that has happened.

641
00:42:50,557 --> 00:42:52,976
- Nice view, huh?
- Yeah.

642
00:42:53,518 --> 00:42:56,855
[sound of thunder]

643
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,940
Looks like it's going to rain.

644
00:42:59,566 --> 00:43:00,692
What bad luck.

645
00:43:01,526 --> 00:43:02,526
Right.

646
00:43:02,736 --> 00:43:04,149
Why now of all times?

647
00:43:04,446 --> 00:43:06,008
It's because you don't shower.

648
00:43:07,157 --> 00:43:08,325
Ouch.

649
00:43:08,783 --> 00:43:10,451
Okay, that's enough.

650
00:43:10,452 --> 00:43:11,077
Funny guy.

651
00:43:11,078 --> 00:43:13,455
My esophagus hurts!

652
00:43:20,289 --> 00:43:21,545
The rain's getting stronger.

653
00:43:21,546 --> 00:43:22,546
Yeah.

654
00:43:22,547 --> 00:43:23,547
What?

655
00:43:23,548 --> 00:43:24,548
Should we go?

656
00:43:40,471 --> 00:43:42,056
Aries, pull over for now.

657
00:43:42,484 --> 00:43:44,564
It's getting dangerous,
something might happen to us.

658
00:43:46,071 --> 00:43:47,197
It's dangerous.

659
00:43:47,572 --> 00:43:49,573
Look, the road's so slippery.

660
00:43:49,574 --> 00:43:52,994
We don't have a choice, we need
to return this car to Angelo already.

661
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Aries, pull over.

662
00:44:00,001 --> 00:44:01,001
We might get into an accident.

663
00:44:01,002 --> 00:44:02,962
Please. I really can't.

664
00:44:02,963 --> 00:44:03,964
Please.

665
00:44:04,172 --> 00:44:06,132
We need to return this.

666
00:44:14,557 --> 00:44:15,557
Don’t touch me.

667
00:44:15,725 --> 00:44:16,725
No, Aries.

668
00:44:17,269 --> 00:44:18,269
Hey!

669
00:44:18,603 --> 00:44:19,603
Hey.

670
00:44:21,982 --> 00:44:23,608
You're going to hurt me too!

671
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,151
All of you!

672
00:44:26,361 --> 00:44:27,362
Hey, are you okay?

673
00:44:27,487 --> 00:44:28,321
Aries, are you okay?

674
00:44:28,322 --> 00:44:29,322
Hey, Aries?

675
00:44:29,489 --> 00:44:30,489
Aries?

676
00:44:32,784 --> 00:44:34,118
Aries, stop the car!

677
00:44:34,119 --> 00:44:35,287
Aries!

678
00:44:36,288 --> 00:44:37,455
Aries!

679
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:48,133
At that time, I woke up to the
smell of rain and something else...

680
00:44:49,092 --> 00:44:50,552
metal and earth.

681
00:44:51,136 --> 00:44:54,472
My body was numb,
but I knew something was terribly wrong.

682
00:44:55,181 --> 00:44:56,808
But I couldn't see anything.

683
00:44:57,142 --> 00:44:58,643
My vision had gone dark.

684
00:44:59,394 --> 00:45:02,731
But I heard Percy's voice, broken.

685
00:45:03,481 --> 00:45:05,357
Yet it sounded like my only hope.

686
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:08,320
I tried to move, my hands shaking.

687
00:45:09,154 --> 00:45:12,324
I tried to unbuckle,
and that's when the car shifted.

688
00:45:13,283 --> 00:45:18,538
It was slow, sickening sway.
I realized, we're in a dangerous position.

689
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:20,081
What’s happening?

690
00:45:21,416 --> 00:45:23,417
What are we going to do, Percy?

691
00:45:23,418 --> 00:45:24,585
Aries.

692
00:45:24,586 --> 00:45:25,919
- Can you move?
- Huh?

693
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,040
I can't see anything, Percy!

694
00:45:27,964 --> 00:45:32,009
You have to jump out. Hurry!

695
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:35,472
- No, I can't!
- Yes, you can! Now hurry!

696
00:45:35,597 --> 00:45:38,516
How about you?
I'm not leaving you here!

697
00:45:42,145 --> 00:45:45,231
You have to.
This is the only way.

698
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:47,275
I can't move.

699
00:45:47,567 --> 00:45:51,945
If you don't open that door,
we'll both fall down this cliff.

700
00:45:51,946 --> 00:45:53,364
So please!

701
00:45:53,365 --> 00:45:54,699
Percy!

702
00:45:55,867 --> 00:45:58,244
My siblings, please.

703
00:45:58,328 --> 00:45:59,371
And Freya.

704
00:45:59,788 --> 00:46:04,834
Just explain that her boyfriend
tried to play superhero, okay?

705
00:46:05,418 --> 00:46:07,087
I'm asking you a favor.

706
00:46:07,128 --> 00:46:10,423
No. Percy! Ask for anything else.

707
00:46:11,508 --> 00:46:15,094
Okay. I'm asking you to save yourself.

708
00:46:15,095 --> 00:46:17,346
Percy! No, I can't!

709
00:46:17,347 --> 00:46:19,348
Get out now, leave me.

710
00:46:19,349 --> 00:46:22,769
No! I'm not leaving you here!

711
00:46:23,728 --> 00:46:28,065
I'm happy that I met you.

712
00:46:28,066 --> 00:46:29,901
Percy!

713
00:46:30,568 --> 00:46:32,737
Percy pushed me out of the car.

714
00:46:33,613 --> 00:46:35,906
I last saw the vehicle
falling off the cliff,

715
00:46:35,907 --> 00:46:38,493
swallowed by the raging river.

716
00:46:51,965 --> 00:46:52,965
Jay-jay.

717
00:46:53,758 --> 00:46:54,758
Jay.

718
00:46:54,968 --> 00:46:56,428
Aries is on his way.

719
00:46:56,761 --> 00:46:58,429
He's being discharged today.

720
00:46:58,430 --> 00:46:59,680
Oh, really?

721
00:46:59,681 --> 00:47:00,515
Yes.

722
00:47:00,598 --> 00:47:01,850
That's great.

723
00:47:03,726 --> 00:47:05,562
Oh, he must be here.

724
00:47:06,187 --> 00:47:07,605
Mom, we're home.

725
00:47:14,028 --> 00:47:15,028
Mom.

726
00:47:18,741 --> 00:47:19,741
Aries.

727
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,369
What are you doing here?

728
00:47:24,414 --> 00:47:25,497
We'll be staying here for now.

729
00:47:25,498 --> 00:47:28,126
By the way, this is Andy.
He's the one I told you about.

730
00:47:28,376 --> 00:47:29,418
Andy, this is Aries.

731
00:47:29,419 --> 00:47:30,419
Hi, Aries.

732
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:32,880
Why?

733
00:47:37,427 --> 00:47:38,428
Gemma,

734
00:47:38,845 --> 00:47:41,973
is this what you teach my kids
while I'm not around?

735
00:47:42,015 --> 00:47:43,224
Your kids?

736
00:47:49,397 --> 00:47:50,397
Jeana,

737
00:47:51,149 --> 00:47:54,611
Aries just got back from the hospital.
Please, don't do this.

738
00:47:55,195 --> 00:47:57,447
Don't talk to my mom like that, okay?

739
00:47:58,364 --> 00:47:59,364
Mom?

740
00:48:00,617 --> 00:48:03,036
Oh, so you've already
chosen another mom?

741
00:48:03,453 --> 00:48:05,329
You're really disrespectful,
aren't you?

742
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:07,247
You know, if I had known
you'd grow up like this,

743
00:48:07,248 --> 00:48:09,626
I wouldn't have let you be
adopted in the first place.

744
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:15,130
Jay.

745
00:48:18,418 --> 00:48:19,418
What is this?

746
00:48:20,595 --> 00:48:23,640
Jay-jay still doesn't know the truth?

747
00:48:25,183 --> 00:48:26,183
Aries?

748
00:48:26,726 --> 00:48:28,561
You still haven't told her?

749
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:32,065
You still haven't told Jay-jay that
you guys are siblings?

750
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,944
Aries is your brother.

751
00:48:41,533 --> 00:48:42,784
Unbelievable!

752
00:48:50,625 --> 00:48:55,296
Now that you know we're siblings,
do you understand now, Jay?

753
00:49:37,297 --> 00:49:38,756
Jay, what are you doing here?

754
00:49:39,066 --> 00:49:41,150
Is Keifer there?

755
00:49:41,175 --> 00:49:42,802
Sorry, he's not home.

756
00:49:42,927 --> 00:49:43,803
Did something happen?

757
00:49:43,804 --> 00:49:44,970
She was just looking for you.

758
00:49:44,971 --> 00:49:47,140
Just don't say anything that's
gonna make her worry.

759
00:49:47,165 --> 00:49:49,099
I'm sorry if I'm rushing you.

760
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:52,603
I just want us to have enough
time to prepare.

761
00:49:52,604 --> 00:49:56,566
- Presenting, my masterpiece!
- Don't you like it?

762
00:49:56,591 --> 00:50:00,636
Grandma! You're here!

763
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:02,196
Don't I get a hug too?

764
00:50:02,864 --> 00:50:03,656
Hi, Jay.

765
00:50:03,657 --> 00:50:05,575
Oh, so you're the one marrying my daughter?

766
00:50:05,742 --> 00:50:06,701
Keifer?

767
00:50:06,702 --> 00:50:08,452
What happened,
where have you been?

768
00:50:08,453 --> 00:50:09,120
I missed you.

769
00:50:09,121 --> 00:50:11,038
What are you doing here, Keifer?

770
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:12,039
I came to see Jay-jay.

771
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,290
He will be my best man.

772
00:50:13,291 --> 00:50:15,751
No, he will be my best man.

773
00:50:15,752 --> 00:50:17,312
What are we going to talk about, David?

774
00:50:17,629 --> 00:50:18,629
Jay.

775
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:21,153
You fucking bastard!

776
00:50:21,507 --> 00:50:23,008
- It's not what you-
- Don't fucking touch me!

777
00:50:23,009 --> 00:50:25,094
Don't come any closer, Jay.

778
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:26,304
I might hurt you.

779
00:50:26,346 --> 00:50:27,680
Just tell her the truth already!

780
00:50:27,805 --> 00:50:29,349
What plan are you talking about?

781
00:50:29,807 --> 00:50:31,142
You sure you want to hear it?
