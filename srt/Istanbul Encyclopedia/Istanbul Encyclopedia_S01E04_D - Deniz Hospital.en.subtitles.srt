ISTANBUL ENCYCLOPEDIA

7
00:01:35,208 --> 00:01:36,416
Why are you like this?

8
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:38,583
I don't know.

9
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,250
Are you bored by Istanbul?

10
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:47,083
No, I'm not bored,
but I guess I'm intimidated by it.

11
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:49,125
Why are you intimidated, huh?

12
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:52,208
I feel like this crowd is going to eat me.

13
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:53,750
-This crowd?
-Yes.

14
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:59,041
Zehra, what do you see
when you look at this crowd?

15
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:05,125
A sea of people.

16
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:10,333
It's scary. I feel like I'm drowning.

17
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:15,666
If you go with the flow of the city
like they do, you'll always find space.

18
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:19,000
If you just watch, of course
you'll feel like you're drowning.

19
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:24,500
But once you take a step,
everywhere will open up for you.

20
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:26,333
-Come on, Zehra!
-Harun!

21
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:29,458
I'm getting into the flow of the city.
Whoosh!

22
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:33,916
-From five meters away. Is that drowning?
-Great! Going forward!

23
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,333
Be careful!

24
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,041
Wait!

25
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,041
-Come on!
-Harun, be careful!

26
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,625
-Come on, Zehra!
-Careful!

27
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:51,708
No!

28
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:26,791
As you like. Yeah.

29
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:35,208
"About what?
Let's put our imagination to work."

30
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,083
"For instance, let's talk about

31
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:41,958
what life will be like
in 200 or 300 years from now."

32
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:46,958
"After we're gone,
people will travel by zeppelins."

33
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,041
"The jacket trends will change."

34
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:53,125
"Perhaps they will discover
our sixth sense and they will enhance it."

35
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:58,666
"But life will remain the same.
It will still be tough."

36
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,083
"Life will still be
full of uncertainty and joy."

37
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,833
"Even after 1,000 years,

38
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:10,833
humankind will sigh and say,
'Oh, life is so hard.' in the same way."

39
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,291
Just like you.

40
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:17,208
"They will fear death in the same way,
and will not want to die."

41
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,041
You know what I wonder the most?

42
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,125
ANTON CHEKHOV
THREE SISTERS

43
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:24,583
You know,

44
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:28,583
back when people
used to communicate by letters…

45
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,416
God knows when those letters would arrive.

46
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,583
At that moment,

47
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,708
the overwhelming feelings
that made them write the letter,

48
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,333
wouldn't they have
already changed by then?

49
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:47,166
That's exactly why
it's a blessing to live in this era.

50
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,875
For example, if I wanna say something,
I can reach out in an instant.

51
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,791
-I would still want to try it.
-Try what?

52
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,291
You know…

53
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,291
My feelings for you now,

54
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:03,958
I don't know, keep them and convey them
to you three or four weeks later.

55
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,833
Maybe there is something beautiful
about the wait.

56
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:08,708
Let's do it.

57
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,500
-What?
-Let's do it. Give me a date.

58
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,708
April 8th, 2024.

59
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,708
We will schedule
an email to each other at 5:00 p.m.

60
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:23,583
-Are you serious?
-I already started writing.

61
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:38,000
-Are you writing an acrostic poem?
-Yes. See you on April 8th.

62
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,250
But some feelings…

63
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,541
Some feelings can't wait that long.

64
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:48,250
Dance, for example.

65
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,291
-Mom, is that you?
-I'm home, son!

66
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,375
Hold on.

67
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,916
-No, it's okay.
-Harun!

68
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,041
It's okay.

69
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,916
I baked the cake this morning, it's fresh.
Have some.

70
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,541
Thanks, I'm just not hungry.

71
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:55,291
-No way! This is Harun's favorite cake.
-It is.

72
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,208
-You have to try it.
-Let's eat.

73
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,416
Just taste… It's fine.

74
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:06,500
Harun told me, but I can't remember.
What was her name? Your aunt.

75
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,500
I couldn't remember.

76
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,666
-Nesrin.
-Ms. Nesrin!

77
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,333
Thankfully, she'll tend to Osman.

78
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,833
Otherwise, he says he's fine
and shrugs it off.

79
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:23,291
-It's not like he's too bad.
-Son, his hand is always on his heart.

80
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,750
When we mention it, he asks,
"Are you all doctors?"

81
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:30,041
I say, "Let a doctor tell us,
so we can relax." Am I wrong?

82
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:31,791
You're right.

83
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:35,333
Though I'm a natural-born doctor.
I know a few things.

84
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,416
My grandma was a healer too.

85
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,666
Remember you said we live to witness?

86
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,333
What if we are witnessing sins?

87
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,666
Then what does one do?

88
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,500
Then one repents.

89
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:11,708
Even though one is sometimes shaken
and doesn't know what to do,

90
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,666
one knows there is always hope.

91
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,166
"Have We not expanded your chest for you?"

92
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,125
"And relieved you from your burden

93
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:31,208
which weighed so heavily on your back?"

94
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,333
"Have We not exalted your fame?"

95
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:39,583
"So, with hardship comes ease."

96
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:44,333
"Yes. With hardship comes ease."

97
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:49,500
"So, when you are free, still labor hard."

98
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,375
-"Turn to Allah with hope."
-"Turn to Allah with hope."

99
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,041
-"Only to Him."
-"Only to Him."

100
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,958
-Are you available after rehearsal?
-I don't know.

101
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:26,000
Wanna go to the hospital with me?
My folks will be happy to see you.

102
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,833
Actually, I have something to do.

103
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:33,708
-Here we go.
-Here we go, what?

104
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,750
-I can't understand you, Zehra.
-Why?

105
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,958
You're weird. You're available,
then suddenly you're busy.

106
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:46,833
I thought you liked me
being weird and eccentric.

107
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,416
-Did you change your mind?
-No.

108
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,875
-It's just you're inconsistent.
-Is it because you can't categorize me?

109
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:57,791
I'm not trying to categorize you.
You're not being honest with me.

110
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,208
It feels like
you got me chasing a secret, a lie.

111
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:06,625
-Because we are not making love?
-I don't even know if you want it or not.

112
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,916
-Because I want it, and I don't.
-Why, Zehra?

113
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,833
-Because that's exactly how I am!
-Great! Let's use this excuse every time!

114
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,000
Sorry, I didn't grow up somewhere chill.

115
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,208
Make up your mind.
You're not a kid anymore.

116
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,750
-Is that so?
-It is.

117
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:38,000
-Hello?
-Hello, Ms. Nesrin, how are you?

118
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:42,375
Oh, İlker. Hi, how are you?

119
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:46,333
Unfortunately, I'm calling about
an unpleasant matter. About your sister.

120
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:49,708
I wanted to give you a heads-up.
Could you come here today?

121
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:54,916
I was about to go into surgery.
Is it okay if I come in about two hours?

122
00:11:55,708 --> 00:12:00,208
-Could you bring Ms. Emel too?
-Sure. Don't worry, I'll bring her.

123
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:08,250
Talking about this is unpleasant,
but unfortunately, time is up.

124
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:11,958
Tomorrow, an enforcement request
will be sent to the execution office.

125
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:16,083
The office will notify you
to pay the debt within seven days,

126
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:19,625
or provide a court order
to suspend the execution,

127
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:23,750
otherwise, the mortgaged property
will be sold.

128
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:28,083
I wasn't aware of any this.
Do we have to pay it immediately?

129
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:32,583
If paid by tomorrow, the process
will be done without any additional cost.

130
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:35,708
If paid within seven days
of the enforcement notice,

131
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,041
it will be with interest.

132
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,250
If you don't pay, you know the drill.

133
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,666
-Emel.
-Okay, thanks for your help.

134
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:48,000
-No need to drag it out. See you.
-Emel, they're gonna sell Mom's house.

135
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,166
-I don't think you heard him.
-Let them.

136
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,333
Her share is more than enough for her.

137
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,833
Banks sell houses for peanuts.
We know that.

138
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,625
Okay, I'll pay the rest. Okay?

139
00:12:56,708 --> 00:13:00,083
Why do others have to suffer
because of your debt?

140
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:03,208
Didn't you buy your house
with my dad's inheritance?

141
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:06,625
-That also included my share?
-Yes, but I've paid off my debt.

142
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:09,666
Years later. Bit by bit.
After my money was devalued.

143
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,000
Didn't I suffer then?

144
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,541
What are you saying?
Be honest with yourself.

145
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,750
Did you ever fall short of money?

146
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,583
Wasn't I there for you
whenever you needed?

147
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:21,416
How can you talk about money?
I don't get it!

148
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,250
Are you gonna count your favors? Really?

149
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:27,333
Emel! You used my mom's house
as collateral!

150
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:30,250
-She's my mom too!
-Then act like it!

151
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:33,041
-I have to be like you. You are the same.
-What do you mean?

152
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:36,291
Insincere, selfish and calculated!
You're the same!

153
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:41,750
-You are one to talk!
-Yes, I am. So what? I'm one to talk.

154
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:43,708
"Is that irresponsible, addict,

155
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:46,125
only-good-for-singing-in-a-bar Emel
saying that?"

156
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:49,041
-Yes, exactly.
-Exactly! I am saying that.

157
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:53,000
But you have to talk, right?
You, you! Always you! Why always you?

158
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,166
Because you were a star student in school?

159
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:00,375
Your house, your car, your life,
your education, you going abroad!

160
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:04,083
Enough! Yes, it's enough! I'm done!

161
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,333
I'm sick of living off your scraps!

162
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,041
As if my birth was an accident!

163
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:15,541
I hate you, and I hate Mom.

164
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,333
Close your eyes.

165
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:49,541
I spent my high school years
working and saving up.

166
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,875
While everyone was swimming during summer,

167
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,541
I was working as a waiter…

168
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,500
or at a kiosk in an ancient city.

169
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:06,250
My last job was
at a defense industry expo…

170
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,875
as a booth host.

171
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:15,166
We had to stand up
when a commander came by.

172
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,291
I didn't leave it to chance.

173
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:23,291
Even when I saw a private,
I got on my feet.

174
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:27,666
Meanwhile, my best friend
was betting on coins and making money.

175
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,500
He first bought a coin called Vuna,
turning 100 USD into 1,000 USD.

176
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:35,125
Then turned it into 5,000 USD.
Just as he was about to hit 10,000 USD,

177
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,750
he hyped me up,
"This is your last chance to invest."

178
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,708
I invested all of my money in Vuna.

179
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:44,750
One day, I was on a plane,
returning to Istanbul from my hometown,

180
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:48,750
when Vuna suddenly died,
and I lost all of my money.

181
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:54,583
I wasn't feeling anything,
except for my heart's pounding.

182
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:58,625
It felt like everything was just a game.

183
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:05,541
But soon, I had to face reality.

184
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,833
I almost cut my hand.

185
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,041
-Are you okay? Be careful.
-I'm fine.

186
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,583
-You take this, and I'll take that.
-Okay.

187
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:25,750
Pelin.

188
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,166
Don't make it too obvious

189
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,458
but are the people by the tree
looking at you?

190
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:33,291
I said not too obvious, Pelin. Gosh!

191
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,333
I was obvious.

192
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:40,708
Man, every time we run into this girl,
she's looking at me. I feel it.

193
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,041
I didn't know
you could read minds, dear Pel.

194
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:50,833
I don't need supernatural abilities,
dear Zehra. It's not unheard of.

195
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:56,416
If that girl smokes with me, she won't
be able to go home tonight out of fear.

196
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,125
But here's what I don't understand.

197
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:02,458
Why do you carry so much weight
in this religion

198
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:05,083
just because you have a vagina and a head?

199
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:11,625
-I don't know. It makes me sad.
-I can't say anything to her. How can I?

200
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:14,333
She's a victim too after all.

201
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,583
Right. What can you say?

202
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:21,708
Look at those complaining about
the judgment machines.

203
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,041
Who is really free?

204
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:29,500
Can you show me? I'm so curious.
Is there such a person in this world?

205
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:33,000
How can you be so sure you are free?

206
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:37,958
Like, how many millions
of that T-shirt are out there?

207
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:41,166
But each says
"Be yourself." "Believe in yourself."

208
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:45,708
I wish we could be ourselves
just by changing clothes.

209
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,916
But trend addicts are passing judgment.

210
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,583
"Come one, come all.
You can be yourself for only 159.90."

211
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:54,708
It's not a T-shirt, man.

212
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,250
It's a sweatshirt.

213
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,166
All right.

214
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:12,500
-I ran out of coffee… Coffee?
-I ran out of coffee!

215
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,583
-I ran out of money!
-Girls.

216
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,791
I'm so sorry. We…

217
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:22,208
Things got tense with Harun,
and I took it out on you.

218
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,208
Again, I'm sorry.

219
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:27,041
Well, well, nice going!

220
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:28,541
Pelin…

221
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:32,000
I was wondering
why Zehra was talking such nonsense.

222
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,791
You know what? You're an item now.
Tense moments and all.

223
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,375
No. There is nothing.

224
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,666
So, what are you?

225
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,875
I bet they're cuddle buddies.

226
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,083
Could be sense buddies too.

227
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,291
We can't be anything.

228
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:52,166
We get it. They're love buddies.

229
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,875
You wanna do something today?

230
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:01,333
I don't know, it feels like you're gonna
get your brain pierced, not your ear.

231
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,666
I can't look at it.

232
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,083
-What do you think, Zehra?
-I don't know.

233
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:11,875
At worst, you'll look like a robot
with a button stuck in your brain.

234
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:15,458
Then you lost me on my right side, baby.

235
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:21,416
Whoa! Girls. Okay, I've changed my mind.

236
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,291
I'm going for a tattoo roulette.
Are you ready?

237
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,541
-Are you sure?
-I'm sure.

238
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,708
-I don't know.
-Is it a sin, Zehra?

239
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:33,416
No. I just meant a tattoo is no joke.

240
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:38,916
It is. This is the most serious one.
Just let it be. Come on.

241
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,500
Here I go.

242
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,791
WINNING TATTOO

243
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,458
Is that a damn joke?

244
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,791
I said it was gonna be unforgettable,
not pretty.

245
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,541
Zehra, you get the tragus.

246
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,666
-No objections. Please.
-No.

247
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,791
Look, I don't want to get my ear pierced.

248
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,166
Look at me.

249
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,583
Are you scared?

250
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:10,750
No.

251
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,416
I'm not scared.

252
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:18,250
Never mind my ear,
I'm gonna get my belly pierced.

253
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,458
I haven't even touched you yet.

254
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:44,041
-Wait. Pierce it when I feel ready, okay?
-Sure.

255
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,708
Yo, what up brother?

256
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,750
Da Poet Istanbul

257
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:03,333
Los Angeles collaboration
Equal Knox resurrecting the dead

258
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,750
Welcome to the state of emergency

259
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,291
Aimed at your servantry
Proclaimed by word diversity

260
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:12,166
Retained by curved hyperbole
Sustained by your uncertainty

261
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,000
With confidence effectively
Being the dopest by complexity

262
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,708
And dominant intensity
What you expect from me?

263
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:20,875
I leave mountains in a single bound
With thousands of my people sound

264
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,791
The challenges to equal level

265
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,625
-Is it done?
-Done.

266
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,541
Your blood test results are fine.
Everything seems to be normal.

267
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:38,666
I tell them I'm fine,
but they don't believe me, Doctor.

268
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:43,708
Let's get another ECG, Mr. Osman.
But your results seem normal.

269
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:47,625
Schedule an appointment for next month
with Ms. Pırıl. We'll meet again.

270
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:51,500
-We better keep monitoring you.
-We appreciate it. Sorry for the trouble.

271
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:55,750
Ms. Nesrin, could you give him
a sedative anyway?

272
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:58,916
-Why?
-He scared us a little yesterday.

273
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,708
Sedatives help. They calm him down.

274
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:06,166
Mr. Osman, I can refer you to someone
if you have anxiety.

275
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:09,416
No, Doctor. I'm quite fine.
Yıldız is exaggerating.

276
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:12,875
-Okay.
-How about this?

277
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:18,625
Let us know if there's a need,
and we'll follow up. Okay, Ms. Pırıl?

278
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:21,416
By the way, Zehra had a thing,
so she couldn't come.

279
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,875
But she said hi to everyone.
I just wanted to say that.

280
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:27,208
-Bless her.
-Have you met her?

281
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:31,166
Yes, we met. She's very sweet.
I liked her.

282
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:35,083
Yes, she's very sweet.

283
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:40,000
It doesn't look stupid, does it?

284
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:44,708
I hope this wasn't too crazy
just to make it a special day, I mean…

285
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:48,000
I hope they won't say something stupid.
I'll lose it.

286
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:51,583
-Don't worry. I'm writing everything down.
-What?

287
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:55,875
In my "people's unsolicited comments
about me" notebook.

288
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:03,333
But how did you learn to sing in English
in godforsaken Amasya?

289
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:06,833
For real though.
You would think she went to Robert.

290
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:10,041
-The internet is everywhere, baby.
-So you say.

291
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:14,250
I swear it's such an embarrassment.
Let me see.

292
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:16,958
Libido killer. Cover it.

293
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,875
-Girls, keep going, I'll catch up.
-Okay.

294
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:28,916
-Hello?
-Zehra, can we meet?

295
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:34,333
-My battery is running low.
-I'll be at the place I told you about.

296
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:36,875
-Why?
-I'm sorry.

297
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:40,333
-I'm sorry.
-I didn't hear you.

298
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:41,500
I'm sorry.

299
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:43,833
I realized what I did wrong.

300
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:46,000
-What?
-I'm sorry.

301
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,333
-What do you mean?
-I'm sorry.

302
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:49,833
Sorry…

303
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,041
-I'm sorry.
-I couldn't hear you.

304
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:57,916
Zehra, I'm sorry.
I apologize a thousand times. I'm sorry.

305
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,666
-Write it in your diary.
-What?

306
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,666
Write it in your diary. Don't forget this.

307
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,833
-You forgive me?
-No.

308
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:05,083
-Make me write it if you can!
-Harun!

309
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:18,000
Why didn't you tell me?

310
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:22,625
You think I didn't notice?

311
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:27,791
Why aren't you two talking, Zehra?

312
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:36,875
Just because.

313
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:39,458
You don't have to tell me.

314
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:44,333
But I want you to know
I'll always be there for you.

315
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:46,041
I'm here, okay?

316
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:49,833
You can share anything with me.

317
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:57,250
I didn't tell you this to make you cry.
I told you to comfort you.

318
00:24:58,583 --> 00:25:00,458
So don't hold it in.

319
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,291
Whatever.

320
00:25:05,791 --> 00:25:08,583
Whatever. You can tell me
whenever you want.

321
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:10,708
Okay?

322
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:13,375
Cheer up a bit.

323
00:25:24,916 --> 00:25:26,875
Stop it. I swear I'm scared.

324
00:25:35,291 --> 00:25:36,416
Wait.

325
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:40,041
Careful.

326
00:25:44,958 --> 00:25:45,958
Here we go.

327
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,375
-Yes, Mom?
-Hello? Harun.

328
00:25:55,916 --> 00:25:57,500
-Harun, hurry! Your dad!
-What?

329
00:25:57,583 --> 00:26:00,291
-He's having a heart attack!
-Where are you?

330
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:02,375
Hurry! Come to the Naval Hospital!

331
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:09,708
Osman!

332
00:26:10,791 --> 00:26:11,791
Osman!

333
00:26:15,916 --> 00:26:18,041
We have an emergency.
Where should we take him?

334
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:21,250
-Room 3 is empty. We can take him there.
-Patient's name?

335
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:23,250
-Osman Akçakaya.
-Who are you?

336
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:24,875
-His son, ma'am.
-Vitals?

337
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:28,000
-Pulse 90, saturation 95.
-All right. One, two, three, lift him.

338
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:30,041
-Mom has his details.
-Glucose is 100.

339
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:32,250
-Got it.
-No known chronic disease.

340
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:34,625
Blood pressure difference between arms.

341
00:26:34,708 --> 00:26:35,791
-Good job.
-Good luck.

342
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:38,416
-Let's take him here.
-Give him some oxygen.

343
00:26:38,916 --> 00:26:41,333
Mr. Osman, hello. Can you hear me?

344
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:45,166
Mr. Osman? Hopefully, you'll recover soon.
Can you hear me?

345
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,583
Guys, give him oxygen, stat.

346
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:52,958
You feel any pain?
Okay. Guys, monitor the patient.

347
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:59,125
I'll get you something to drink.

348
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:33,958
Harun. Water?

349
00:27:58,375 --> 00:27:59,833
Your dad is going to be fine.

350
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:01,916
Don't worry.

351
00:28:03,791 --> 00:28:06,000
We have to comfort your mom.

352
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,000
Don't be like that, okay?

353
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:10,500
I'm here for you.

354
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:12,541
I'm praying.

355
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:14,708
Your dad will be fine.

356
00:28:14,791 --> 00:28:16,416
Just relax.

357
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,500
Give me your phone.

358
00:28:26,625 --> 00:28:30,625
-Why? What happened?
-My phone is dead. Can I use yours?

359
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:39,708
When your dad gets better,
he'll watch this and we'll have a laugh.

360
00:28:39,791 --> 00:28:41,166
That's why I'm recording this.

361
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:43,416
Yes.

362
00:28:45,833 --> 00:28:47,583
Hello, dear Uncle Osman.

363
00:28:48,958 --> 00:28:51,208
This is how we got to meet you.

364
00:28:51,291 --> 00:28:56,083
With this video, we wanted to show you
what good kids we are.

365
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:59,500
I'm with Harun.
Harun, what do you wanna say to your dad?

366
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:03,125
Yes. What do you want to tell him?

367
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:05,125
Go.

368
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:09,541
See, Uncle Osman?
It wasn't easy to convince him.

369
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:12,250
So, Harun, what do you
want to say to your dad?

370
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:17,083
Don't scare us like that again.
Don't do it. Okay?

371
00:29:17,166 --> 00:29:18,166
-Yes.
-And get well.

372
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:21,958
Yes, don't do it again, Uncle Osman.
You really scared us.

373
00:29:22,041 --> 00:29:25,333
We are now heading to
Mom Yıldız to support her.

374
00:29:25,416 --> 00:29:26,958
That doesn't make sense.

375
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:31,125
-You said you ran all the tests. Okay.
-Mrs. Yıldız, please. Yes, I did.

376
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:32,625
But what did I tell you?

377
00:29:32,708 --> 00:29:36,291
-"Give him a sedative to calm him down."
-I did it, Mrs. Yıldız. I did it!

378
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:37,875
What on earth did you do?!

379
00:29:37,958 --> 00:29:41,125
I did it, Mrs. Yıldız!
I won't stand for your insults!

380
00:29:41,208 --> 00:29:45,041
Yes! I took an ECG! We ran blood tests!

381
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:49,333
Don't you understand?
I couldn't have predicted that!

382
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:21,458
Hello?

383
00:30:26,916 --> 00:30:28,291
Mommy, how are you?

384
00:30:31,791 --> 00:30:33,583
Thank God, everything is fine.

385
00:30:36,416 --> 00:30:37,416
Mom.

386
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,458
Can you pray for me?

387
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:24,916
Are you okay, Zehra?

388
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,541
You were talking in your sleep.

389
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:29,875
Zehra.

390
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:35,041
Zehra.

391
00:31:38,208 --> 00:31:39,208
I'm fine.

392
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:42,875
The morning prayer time is ending.

393
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,708
This is a four-bedroom house.

394
00:32:17,208 --> 00:32:19,750
We don't use three rooms.
Let's just sell it.

395
00:32:20,791 --> 00:32:24,250
Let's sell it. We can buy a house for Mom
that will be enough for her.

396
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:26,333
Which house?

397
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:28,125
This house.

398
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:35,541
This house. This house, Mommy.
This house. This is your house.

399
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:43,000
-Or she can stay with you.
-You know I'm selling my house.

400
00:32:43,958 --> 00:32:46,625
Right. You can buy, sell.
Do whatever you like.

401
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:49,625
I'm not selling my house
because of a debt or mortgage.

402
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:52,166
-You're going abroad.
-Yes, dear, yes.

403
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:54,041
You're no different from Dad.

404
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,333
What did Dad do to you?
Just tell me. You keep saying that.

405
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,625
He abandoned us. Isn't that enough?

406
00:33:01,708 --> 00:33:05,666
He didn't abandon anyone.
He just couldn't find a space here.

407
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:09,750
Weren't you angrier at Dad than I was?
Did you forget?

408
00:33:09,833 --> 00:33:11,791
You're going abroad.
Now you understand him?

409
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:14,458
Did he abandon his responsibilities?
He sent us money.

410
00:33:14,541 --> 00:33:16,541
-Who bought this house?
-Oh, God!

411
00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:19,083
-Who?
-Your husband.

412
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:21,541
Your husband.

413
00:33:23,916 --> 00:33:25,750
Do I have a husband?

414
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:34,208
Mom, who did we come out of?
Who? Didn't we come out of your belly?

415
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:38,875
-My belly?
-Yes.

416
00:33:39,375 --> 00:33:45,291
Let's sell this house and part ways.
Let's shut this family institution down.

417
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:48,833
-Why did you go into so much debt?
-I did it. Why do you care?

418
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:54,250
Fine. Take a loan from a bank
without us knowing and go into debt.

419
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:58,125
-Fine. Then, "Why do you care?" Great.
-Did I start the pandemic, Nesrin?

420
00:33:58,208 --> 00:34:01,375
What could I do?
The pandemic crushed the bar.

421
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:03,875
I would've made enough money
to shut you up otherwise.

422
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,166
Sevinç.

423
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:11,291
Is that you? Sevinç.

424
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:15,041
Aunt Sevinç isn't here, Mom.

425
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:17,458
Where is she?

426
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:20,708
There is no Sevinç here, Mom.

427
00:34:23,166 --> 00:34:24,166
There is anger.

428
00:34:30,125 --> 00:34:32,875
The letter D. "Deniz Hospital."

429
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:39,125
"Formerly Sakızağacı Naval Hospital
and Kasımpaşa Naval Hospital,

430
00:34:40,666 --> 00:34:45,083
now officially called
Istanbul Naval Hospital."

431
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:50,125
"It is a great health institution
that is a source of pride for Türkiye,

432
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:55,083
and for the land, sea, and air forces,
as well as the Turkish army."

433
00:34:55,583 --> 00:35:00,625
What could this Naval Hospital be?
Did they bring in sick seas?

434
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:03,625
Yes, I've heard that

435
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:08,625
Istanbulites were
such harmful, malevolent folks

436
00:35:08,708 --> 00:35:11,083
that they made the whole sea sick.

437
00:35:13,708 --> 00:35:16,541
Marmara's snot filled up the shores.

438
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:21,708
It's hard to imagine a beauty
famous for its turquoise in snot green.

439
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:26,291
But feeling surrounded by a snot sea
is not unfamiliar.

440
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:28,958
Living in Istanbul…

441
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:32,541
is actually sometimes

442
00:35:34,125 --> 00:35:35,708
just like swimming in snot.

443
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,375
So sticky and so hard.

444
00:35:40,375 --> 00:35:43,333
No, it's not a swamp.
The sea doesn't pull you in,

445
00:35:43,833 --> 00:35:46,166
but it never lets you get away either.

446
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:50,125
An overwhelming sense of restriction.

447
00:35:50,625 --> 00:35:52,250
We're stuck in the sea.

448
00:35:53,083 --> 00:35:56,000
I don't know if the city is sick
or if I'm tired.

449
00:35:56,541 --> 00:35:59,541
I'm admitting my inner sea
to a hospital now.

450
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:01,708
Don't you understand? I couldn't…

451
00:36:01,791 --> 00:36:05,125
DOCTORS ARE ARROGANT!
SHE SHOULD BE FIRED!

452
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:08,666
I want to believe in a land
where the seas are cured.

453
00:39:26,583 --> 00:39:27,958
I'm sorry.

454
00:39:30,666 --> 00:39:32,041
It was my fault.

455
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:58,500
