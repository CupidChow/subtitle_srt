00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:17,375
BUILT IN 1957
ON THE SITE OF THE OLD MELEK CINEMA

WITH KÜÇÜK EMEK MOVIE THEATER

99% OWNED BY PENSION FUND,
1% BY KEMAL ERBAŞ.

6
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:23,291
OPENED ON APRIL 19, 1958.

7
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:54,958
I did it, Mrs. Yıldız!
I won't stand for your insults!

8
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:58,666
Yes! I took an ECG! We ran blood tests!

9
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,500
Don't you understand? I couldn't…

10
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:02,583
@BREAKINGNEWS

11
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:05,916
YOU CAN'T YELL AT PEOPLE
JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE A DIPLOMA

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,375
THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND, THEY'RE NOT GODS

13
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:12,125
HEALTH SYSTEM SHOULD BE ACCOUNTABLE!
LOOK AT THAT SO-CALLED INTELLECTUAL!

ISTANBUL ENCYCLOPEDIA

15
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:08,041
I just wanted to cheer up Harun.
I was recording Harun, not you.

16
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:09,750
-Then?
-And then…

17
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:13,458
Harun went running towards you
when the shouting started.

18
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:16,916
And I didn't question
what was going on. I just…

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,416
I just kept recording.

20
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,625
-Why did you send the video to Harun?
-Of course, I didn't!

21
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:25,250
My phone was dead.
I was recording with his phone.

22
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,791
Then when I couldn't breathe
at that moment…

23
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:31,875
That moment was recorded just like that.

24
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:35,208
A moment without context,

25
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:40,375
just a cropped moment
of extrajudicial execution.

26
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,375
What do you think will happen now?

27
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,541
What will happen now?

28
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,291
I don't know that.

29
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,666
Everyone will deal with their own pain.

30
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,750
Were you really negligent in any way?

31
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,791
Nesrin Caner.

32
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,166
ECG.

33
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:21,166
-Blood tests.
-All done, ma'am.

34
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,791
The patient had suffered from bisection.

35
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:27,625
Due to a 70% narrowing in the bifurcation,

36
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,625
the heart tissues it supplies
have begun to necrose.

37
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:34,708
-And it led to a myocardial infarction.
-Unfortunately.

38
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,708
Weren't there any symptoms
when the patient came in?

39
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:46,125
No. On the contrary,
he said his family had forced him to come

40
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,916
and he was feeling very well.

41
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,208
CT angiography wasn't performed.

42
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:59,708
Right, but there wasn't any condition
that required it.

43
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,375
I see.

44
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:08,375
Yes, unforeseeable events
may occur in such cases.

45
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,500
We'll state this in the report.

46
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:16,041
However, these days, perception
is more important than medical knowledge.

47
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:19,958
It's a mess out there.
I've been getting calls all day.

48
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,500
So?

49
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:29,208
So, be on the good side of the prosecutor.
I hope they won't keep digging too much.

50
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,375
Last night they said,

51
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:43,375
"Be prepared for anything,
and say farewell."

52
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:49,083
Thank God, he's surprisingly
been improving since morning.

53
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,125
Thank God.

54
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,750
If only he could get out of the ICU too…

55
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,708
-Keep your spirits up.
-I am.

56
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,250
-Don't worry. It will be okay.
-It will.

57
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,000
Harun…

58
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,791
You're in a very difficult situation.

59
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,041
I know.

60
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,708
But why did you do such a thing?

61
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,083
I don't get it.

62
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,000
Zehra, I didn't do anything.

63
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,125
What do you mean, Harun?

64
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:47,416
The whole country saw it.
And it was a video I recorded.

65
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:52,000
I sent it to the family WhatsApp group.
One of my cousins uploaded it.

66
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,166
They didn't expect such a reaction.

67
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,416
Is it a lie?

68
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,625
It's only the part they cropped.

69
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,625
It wasn't the whole video.

70
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,708
Zehra, are you interrogating me?

71
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,458
You're playing with someone's life.

72
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:15,666
My dad was dying. Because of her mistake.

73
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:21,583
I can't cry over someone's reputation.

74
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,041
Harun, you already killed Nesrin.

75
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:28,958
She's getting lynched.

76
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,458
I always thought
this only happened to other people.

77
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:40,666
Without knowing the whole story
and watching a 20-second video,

78
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,000
everyone in Türkiye
cursed at her and all the doctors.

79
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,750
Are we really gonna talk
about this right now?

80
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,500
Harun, I'm so sorry about your dad.

81
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:55,708
Okay? I'm really sorry.
I'm praying for him.

82
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:59,291
And if there is anything else I can do,
tell me, I'll do it.

83
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,125
-But for Nesrin, there is one thing…
-Withdraw the complaint?

84
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,375
I won't.

85
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:13,791
I will not.

86
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,000
I can't, okay?

87
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,458
"Do you know why you are here?"
they asked.

88
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:42,375
"Because you need to be grounded."

89
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:46,958
Turns out, my planets and my positions
are all in the Air element.

90
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:50,416
That's why I'm so volatile and frivolous.

91
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,916
They said,
"You are used to being altruistic

92
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,583
because of your childhood experiences."

93
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,541
"Because you spent your childhood
making your mom happy."

94
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:08,000
"You've associated your own worth
with her happiness."

95
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:13,333
"And you've never
accepted your dad as a father."

96
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,041
"First, you need to make peace with them."

97
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:19,625
"Then you need to balance
your masculine-feminine energies."

98
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,333
"Even at the cost of causing unease."

99
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:27,416
"If others get hurt, so be it.
What do you want?"

100
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,500
"Nothing anyone says matters."

101
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:39,250
I think it was the first time

102
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:45,916
I've contemplated on my relationship
with my mom and dad.

103
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:58,666
I realized everyone around me
was suffering from the same problem.

104
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,333
Turns out, I wasn't all alone.

105
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:09,375
Maybe we're all children
of a codependent country.

106
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,208
Oh, Zehra, come on!

107
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:24,250
You're always hiding something,
then you unlock a new level.

108
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,750
-I can't process it.
-Let's go over them one by one.

109
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,000
So, how is Harun's dad now?

110
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:36,666
-He's in the ICU but he's getting better.
-Okay. No one died at least.

111
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,416
So, how is Harun?

112
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,916
He's bad, of course.

113
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,458
We had an argument this morning.

114
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:52,416
Don't worry, he'll come around
once his dad recovers.

115
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,541
How is your aunt?

116
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:01,958
Terrible. She keeps getting cursed.

117
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:07,041
Men, women, leftists, rightists,
everyone in Türkiye

118
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,208
is lynching her in unison.

119
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:12,166
Is the woman getting lynched your aunt?

120
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:19,500
I had never witnessed such a thing
up close before, you know?

121
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,791
That's crazy. Look at that.

122
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:27,000
Anyway. Let's not say she's being lynched,
but rather she became famous.

123
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:30,000
Positive vibes, huh, honey?

124
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,416
Okay, never mind all that for now.

125
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,625
How are you, Zehra?

126
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,791
I don't know.

127
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,833
Mr. Prosecutor will see you shortly.
You can wait in that room.

128
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,083
I was worried about you.
You weren't home yesterday.

129
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,166
Yes, I wanted to talk to you about that.

130
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,291
I won't be coming back home, Fatıma.

131
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,625
What do you mean?

132
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,458
I went back to Nesrin's.

133
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,208
Why are you smiling?

134
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:10,958
I was wondering why you don't look away
and talk to me at school.

135
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:17,000
It feels easier to be with those people
than to be with us, right? Only for now.

136
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:21,500
Do you think they'll accept you
as who you are?

137
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,000
Do you think you'll be loved?

138
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,083
You will never make it happen.

139
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:31,458
And the more you try,
the more you'll feel like an impostor.

140
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,833
Eventually, you'll become one.

141
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,833
How do you know what I'll become?

142
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:41,666
How can you be so sure what I'll become,
when even I am not?

143
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,708
-Are you Allah, Fatıma?
-God forbid, no!

144
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,041
Dear Zehra,

145
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:51,333
"As clothes resemble one another,
hearts also begin to resemble each other."

146
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:58,000
Some clothes have a price,
and you're avoiding paying it.

147
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:04,208
But don't worry, with your fluid,
even frivolous personality,

148
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,750
you will soon confirm my judgment.

149
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:13,333
I didn't know I owed you an ideology.
I thought you had offered me a place.

150
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:16,875
I have nothing to gain.
I'm only an intermediary, dear Zehra.

151
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,083
And you're a prophet now?

152
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:24,250
See you when you're homeless again.
May Allah watch over you.

153
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,500
Serdar?

154
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,875
You may sit down.

155
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,666
Serdar, what are you doing?

156
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,625
Please, have a seat. It's a busy day.

157
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,000
I have many more cases to handle.

158
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:05,166
-Are you serious?
-Please!

159
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,875
-Serdar, don't be ridiculous.
-Please.

160
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,583
Why are you so surprised?

161
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:24,583
Since we're not together anymore,
there isn't an ethical problem, right?

162
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:26,916
Well…

163
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:31,125
You requested a meeting. We're waiting
on the Medical Association's report.

164
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,958
In the meantime,
let's clarify some things.

165
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,458
Sure.

166
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:40,916
-You had an early surgery that morning.
-Yes.

167
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,541
But, after the surgery,
it seems your system was off for a while.

168
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:49,833
Then your system was online again.
For this patient.

169
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,916
-Osman Akçakaya.
-Yes.

170
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,500
What is the reason?

171
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:57,916
I had an urgent matter.

172
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,666
Now, look. Let's make it clear.

173
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,416
We will speak
in a clear, descriptive, and plain manner.

174
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,291
What was the urgency?

175
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:15,958
-Due to Emel's debt to the bank…
-Emel?

176
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:27,500
Due to my sister's debt to the bank,
my mom's flat is being foreclosed.

177
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:30,416
So, I had to take a short break from work.

178
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,666
Do you have any legal right to do so?

179
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,833
I had a surgery in the morning.
It took too long.

180
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:45,666
I talked to a colleague who covered for me
and took care of my patients.

181
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,208
There is such a custom among surgeons.

182
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:55,416
-What time was the patient check-in?
-1:40 p.m.

183
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,583
What kind of tests did you run?

184
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:01,500
Blood tests, ECG, and general examination.

185
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:06,125
You did everything required,
or might you have forgotten something?

186
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:09,083
Of course I did.
No, I didn't forget anything.

187
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:12,166
I talked to a doctor friend this morning
who's a professor.

188
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,750
They said, "A careful doctor
would definitely do a contrast thorax."

189
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,666
What do you think?

190
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:22,333
The patient didn't have any complaints
that would lead me to do so.

191
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:25,916
And it wasn't possible
to do it that day in the hospital.

192
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,125
-I explained that to the Chief Physician.
-Possible or not, that's another matter.

193
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,541
But you didn't inform the patient.

194
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,833
Also, you refused
some of the patient's requests.

195
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,625
-Like what?
-Such as…

196
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:46,958
The patient's wife, Mrs. Yıldız
asked you to give the patient sedatives.

197
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,083
And you refused.

198
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:52,375
You can't give a patient sedatives
just because their wife asks.

199
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,208
I did the right thing.

200
00:16:56,791 --> 00:17:00,291
Of course, you would know better
what is medically correct.

201
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,041
However, wouldn't such a request…

202
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,666
indicate a serious problem,

203
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:10,125
and thus require you
to be more meticulous about the case?

204
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:15,166
Everything came out clean.
His blood tests, his ECG…

205
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,833
I'm a doctor, not an oracle.

206
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:20,833
Yeah…

207
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,916
Unfortunately, professions
that deal with human life

208
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,083
carry great responsibilities.

209
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,916
Do you plan to go abroad these days?

210
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,291
To France, for example?

211
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm considering
whether to request a travel ban or not.

212
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:23,333
Why are you here?

213
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,250
I came to wish him a speedy recovery.

214
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,458
Welcome. Thanks, there you said it.

215
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,625
Are you kicking me out?

216
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:38,000
Is there anything left to say, Zehra?

217
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:40,333
Yes.

218
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,625
It's not easy to tell you this,
but I will anyway.

219
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:54,833
Harun, you still haven't done
what I asked you. And that's not right.

220
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:59,291
-How do you know if it's right or not?
-Because I love you.

221
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,125
I loved you the moment I saw you.

222
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:09,541
My heart knew you
once it was in your gravitational field.

223
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,625
That's how I know, this is not you.

224
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:19,375
What if my dad…?
What if my dad died, Zehra? I…

225
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:24,291
I don't know what we would do then.

226
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:29,250
But I would still be here.
I would still hug you.

227
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:34,000
I don't know, Zehra. I'm so…

228
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,666
-I've been so scared, Zehra.
-Okay.

229
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:40,791
Okay.

230
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:43,708
Okay, it's all right.

231
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,666
It's all right. Okay, it's all right.

232
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:58,416
I didn't know he was such a psychopath.

233
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:04,083
The speed he found out
and took over the case is incredible.

234
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:09,041
The whole of Türkiye already knows.

235
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:11,333
I'm not surprised, but…

236
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,166
What will you do?

237
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:17,875
I don't know.

238
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:24,958
I just want to lay low for a while.

239
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:31,333
I don't want to come to classes either.

240
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:35,458
Why?

241
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:43,208
I feel like everybody knows,
talks, and stares at me.

242
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:49,250
Don't think about the classes.

243
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:52,958
It's almost time for the exam.

244
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:57,500
Please don't quit. We'll study together.

245
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:08,291
-What are you doing?
-Where?

246
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:11,625
No. Louis.

247
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:14,500
-What is the name?
-What are you doing? Louis.

248
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:15,583
-Wait a moment.
-Louis.

249
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:18,375
-Don't be ridiculous.
-Looks like an old porn site.

250
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:21,291
-Ridiculous!
-Please stop!

251
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:23,291
-Okay, okay, stopping.
-Stop!

252
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:25,208
-Stop it!
-Stop it?

253
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:31,125
What? The woman I love became famous,
shouldn't I enjoy it?

254
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:35,166
-What?
-Yes. You're famous.

255
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:38,958
Surprised?

256
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:44,208
Or… that I enjoyed it?

257
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:49,791
Or because you're the woman I love?

258
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:53,291
I don't know.

259
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:55,416
-I don't know.
-I don't know.

260
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,916
-I don't know.
-I don't know.

261
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:03,833
It's hard for you to go to France now.

262
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:10,958
That's why I'm bringing France to you.

263
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:31,666
No matter where you go,

264
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:35,666
the city you leave behind
will always follow. Always.

265
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:39,041
Why did you come here then?

266
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,166
I'll give you the long answer later.

267
00:24:47,416 --> 00:24:50,375
The short answer is, to find you.

268
00:24:54,416 --> 00:24:55,416
You.

269
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:31,125
I prayed so much.

270
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:34,333
I even prayed in the church
I accidentally walked into today.

271
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:39,833
Likely accepted due to its influence.
Some places are different.

272
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:47,333
It's all over now, right?

273
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:51,250
It's not that easy.

274
00:25:52,833 --> 00:25:53,833
But why?

275
00:25:54,708 --> 00:25:57,416
Harun's dad is getting better.
He'll be fine.

276
00:25:57,916 --> 00:26:00,583
And they said
they'll withdraw the complaint.

277
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:05,083
There are both administrative
and criminal investigations.

278
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:07,708
What if there's no complaint?

279
00:26:07,791 --> 00:26:11,666
They deleted the video.
And this will fade away.

280
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:15,666
Like everything else in this country.

281
00:26:16,916 --> 00:26:21,833
The administrative wouldn't be a problem,
but I'm not sure about the criminal case.

282
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:24,458
Why?

283
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:31,333
Life is an interesting fiction.
That's why.

284
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:38,083
By the way…

285
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:44,083
I hesitated to ask,
but what happened to Diego?

286
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:47,333
Missing, sadly.

287
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:55,250
But I'm sure he'll come back.
Because I'll pray a lot for him too.

288
00:26:56,416 --> 00:27:00,208
I'm sure my prayers will be answered.
I'm sure he'll come back.

289
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:03,458
Call an ambulance! Please help!

290
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:07,875
Is there a doctor? Help, please!

291
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:12,750
-Someone call an ambulance!
-Okay, calling.

292
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:15,208
-Ambulance!
-Choking on his tongue! Help!

293
00:27:28,958 --> 00:27:30,291
I'm a doctor!

294
00:27:31,125 --> 00:27:32,833
I'm a doctor! Move aside!

295
00:27:53,708 --> 00:27:55,125
EMEK MOVIE THEATER
REMEMBER!

296
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:57,583
The letter E. "Emek Movie Theater."

297
00:27:58,291 --> 00:28:04,416
"It is at the corner where Yeşilçam Street
meets İstiklal Avenue in Beyoğlu."

298
00:28:05,958 --> 00:28:09,416
"It was built in 1957
on the site of the old Melek Cinema,

299
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:14,666
along with Küçük Emek Movie Theater,
the old Sümer and Rüya Cinemas,

300
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:17,916
by Emek Cinema Limited Liability Company."

301
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,833
"99% of the shares of this company
belong to the Pension Fund,

302
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,083
and 1% to businessman Kemal Erbaş."

303
00:28:24,166 --> 00:28:29,250
"Emek Cinema
was opened on April 19, 1958."

304
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:33,791
Emek, Melek, Sümer, and Rüya.
Like four sisters.

305
00:28:33,875 --> 00:28:36,500
Emek being the eldest sister. Sister Emek.

306
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:39,333
Yes, I'm sure this place
was a big sister for some.

307
00:28:39,416 --> 00:28:41,791
A big sister
they introduced their first loves to,

308
00:28:41,875 --> 00:28:44,625
where they could get
a few hours of safe sleep for a few coins

309
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:46,416
when they were homeless and broke.

310
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,250
Directly connected to the street,
it covered your poverty and loneliness,

311
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:54,000
letting you rest like a seed
in the darkness.

312
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:58,000
But the city can be very cruel, sister.

313
00:28:58,083 --> 00:29:00,791
Everyone wants to eat you whole sometimes.

314
00:29:00,875 --> 00:29:04,750
Even if you're not
a tired, wretched young girl anymore.

315
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:08,583
Even if you're a woman who spun a cocoon
thinking it would protect you,

316
00:29:08,666 --> 00:29:10,583
with a reputable profession and skills,

317
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:13,458
you can still be swallowed whole,
Sister Emek.

318
00:29:13,541 --> 00:29:17,625
I don't have to tell you this.
You know it yourself.

319
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,250
Mommy?

320
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:37,875
What's wrong?

321
00:29:40,416 --> 00:29:41,458
What do you mean?

322
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:47,958
Oh, okay. Where are you?

323
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:50,500
Okay.

324
00:29:59,125 --> 00:30:00,458
My grandma.

325
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,750
I have to go to Amasya.

326
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:27,583
