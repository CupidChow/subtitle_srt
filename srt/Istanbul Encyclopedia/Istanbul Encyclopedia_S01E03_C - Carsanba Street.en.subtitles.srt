Diego?

15
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:31,625
Diego.

16
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:37,625
Diego.

17
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:46,208

00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:54,791
Diego!

19
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:57,333
My boy! Diego!

20
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:00,666
Not you, baby. I'm looking for Diego.

21
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,166
Diego!

22
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:10,166
Diego!

23
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:21,458
-Yes, Mr. Bekir?
-Ms. Nesrin, hello.

24
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,916
Can we talk later
if it's not urgent, Mr. Bekir?

25
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:28,666
It's been over three years
since you submitted your fingerprints.

26
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,416
You must come now.
Also, the interview is very soon.

27
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,166
Oh, was it today?

28
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,708
Yes. I tried to handle it without you,

29
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:39,458
but since this is a long-term residency,
they want to see you.

30
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,250
Okay. Okay, Mr. Bekir. Okay.

31
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:56,375
SERDAR
CALL

32
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,791
Give me your ID.

33
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:15,625
-Fill out this form and bring it back.
-I've lost my ID. Would this do?

34
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,000
Okay. When you're done, wait in that room.

35
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,916
-We'll come for the interview.
-Okay.

ASSOCIATION OF TOMORROW'S INTELLECTUALS
SCHOLARSHIP

37
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,833
Left thumb.

38
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,458
Left four fingers.

39
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,875
-Left four fingers.
-Okay.

40
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:45,583
Look at the camera.

41
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,291
Take a step back.

42
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:51,625
No smiling.

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,166
Now, do you receive financial help

44
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,041
from any official
or non-official organization,

45
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:04,541
religious association or cult?

46
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,208
No.

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,416
If you qualify for this scholarship,
what kind of support will it provide you?

48
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,791
-What will you use it for?
-I need money for accommodation.

49
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,875
But Ms. Nesrin said

50
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:23,041
that you're staying together,
when she referred you.

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,958
Yes, but she's moving abroad,
so I need to find another solution.

52
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,500
Well, what is your biggest dream

53
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:37,416
that you hope to achieve for this country
after graduation?

54
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,791
First of all,
I will eliminate the rent issue.

55
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:44,041
I will build houses and dormitories,

56
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:48,375
to solve the housing problem
for students in this country. One by one.

57
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:52,708
As you know, we don't accept
scholarship applications midterm.

58
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:56,583
But we hold Ms. Nesrin dear.
She is highly esteemed by our association.

59
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:02,708
We will evaluate your situation
and get back to you as soon as possible.

60
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:08,375
-Is there something wrong?
-No.

61
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,875
Do you have someone in France?

62
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:19,666
No.

63
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:25,583
Do you plan to return to your country
within five years of your departure?

64
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,666
No. I want to stay there
for the rest of my life.

65
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:34,041
You mean as long as France lets you.

66
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,416
-Of course.
-Good.

67
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,250
What is your reason for going?

68
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:46,833
It is stated clearly in my application.

69
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:47,875
Ma'am.

70
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:53,833
Please answer the questions asked.
No more, no less.

71
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,333
-Sure.
-Good.

72
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,500
Your reason for going?

73
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:04,875
-I want to continue my career in France.
-Why?

74
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:08,625
Because I no longer
want to live in Türkiye.

75
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,375
Why?

76
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:14,875
Because I can't live here anymore
due to the deteriorating cultural,

77
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:18,500
social, economic
and professional conditions,

78
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:21,000
especially in the last ten years.

79
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,250
Ma'am, do you have a contract

80
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,458
stating your future employment
at the hospital?

81
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:31,375
Yes.

82
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,416
And passport please.

83
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,833
Thank you.

84
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,041
My mind hasn't changed.

85
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:49,750
If there are no feelings, it won't matter
even if you climb Everest.

86
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:52,041
The package is what matters, dear.

87
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,125
-The package.
-Don't be silly.

88
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:55,208
-Pelin!
-Hello.

89
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,333
-But listen.
-Hi.

90
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,250
-This is what I realized.
-Welcome.

91
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,416
If there is one thing better than sex,

92
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,750
it's having someone scratch your back
whenever you want.

93
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:07,875
That's the most absurd thing
I've heard all week. Thank you.

94
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,208
Shut it.

95
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:12,791
-Why? What did I say?
-Guys. I'm starving.

96
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,500
Can we please order a takeout?
Let's order it online.

97
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:19,125
I'm flat broke, guys.
We shouldn't have gone to bowling.

98
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:23,208
Don't worry, dear. It's not just you,
the whole country is broke.

99
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,875
Bowling is a luxury now?

100
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:28,000
-Here she goes again.
-Is this what we've come to?

101
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:31,291
Let's share a pizza.
Maybe we'll find a discount or promotion.

102
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,333
-Give me the phone.
-Here.

103
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:34,625
I'll handle it.

104
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:39,833
-Can I get one thin crust pizza?
-Thick! Why would you get less?

105
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:43,708
We'll have a thick crust one too.
What toppings do you want, sir?

106
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,500
Fried meat.

107
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,625
A fried meat pizza.
A bit heavy, but your choice.

108
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,041
Ms. Pelin, your order?

109
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:53,375
-Buy one, get five.
-"Buy one, get five."

110
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:57,166
She outdid Dodo.
So, Ms. Selin, what would you like?

111
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,833
-French fries.
-French fries. Such a visionary. Really.

112
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:03,125
Now, this is a very important order.

113
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:06,000
The most important one.
This order means a lot to us.

114
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,958
-Ms. Zehra, how are you?
-Thank you, sir. How are you?

115
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:12,416
I'm fine too. Thank you very much.
What would you like to order?

116
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,416
-A mushroom pizza.
-Mushroom?

117
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,333
-Yes.
-Great choice.

118
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:17,791
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

119
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:22,541
So, now that the orders are done,
there is one last thing we need to do.

120
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:24,791
-What?
-The pizza dance.

121
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:28,041
-This nonsense sometimes works.
-No, it always works.

122
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,666
Not nonsense, a good luck charm.
Now we'll prove it.

123
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,000
It worked the other day.

124
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:33,875
Discounted pizza

125
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,500
Discounted pizza

126
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,708
-Pizza!
-Discounted pizza

127
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,291
-Sujuk and mushrooms!
-Discounted pizza

128
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,291
-Refreshing.
-Do it, man.

129
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:45,625
It's coming.

130
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,833
Goal! It worked!

131
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,250
Idiot! You fool! You scared me!

132
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,916
-Come on, Harun.
-Coming, sir.

133
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:04,166
Okay, guys. Let's start with a warm-up.

134
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:07,875
Listen to what I say.

135
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:12,208
You'll go faster
every time I clap my hands.

136
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:17,958
Four.

137
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:22,500
Fast and big. On a fixed route.
Fast and big.

138
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,541
Five.

139
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:29,958
And then it's gonna be zero at some point.
Completely zero. Even your eyes.

140
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,458
Feel yourself floating like the air.

141
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,250
Focus on your breathing.

142
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:42,125
You are all by yourself.

143
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:48,291
We begin with Selin's story this week.

144
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,958
Tell us when you're ready, Selin.

145
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,333
I once had the chance to travel abroad
with my parents when I was a kid.

146
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:10,833
Back then, even a public servant family
could take a trip with their kids.

147
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,250
It wasn't a luxury.

148
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:18,291
Then, over my 20 years of life,
I witnessed every surge of the dollar.

149
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,291
I remember when it rose
from 7 to 13 liras.

150
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,708
I think I was 14.

151
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:29,666
Why did a 14-year-old
have to worry about that?

152
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,958
We went to Hamburg.

153
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,583
On our first morning,
we stopped by a coffee shop.

154
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,791
A woman with her kid in front of me

155
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,833
was trying to choose her coffee,
calm and happy.

156
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:42,500
She seemed like she had no worries

157
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,958
or hurry in life.

158
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,416
At first, I admired that calmness.

159
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:53,541
But as time passed,
my admiration was replaced by resentment,

160
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,083
even anger.

161
00:10:55,875 --> 00:11:00,583
In many ways, I didn't find it strange
to feel anger towards a white European.

162
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,000
But the strange thing is,

163
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,875
I felt the same anger
towards that innocent kid.

164
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:11,083
I couldn't accept
that they were living in prosperity there.

165
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,708
Okay, it's not their fault.

166
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,583
But it wasn't my fault either.

167
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:20,000
I checked everywhere.
I told every shopkeeper.

168
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,458
-Had them put up his photos.
-I noticed.

169
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,041
Don't worry.
We will definitely find Mr. Diego.

170
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,458
-If anything comes up, call me.
-Serdar.

171
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:38,958
I…

172
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:46,791
I'm so sorry to come to you like this
after everything that's happened.

173
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,916
I felt so helpless.

174
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,250
It's fine. I'm like his father after all.

175
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:02,458
I… need your help with one more thing.

176
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,250
What is it?

177
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,958
Zehra. We argued.

178
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:10,875
She left home.

179
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:16,916
I went to her school, but it's impossible
to convince her in front of her friends.

180
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,625
I don't know where she's staying.
I'm worried sick.

181
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,708
-She's probably with her friends.
-No.

182
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:25,541
She didn't tell them
she wasn't staying with me.

183
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,041
So, she's not with them.

184
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:35,333
I don't know if you can find where she is,
but I couldn't think of anything else.

185
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,125
Give me her number.

186
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,208
I sent it.

187
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:54,125
You're not taking this the wrong way,
are you?

188
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:58,541
MISSING
MY CAT DIEGO IS MISSING

189
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,000
Hi, Zeynep.

190
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,083
How are you?

191
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:11,458
Perfect.

192
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:15,708
What's wrong?

193
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,583
I'm helpless and hopeless.

194
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,333
And homeless, with nowhere to go.

195
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:28,625
Don't lose hope just yet.
Keep holding on. What's the matter?

196
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:33,875
-How could it possibly get worse?
-There are countless worse options.

197
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,541
But no matter what,

198
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,916
if people only realized
that everything in life is temporary,

199
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,750
the anxiety of both happiness and sadness
would lessen a bit, don't you think?

200
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,583
I'm not sure anymore.

201
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,916
It feels like
once the anxiety penetrates your soul,

202
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,208
it never leaves.

203
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:03,875
Everything is beautiful, though.
No matter what happens to us.

204
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,541
Then why all this?

205
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,875
Just for us to witness.

206
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,041
I don't want to witness this.

207
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:23,041
The bakery in our neighborhood
makes great ones.

208
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,416
I buy them every kandil.

209
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:27,958
Thank you.

210
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:34,625
We're having a kandil gathering tonight
with some friends. Why don't you join us?

211
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:37,875
I can't come.

212
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,000
-Why? Just come--
-I can't.

213
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,625
Okay. It's your call.

214
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:47,708
Enjoy your class then.

215
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:50,666
You too.

216
00:16:54,458 --> 00:17:00,125
KARDEŞ BAKERY
KANDİL BAGELS

217
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:24,916
Zeynep?

218
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,416
They were delicious.

219
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,541
-Why don't you come in?
-May I?

220
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:37,125
Sure. Come right in. Welcome.

221
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,833
-Should I take my shoes off here?
-Sure, yeah.

222
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,583
-I'll give you some slippers.
-Okay. Thanks.

223
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:52,416
I repented of all my sins and mistakes.

224
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,208
Blasphemy, polytheism,
rebellion, sin and fault.

225
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:00,500
Whatever happened,
I repented and felt regret.

226
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,000
Oh, Mighty Allah,

227
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:06,583
any blasphemy, rebellion
or shirk committed

228
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:10,416
through our hands, tongues,
or any part of our body,

229
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,625
whether knowingly or unknowingly,

230
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:16,500
in the night or day,
in secrecy or in plain sight,

231
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:20,125
we repent and regret for all of them.

232
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:23,416
I bear witness
that there is no god but Allah.

233
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,041
And again I bear witness that
Muhammad is His servant and messenger.

234
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:30,125
To die in faith in our last breath.

235
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,958
I bear witness
that there is no god but Allah.

236
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:36,500
And again I bear witness that
Muhammad is His servant and messenger.

237
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,958
To cross the Sirat Bridge
with lightning speed.

238
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:42,958
I bear witness
that there is no god but Allah.

239
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:46,500
And again I bear witness that
Muhammad is His servant and messenger.

240
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,416
-Hello.
-Hello?

241
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,166
-My name is Nesrin Caner.
-Yes?

242
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,583
-May I ask your name?
-Fatıma. Who are you looking for?

243
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,583
-Hi, Ms. Fatma.
-It's Fatıma.

244
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,125
Sorry?

245
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,958
My name is Fatıma, not Fatma.

246
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,791
I'm so sorry.

247
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:02,500
Ms. Fatıma. I'm Zehra Demirci's aunt.

248
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:06,041
I'm looking for her. Can I see her?

249
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,208
There is no Zehra here.

250
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,916
Allahu akbar.

251
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,500
Samee Allahu leeman hameeda.

252
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,416
Allahu akbar.

253
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,000
Allahu akbar.

254
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:38,875
Allahu akbar.

255
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,541
How did she find here then?

256
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:43,666
I don't know. But don't worry,
she won't come again.

257
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:47,041
-You want me to talk to her?
-No, I'll take care of it.

258
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,041
Don't trouble yourself.

259
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,166
By the way…

260
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,458
My middle name is Zehra.

261
00:20:58,625 --> 00:20:59,875
Zeynep Zehra.

262
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,000
Lot of Z's.

263
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:07,208
We are Fatima al-Zehra together.

264
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,750
You haven't eaten anything.

265
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,500
I'm not very hungry.

266
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:42,666
Don't worry.
Everything is tasty and clean.

267
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:47,541
Of course. I didn't mean anything.
I'm just not hungry.

268
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:51,000
You should try the lentil balls.
I'm good at lentil balls.

269
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,541
That goes for sarma too.

270
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,583
Yes, it's really delicious. Thank you.

271
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:08,458
-What do you do for a living?
-I'm a doctor.

272
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,125
I guess you are a student?

273
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:20,125
Yes. We're all students.
But I'll graduate soon.

274
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:23,208
-What is your major?
-I study Genetics.

275
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:24,875
How interesting.

276
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:27,875
Why?

277
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,958
I meant, "How nice."

278
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:36,958
We will both be
in the healthcare industry.

279
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:39,541
Yes, we will soon. Inshallah.

280
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:43,791
I don't want tea. No, thank you.

281
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,666
It upsets my stomach.
Theine upsets my stomach.

282
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,791
Sorry to hear that.

283
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:52,125
Thank you.

284
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,583
Do you all stay here?

285
00:22:58,208 --> 00:23:02,875
Yes. We can barely pay the rent.
You know how it is in our country.

286
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:09,875
When Zehra joins us,

287
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:13,333
we'll finally be able to
split the rent evenly.

288
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:18,125
Can we have a word?

289
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,666
Why do you keep coming wherever I go?

290
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:34,125
-What do you think you're doing, Zehra?
-What am I doing?

291
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:38,333
-Is your neck red?
-No, it's not.

292
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:41,125
-Wait, let me see! Let me!
-Stop. It's not!

293
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:43,000
You have urticaria.

294
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,625
Good job. Push yourself a little harder.

295
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,291
Zehra…

296
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:52,375
You're in Istanbul now.

297
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:55,875
You can't just go wherever you want.

298
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:59,333
-What if something had happened to you?
-Would you worry?

299
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:06,708
Is seeking refuge with strangers
the answer?

300
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:10,458
I know her.
Fatıma is my friend from school.

301
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:14,208
A friend who doesn't even know
your real name.

302
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:17,958
At least she didn't judge me for it.

303
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:21,666
Zehra, please pack your suitcase.
Let's go back home.

304
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:24,250
-It's not my home.
-Is this your home?

305
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:28,250
-I don't have a home. Don't yell.
-Zehra, don't do it.

306
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:31,916
You gave me a deadline.
I didn't keep my promise.

307
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:39,375
Zehra, I only asked you to call your mom.

308
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:41,416
To let her know.

309
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,375
Please, call your mom,
explain the situation and let's drop this.

310
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:47,500
-That's impossible.
-What do you mean?

311
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:50,000
-I can't do it.
-You have to call your mom.

312
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:52,583
-What do you mean--
-Because Mom already knew!

313
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:57,166
What?

314
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:00,958
What do you mean she knew?

315
00:25:02,958 --> 00:25:04,791
Are you an idiot?

316
00:25:05,791 --> 00:25:07,916
Could I come and stay without Mom knowing?

317
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,250
-Is that possible?
-You said you lied to me.

318
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:13,625
-That's when I lied.
-Why, Zehra why?

319
00:25:13,708 --> 00:25:16,791
Because I couldn't take
your condescending, disgusting remarks

320
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:18,291
about my mom anymore!

321
00:25:19,666 --> 00:25:21,208
I don't know what happened,

322
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:25,166
and how you two had a fallout
when you were so close, but she's my mom!

323
00:25:25,916 --> 00:25:29,875
And I can't stand
the hate and arrogance against her,

324
00:25:29,958 --> 00:25:32,583
both in your words and eyes anymore. Okay?

325
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:37,875
I knew it would end up like this.

326
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,708
Mom warned me before I came.

327
00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:48,708
So, you were already hateful and biased
against me, is that so?

328
00:25:48,791 --> 00:25:50,625
No, I wanted to love you.

329
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:56,625
Don't you think I can tell
that you see my mom when you look at me?

330
00:25:56,708 --> 00:25:59,875
-Why did you hate my mom?
-That's between me and your mom.

331
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:02,666
-How could you ever know?
-It's all very clear.

332
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:06,041
First time you saw me,
you admired my modern look.

333
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:08,666
Thinking, "Look at her,
nothing like her mom."

334
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,958
You were proud.

335
00:26:10,541 --> 00:26:13,375
-But then you started judging me.
-Zehra.

336
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:17,583
As soon as I found out
you needed a place to stay,

337
00:26:17,666 --> 00:26:21,041
I accepted it right away
despite all the chaos in my life.

338
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:23,750
I didn't know anything about you.

339
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:27,166
When I found out your mom didn't know,
I naturally got worried.

340
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,333
And I pushed you
because she had the right to know.

341
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:35,916
Out of my respect for her, and you.
There is nothing more to it.

342
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,583
Please, put aside what you're holding in,
and let's get out of here.

343
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:44,375
And now you're judging
because of their hijabs, right?

344
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:50,375
You'd feel more comfortable leaving here
if we served you some wine, wouldn't you?

345
00:26:51,916 --> 00:26:54,541
Unless we poured wine like soda.

346
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:57,500
Don't be silly, Zehra. Don't be silly.

347
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,750
I'm familiar with this since I was young

348
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:04,875
from all the condescending looks
my mom has received, okay?

349
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:08,750
-I understand when I see it.
-What on earth do you understand?

350
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:11,625
No, this has never been a problem for me.

351
00:27:11,708 --> 00:27:14,541
What we went through with your mom
is a delicate subject.

352
00:27:14,625 --> 00:27:16,750
You wouldn't know or understand it!

353
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:20,375
And it means a lot to me,
so I can't let you use that here!

354
00:27:20,458 --> 00:27:22,166
-Is that so?
-Yes, it is!

355
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,916
You're the one judging me
based on things that aren't true!

356
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,166
And yes, I find it odd that you're staying
with people you don't know.

357
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:34,583
-I can't let you stay here!
-You think I wanted to stay here?

358
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:38,750
That's what I've been trying to avoid.
I came to Istanbul because of this.

359
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:42,375
I ran away from those dormitories
and came to seek refuge with you!

360
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:47,083
Why would I leave
your brilliantly designed house

361
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,250
and come to this crowded, stinking place?

362
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:51,500
-Am I an idiot?
-Yes, you are!

363
00:27:51,583 --> 00:27:53,333
Stop being stubborn and let's go!

364
00:27:53,416 --> 00:27:56,750
You didn't accept me! You judged me!
So I have to stay here!

365
00:27:56,833 --> 00:28:02,416
I've done things for you
that I would never do for anyone else!

366
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,541
And I continue to do so!
And I'm not letting you stay here!

367
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:10,375
-I'm not going anywhere without you!
-You'll sit here till morning then!

368
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:53,416
Look at me. Look.

369
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:17,791
I'm sorry.

370
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,583
I'm sorry.

371
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,500
Come on.

372
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:30,916
Come on. Please come with me.

373
00:29:40,791 --> 00:29:43,583
My pride wouldn't let me accept
the scholarship…

374
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,583
you referred me for.

375
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:55,125
But my financial situation
overruled my honor.

376
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:35,916
"Carsanba Street."

377
00:30:37,708 --> 00:30:40,583
"It's in Kocadede Neighborhood
of Karagumruk subdistrict

378
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:43,291
of Fatih district,

379
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:47,125
between Mustekimzade
and Valde Madrasah Streets."

380
00:30:47,791 --> 00:30:50,291
"It intersects with Silistre Street."

381
00:30:50,833 --> 00:30:52,916
"Wide enough for a car,

382
00:30:53,416 --> 00:30:56,583
paved with rough stone,
curves left and right,

383
00:30:56,666 --> 00:30:59,875
and has two-story
wooden and concrete houses."

384
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:04,750
"Door numbers are 1-21 and 2-24."

385
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,291
Carsanba Street.

386
00:31:07,791 --> 00:31:10,375
Reporting from
my personal Carsanba Street.

387
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:12,333
With an N.

388
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:18,375
Back then, did they say it with an N,
or did N turn into M later on?

389
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:23,291
The streets of this city are nothing like
the architectural drawings.

390
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:27,166
It's not like walking through
monotonous hallways without excitement.

391
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,291
It's more like I'm in a snake's belly.

392
00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:32,208
I'm swallowed up.

393
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:37,041
I can't take a step,
I'm slipping, sliding into a snake's body.

394
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,083
I'm clinging to other eaten up,
not yet digested souls.

395
00:31:44,416 --> 00:31:47,541
I'm never alone. Hello, my friend.

396
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:52,541
Sometimes I think,
you and I alone can live in this city.

397
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:57,083
Sometimes it's not impossible
to fit in a suitcase.

398
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:59,791
It's possible, but uncomfortable, maybe.

399
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:03,791
Actually, this is all the space I occupy.
A suitcase.

400
00:32:04,541 --> 00:32:07,000
I can leave it with the guard
in the mornings,

401
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:08,500
and pick it up after class.

402
00:32:08,583 --> 00:32:12,958
You can be my home. My home and my shell.
My shell and my home.

403
00:32:13,041 --> 00:32:16,166
I can be your fleshy, juicy, alive half.

404
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:20,208
I can stretch my arms to the streets
like a tower shell.

405
00:32:20,291 --> 00:32:22,750
A suitcase of my own, a shell.

406
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:25,916
A room of light in these streets I roam.

407
00:32:27,291 --> 00:32:30,916
I've decided to continue my life
as a crustacean, yes.

408
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:34,291
Mom, I'm a suitcase now.

409
00:35:51,625 --> 00:35:56,333
