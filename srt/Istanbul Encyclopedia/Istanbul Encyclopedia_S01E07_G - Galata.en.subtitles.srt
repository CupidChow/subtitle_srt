GALATA DOCK'S SHANTIES,
THEATERS AND TAVERNS

AHMED RASİM DESCRIBES THE GALATA DOCK

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,125
IN "CITY LETTERS" HE WROTE
FOR THE MALUMAT GAZETTE,

4
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:19,916
"THE DOCKS PROVIDED A NICE NEW VIEW,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,583
BUT THE SHANTIES BUILT ALONG IT
ARE VERY INAPPROPRIATE."

6
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:27,000
So, what's your plan today?

7
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:36,000
-I don't know.
-Zehra. It's been a week.

8
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,083
You shouldn't skip school any longer.
You haven't left the house.

9
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:45,958
I have to go to work.
There is breakfast on the table.

10
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:48,958
Okay? Get up.

00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:02,333
ISTANBUL ENCYCLOPEDIA

12
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:29,250
I'll ask you once again.

13
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:32,166
I'm sure.

14
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:36,833
I don't know how I could be more sure.

15
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:40,250
I don't know if I was this sure
about anything before.

16
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:42,833
It's your choice.

17
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:45,416
Can I take a picture of you?

18
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:48,833
-Excuse me?
-To keep it as a memory.

19
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:50,791
I'll send it to you once I print it.

20
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:57,208
Yes, I want a serious look
fitting for a chief physician.

21
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,291
NO ENTRY

22
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:16,208
How is your dad?

23
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:18,708
He's been discharged.

24
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:20,875
I'm so glad.

25
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:22,791
Thanks.

26
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:28,250
My condolences. I'm so sorry.

27
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,333
Thanks.

28
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,500
Zehra, the assignments, notes,

29
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:43,166
all the materials of every class are here.

30
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,958
So, you didn't miss anything this week.

31
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,458
I was just very worried about you.

32
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,750
Istanbul Encyclopedia ends at G.

33
00:03:56,833 --> 00:04:01,083
So, we have to pick a letter and a word,
and do the last week's assignment.

34
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:06,041
Did you pick your letter or word?

35
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:08,708
No.

36
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,500
If Reşad Ekrem Koçu were alive,

37
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,041
how would he describe you
in his encyclopedia?

38
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,083
Who is Harun?

39
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,875
When my mom was pregnant with me…

40
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:45,666
my family wasn't very well off,
so they considered abortion.

41
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,750
They said, "Either we have the abortion,
or we stop talking about it."

42
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,375
"We have to decide."

43
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,375
Mom, realizing there is no other way,

44
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,416
decides to have the abortion.

45
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,916
That night, she has a dream.

46
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:06,250
There's a circle of fire in a green field.
She starts walking towards it.

47
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:11,250
She gets quite hurt because of the heat,
but keeps walking, keeps going.

48
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:17,833
When she arrives, she sees a baby.
In the center of the fiery circle.

49
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,791
She jumps in without hesitation,

50
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,333
grasps the baby
and pulls him out of the fire.

51
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:28,083
Then she tells Dad,
"I definitely won't have an abortion."

52
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,958
Then comes the day I was born.

53
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,250
They call a midwife.

54
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:35,958
I give them some difficulty.

55
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:40,500
But I come out quickly.
I wasn't breathing after I came out.

56
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,250
My face was all blue.

57
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:46,791
I was born dead.

58
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:52,125
Just when the midwife
was about to tell Mom,

59
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:55,291
I started urinating and breathing.

60
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,583
I came back by urinating.

61
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,750
I don't know.

62
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,375
Since my relationship with loss

63
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,666
started at the beginning of my life…

64
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,833
Maybe that's why I always lived
with a feeling of loss.

65
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,208
So, I'm a bit impulsive and frivolous.

66
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,250
Feeling I can disappear at any time.

67
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:27,458
But I know that if I came into this world,
it is to conquer that fear.

68
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:32,458
Because I know
this isn't the result of the life we lead.

69
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:36,291
The lives we lead
are just a cause of this feeling.

70
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:51,375
This is expired. You need a new ID.

71
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,166
I see.

72
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,833
-Are you still in university?
-I am.

73
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,791
Good. Our busy time is on the weekends.
We got the weekdays covered.

74
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:06,250
Come and work full-time on weekends.
550 liras a day.

75
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:10,000
-550?
-You'd get a good bonus, don't worry.

76
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,958
If that's okay, you can start tomorrow.

77
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,875
-I don't have any other choice anyway.
-So?

78
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:20,500
It's okay or not?

79
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,416
Okay. Sure.

80
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,750
Congratulations then.

81
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:32,333
Is it cold in here?
You didn't take off your beanie.

82
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,333
That's my style, so…

83
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:38,833
Fine, okay.

84
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,416
Get a new ID. We'll be waiting.

85
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:59,333
-So, what is this for?
-For an ID.

86
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,833
For the ID, we'll take a biometric photo.

87
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:06,000
-You're not ready yet.
-I want it this way.

88
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,041
Are you kidding?

89
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:10,416
No, I'm serious.

90
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,083
You're serious?

91
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,250
Look…

92
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:18,500
If you're gonna pull out a camera
and say this is a prank,

93
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,958
I'm not ready to see myself
on the internet.

94
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,208
No. Why?

95
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,208
-Didn't you say it was for an ID?
-Yes.

96
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,750
The ID is for the state.
You can't be wearing a beanie.

97
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,500
-Why not?
-Sweetie, it's the state.

98
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:39,500
Wearing a headscarf is okay.
The state recognizes it now.

99
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,166
But you must either be covered
or uncovered. Not with a beanie.

100
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:47,916
-Isn't this about my face being visible?
-Just save your breath.

101
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,458
I'm telling you, they won't accept it.
You'll get another one taken.

102
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:52,750
Won't this work?

103
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,041
…the air is very, very clean.

104
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,125
Yes.

105
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,208
Oh, my God. Excuse me for a kiss. A kiss.

106
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,083
-A tiger.
-A tiger.

107
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,333
I want another photo.

108
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,541
-Something wrong?
-No.

109
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,291
-May I look at it?
-Nothing's wrong.

110
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,541
Tell me what's wrong.

111
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:56,375
I can edit it the way you want
with Photoshop.

112
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,625
Sir, can I get another photo taken?

113
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,583
Okay. Go in there,
and ring the bell when you're ready.

114
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,208
Here we go.

115
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,083
-What?
-What's your deal?

116
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:27,875
What happened?

117
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,208
I'm asking what you're up to.

118
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,041
You're wearing a headscarf now?

119
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:36,750
Yes, I'm wearing it now,
maybe I'll take it off in five minutes.

120
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,083
What's it to you?

121
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:41,625
Can you take my photo?

122
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:45,875
Tell me if it's something fishy,
so I won't get in trouble.

123
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:49,291
My name is written under the photos.

124
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,583
You can cut your name out.

125
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:54,666
Will you just take it?

126
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:00,416
Biometric.

127
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:02,791
All right.

128
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,291
COUNTY REGISTRY OFFICE

129
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,083
-157?
-157.

130
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,083
Okay. The monitors aren't working.

131
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:32,375
The ones in there work,
but the ones here don't. I check each one.

132
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,666
Let's start with your fingerprints.
Right thumb.

133
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,333
They haven't replaced them in weeks.

134
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:45,333
If anyone asks, they say they reported it
to headquarters and they'll do it.

135
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:47,208
They fix anything else immediately.

136
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:50,416
Four fingers.

137
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,583
Press your fingers firmly.

138
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,916
Okay, do the same with your left hand.

139
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:01,666
-With my thumb or my four fingers?
-Thumb first.

140
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,375
-Don't move it.
-Sorry.

141
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,000
Left four fingers.

142
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,583
I'm not dying for it.
I just go out for a smoke.

143
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,958
But always… You can take off your hand.

144
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:19,666
Scan a card every time going in or out.
Give me your photo.

145
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:27,875
Give me your photo.

146
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,666
Come on, I'm already busy.

147
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,791
Wow. First time I've seen you this lively.

148
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,625
Is that so?

149
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,500
Will you tell me why?

150
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:45,083
I've had to be this high to tell you.

151
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,083
-Because…
-Because…

152
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,083
Because I quit my job today.

153
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:57,875
Excuse me?

154
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:01,458
Are you not happy?

155
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,041
I don't know. I don't get it.

156
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,041
I quit!

157
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:17,583
Wow.

158
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,416
So, you've made your decision.

159
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,250
You've decided.

160
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,250
Louis.

161
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:29,916
I already have.

162
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,333
I don't know. Maybe…

163
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,541
we would be together…

164
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:44,916
or so I thought.

165
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:50,500
Louis. You knew from the start
I would leave.

166
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,500
That was why I was studying French.

167
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,125
Weren't we thinking the same thing?

168
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,833
I'm not thinking of anything.

169
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,750
I mean, if you were so sure
you've never thought the same way,

170
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:08,250
why did you get so close with me?
I don't get it.

171
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,041
Are you blaming me?

172
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:14,875
No, I'm not.

173
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:17,708
Just that…

174
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,458
Okay.

175
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:21,875
Okay.

176
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,125
This is delicious.

177
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,166
What is your sign?

178
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,833
-Why? Why did you…
-Will you tell me?

179
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,083
Scorpio. Why?

180
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,458
What?

181
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,625
I could change it.

182
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,375
I could change my sign.

183
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,750
I'm not a Scorpio. I'm a Virgo.

184
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:08,708
I'm a…

185
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,875
A Sagittarius, a Leo.
I'm whatever you want.

186
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,833
-Just not a Scorpio.
-Okay, enough.

187
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,291
I don't even have an identity.

188
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:01,208
Until I decide who I am,
I don't even have an identity.

189
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,416
You should do as you want, Zehra.

190
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,625
-As you want.
-Don't give me advice.

191
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,541
Don't lecture me!

192
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm just trying to be there for you.
And I will be.

193
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,208
We will do as you want.

194
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,291
-What do you want, Zehra?
-I don't know.

195
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:35,500
I don't know. I wish I knew.

196
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:40,000
Everything would be so easy.
I wish I knew.

197
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,666
Do you know what I did today?

198
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,500
I quit my job.

199
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,875
And how did I do it?

200
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,125
With the strength you gave me.

201
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,208
I realized

202
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,375
I was using my mom, Serdar,

203
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:09,416
Diego, Emel, everything as an excuse.

204
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:14,250
I've been amazed by
how you dive headfirst into a life

205
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,375
that you say you don't know.

206
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,375
You tapped on my back.

207
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,000
You said, "Go."

208
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,791
You said, "You can go."

209
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,541
Really?

210
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,541
Really.

211
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,958
And I want to celebrate it with you.

212
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,166
Oh, I'm so hungry!

213
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:50,375
I'm so hungry!
I couldn't get enough, Zehra, I couldn't.

214
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:55,541
Come here.

215
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,541
Oh, there is this one too.

216
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:10,541
Come here.

217
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:22,000
Yes. Here it is.

218
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,250
What do you think?

219
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,541
A wig?

220
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,791
Many years ago, in a war,

221
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:49,208
angered by
the Carians' alliance with the Persians,

222
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:53,916
the Greek annihilated the Carian men
and captured the Carian women.

223
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,958
They then depicted these women as

224
00:18:56,041 --> 00:19:00,625
"able to bear the weight of buildings
in their grand, traditional clothing,"

225
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:03,750
condemning them
to a form of eternal slavery.

226
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,875
So, the Caryatids
are actually symbolizing these women

227
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:10,416
crushed under that shame. You know that?

228
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,666
You know so many things.

229
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:16,250
-You're gonna be a great architect.
-I hope so.

230
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,916
But I thought it was the French style.

231
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,166
There was a modernization period due to
the intense French lifestyle influence,

232
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:29,458
and all the new venues being built
were almost like a simulation of Paris.

233
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:32,375
Café de Luxembourg, Lebon, Markiz.

234
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:37,125
Mostly with the efforts of non-Muslims
living in Pera, a place was built that,

235
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:40,708
though not the same,
was similar to Paris's urban structure.

236
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:45,083
And the origin of the word "passage"
is the French word "passer."

237
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,416
Meaning "to pass."

238
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:51,375
-How about that?
-Good. You're not so bad yourself.

239
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,125
So, you want to go to France.

240
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:03,375
If Paris was a part of Istanbul,
and you went there,

241
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,000
where would you really have gone?

242
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,875
Hey, I'm moving to Pera.

243
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,333
Great choice. I think it's right.

244
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,708
-Oh, they're coming here!
-Here?

245
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,291
Your hands in mine

246
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:33,458
Your eyes gazing into mine

247
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:38,500
The day I saw you

248
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:42,833
You set my heart on fire

249
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:47,708
You set my heart on fire

250
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,291
-What shall we sing for you?
-What should they play?

251
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,500
Is "Büklüm Büklüm" fine?

252
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,208
-You heard her.
-Sure.

253
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:20,958
Whatever you say, whatever you expect

254
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:25,625
From the Creator or your fate

255
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:29,833
You can't have it your way

256
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:33,833
Unless you fight for it

257
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It feels like it drowns you

258
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,916
It feels like being reborn

259
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:58,666
It feels like dying over and over

260
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:06,875
If you haven't suffered through
That pain and ordeal

261
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,875
Winding round and round your weary neck

262
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:15,208
Scattered through your fractured soul

263
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:19,583
With questioning eyes at your door

264
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:26,125
Your bitter memories remain

265
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:29,291
-Bravo!
-Thank you.

266
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:31,875
-Great!
-Thank you.

267
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:35,333
Nesrin.

268
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,750
-Emel.
-I can't believe it!

269
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:43,083
I'm in shock!

270
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:45,750
So, we're here.

271
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:47,875
Why didn't you tell me?

272
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:50,625
It was spontaneous.

273
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:52,458
-Is that so?
-Yes.

274
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,750
Hello, by the way.

275
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,625
-It looks great, by the way.
-Thank you. You're very beautiful too.

276
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:03,416
-Thanks.
-By the way, I know you.

277
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,875
Yes. I went to a bar with my friends,
you were singing. It was really nice.

278
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:12,583
Nesrin, look, I'm very popular.

279
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,000
She never came to listen to me.

280
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,750
Tell her about it. How was I?

281
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:31,083
Great. Listening to her was incredible.
She has a beautiful voice.

282
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:33,625
-I'm sure.
-Yeah. It was.

283
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:36,333
-Did you hear that, Nesrin?
-I did.

284
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,791
-Great.
-Yeah, great.

285
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,458
How do you know each other?

286
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:47,666
My sister.

287
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:50,208
Emel.

288
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:51,875
Can't you tell?

289
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,958
-You're the same. I'm shocked. Yes.
-We're the same.

290
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:59,458
-We're the same in every way.
-Is that so?

291
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,125
Yes. You? What's your name?

292
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,291
I'm Zehra.

293
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,166
Yes. Nice to meet you.

294
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,250
Aylin's Zehra.

295
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:11,416
Oh…

296
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,083
The famous Zehra.

297
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:18,291
-I see. She's so cute.
-Thank you.

298
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,250
How wonderful.

299
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:26,666
You're very lucky, you know.

300
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:29,666
-Yes.
-Why?

301
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:32,500
My sister really cares about you.

302
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,625
And I about her.

303
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,500
Look, she brought you to a tavern.

304
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:46,250
She won't move a muscle for me.

305
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:52,250
So, enjoy it.

306
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:58,500
-Oh, Zehra, we had such a good laugh!
-We laughed so much!

307
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,041
That's nice.

308
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:02,833
Sis, give me some money.

309
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:07,583
-Isn't that enough?
-Sis, give me money.

310
00:25:07,666 --> 00:25:11,208
She has lots of money.
She's stingy with me.

311
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:15,083
She actually gave some just now
to the singers.

312
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:16,291
Did you ask for it?

313
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:20,166
-No.
-See, she doesn't give me any.

314
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:21,666
Sis, can you give me money?

315
00:25:24,041 --> 00:25:25,291
She's stingy with me.

316
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,708
She won't give me any.
But she'll give it to you.

317
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:32,250
-What do you study?
-Architecture.

318
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:34,083
-Is that so?
-Yes.

319
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,833
She gave me. I worked for it.

320
00:25:38,958 --> 00:25:39,958
Zehra.

321
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:44,875
I'll be back, Nesrin.

322
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:48,208
She gave me.

323
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:52,916
Sorry for interrupting, excuse me.

324
00:25:53,416 --> 00:25:55,750
Do you have "Boş Vermişim"?

325
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:57,041
-Can you sing it?
-Sure.

326
00:25:57,541 --> 00:25:58,541
Thanks.

327
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:05,208
Attention. Sorry for interrupting,
but it will only take one minute.

328
00:26:05,291 --> 00:26:09,833
You see this beautiful woman?
Here, can everyone see? She's here.

329
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,958
She's my big sister and a doctor.

330
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:19,291
She's such a good doctor.
I'd like to gift her a song, if I may.

331
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:23,250
And… But this is for everyone.
Applause, please!

332
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,541
For Nesrin. But I say,

333
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:35,458
just let it go for a bit! Nesrin!

334
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:48,708
Everybody sing!

335
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,625
July, August, September

336
00:26:55,708 --> 00:26:58,000
Smile through every season

337
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,666
Believe me, life is too short

338
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,000
Maybe we won't make it till summer

339
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:05,625
Believe me, life is too short

340
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:07,875
Maybe we won't make it till summer

341
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:11,666
I let it go

342
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:14,583
I let the world go

343
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:17,416
If you don't want to cry

344
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,041
Just let the world go

345
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:22,916
If you don't want to cry…

346
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,750
-Do you know it, Zehra? Sing along!
-A little.

347
00:27:40,916 --> 00:27:43,166
Ahmet, Mehmet, Süreyya

348
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:45,541
Good for nothing, just a mirage

349
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:50,041
Life will end one day
You'll realize it was a dream

350
00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:54,791
Life will end one day
You'll realize it was a dream

351
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:58,416
I let it go

352
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,625
I let the world go

353
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:04,583
If you don't want to cry

354
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:07,416
Just let the world go

355
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,083
If you don't want to cry

356
00:28:10,166 --> 00:28:11,500
Just let the world…

357
00:28:11,583 --> 00:28:15,000
-I let it go
-Get down, Emel!

358
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:17,291
-Bravo!
-She created a mess!

359
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:21,583
-Let it go for a little!
-Emel, get down!

360
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:24,833
-Bravo, you were great!
-Will you get down? Get down!

361
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:27,250
-Where did you find her?
-It was great!

362
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:29,833
-Get down!
-She trashed the place!

363
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:33,583
-Get down, Emel. Down!
-Okay, damn it!

364
00:28:33,666 --> 00:28:35,583
-Calm down.
-Calm down!

365
00:28:36,208 --> 00:28:38,041
-Get down!
-Just let it go!

366
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:40,000
Emel!

367
00:28:40,541 --> 00:28:42,666
Where did this crazy woman come from?

368
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,750
-Zehra.
-Emel.

369
00:28:45,833 --> 00:28:48,333
-Zehra, just let it go.
-Please.

370
00:28:48,416 --> 00:28:50,708
-What's it to you?
-Calm down.

371
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:53,291
Please, okay, Emel. Hey, shut up!

372
00:28:53,375 --> 00:28:56,791
-Okay, ma'am, take it easy.
-Will you please stay calm?

373
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,166
Letter G.

374
00:29:06,708 --> 00:29:09,291
"Galata Dock's shanties and taverns."

375
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,666
This is actually
the city's factory of shanties.

376
00:29:16,166 --> 00:29:19,166
Fish guts celebrate the night,
smelling rotten.

377
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,250
Hear them.

378
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:23,958
Their blood mixes with
raging waters of the sea, right there.

379
00:29:24,041 --> 00:29:26,166
This is actually a holy reunion.

380
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:29,875
You seem to not know that stinky journey
on the sidewalks. Unbelievable.

381
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:32,583
Attention, attention.

382
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,583
The sidewalks of Galata are crooked.

383
00:29:35,666 --> 00:29:38,416
You know those cunning,
bitter and fierce young men

384
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,916
who have a way about them
even in their stance.

385
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,875
These sidewalks
have a relationship with them.

386
00:29:43,958 --> 00:29:48,500
The hearts of those criminal boys are
like a velvet. Pure silk, just feel it.

387
00:29:49,708 --> 00:29:54,208
That's why, even when in shambles,
women don't fall down there.

388
00:29:55,208 --> 00:29:58,083
But they may get wet.
No one made promises.

389
00:29:58,166 --> 00:30:01,375
These rocks hide
all the waters of the city

390
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:04,125
which are mixed with the fish blood,

391
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:08,500
drunken vomit, boozer's piss,
bully's spit, poor children's snot.

392
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:12,375
And when they find a bit of rainwater…

393
00:30:12,458 --> 00:30:16,916
Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream

394
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,666
Merrily, merrily, merrily

395
00:30:20,875 --> 00:30:23,541
These sidewalks are
sometimes a dirty thrill.

396
00:30:24,416 --> 00:30:28,083
But on these sidewalks,
we experienced the most innocent sorrows.

397
00:30:29,208 --> 00:30:31,833
For example, today,
I was left without anyone…

398
00:30:31,916 --> 00:30:35,375
Sorry. Without myself…
I can't find the word. What was it?

399
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,291
Ah, yes.

400
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:38,541
I was without an identity, right?

401
00:30:40,291 --> 00:30:44,666
Somehow, I was too crowded today.

402
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:47,458
Somehow, I was arm in arm, hand in hand.

403
00:30:48,208 --> 00:30:52,000
Somehow, I was someone,
or even, I was too many.

404
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:57,250
Because this city is also
a bit like shanties leaning on each other,

405
00:30:58,291 --> 00:31:00,333
friends collapsing onto one another,

406
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:05,291
those without identity, arm in arm,
and seeking, hand in hand.

407
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:28,583
