ALÇAKDAM SLOPE

2
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:16,833
A STEEP, UNREGULATED STREET,
THE SITE OF A LARGE FIRE,

3
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:20,291
GULLY-LIKE, ESPECIALLY AT THE BOTTOM,
WITH HALF-STONE, HALF-DIRT STEPS,

4
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:21,791
DESTINED TO BECOME A STAIRWAY.

00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:46,708
ISTANBUL ENCYCLOPEDIA

6
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:56,750
I prepared this show on the way.

7
00:01:56,833 --> 00:02:00,000
-It was all my plan.
-My head exploded. Impossible.

8
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:08,000
Thank you so much.

9
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,458
For letting me stay at your place.

10
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:13,041
I don't know what I'd do otherwise.

11
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:16,125
I'm glad you're here, dear Zehra.

12
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:21,000
I think we'll have
many great days together.

13
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:26,500
-What do you think of this place?
-Boring.

14
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:31,291
Oh, you don't like it?
We could have gone somewhere else.

15
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:32,708
I didn't mean that.

16
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,958
When your mom came to Istanbul,
we came here.

17
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:40,041
That's why I brought you here.

18
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:43,000
She came to Istanbul for a day
in her whole life.

19
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:45,416
And she wasted it here.

20
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,500
I brought her to such a boring place,
so that she wouldn't come back.

21
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:51,791
It worked.

22
00:02:57,375 --> 00:03:00,708
-What do you know about me?
-I can't really say much.

23
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:05,916
But for the last 20 years,
you and my dear mom, whom you really love…

24
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:12,458
I don't know exactly how you're related.
Defining distant relatives confuses me.

25
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:15,583
-I know you don't see each other.
-It's been 19 years.

26
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:20,041
There's a picture of us together
when I was one, you know?

27
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,333
-Yes!
-Yes!

28
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:26,791
You are one year old and I'm 24.
My fifth year at the university.

29
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:31,000
You're wearing a green dress,
and I'm wearing a red one.

30
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:34,666
I didn't know that
since it was black and white, but thanks.

31
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,000
Do you still have it?

32
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,250
I do.

33
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It caught my eye while I was packing.
I brought it.

34
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:50,000
I put it in here,
but I don't remember where.

35
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,083
You're so beautiful.
You were such a beautiful baby.

36
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,708
I know your favorite song is
"Büklüm Büklüm."

37
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,583
How do you know that?

38
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,833
My mom banned that song, that's how.

39
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:27,750
I talk about her like she's strict,
but my mom is actually a great person.

40
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:32,375
-What made you listen to it?
-I had a retro phase.

41
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,083
And I'm really into biographies.

42
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,916
Back then,
I was losing myself on the internet.

43
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,291
I got curious
when I stumbled upon Tülay Özer.

44
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:45,666
She was Zerrin Özer's elder sister.
I'll never forget her saying,

45
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,958
"She hit the top with 'Büklüm Büklüm'
again, but for the last time."

46
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:53,541
If my mom banned it, I would've
listened to it just out of spite.

47
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:58,041
Actually, she didn't ban the song,
only the Tülay Özer version.

48
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:03,416
She said, "Listen to it by Sezen Aksu.
It's her song and she sings it better."

49
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,291
But Tülay was a no-no. I don't know why.

50
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,791
Your mom is strange like that.

51
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:11,708
She is.

52
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,791
You know why we don't talk anymore?

53
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:19,541
-That's off-limits.
-She never talked about it?

54
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:24,333
She hates me that much,
yet lets you stay with me, is that so?

55
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:27,666
Yeah.

56
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:32,833
Humans are so strange.
So hard to understand.

57
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:37,541
First, they treat you as special.
You get used to it.

58
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:40,958
You feel like
you can't live without them. And then…

59
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:44,375
Then they're gone.

60
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:49,833
How can someone, after leaving,
set aside their past, their pride,

61
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:54,208
and the values
they once deemed worthy enough

62
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,708
to change their entire life for?

63
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,250
Isn't that unfair?

64
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,916
That is inconsistent and unethical,

65
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,041
at the very least.

66
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:12,208
I guess you can only do such a thing
for someone you love very much.

67
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,416
Such as your beloved daughter.

68
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:20,708
I lied to you.

69
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:22,916
About what?

70
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,208
Mom doesn't know I'll be staying with you.

71
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,291
What do you mean?

72
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:36,166
This came up too soon.

73
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:42,750
But maybe it's better to talk about it
before the burden weighs too much on me.

74
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,416
What are you saying, Zehra?

75
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,750
I couldn't get a dorm room.
Rents in Istanbul rival Miami.

76
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:52,625
Everyone keeps saying,
"Oh, Istanbul of 20 years ago…"

77
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:57,666
I had no other choice.
I had to come to Istanbul.

78
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,583
-I've missed the first term.
-And you lied to me.

79
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,291
I was out of options.

80
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:05,291
Either a cult house
or the banned Nesrin. What could I do?

81
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:10,375
But your grandma called and asked me.

82
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:14,250
I convinced my dear granny.
She's very ill, but she's still sharp.

83
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:20,458
Did you really think
Mom would let me stay at your place?

84
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:42,916
Before I forget…

85
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,791
The keys.

86
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:52,958
And an IstanbulCard. It's already loaded.

87
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,416
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

88
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:02,958
By the way, you have an amazing house.
It's more than I could have imagined.

89
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:05,875
Can I call you Aunt?

90
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,041
You can call me Nesrin.

91
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:13,208
Since we haven't set the terms yet,
I wanted to ask you first.

92
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,833
It will be hard for me, though.
But I'll try.

93
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,291
I mean, to call you Nesrin.

94
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,750
-What about formality?
-However you want, Zehra.

95
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:27,625
I can get around it
with passive sentences without pronouns.

96
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:28,708
You can.

97
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,708
By the way, we have the same one.

98
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:40,708
Speaking of which,

99
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:45,583
you'll call your mom tomorrow,
and tell her everything.

100
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,875
Otherwise, I can't let you stay here.

101
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:50,291
Okay?

102
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:53,416
Okay.

103
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,458
Fine.

104
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,125
Good night then. Do you need anything?

105
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,458
No, thank you.

106
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:20,000
PRACTICAL ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY

107
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,916
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

108
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,791
Did you sleep well?

109
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:10,708
Like a fox.

110
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,333
Sorry, that's the wrong expression.
Like a log.

111
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:18,375
I'm not sure about that too,
but I slept soundly.

112
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:21,541
Great. It means you felt at home.

113
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,875
I keep waking up in unfamiliar places.

114
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:27,541
-I'm not really a stranger.
-What do you mean?

115
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:31,625
I've been dreaming for months
of coming to Istanbul and staying here.

116
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:34,375
I slept in that bed many times.

117
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,041
Was it the same bed?

118
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,208
Yes and no.

119
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:41,583
For example, I drive a car in my dreams.
I mean it.

120
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,541
I even drove a truck once.

121
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:48,041
-Getting my driver's license will be easy.
-Great.

122
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:53,666
You're at an age
where you dream, live, and experience.

123
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,375
And you?

124
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,125
You don't dream anymore?

125
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:04,166
Of course, I do,
but probably not as often as you do.

126
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,750
What are you dreaming about?

127
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:13,000
Just getting out of this city.

128
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,958
And look.

129
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:22,125
-My dreams came true.
-What do you mean?

130
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,666
I got an acceptance letter
from the hospital I applied to in France.

131
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,833
-Really?
-Yes!

132
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:29,541
-I'm so happy for you!
-Thanks, me too.

133
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:35,041
I'll take a language test in two months,
and if I pass, I'll move there right away.

134
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:36,791
Right away?

135
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,833
You're leaving in two months?

136
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,000
Yes, that's what it looks like.

137
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:57,041
Yeah, it's not easy
to find a place in Istanbul.

138
00:12:57,125 --> 00:13:01,583
But don't worry, I'll help you out. Okay?

139
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,041
Okay.

140
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:29,916
ISTANBUL TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY

141
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,500
-Good morning, guys.
-Good morning.

142
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,666
Welcome to the first lecture
of the second term,

143
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,250
unless there is another class at 7:00 a.m.

144
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,500
I am Özlem Varlık.

145
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:33,458
Throughout this term,
you'll be studying in Istanbul,

146
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:37,916
a city where both ends can't meet.

147
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,375
This city is new and unfamiliar
for some of you, and familiar for others.

148
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:48,958
Actually, it's a brave new world for you.

149
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:52,458
You will learn to look
as you roam the city.

150
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:58,791
You will learn to read people's faces,
the facades of buildings.

151
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:02,958
Slums, office buildings,
mansions will pass before you.

152
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:09,708
Like tired, sad, sorrowful,
anxious, carefree faces.

153
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:13,125
Everything will change quickly,
just like you.

154
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,916
As the city changes, so will you.

155
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,416
Don't you have a past? You do, right?

156
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,750
You have a history. You have a past.

157
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:27,833
In this class, we will study
the city's past and present times.

158
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:31,291
We will examine a book,
or rather an encyclopedia.

159
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,041
The Istanbul Encyclopedia.

160
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,833
You will choose a place
from this encyclopedia

161
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:38,041
and prepare a project on it.

162
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:42,208
I wonder, have any of you heard of
the Istanbul Encyclopedia before?

163
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:49,500
The gentleman who arrived late,
could you tell us your name?

164
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,416
It's Harun, Professor.

165
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,416
Mr. Harun, do you know
the Istanbul Encyclopedia?

166
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,416
I do.

167
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,500
-Could you enlighten us?
-Sure.

168
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:03,291
It's a cultural encyclopedia
written by Reşad Ekrem Koçu,

169
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,708
but it's unfinished.

170
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:09,416
Can you also tell us in which years
that encyclopedia was published?

171
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,000
'44 and '73.

172
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,875
1944 and 1973?

173
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:21,041
Thank you, you may sit.
Please don't be late to class.

174
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:25,500
The Istanbul Encyclopedia
by Reşad Ekrem Koçu

175
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,666
is being featured in an exhibition.

176
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,000
Please don't forget to visit it
while it's still on.

177
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,083
-Thanks.
-Sure.

178
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:34,208
If you're ready, let's begin.

179
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,166
This is my favorite course.

180
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,250
This is my favorite
because once we're finished here,

181
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:45,750
we will be able to talk about
interesting stuff in French.

182
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:50,333
For example, how much Beyoğlu
has changed in the last 10 years.

183
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,958
Or the strange contradiction between

184
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:58,291
being angry at immigrants in Turkey,
yet dreaming of settling in France.

185
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:01,083
Pardon me, it's a joke, of course.

186
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:04,208
I hope you don't mind.

187
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,541
All right, let's get started.

188
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:10,333
-Could you introduce yourself, sir?
-Okay.

189
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:15,333
Please state your name, your profession,
the reason why you are learning French.

190
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:16,875
Okay, my name is Kenan.

191
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,791
I'm a real estate agent.
I have a lot of French clients.

192
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:22,291
That's why it benefits me to learn French.

193
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,125
That's very pragmatic.

194
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,291
Very good.

195
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,125
Hello.

196
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,833
My name is Nesrin Caner.

197
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,916
I'm a cardiovascular surgeon.

198
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:49,958
I'm learning French
because I want to move to France.

199
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,125
Because…

200
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,833
Because…

201
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,666
Because I hate Istanbul.

202
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,458
I like…

203
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:07,458
I like Istanbul.

204
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:14,166
It was designed for
the Imperial School of Medicine.

205
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,833
It was built in the Renaissance style.
It's also an architectural wonder.

206
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:21,666
It was between 1846 and 1852,
if I'm not mistaken.

207
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,083
-So, our school has a rich history--
-Were you born here?

208
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,166
Yes.

209
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:31,125
So, you were born in Istanbul.
Which building are you?

210
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:35,458
A three-bedroom apartment
with an illegal balcony extension. You?

211
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:36,500
Take a guess.

212
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:37,708
I don't know, Zehra.

213
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,208
I've only known you
for two hours and 17 minutes.

214
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:44,791
I've known myself 19 years, 10 months,
and 17 days. What difference does it make?

215
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,666
I'm going out with friends tonight.
Would you like to join us?

216
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,250
-I can't.
-Why not?

217
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,625
Well, there is so much to learn
about Istanbul.

218
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:01,291
-Okay. What's your social media handle?
-I'm not on social media.

219
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:04,958
-Quite mysterious.
-Yeah. I'm full of mysteries.

220
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,666
Can I get your number then?

221
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:10,750
I don't remember.
Everything is new, and so is my number.

222
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:14,083
If you change your mind,
you can contact me here.

223
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:30,708
Diego.

224
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:45,250

ISTANBUL ENCYCLOPEDIA
REŞAD EKREM KOÇU AND ISTANBUL

226
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:07,000
NAME: ZEHRA, HER CRIME
BORN IN TRABZON IN 1902

227
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:24,916
A very long hallway. It goes on and on.

228
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,541
There's a door, painted blue.

229
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:33,958
Every room in the hospital is yellow,
but this is blue. I'm dying of curiosity.

230
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,541
But something tells me, "Not now, Serdar."

231
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,041
"You can't die
before you uncover its secret."

232
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,125
Serdar…

233
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,541
You said, "Don't come to the hospital."
It's okay.

234
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:48,958
You didn't want to say it on the phone.
But I just can't take it anymore.

235
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:52,250
-I can't get to it before I tell you this.
-Serdar…

236
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,625
Please stop the nonsense already.

237
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,125
I'm clean.

238
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,416
Not a single trace left.

239
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,166
-Really?
-Really.

240
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,666
Really.

241
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,125
Really.

242
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,666
Can I check your results?

243
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:38,000
Forget about it, I threw it away!
It's over, dear, it's all over.

244
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,833
-It's over.
-I'm so glad, Serdar.

245
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:46,458
I'm so glad.

246
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,791
Let's dance. Come on.

247
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,791
-Right now?
-Come on!

248
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,041
No, not right now.

249
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,250
Don't reject a healthy man. Come on.

250
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:01,666
I want to drink a little.

251
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:03,791
All right.

252
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:18,000
2014.

253
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,958
March 3rd.

254
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:24,500
Night, raining buckets.

255
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:30,083
I have to go into a bar
because of the rain.

256
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,833
It's crowded and dark in there.

257
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:37,041
Only one thing is shining.

258
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,375
The most beautiful thing in the world.

259
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:44,583
I stare at her all night.

260
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:49,625
Finally, I find my courage
to approach her and…

261
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:52,791
"Sorry, do you have a lighter?"

262
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:08,458
I love you so much, darling.

263
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:14,291
Believe me,
everything's going to be great.

264
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,416
From now on,
we will live life to the fullest.

265
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:26,333
Because we're alive and together.

266
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:35,833
From now on, we will hold on
to each other tightly and never let go.

267
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:50,041
What is it?

268
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:53,666
Our plane tickets.

269
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:58,416
Paris. Right when you want to go.

270
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:04,041
Serdar, why would you do something like…

271
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:08,541
Welcome, Zehra.

272
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:12,875
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

273
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:14,458
I'm sorry.

274
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,625
I'm so happy! For real?

275
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:25,208
I'm not exactly sure what to say
in a situation like this,

276
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:28,375
but just assume that I said
the most beautiful thing.

277
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:30,250
I appreciate it, thanks.

278
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:32,291
Let me get a glass for you.

279
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:35,291
-Thanks, I'll pass.
-Especially on a night like this?

280
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:38,500
I expressed myself poorly.
I should've said, "I don't drink."

281
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,416
What do you mean? Never?

282
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:46,416
Yes. That's why I used the present tense.

283
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:48,333
Why?

284
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:56,166
I mean… I don't consume mayo either
but no one asks about it.

285
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:04,833
Sorry.

286
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:06,833
Let me help you.

287
00:25:08,583 --> 00:25:09,583
Thanks.

288
00:25:12,916 --> 00:25:13,916
Whoa!

289
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:18,083
It's not soda!

290
00:25:20,916 --> 00:25:22,041
Sorry.

291
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:24,291
We're gonna drink all of it anyway.

292
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:30,125
Did you call your mom, Zehra?

293
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:32,375
I will.

294
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:39,375
Well…

295
00:25:40,166 --> 00:25:41,666
Now, if you'll excuse me,

296
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:46,250
I'm going to a mixer
with some people from the school.

297
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:48,833
I came home to change.

298
00:25:49,416 --> 00:25:50,541
Have fun.

299
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:53,208
Go on.

300
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:29,166
Hello?

301
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:33,125
Alaikum salam, Mommy.

302
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:38,958
I'm fine. Everything is okay, don't worry.

303
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:43,833
No, don't worry. I checked in.

304
00:26:47,458 --> 00:26:48,500
I did, Mom.

305
00:26:51,791 --> 00:26:53,625
May Allah watch over you too, Mom.

306
00:27:30,666 --> 00:27:31,875
-Welcome.
-Thank--

307
00:27:32,708 --> 00:27:34,250
-Hi.
-Hi.

308
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:37,833
-Let's meet the guys. Come on.
-Okay.

309
00:27:37,916 --> 00:27:40,666
-Stop talking nonsense.
-I'm talking nonsense?

310
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:41,666
Okay, enough.

311
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,916
Wow! Zehra?

312
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,375
Is it so obvious?

313
00:27:45,458 --> 00:27:47,958
Harun can't stop talking about you, honey.

314
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:53,416
Let me introduce you. Pelin, Dodo, Selin.
What would you like to drink?

315
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:55,958
-A beer?
-Yeah.

316
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:57,458
-Good, okay.
-Okay.

317
00:27:57,541 --> 00:28:01,291
Look, Zehra just came here.
We've literally just met.

318
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:05,000
So, she couldn't have heard it from me.
What's social jet lag?

319
00:28:05,541 --> 00:28:09,916
-Social version of jet lag.
-See? Did you hear that?

320
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,625
Yes. But that's not enough.
She should explain it a little.

321
00:28:14,916 --> 00:28:17,166
So, when you fly-- Thanks.

322
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:20,250
After flying,
your biological clock gets out of sync

323
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:22,666
due to the time difference.
It's the social version.

324
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:25,458
See? What time is it now?

325
00:28:25,541 --> 00:28:28,541
-9:00 p.m.
-Melatonin is released at this hour.

326
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:33,166
But you're out. Bowel movements
start to decrease around 10:30 p.m.

327
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,416
And you're drinking beer.

328
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,833
-Right.
-Here's to health then.

329
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:40,083
-That's so lame.
-To Amazon, then.

330
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:42,416
-To Amazon!
-To Amazon!

331
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:44,291
Alright.

332
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:46,250
-Honey.
-That's it.

333
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:48,166
I'll smack you on the head!

334
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:52,583
I didn't understand the jet lag thing.
But I got it when Zehra explained.

335
00:28:52,666 --> 00:28:56,083
Zehra. I didn't see you in the first term.

336
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:57,166
I just started.

337
00:28:57,791 --> 00:28:58,791
Why is that?

338
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:01,833
I guess I like to be irregular.

339
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:08,833
Anyway. Though late, now that she's here,
it means we've found our fifth member.

340
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:11,666
-Great idea, man.
-Are we moving in together?

341
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,750
To the stage.

342
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:14,041
Here's the thing.

343
00:29:14,125 --> 00:29:17,791
We're going to work on
a very nice play called Amazon,

344
00:29:17,875 --> 00:29:19,708
but we are missing one person.

345
00:29:20,208 --> 00:29:23,083
Not missing. She let us down.

346
00:29:23,166 --> 00:29:25,625
Anyway. Call it whatever you want.

347
00:29:25,708 --> 00:29:29,583
A friend backed out at the last minute.
Would you like to join us?

348
00:29:29,666 --> 00:29:34,625
Hold on. We don't know if Zehra can
pull it off yet. What's with the offer?

349
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:36,500
We don't even know the girl.

350
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:40,041
Sorry, but you can't have it all
just like that, honey.

351
00:29:40,833 --> 00:29:42,916
What does she have to do then, honey?

352
00:29:43,416 --> 00:29:45,333
Prove herself.

353
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:49,041
Don't worry. That's why I'm here, "honey."

354
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,750
-Honey.
-I'll smack you on the head!

355
00:29:58,583 --> 00:29:59,583
Serdar.

356
00:30:01,041 --> 00:30:03,625
You know how much I care about you.

357
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:06,416
Today, I received

358
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:12,291
maybe the best news of my life,
and I'm so relieved.

359
00:30:17,291 --> 00:30:18,291
Yes?

360
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:25,541
I want to break up.

361
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:34,541
Look, love. Listen to me.

362
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:38,250
Look, I know you've been through a lot.

363
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:41,750
Serdar, believe me,
there is no point in dragging it out.

364
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:46,250
All right, okay.
Let's go to couples therapy.

365
00:30:47,791 --> 00:30:51,500
I'll find the best there is.
Like the woman who writes TV series.

366
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:54,208
I'm moving abroad, Serdar.

367
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:03,125
You never give up.

368
00:31:03,208 --> 00:31:06,458
But when I say you're just like your dad,
you get mad.

369
00:31:06,541 --> 00:31:10,958
What does it have to do with my dad?
And yes, I won't give up.

370
00:31:11,541 --> 00:31:13,541
Okay. Moving abroad isn't a problem.

371
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:16,291
I'll visit you.
We can make it work somehow. Don't worry.

372
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,166
Serdar, we live separately,

373
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:21,625
we've set up rules, played games.
It's not working out.

374
00:31:21,708 --> 00:31:25,541
The longer we drag this out,
the harder it gets.

375
00:31:25,625 --> 00:31:28,041
Even when I was in the countryside,
we were fine.

376
00:31:28,125 --> 00:31:30,125
I was only coming when you wanted.

377
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:32,750
Trust me, traveling to Paris
is way easier than Uşak.

378
00:31:32,833 --> 00:31:35,458
-Serdar…
-Don't worry, love. Don't worry.

379
00:31:35,541 --> 00:31:36,750
Serdar!

380
00:31:37,458 --> 00:31:39,875
I want to go there alone.

381
00:31:40,541 --> 00:31:42,208
I want a fresh start.

382
00:31:42,291 --> 00:31:45,625
I don't want to feel suffocated anymore
by not only you,

383
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:49,291
but my sick mother,
my addicted sister, chaotic Istanbul,

384
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:52,958
this nightmarish country, nothing!
I'm tired, got it?

385
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,500
Love, please. Please.
Not now, I'm begging you.

386
00:31:59,583 --> 00:32:04,083
Please. Please, love. Calm down. Not now.

387
00:32:04,166 --> 00:32:05,958
Now is just the time, Serdar!

388
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,333
-So, today is the day?
-Yes!

389
00:32:08,416 --> 00:32:10,041
The day I beat fucking cancer?

390
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:13,541
-Can't we talk tomorrow?
-I've been waiting for it for a year!

391
00:32:13,625 --> 00:32:15,958
I put my feelings aside
because you had cancer,

392
00:32:16,041 --> 00:32:18,666
so you wouldn't be upset,
and to be there for you!

393
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:23,958
I forgot about my own pain!
I kept waiting until I heard the news!

394
00:32:24,791 --> 00:32:26,291
What have I done to you?

395
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:30,041
Just tell me for God's sake!
What have I done?

396
00:32:30,125 --> 00:32:33,958
-What have I done except love you?
-I don't want it anymore!

397
00:32:34,041 --> 00:32:36,416
I don't want it!
But you're dragging it out!

398
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,250
Do I have to have a reason?

399
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:43,375
Do I have to have a reason?
Why can't I just break up with you?

400
00:32:44,291 --> 00:32:48,083
Nesrin, I'm sorry.
My apologies for having cancer.

401
00:32:49,916 --> 00:32:53,291
I didn't believe you
the first time you said it, you know?

402
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:54,750
Yes. I just didn't.

403
00:32:54,833 --> 00:32:57,375
I thought you were trying
to manipulate me.

404
00:32:57,458 --> 00:33:02,500
But then I convinced myself
that Serdar wouldn't go that far.

405
00:33:02,583 --> 00:33:06,083
Please tell me,
how could you think such things?

406
00:33:06,166 --> 00:33:10,666
I am a doctor
but I believe in astrology now!

407
00:33:11,416 --> 00:33:16,708
And you are the god of evil,
a manipulative Scorpio!

408
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:19,625
Stop talking nonsense!
Fuck your horoscope!

409
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:23,375
-Ten years! How can you throw it away?
-I don't want it anymore!

410
00:33:23,458 --> 00:33:27,625
-You wanted it, loved me until yesterday!
-Today I don't! I wanna break up!

411
00:33:27,708 --> 00:33:30,416
But I can't! Just let me go! Let me go!

412
00:33:32,958 --> 00:33:38,791
It has nothing to do with you!
Nothing to do with us! It is about me!

413
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:41,416
Tell me what it is, so I can fix it!

414
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:46,500
I've been fucking you for a year
while fantasizing about other people!

415
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:50,458
I bury my face in the pillow,
so you don't get upset!

416
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:52,041
Just so you don't notice!

417
00:34:07,541 --> 00:34:10,083
-What the hell did I do to you?
-What are you doing?

418
00:34:10,166 --> 00:34:12,208
-Tell me what I did.
-Serdar, stop it.

419
00:34:12,291 --> 00:34:14,041
Tell me what I did.

420
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:16,208
-What are you doing? Stop!
-What did I do?

421
00:34:16,291 --> 00:34:19,625
-Stop hitting yourself!
-Fuck off, Nesrin! Fuck off!

422
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:20,791
You fuck off!

423
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:23,125
Go fuck those assholes
you're fantasizing about!

424
00:34:23,208 --> 00:34:26,208
Fuck off! Of course I'll fuck them!
I'd ask your permission?

425
00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:29,625
-But this time, pretend you're fucking me!
-Fuck off, Serdar!

426
00:34:29,708 --> 00:34:32,750
When your boyfriend had cancer,
you were dreaming of other men!

427
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:34,500
And now that I've beaten cancer…

428
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,041
Istanbul made you lost

429
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,583
Drugged you and messed you up

430
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:49,750
Who knows who beat the drum, oh, God
On your tight skin?

431
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:57,750
Who knows who beat the drum, oh, God
On your tight skin?

432
00:34:58,458 --> 00:35:03,791
Hundreds, thousands of people, oh, God

433
00:35:03,875 --> 00:35:06,958
They all sang this song

434
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,125
Thank you!

435
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:21,958
This song is
for all the sisters out there.

436
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:25,458
-Oh, yes!
-For the sisters.

437
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:27,000
-Yes.
-I think I know it.

438
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:30,750
-What's that? What's the song?
-I'll remember.

439
00:35:30,833 --> 00:35:32,208
-Come on.
-I will.

440
00:35:32,291 --> 00:35:36,791
Whatever you say, whatever you expect

441
00:35:37,416 --> 00:35:38,708
From the Creator

442
00:35:38,791 --> 00:35:39,958
Oh, God!

443
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:42,125
Or your fate

444
00:35:42,791 --> 00:35:47,125
-You can't have it your way
-Look at her.

445
00:35:47,666 --> 00:35:52,000
Unless you fight for it

446
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:57,333
It feels like

447
00:35:58,416 --> 00:36:02,791
It drowns you

448
00:36:03,583 --> 00:36:05,041
It feels like

449
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:07,166
Wow! She's pretty good.

450
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,375
-I like you. Welcome to Amazon.
-Being reborn

451
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:14,291
-Cheers. Come on.
-Come on.

452
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:19,208
It feels like

453
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:23,125
Dying over and over

454
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:29,500
If you haven't suffered through

455
00:36:29,583 --> 00:36:34,583
That pain and ordeal

456
00:36:37,666 --> 00:36:42,125
Winding round and round your weary neck

457
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:45,875
Scattered through your fractured soul…

458
00:36:45,958 --> 00:36:48,583
-You are amazing!
-Guys, take one.

459
00:36:48,666 --> 00:36:50,375
With questioning eyes at your door

460
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,791
Come on! Quick!

461
00:36:54,958 --> 00:36:57,541
Your bitter memories remain

462
00:36:58,208 --> 00:37:03,291
Winding round and round your weary neck

463
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:08,500
Scattered through your fractured soul

464
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:13,125
With questioning eyes at your door

465
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:17,875
Your bitter memories remain

466
00:37:22,583 --> 00:37:24,625
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

467
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:17,083
-Let me read your fortune.
-Will you read my future?

468
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:20,458
It's a manifestation.
How would I read the future?

469
00:38:20,541 --> 00:38:22,291
-Mani-fes-ta-tion.
-What is this?

470
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:24,750
-It's serious. Don't laugh it off.
-Okay.

471
00:38:27,416 --> 00:38:28,416
Turn to me.

472
00:38:32,666 --> 00:38:34,375
Put your hands on your knees.

473
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,208
And just trust me.

474
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,166
I really don't trust you right now.

475
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,708
-Why not?
-I just don't.

476
00:38:42,791 --> 00:38:47,291
No. Just close your eyes
and follow my ritual. All right?

477
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:52,875
Close your eyes.

478
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:00,875
The thing that you desire the most is…

479
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:03,875
-You want to be understood.
-No.

480
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:06,583
What do you mean?
My guess is correct then.

481
00:39:06,666 --> 00:39:09,375
Close your eyes now. Don't open them.

482
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:13,041
Because I see a whale in those eyes.

483
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,250
Yeah, if only someone understands me
like a sperm whale understands the ocean.

484
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:21,583
-I wish that.
-She wished for love too.

485
00:39:21,666 --> 00:39:22,916
Don't ruin the mood!

486
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:27,208
It's sad to be the stranger
everywhere you go.

487
00:39:28,458 --> 00:39:30,958
What else?
Anything you feel obligated to do?

488
00:39:33,333 --> 00:39:34,375
To be successful.

489
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:40,583
I feel like I don't have
any other chance in life.

490
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:43,791
I'm one of those who can't afford to fail.

491
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:46,500
-What's your biggest problem?
-Being homeless.

492
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:50,375
This is too much, Zehra.
You have so many problems!

493
00:39:50,458 --> 00:39:53,541
This is my weak spot.
You hit me where it hurts.

494
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:57,041
-How so?
-It just is. My weak spot. I don't know.

495
00:39:57,125 --> 00:39:58,333
Tell me.

496
00:39:59,375 --> 00:40:02,083
I feel like all my problems would go away

497
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:04,833
if I had a home
where I could just be myself.

498
00:40:04,916 --> 00:40:06,750
Sometimes I look around,

499
00:40:07,375 --> 00:40:10,875
and I feel like
I'm living someone else's life.

500
00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:14,041
Like I've never been here before.

501
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:20,000
But you get used to it in time.

502
00:40:23,375 --> 00:40:26,166
Suddenly, Istanbul embraces you.
You feel like a local.

503
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,250
Yes.

504
00:40:29,458 --> 00:40:30,458
So…

505
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:35,291
There's no problem. I think so.

506
00:40:41,791 --> 00:40:43,416
What don't you want at all?

507
00:40:47,166 --> 00:40:48,458
To become my mom.

508
00:40:51,875 --> 00:40:54,083
I don't want to become my mom or her.

509
00:40:58,791 --> 00:40:59,625
Are you okay?

510
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:01,708
Won't it come true? Why did this happen?

511
00:41:01,791 --> 00:41:05,708
No. I don't know
what will or won't happen.

512
00:41:06,791 --> 00:41:08,791
But there is one thing I know.

513
00:41:10,541 --> 00:41:12,333
That you are a strange person.

514
00:41:16,208 --> 00:41:17,583
So are you.

515
00:41:24,208 --> 00:41:27,458
-Are you okay? Is everything all right?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

516
00:41:29,916 --> 00:41:31,000
It's freezing.

517
00:41:31,583 --> 00:41:32,583
Run!

518
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:36,041
-What are you doing?
-Jump!

519
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,625
-Jump!
-Stop!

520
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:44,708
-Run!
-Stop!

521
00:41:44,791 --> 00:41:45,833
Jump!

522
00:41:49,041 --> 00:41:49,875
Jump!

523
00:41:59,958 --> 00:42:00,958
Idiot!

524
00:42:01,916 --> 00:42:02,916
Yes?

525
00:42:03,958 --> 00:42:05,250
-I got scared.
-Scared?

526
00:42:05,333 --> 00:42:06,333
I was, really.

527
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,541
-Let's take a selfie.
-Huh?

528
00:42:09,625 --> 00:42:10,666
A selfie together.

529
00:42:16,416 --> 00:42:18,208
-Wait…
-Istanbul.

530
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:21,166
ALÇAKDAM SLOPE STREET

531
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:22,166
"Alçakadam."

532
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:24,916
It was written as "Alçakdam Slope",
we saw it.

533
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,041
Not everything written is true.

534
00:42:27,125 --> 00:42:30,583
But it's an encyclopedia.
We can't say, "That's not right."

535
00:42:30,666 --> 00:42:34,166
-Yeah. Yes, Professor Zehra. Was it 1900…?
-'44. Embarrassed?

536
00:42:34,791 --> 00:42:39,583
When was it finished though? Can't be?
Alçakadam. Alçakadam is easier to read.

537
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,708
By the way, this is it.

538
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:45,500
All that talk about being homeless,
making me read your fortune,

539
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,958
but your house
turned out to be pretty nice.

540
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:52,000
It's not my house. It's Nesrin's.

541
00:42:52,708 --> 00:42:55,208
She's kind of like my aunt.

542
00:42:55,958 --> 00:42:57,458
Her name is Nesrin. Yes.

543
00:43:00,541 --> 00:43:04,083
We're still sorting out the terms,
so I'm a bit confused.

544
00:43:04,166 --> 00:43:05,750
-It's fine. Great.
-Yes.

545
00:43:14,041 --> 00:43:15,041
Good night.

546
00:43:15,791 --> 00:43:17,375
-Good night.
-Good night.

547
00:43:17,458 --> 00:43:18,750
Good night.

548
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:24,250
-Go now.
-Okay, I'll go when you get inside.

549
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:27,791
-Just go, it's cold.
-I'll go when you're in.

550
00:43:27,875 --> 00:43:31,000
Okay, I'm going. Go now. Go.

551
00:43:31,083 --> 00:43:34,166
-Go now. Go.
-What? I can't hear you.

552
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,291
-Just go.
-What?

553
00:43:36,458 --> 00:43:39,166
-Tell me.
-Go. You have to.

554
00:43:39,875 --> 00:43:40,875
What?

555
00:44:07,666 --> 00:44:10,625
Letter A: Alçakdam Slope.

556
00:44:12,041 --> 00:44:16,250
It's the first place I ran down the stairs
and took my first selfie

557
00:44:16,333 --> 00:44:20,708
in this seven-hilled city with two coasts
and stairs everywhere.

558
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:24,833
What I love the most about those stairs is

559
00:44:25,708 --> 00:44:28,541
once you start running down,
you can't stop.

560
00:44:30,166 --> 00:44:33,708
When I reached the end of the street,
my heart pounding,

561
00:44:33,791 --> 00:44:37,000
I thought about its description
in the encyclopedia.

562
00:44:38,541 --> 00:44:42,541
"A steep, unregulated street,
the site of a large fire,

563
00:44:42,625 --> 00:44:46,166
gully-like, especially at the bottom,

564
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:51,875
with half-stone, half-dirt steps,
destined to become a stairway."

565
00:44:52,458 --> 00:44:53,541
Just like me.

566
00:44:54,083 --> 00:44:57,250
It has a great potential,
but has not yet been regulated.

567
00:44:58,458 --> 00:45:02,166
This prediction from the past
about it going to be a steep slope

568
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:05,208
made me wonder about 50 years later.

569
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:09,250
At that moment, where the past,
future and present intertwined,

570
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:11,958
I felt that my story with this city
had just begun.

571
00:45:12,041 --> 00:45:13,708
My own Istanbul history.

572
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:23,833
Good evening.

573
00:45:26,583 --> 00:45:27,583
Good night.

574
00:45:30,916 --> 00:45:32,875
I'm sorry, I'm a little late.

575
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,375
Did you call your mom, Zehra?

576
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:42,500
I couldn't.

577
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,083
You promised me you would call her today,
didn't you?

578
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Didn't you?

579
00:45:53,708 --> 00:45:56,250
-Yes.
-Why didn't you call her?

580
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:05,083
-I just didn't.
-It was a very rough day for me.

581
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,500
I don't have the strength
to talk to you nicely.

582
00:46:10,583 --> 00:46:13,041
And I made myself pretty clear.

583
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:17,583
Keep your promise. Call your mom.

584
00:46:26,666 --> 00:46:29,458
You still have time to keep your promise.

585
00:46:30,041 --> 00:46:33,750
Or pack your things and leave
tomorrow morning. It's up to you.

586
00:46:39,125 --> 00:46:40,541
What are you doing?

587
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:42,500
Zehra!

588
00:46:43,916 --> 00:46:45,458
Will you calm down?

589
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,500
I know what your problem is.

590
00:46:49,291 --> 00:46:52,041
I guess everything Mom said about you
was true.

591
00:46:56,250 --> 00:47:00,416
I don't need the pity of a selfish person
who lacks empathy.

592
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:04,208
You know nothing about feelings
because you completely shut them out.

593
00:47:04,291 --> 00:47:08,750
Fine, go then!
Go and see what Istanbul is really like!

594
00:47:08,833 --> 00:47:12,416
Learn your lesson,
return tomorrow night, and do as I said!

595
00:51:09,083 --> 00:51:14,083
