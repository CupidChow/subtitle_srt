ISTANBUL ENCYCLOPEDIA

3
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:19,958
Interesting. Epic. So…

4
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,625
Look at him.

5
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:28,291
-Pelin.
-I got you.

6
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:30,875
I'm sure you'll have more fun.

7
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,125
Truth or dare?

8
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:33,791
Truth.

9
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:36,583
-How many times have you had sex?
-If she counted.

10
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:41,291
How dare you? How are you so bold?
How can you ask me something like that?

11
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:46,250
Kidding. How many times have I made love?
Take a guess.

12
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,375
-Five.
-Seventy-three.

13
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:50,500
-A thousand.
-Whoa!

14
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:54,041
I'm honored, dear Dodo, but… Well…

15
00:01:58,833 --> 00:01:59,833
Zero.

16
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:03,500
Okay, tell me the truth now.

17
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,250
Zero, man.

18
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:10,000
Wait, did I prepare you
for all those dates for nothing?

19
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:13,250
I did your make-up.
You even told me it went great.

20
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:17,791
-So, nothing happened?
-Nothing happened, somehow.

21
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:21,875
What kind of friend group are we?
How on earth do you not like metal?

22
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:23,791
-I don't.
-And you've never had sex?

23
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:27,166
-Okay, whatever. Just go on.
-And that was my secret.

24
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,125
-Zehra's closer to me than you.
-Come on.

25
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,000
I think I made it count.

26
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,583
-Who's spinning? Me?
-Yes.

27
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,166
Let's go! Okay, truth or dare?

28
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:41,333
-Truth.
-Damn! Enough with the truth!

29
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:44,458
-Say dare so we can see something!
-What are you gonna ask?

30
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:50,000
What is your red line in a relationship?
What makes you leave a girl?

31
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,666
-I'll leave her if she lies.
-Shut it, Mr. Cliché.

32
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,250
But it's true.
If she lies, it's over for me. That's it.

33
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:01,416
And blondes aren't usually my type.
I like brunettes more.

34
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,166
I like cute, oval faces.

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,583
I like gazelle-eyed ones.

36
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,000
-That's all.
-He likes girls named Zehra.

37
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:10,208
Okay, I'm spinning.

38
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:16,375
What's up?

39
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:17,833
-Fine, you?
-I'm fine too.

40
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,208
-May I ask a question?
-Sure.

41
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:23,083
Thank you so much. Truth, dare?

42
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,833
-Dare.
-Can I get a big round of applause?

43
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:31,166
Finally.

44
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,791
-Jump into the sea.
-What?

45
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,625
-Jump into the sea.
-Harun, don't be silly.

46
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,625
-You can do it.
-No.

47
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,500
-Yeah, go on.
-Don't be silly.

48
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:46,791
-Hey, it's a game, girl. Come on.
-No, no way. No.

49
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:48,333
You can do it.

50
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,166
No.

51
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,708
But didn't we all promise
to go into the sea today?

52
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,625
I didn't promise such a thing.

53
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,041
Why?

54
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,500
You don't know how to swim?

55
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,791
What if I don't know?

56
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,250
What's it to you?

57
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,083
It's okay if you don't know.
Just say you don't know.

58
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,833
-Hello.
-Hello.

59
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:01,500
Welcome to the French oral test.

60
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,500
Thank you.

61
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:10,958
How are you?

62
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,625
-I'm great.
-Very well.

63
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:22,125
I'm going to be recording your voice
so that we can assess it later.

64
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,750
-Do you agree?
-Yes, I do.

65
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,791
Great. Let's begin.

66
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:38,250
Please begin by introducing yourself.
What's your name and surname?

67
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,500
Nesrin Caner.

68
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:43,583
-Where were you born?
-In Amasya.

69
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,291
When did you move to Istanbul?

70
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,541
-Twenty-five years ago.
-That's a long time.

71
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,291
What's your occupation?

72
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:56,958
I'm a cardiovascular surgeon.
I'm not currently employed.

73
00:06:57,041 --> 00:07:01,791
-May I ask why?
-I resigned to pursue my career in France.

74
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:04,833
You know what they say.

75
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:08,791
You can't leave a city.
It keeps following you.

76
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,000
I don't think it's fair

77
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,791
for a first world country citizen
to say this.

78
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,541
I want to live with you.

79
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:41,125
I want us to solve your problems together.
I want to live with you.

80
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,166
There's only one thing on my mind.

81
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,250
Being with you.

82
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,583
I'm begging you.

83
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:58,625
Please let it happen.

84
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,750
I love you, Nesrin. I love you.

85
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,291
I love you so much.

86
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,375
Louis.

87
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,375
Can we continue please?

88
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,541
You told me
you wanted to live in France, right?

89
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:12,625
You seem like a woman
who has a lot of self-confidence.

90
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:19,000
How can you be so sure that you can

91
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,791
successfully pass this exam?

92
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,125
It's admirable.

94

Hi. I'm calling about
my dormitory application.

95
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,250
You said you'd get back to me.

96
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,750
So, I didn't get it?

97
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:04,666
I understand.

98
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,916
Would it change anything
if I came in person?

99
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,958
It won't. Okay.

100
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,583
Okay then. Bye, have a nice day.

101
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,791
Are you upset?

102
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,416
No.

103
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,458
-You?
-No.

104
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:55,708
Good.

105
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,916
Any news about the dorm you mentioned?

106
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,791
It's not certain yet.

107
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,666
But it will work out. Why wouldn't it?

108
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:18,541
What if it doesn't?
We have to find a solution.

109
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,500
I don't know.

110
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,333
My life has always been filled
with uncertainties.

111
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:32,958
I guess I have to learn to live with it
instead of fighting it.

112
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,791
What do you mean?

113
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:36,708
You know.

114
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:41,166
There are billions of people
in this world.

115
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:45,416
I'm not the main character in the world,
after all.

116
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,916
Everyone is going through something.

117
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,833
Things work out somehow.

118
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,375
When you overcome one mountain,
another one pops up.

119
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,208
I think so.

120
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:06,791
That's why you can never know
exactly who you are

121
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,083
or see the path you're on.

122
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,208
But I think that's normal.

123
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,916
-It is.
-It is.

124
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,791
So, there's no problem.

125
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,333
I mean, at least for now.

126
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,416
When will you get your exam results?

127
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,416
They should've been out by now.

128
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,166
I'm sure you passed.

129
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:47,916
I hope so.

130
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:50,625
I hope so.

-Are we cool?
-We're cool.

No, I'm not.

138
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,375
It does.

-Enjoy the play.
-Thanks.

142
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,208
-What's going on?
-Go on.

143
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,208
Dichotomy has never left me alone.

144
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,750
I don't know if it's my chronic indecision

145
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,958
or the constant search
driven by the feeling

146
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:34,208
that I'm not truly alive
unless I experience things.

147
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,791
But I've always been stuck
between these polar opposites.

148
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,833
Did I have to choose something?

149
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,750
I don't know.

150
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,875
I can't tell you how much I admire
people who can choose a path.

151
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:53,500
Those who say,
"This is what I want, this is my goal."

152
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:56,291
Or those who say,
"I hate this. No, never."

153
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,291
I feel like…

154
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:04,916
my tongue is tied,

155
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,833
my heart is burdened,

156
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:10,541
and my mind is frozen.

157
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:17,041
There's even a name for it
in the literature, you know?

158
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,791
I'm a diagnosed and registered case
of ambivalence.

159
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,666
Experiencing two contradictory feelings,

160
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,750
two opposing emotions,
beliefs, and desires simultaneously

161
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:30,166
and being paralyzed.

162
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,875
Ambivalence is
not being able to do anything.

163
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:38,833
And this feels like the bottom of the sea.

164
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,958
Airless.

165
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:48,541
You must be wondering. No, no one told me
or this character to cover up her head.

166
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,333
So, why did I do it?

167
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,041
Due to a divine feeling?

168
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:57,625
Or was it a reaction
to the looks directed at my mom?

169
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:01,333
Was it in solidarity
with the woman I came from? I don't know.

170
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,875
But even if I knew the answer…

171
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,625
it wouldn't justify your looks.

172
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,625
Don't ever forget that.

173
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:23,000
It was my first day in Istanbul.

174
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,791
I didn't want to cover myself that day.

175
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,708
I didn't actually plan it.

176
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:35,416
It was the will of an unknown reason,

177
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,291
and sometimes you can make a decision
even if you're so confused.

178
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,791
Maybe I was afraid of being categorized,

179
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:48,458
of being judged, tagged,
and etched on someone's mind irreversibly.

180
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,291
Because I'm actually a flighty person.

181
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:55,916
Like a balloon.

182
00:16:57,208 --> 00:17:01,916
A balloon has air inside it.
But no one sees or pays attention to it.

183
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,458
They only look at its exterior.

184
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:08,916
So, I was afraid of getting stuck
in those looks.

185
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:13,041
I wanted to be seen unfiltered
like everyone does,

186
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,250
as much as everyone wants.

187
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:19,041
So, I created two spaces for myself.

188
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:24,541
And I can't say I wasn't ashamed,
because I was very ashamed.

189
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,208
To find a common ground
with the outside world,

190
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:32,500
I removed some stones in between
with an anxious will.

191
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:37,458
And now, in retrospect…

192
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,208
I've become rather desolate.

193
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:46,791
And I don't even know what type of soil
I want to grow in anymore.

194
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:49,500
The only thing I know

195
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,708
is to roam within myself.

196
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,541
To hang onto a word.

197
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,166
Not every piece of gold shines.

198
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:05,250
And not every traveler has lost their way.

199
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,833
Yes, that's right.

200
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,125
That's the way disasters are.

201
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:13,000
Don't they happen
when everything is going well?

202
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:19,416
Because who can know where those who think
they're on the right path actually stand?

203
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:26,208
And who can know that getting lost,
that the doubt, isn't a part of the path?

204
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:34,583
Because I'll probably wake up tomorrow
and have no idea what I want to do.

205
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:41,291
A headscarf, a cap,
a hoodie, a wig, or bald.

206
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:47,041
The only thing I know is,
"Thank God, I could leave the house."

207
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:52,166
If disasters are the stops
when everything is going well,

208
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:56,500
then maybe miracles are found
along the route of getting lost.

209
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:57,916
Who knows?

210
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:01,541
The only thing I know is…

211
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,250
I'm still me.

212
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:08,541
Zehra.

213
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,333
Is everyone here?

214
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,625
Yeah. So…

215
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,583
It was good. I mean…

216
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:38,958
It wasn't bad.

217
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:43,125
Of course,
I have detailed notes for everyone.

218
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:45,708
But let me tell you this.

219
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:49,833
At this point of the play,

220
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:54,000
we can't make additions or deletions
as we wish, Zehra.

221
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,250
But, Professor, you said,

222
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:03,125
"If you have an experience on stage,
embrace it."

223
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:08,125
-"The continuity doesn't matter--"
-It was for rehearsals. For rehearsals.

224
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,041
Rehearsals are a part of
the creative process, right?

225
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,500
It's with an audience.
It's the play's rehearsal.

226
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:17,041
Aren't we repeating the same things
for two weeks?

227
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,416
You did anything different?

228
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:26,041
Everyone was free to create any character
they wanted in the first two weeks.

229
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,583
Have I interfered at all?

230
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:31,583
I wasn't damaging any other character,
only in my monologue…

231
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:34,708
No, each monologue here
affects the others.

232
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:39,375
When you acted like that,
when we heard you act like that,

233
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:40,791
Harun and I panicked.

234
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,750
You two have a scene five minutes after.

235
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:47,333
Doesn't he need to change his reactions?
Because, you know…

236
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:53,125
You can appreciate that the characters
facing a headscarf-wearing character

237
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,958
behave accordingly.
They relate accordingly.

238
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,458
"They relate accordingly"?

239
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:03,958
Of course. Don't we have compartments
in our minds, Zehra? I mean…

240
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:09,166
Okay, let me put it this way.
Picture me as a female stage director.

241
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,333
Right? You can probably do that.

242
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,041
What are you imagining?

243
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:16,875
Beautiful.

244
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:21,958
Thanks, Selin, but that's not my point.
Am I wearing a headscarf?

245
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,875
You're not.

246
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:32,416
That's what I'm talking about.
There are compartments in our minds.

247
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,333
We put the characters in them.
You messed up their calibration.

248
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,833
For example, what was that class called,
Istanbul Encyclopedia?

249
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,833
Professor Özlem's class, right?

250
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:48,833
Can you imagine Professor Özlem
teaching wearing a headscarf?

251
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:52,041
But we can imagine
the lady in the dining hall.

252
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:54,750
You mean it's a class thing?

253
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:58,416
I'm not talking about
a purely economic class difference.

254
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,333
Honestly, I can imagine anyone in any way.

255
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,375
I think it's absurd
we're even discussing this.

256
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:09,041
Doğukan, what are you talking about?
We're not trying to badmouth anyone here.

257
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:13,250
We're not advocating banning anything.
It's about consistency.

258
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,875
As artists, we chase reality.

259
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:20,041
As I told you, it's about
placing people in certain spots.

260
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:24,458
I'm not saying what Zehra did is wrong.
But she wasn't doing that until today.

261
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:27,458
This wasn't the Zehra character
we practiced.

262
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:30,000
Otherwise, it's a credible character.

263
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm not saying it won't work,

264
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:34,708
but she wouldn't be like that
in the next scenes.

265
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:37,125
Or Harun's character
wouldn't say those things.

266
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:40,791
If Zehra's character
was a lead role in a show,

267
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:43,333
can you imagine the writer
wearing a headscarf?

268
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:48,916
Or how do you picture the female executive
who decides whether that show airs?

269
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:51,375
Is it because of people's prejudice?

270
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:54,750
What about the prejudice
of the people wearing headscarves?

271
00:22:55,375 --> 00:23:00,041
They refuse this kind of job
for some reason and this is the result.

272
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:04,208
It's easy to label people as prejudiced
without digging deeper.

273
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:06,375
Maybe if they weren't this way,

274
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:10,166
they would prevent others
from having prejudices, right?

275
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,208
That's obvious.

276
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:14,875
There are many people wearing headscarves
on campus.

277
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:17,208
They should do whatever they want.

278
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:22,083
Even if life gave them an opportunity,
would their religion allow them?

279
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:26,416
No. No, let's drop it.
This is going somewhere else.

280
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:30,541
This isn't our topic.
Ours is the consistency in our play, okay?

281
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:31,625
I mean…

282
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:35,541
That we should act as we wrote.
We didn't write this.

283
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:39,208
Anyway. It's getting late and we're tired.

284
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:42,500
We'll decide
how Zehra's character is going to be.

285
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:47,083
Take the Styrofoam pieces in the back.
And mop here. Let's leave it clean.

286
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:23,291
You really are a strange person.

287
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:53,916
It's great. I've been here for 25 years.

288
00:25:22,583 --> 00:25:24,375
To this world

289
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:28,000
Okay! Don't do it! Please!

290
00:25:31,541 --> 00:25:32,541
Jump!

291
00:25:32,625 --> 00:25:36,416
My soul burns
My soul doesn't know

292
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:43,375
I have a soul
My soul doesn't think

293
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:50,166
My soul is love
My soul doesn't change

294
00:25:50,791 --> 00:25:53,041
My soul

295
00:25:56,791 --> 00:26:01,583
Thump, thump! Doing the final hit
and I'm putting an end to this! Thump!

296
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:06,833
Stop, put it down! Don't!

297
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:15,125
Ta-da!

298
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:17,375
I panicked.

299
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:29,250
Stop.

300
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:55,041
Easy.

301
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:58,083
-Careful, those are fragile.
-Give it to me. Okay.

302
00:27:01,541 --> 00:27:04,583
FRAGILE

303
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:07,208
Emel.

304
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:13,041
There are some papers there.
See if they're important.

305
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:21,375
-What will happen to the furniture, Emel?
-Nothing's left, everything's going.

306
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:25,291
What are you gonna do? Where will you go?

307
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,625
I can take care of myself.

308
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:33,083
Mom? What about Mom?
What about our family?

309
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:35,500
Everyone will be on their own.

310
00:27:36,416 --> 00:27:39,083
I have nothing more to offer
this institution.

311
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,750
Emel.

312
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:52,250
Emel. Emel, can you listen to me?
Just listen. Please, listen to me.

313
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:54,708
Leave it. Put it somewhere. Put it down.

314
00:27:54,791 --> 00:27:56,208
-Nesrin, okay.
-Put it down.

315
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:02,458
What are you gonna say?
What are you gonna ask from me?

316
00:28:14,666 --> 00:28:16,083
I understand you.

317
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:21,250
Do whatever you want.

318
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,250
Whatever you want.

319
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,041
I'll take care of it.

320
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:29,958
What are you gonna do?

321
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,541
I don't know.

322
00:28:34,041 --> 00:28:35,833
I'll take care of Mom somehow.

323
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:38,625
You won't go to France?

324
00:28:43,916 --> 00:28:45,333
I won't, if necessary.

325
00:28:50,666 --> 00:28:53,375
I won't burden you. Don't worry.

326
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:56,833
Come here.

327
00:29:01,666 --> 00:29:03,541
Emel, I love you so much.

328
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:08,708
Sevinç.

329
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:12,583
-Sevinç.
-She's not Sevinç, Mom. She's Emel.

330
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:16,833
-Emel?
-Emel. Yes, your daughter Emel.

331
00:29:21,541 --> 00:29:23,958
-Let's pack up and go.
-Okay, Mom.

332
00:29:24,041 --> 00:29:25,541
-To Sevinç.
-Okay.

333
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:29,000
-We're going to Sevinç.
-Okay.

334
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:32,000
-Let's go.
-Okay, Mom, okay.

335
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:52,791
Diego.

336
00:30:04,875 --> 00:30:06,541
-Diego!
-Zehra?

337
00:30:07,416 --> 00:30:08,416
I've found Diego!

338
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,916
-Diego?
-Yes!

339
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,666
-Stop it!
-Yes, it's him. Look.

340
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,958
-It must be a lookalike.
-No, it's him. I'm sure.

341
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:15,041
Let me see.

342
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:18,958
Diego. My boy.

343
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:20,541
Diego!

344
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:21,666
-Kitty kitty.
-Come.

345
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:24,208
Diego, is that you? My baby.

346
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,208
Come. Here, kitty. Come here.

347
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:37,208
Let's look at you. Come here.
You're surely as heavy as Diego.

348
00:30:37,291 --> 00:30:40,708
-Yes. I think you are him.
-Really?

349
00:30:41,458 --> 00:30:43,291
Yes. Yes! Diego.

350
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:48,625
Where were you? Where did you go?

351
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:22,166
What is it?

352
00:31:26,458 --> 00:31:28,125
I was thinking about Diego.

353
00:31:31,166 --> 00:31:35,333
He really missed you.
You'll never be apart again.

354
00:31:36,833 --> 00:31:39,208
-It's not that easy.
-Why?

355
00:31:40,041 --> 00:31:42,291
Diego can't travel anymore.

356
00:31:43,625 --> 00:31:44,541
How so?

357
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:50,500
Because he's an old cat.
At this age, moving him would be cruel.

358
00:31:52,041 --> 00:31:56,708
Don't worry. He must have been through
some crazy adventures. He'll be fine.

359
00:32:03,583 --> 00:32:05,333
-Hello?
-Hello? Hello, Nesrin?

360
00:32:05,916 --> 00:32:06,916
Louis?

361
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,416
The official exam results
arrived by email today.

362
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,958
-But I wanted to let you know personally.
-Okay.

363
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:20,041
I wanted to let you know
whatever we had was great.

364
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:22,958
Yes, of course it was.

365
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:29,625
You passed the exam.
With a very high score, at that.

366
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:31,916
Really?

367
00:32:32,958 --> 00:32:33,958
Have a good trip.

368
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:37,833
Thank you.
Thank you for everything, Louis.

369
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,291
What happened?

370
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:46,333
If I go,

371
00:32:47,958 --> 00:32:49,583
will you take care of Diego?

372
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:57,291
Of course I will, though I'm still unsure
how I'll take care of myself, so…

373
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,666
But I'll definitely find him a place.

374
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,791
How about you stay here with him?

375
00:33:03,291 --> 00:33:04,833
Won't you sell the house?

376
00:33:05,958 --> 00:33:08,125
If you look after Diego, I won't.

377
00:33:11,458 --> 00:33:12,458
Really?

378
00:33:12,541 --> 00:33:13,666
Zehra.

379
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:16,833
Yes?

380
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:19,333
I passed the exam.

381
00:33:26,708 --> 00:33:30,041
Congratulations! I'm not surprised.

382
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:31,375
I knew it.

383
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:37,041
All right, guys. This is our last class.

384
00:33:37,541 --> 00:33:40,541
I know this hasn't been a typical class.

385
00:33:40,625 --> 00:33:43,750
I even heard you discussing
among yourselves

386
00:33:43,833 --> 00:33:46,708
whether this was
architecture or literature.

387
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:49,708
But I'd like to think
you understand my point.

388
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:52,708
Maybe when you design your projects
in the future,

389
00:33:52,791 --> 00:33:55,875
you'll remember this assignment
and act sensibly,

390
00:33:55,958 --> 00:34:00,208
thinking you might be
in someone's encyclopedia.

391
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:04,833
While years and people have been doing
all kinds of harm to the city,

392
00:34:04,916 --> 00:34:06,833
Istanbul is still lovely.

393
00:34:06,916 --> 00:34:11,041
But I will ask you to remember Istanbul
and let it breathe.

394
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:14,125
Because the truth is,
this city is suffocating.

395
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:18,250
But to be able to do this,
you need to have your own places.

396
00:34:18,958 --> 00:34:20,708
What affected you the most?

397
00:34:21,541 --> 00:34:24,916
What was your letter, your word?

398
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:29,500
Yes, now let's share them.

399
00:34:30,166 --> 00:34:34,958
Maybe you have common places.
Or some of you will discover new places.

400
00:34:37,416 --> 00:34:38,916
Go ahead, please.

401
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,750
Letter N. Nesrin's house.

402
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:57,041
In the current dictionary,
this is stated for Nesrin.

403
00:34:57,833 --> 00:34:59,541
"The meaning of the name Nesrin,

404
00:34:59,625 --> 00:35:02,458
which has passed into our language
from Persian, is wild rose."

405
00:35:02,541 --> 00:35:07,208
"This name appears as 'Nasrin'
in Ottoman texts."

406
00:35:07,291 --> 00:35:11,750
"Especially in Diwan poetry,
often mentioned alongside rose and tulip,

407
00:35:11,833 --> 00:35:16,333
Nesrin symbolizes longing for the beloved
and the agony of love."

408
00:35:16,416 --> 00:35:19,708
House. "A house is a building
where people live,

409
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:23,916
surrounded by walls, divided into rooms,

410
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:27,958
which has its own roof
and sometimes a garden,

411
00:35:28,041 --> 00:35:30,541
and is made of wood, earth, or concrete."

412
00:35:30,625 --> 00:35:34,250
Nesrin's house.
The Rüyam Apartment in Moda Cape,

413
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:37,666
built in 1968,
is notable for its geometric facade,

414
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:40,291
wide windows and flowerbed design,

415
00:35:40,791 --> 00:35:45,791
and it is appropriately proportionate
to the street at a human scale.

416
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:49,208
Here I started writing
my personal Istanbul Encyclopedia.

417
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:52,625
Cats of Istanbul. Diego.

418
00:35:52,708 --> 00:35:56,333
The wise cat. I learned so many things
about life from him.

419
00:35:56,416 --> 00:35:59,041
He knows when to get lost
and when to return,

420
00:35:59,125 --> 00:36:01,208
and he faces the dire consequences.

421
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:05,833
The science-student son
of a secular civil servant. Harun.

422
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,958
He's full of life
with his never-ending energy.

423
00:36:10,041 --> 00:36:12,541
Do you know when I felt it the most?

424
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:15,458
When I touched his throat in the sea.

425
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:19,625
I can't explain it.
You have to try and see.

426
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:22,083
Then the strangest thing happened.

427
00:36:22,916 --> 00:36:27,291
Our scheduled emails were delivered.
I'll keep what Harun wrote to myself.

428
00:36:27,375 --> 00:36:29,125
But I sent him this.

429
00:36:29,916 --> 00:36:31,625
"The letter to the future."

430
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:37,083
"Do you realize we're now time traveling?
Of course you do."

431
00:36:37,875 --> 00:36:41,208
"You had turned Istanbul
into a galactic voyage."

432
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:44,791
"When you held my hand
and got me through portals in Istiklal."

433
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:48,458
"You are like the moment
a star explodes, Harun."

434
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:52,250
"I watch your enthusiasm in amazement,
but I don't get it. What exactly are you?"

435
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:54,291
"Are you Vega, or Sirius?"

436
00:36:54,375 --> 00:36:59,000
"All I know is, you're a bursting
beam of light and I can't look away."

437
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,083
The male bureaucrat. Serdar.

438
00:37:02,166 --> 00:37:06,708
We met on the day he beat cancer,
which I always doubted was true.

439
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:10,833
When I first saw him, it was like,
under his charming physical appearance,

440
00:37:10,916 --> 00:37:14,708
he had repressed emotions
ready to burst at any moment.

441
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:18,291
The in-between Gen Y. Emel.

442
00:37:18,791 --> 00:37:21,416
She's one of the most unusual characters
I've ever known.

443
00:37:21,916 --> 00:37:25,583
I defined her as one who hides her beauty
in an endless darkness,

444
00:37:25,666 --> 00:37:29,583
with her complex state of mind
reflected in her body.

445
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:33,875
The retired teacher.
Mrs. Nazife or Mrs. Auntie.

446
00:37:34,708 --> 00:37:36,625
She's like vintage powder.

447
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,708
She covers you up
in a soft and nostalgic familiarity.

448
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:45,958
But you can definitely tell she was like
a force of nature back in the day.

449
00:37:46,583 --> 00:37:49,000
She divided herself into her daughters.

450
00:37:49,958 --> 00:37:55,291
She gave her quirks and storms to Emel,
and saved the quiet shores for Nesrin.

451
00:37:55,791 --> 00:37:58,750
Still, Mrs. Nazife is deeper
than the two of them combined.

452
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:01,250
I wonder if this is what motherhood is.

453
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:04,250
Being greater than
the sum of what you give.

454
00:38:07,625 --> 00:38:10,583
The devout woman in university. Fatıma.

455
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,125
The students worried about their future.

456
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:22,583
Yes, the trio of our group.

457
00:38:23,708 --> 00:38:24,750
I love you.

458
00:38:34,291 --> 00:38:35,583
The cardiac surgeon.

459
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:40,166
My real heroine is…

460
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:43,208
Nesrin, of course.

461
00:38:43,291 --> 00:38:45,833
When I first saw her, it was hard to tell

462
00:38:45,916 --> 00:38:49,458
whether her obvious tiredness
was due to the surgeries

463
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:52,250
or a chronic condition
that'd been etched into her face.

464
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:56,166
She was like she had experienced
everything she needed to,

465
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:59,875
and her hope, still believing in miracles
but buried deep inside,

466
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:01,708
was mixed with this tiredness.

467
00:39:01,791 --> 00:39:05,208
Then Nesrin became my Nesrin.

468
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,166
ISTANBUL ENCYCLOPEDIA

469
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:51,708
That balloon was there the day I arrived.
Look, I filmed it.

470
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,125
Thanks again for this

471
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:10,750
special gift.

472
00:40:11,791 --> 00:40:12,916
Just like you.

473
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:15,750
Thank you.

474
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,750
It helped me a lot
to get to know Istanbul.

475
00:40:20,833 --> 00:40:23,416
I hope it helps you not forget it.

476
00:40:34,541 --> 00:40:36,791
And this is Istanbul through my eyes.

477
00:40:38,166 --> 00:40:39,875
I printed it for you.

478
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:49,291
I remember this.

479
00:41:10,625 --> 00:41:11,958
I'm so glad you came.

480
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:15,416
So glad you entered my life.

481
00:41:26,416 --> 00:41:27,750
Take care of yourself.

482
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:46,500
You can come anytime.

483
00:42:34,333 --> 00:42:41,333
Flight number 955 from Cyprus
has landed at our airport.

484
00:42:52,208 --> 00:42:53,208
Mom?

485
00:42:57,083 --> 00:42:58,166
You're late.

486
00:43:01,333 --> 00:43:02,875
Nesrin just left.

487
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,125
Nesrin.

488
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:13,125
You look like her.

489
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:16,666
I look like you too.

490
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:55,500
