BEZM-I ALEM VALIDE SULTAN MOSQUE

2
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:16,416
AT THE SEASIDE
BETWEEN KABATAŞ AND BEŞİKTAŞ,

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,833
OPPOSITE THE LARGE COURTYARD GATE
BY THE CLOCK TOWER OF DOLMABAHÇE PALACE,

4
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:22,000
IT'S CALLED "DOLMABAHÇE MOSQUE"
DUE TO ITS LOCATION.

5
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:26,625
Don't even try, honey.
Gates are closed. It's the last ferry.

6
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:31,416
-Could you open it then?
-Once closed, it can't be opened, miss.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,041
The ferry is just there. I can see it.
Why won't you open the gates?

8
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:40,416
So the ferry can leave on time, miss.
Why don't you get it?

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,833
First time on a ferry?

10
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:45,208
I could catch it at the last minute.

11
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:51,041
Istanbul is where the impossible happens.
That's why I'm here. You can't do this.

12
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:54,083
Could you open the gates?

13
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:07,000
Next station, Millet Street.

00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:12,291
Get out, man! Don't just sit there!
Protect your dumpster!

16
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:18,458
This dumpster will stay right here!

17
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:22,041
Enough already! L-58!

18
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,666
-Protect your dumpster!
-Right on time. She made a scene.

19
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,458
I didn't know what to do.
She's obsessed with the dumpster.

20
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:30,041
Okay, Ms. Şükran.
Thank you very much. Thanks.

21
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:34,500
-You can go. I'll handle it, okay?
-L-53! One, two, three dumpsters! Enough!

22
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:38,916
-Stop it, Emel, what are you doing?
-L-58! Protect your dumpster already!

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,541
What are you doing? Stop yelling!

24
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:44,791
-I'm not yelling, Nesrin! Enough!
-Okay. Everybody's watching! Stop yelling!

25
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:47,541
-Enough! Move. I'm protesting.
-Please, don't yell.

26
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,666
Okay! Nesrin. I'm protesting.

27
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,833
-I get it. Calm down. Stop yelling.
-I'm protecting my dumpster. Nesrin, move!

28
00:02:56,208 --> 00:03:02,291
-Protect your dumpster!
-Emel. Please.

29
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:08,708
-Protect your dumpster!
-Shut up. God, it's so late. Shut up!

30
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:11,333
-Emel, listen to me, darling.
-What?

31
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:13,125
Please.

32
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:15,208
-What did you say?
-What did I say?

33
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:16,708
Nesrin, what did you say?

34
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,875
-What did I say?
-Nesrin.

35
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:21,500
-What did I say?
-Did you call me "darling"?

36
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,166
Yes, darling. I said "darling."

37
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,166
-To me?
-Yes.

38
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,583
Did you call me that?

39
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,166
Say it again. Nesrin, say it again.

40
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:36,000
-Nesrin, say it again. Say it again!
-Okay! Darling. Okay.

41
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,333
Darling.

42
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,666
"Darling." Nesrin, come.

43
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,333
-I can't. No.
-Nesrin, come.

44
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:48,791
-Protect your dumpster! Come on, Nesrin.
-I don't wanna-- Don't yell! No!

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,833
-Okay.
-Nesrin, will you come?

46
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:52,916
Okay, I will.

47
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,208
-Nesrin!
-One, two, three.

48
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,583
Nesrin.

49
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,250
Protect your dumpster.

50
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:08,375
Nesrin!

51
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:24,291
Nesrin. Did you come to save me?

52
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:33,250
Doctor Nesrin saved yet another life.

53
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:36,041
Wow.

54
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,291
Sevinç.

55
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,083
It's me, Mom. Nesrin.

56
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,083
Nesrin?

57
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:12,458
Your daughter. Nesrin.
Sevinç is your sister.

58
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,541
Yeah.

59
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:20,041
-I have a daughter.
-Yes. You have two daughters.

60
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:26,583
-I have two daughters?
-Yes. Emel and Nesrin.

61
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,625
-Who is Emel?
-Your daughter.

62
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,083
I have two daughters.

63
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,833
Nesrin. Emel.

64
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,958
LADIES ONLY, FULLY FURNISHED
NICE HOME IN CITY CENTER

65
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:03,958

INCOMING CALL

00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,541
DECLINE

67
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,750
Hello. Good day.

68
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,208
Thank you.

69
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,416
I am a freshman.

70
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,500
I was wondering
if I can put my suitcase here.

71
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:44,000
-No, you can't.
-Please, don't send me to class like this.

72
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:47,375
-You shouldn't have brought it.
-But I had to. Please.

73
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:50,458
-How do I know what's in it?
-Just a bunch of clothes.

74
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:51,875
-I'll show you.
-No way.

75
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,875
-It's forbidden.
-Mister. Oh, God.

76
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:56,458
-No. I can't.
-Let it stay here for a bit?

77
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,250
And I'll pick it up after the class?

78
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,833
Look, pick it up by 5:00 p.m.

79
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:05,583
Hamit will replace me then.
I can't deal with him and explain this.

80
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:08,791
-Don't put me in a tough spot.
-Never. I'll be here at 5:00.

81
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,250
-By 5:00 p.m.
-I'll be here at 5:00.

82
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,541
I'll pick it up at 5:00.

83
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:23,250
-Why did you pick the Anatolian Fortress?
-It has great historical significance.

84
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,125
-Which history is this?
-You know, the Ottoman history.

85
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:32,125
A key site for the Conquest of Istanbul.
Cannons fired from the fortress and such.

86
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:35,208
Naturally, it also impacted
Byzantine history.

87
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,583
So, what is its impact on your history?

88
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,666
Guys, these projects
are not about picking a few photos

89
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:48,208
and compiling some facts
from the internet.

90
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:52,000
I want you to create
your own Istanbul history.

91
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:56,458
Rediscover Istanbul
using your curiosity and enthusiasm.

92
00:07:56,541 --> 00:08:00,291
Pay attention to that next week
when you examine the letter B.

93
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:07,375
Okay. Before we finish, I'd like to hear
a personal story related to the letter A.

94
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:16,458
Isn't there anything that has touched you
or affected you throughout the week?

A STEEP, UNREGULATED STREET,
THE SITE OF A LARGE FIRE…

99
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:52,750
-Wanna grab a bite before rehearsal?
-No, I'm not hungry.

100
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,458
How about a barbecue chicken pizza?

101
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:58,041
Okay. But I need to do something first.

102
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:01,041
-Okay. Shall I wait?
-Yeah. No, it's fine. Thanks.

103
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,250
What's the rush?

104
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:25,375
-Sorry?
-You should pray nicely and calmly.

105
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,125
Okay, dear?

106
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,583
May Allah accept your prayers.

107
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,583
Salam aleikum.

108
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,916
You're in our school, right?
I saw you on campus.

109
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:54,583
-Alaikum salam.
-How nice, I'm so glad. I'm Fatıma.

110
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:59,583
-I'm in a hurry. Thank you.
-What is your name?

111
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:05,083
-Zeynep.
-Nice to meet you.

112
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You too.

113
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,500
I told you not to come, Serdar.

114
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:15,083
Especially to the hospital. Don't push me.

115
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:19,250
-Don't worry, I have no expectations.
-Why are you here then?

116
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:23,416
I just wanted to tell you
that we made the right decision.

117
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,208
You have the right to know,
and I have the right to say it, right?

118
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,208
What did I expect
from a selfish woman like you

119
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:36,625
who doesn't care about her sister
and is about to abandon her sick mother?

120
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,041
Now you're using my family against me?

121
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:47,500
You think meeting them a few times
gives you the right to judge?

122
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,500
"Meeting a few times?"

123
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:55,375
It was fine when I bailed
your addicted sister out of custody,

124
00:10:56,083 --> 00:11:01,166
when I took your sick mom to the hospital
when you were busy. And now this?

125
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:06,875
That's exactly why. I want to run away
so you don't keep dumping these on me.

126
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:11,125
I want to start a brand-new life.
To escape from this tangled mess.

127
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:15,083
Nesrin, what if you're the one
who created this mess?

128
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,083
Check these out.

129
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,250
-Why?
-Check them out.

130
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:29,208
-I won't.
-I didn't beat cancer, Nesrin.

131
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:34,583
I didn't want to upset you anymore,
that's why I said I was clear last night.

132
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:38,500
-Don't stoop so low, Serdar.
-You'll see if you look at it.

133
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,625
-No.
-Because you are avoiding confronting it.

134
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:42,833
Don't, Serdar.

135
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,125
Because you know
you're responsible for this.

136
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,833
-Responsible for what?
-Didn't you ruin my life?

137
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:48,916
What did I do to you?

138
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,833
-I got cancer after you cheated on me.
-I didn't cheat on you!

139
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,041
I only went to a dinner behind your back,
and I apologized hundreds of times for it.

140
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,208
Unbelievable.

141
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:04,125
Man, even I can accept it,
but she still can't.

142
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:10,166
What if that was the case? Just tell me.
What does it have to do with your cancer?

143
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:14,000
-This is how you're avoiding it.
-I'm responsible for it?

144
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,041
Why did you wait if you didn't want it?

145
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:19,500
Could it be because I still loved you?
To support you?

146
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,583
No, because of your conscience.

147
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:24,750
Deep down, you knew you were guilty
and wanted to suppress it.

148
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:29,166
Serdar, I did everything I could for you.
Simple as that.

149
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,375
You didn't even believe I had cancer.

150
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:37,708
Yes, I didn't believe it at first.
Because I know you very well.

151
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:43,041
I just know you, your character
and how manipulative you are.

152
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:49,291
I only lied to you once. Just once.
And that was last night.

153
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:53,791
And it was not to burden you anymore.
Because I was thinking of you.

154
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,916
Serdar, I wish you had lied to me more.

155
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,750
With you, I don't know
what's truth and what's lie anymore.

156
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:01,958
I forgot.

157
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,125
My trust is broken.

158
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,833
Even when I ask you the time,

159
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:10,666
I wonder if you're telling me the truth
or what I want to hear.

160
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,541
I have always told you down to the second.

161
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:16,708
It doesn't matter
now that I feel this anxious.

162
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:18,458
Why?

163
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:21,583
Because everything about you
is potentially suspicious.

164
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,708
Because you are a coward

165
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:26,791
who could even use your illness
for your interests.

166
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,958
Are you gonna slit your wrist?

167
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:39,125
Fucking do it!
What are you waiting for? Do it!

168
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:44,000
Isn't that why you came to the hospital?
"I'll be in the ER with a doctor,

169
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,166
I'll be fine."

170
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,500
Do it! Don't wait!

171
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,625
Sorry, am I interrupting?

172
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:06,791
Not at all. Welcome.
Just close the door, it gets breezy.

173
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,125
It's Zehra, right?

174
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,041
-Zehra.
-Welcome, Zehra.

175
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,416
-Thank you.
-You can sit anywhere.

176
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,750
I was just explaining to your friends

177
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:40,125
how pretending is
far from being convincing and real.

178
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,041
I mean, think about it.

179
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:48,583
I'm so tired of people pretending
in life, and in art.

180
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:51,875
Don't worry. I won't expect anyone
to really stab themselves on stage.

181
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:58,000
But we can stop playing dead
like I just did, and face our problems.

182
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:02,500
You know the famous saying,
"Theater heals."

183
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:06,625
Maybe we can heal,
starting with ourselves. What do you say?

184
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:09,541
Maybe you are four months late,
but you're just in time, Zehra.

185
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:12,375
Because we will start working
on a new play.

186
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:16,541
No prior experience needed.
Don't feel intimidated.

187
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,500
You will tell your own story.

188
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:23,125
Each week, one of you will share
a dreadful memory,

189
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:26,041
or maybe a moment you try to forget,
or a trauma.

190
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:29,166
In short, you'll share a story
that burdens your heart.

191
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,708
Maybe we can remove the burden together.

192
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:36,916
We'll base the script on that,
but we might add some fictional elements.

193
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,250
Maybe your friends
could play the characters in it.

194
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:46,791
But all I know is you'll create the script
based on your stories.

195
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:50,875
All right? You'll tell a story every week.

196
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:55,500
And I need a volunteer for next week.
I want them to be well-prepared.

197
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,708
-I can do it, Professor.
-Okay, great.

198
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:06,708
So, I'll start this week.
To give you an example.

199
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:11,875
If you're ready,
I'll tell you my biggest worry.

200
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:16,583
Perfect! As you can see,
no matter what I do, she looks great.

201
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:21,416
She's pretty as a swan.
I did a star girl makeup.

202
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,250
-I'm about to erupt volcanoes. Be ready.
-Fire! You're on fire!

203
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:28,291
Don't forget to
like, save, and comment, everyone.

204
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,708
Bye!

205
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,458
-It was awesome!
-Finally.

206
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,041
Pelin, put makeup on Zehra too.

207
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,458
I can't be bothered.

208
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:40,416
I'll just give her a cheap nightclub look.
Forget it.

209
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,541
But I'm tired. I've been here an hour!

210
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:45,541
-I…
-Okay, I'll do it. You'll be reborn.

211
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,500
-I don't want to. Thank you.
-You'll look so nice.

212
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,333
-Just come on! Come.
-You know what?

213
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:56,625
-You look so nice, no need to do me.
-Hey, shut it! I hate a buzzkill.

214
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:58,875
Maybe you're killing the buzz.

215
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:03,416
Besides, I like people around me
to take care of themselves.

216
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,041
So, you have to, darling.

217
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,000
-Is that so, honey?
-Yes, honey.

218
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:10,000
All right. Nothing you can do.
We'll force makeup on you.

219
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,833
-That's your destiny. Let's go.
-No. I really don't…

220
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:15,625
Show me those hands! Give me your hands.

221
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:19,125
No way! What is this? A carpenter's hands?

222
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:22,583
-Stop it.
-Nail polish, right now. I'm gonna faint.

223
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,375
-Let her smile. Don't upset her. Smile.
-I don't…

224
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:28,333
-Come on, smile. You'll be great.
-She said smile!

225
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:31,166
-I'm smiling. I'm sparkling.
-"I'm smiling."

226
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,125
-You're not smiling!
-I really don't want it.

227
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:40,708
Maybe he was going to cut himself
if I hadn't stopped him.

228
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,208
I guess you'll never know.

229
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,125
That's the worst of it.

230
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:49,166
I wish you hadn't come
on such a ridiculous day.

231
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,041
It felt so good.

232
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,500
Your class is like therapy to me.

233
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:03,541
I'm glad you're feeling better.
It means I'm not too bad a teacher.

234
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,000
Yes, thank you.

235
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:13,833
Sometimes I feel like
I have enough energy for everything.

236
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:19,000
I think I can do everything I can imagine
and everything I plan.

237
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:23,125
In fact, it seems so easy
that even I am surprised.

238
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:31,791
And sometimes you feel powerless
to take even the smallest action.

239
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:36,458
-Bizarre, right?
-Yes, it's bizarre.

240
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:42,500
It's like it's hard to breathe in.
Or to breathe out.

241
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,250
In fact,

242
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:49,250
the day I leave all my life behind
and move to France,

243
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,625
I feel as if my life will be reset.

244
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:58,583
As if I will start all over again.

245
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:02,333
I guess there is no other way out for me.

246
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,333
That's not how it works.

247
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:09,875
How does it work?

248
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,958
Do you want to continue this at home?

249
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:26,750
I'd like to.
But I thought I'd pay my mom a visit.

250
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:27,833
Right.

251
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,750
-You have to take care of that too.
-Yes.

252
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,458
-I'll go then.
-Louis.

253
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:48,416
I’m glad you're here.

254
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,083
Me too.

255
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:17,958
-Hello.
-Hello.

256
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:20,750
I'm Nesrin Caner. Doctor Nesrin Caner.

257
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:24,791
I am looking for one of your students.
Her name is Zehra Demirci.

258
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,291
Where is the architecture department?

259
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:30,875
-Right this way. Can I see your ID?
-Sure, of course.

260
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:35,375
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you. This way?

261
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:36,791
-Yes.
-Okay.

262
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:51,375
We know there's a problem but Dad's acting
like there is nothing wrong with him.

263
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:52,958
But the doctors…

264
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,333
How are you, Zehra?

265
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:10,000
-Fine, and you?
-I'm fine too.

266
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:12,916
Why are you here?

267
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:18,708
Come on now.
We were supposed to meet after school.

268
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:22,000
I called but couldn't reach you.
That's why I'm here.

269
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,166
I wasn't available.

270
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:30,625
-And I have plans with friends later.
-Oh. Is that so?

271
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:34,500
Okay then. Have fun.

272
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:40,500
By the way, your dad should see me.
We'll examine him and run some tests.

273
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:45,041
No need to make an appointment.
You can call me anytime.

274
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:48,666
-Thank you so much. I'll convince him.
-You're welcome.

275
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:51,041
So, then…

276
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:55,541
I'll see you at home tonight.

277
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,375
See you. Let's go.

278
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:04,250
-Have a nice day.
-Have a nice day.

279
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:25,416
I don't believe anyone has done anything
to deserve a mansion here.

280
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:31,041
I don't know the owners
but I hate all of them.

281
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:34,750
All of you! I hate you, and you, and you.

282
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:37,875
What should we do with the mansions?

283
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:42,208
Make them accessible to everyone.
Make them public.

284
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:46,541
-What about the owners?
-Give them houses far from the sea.

285
00:24:47,041 --> 00:24:49,333
And tell them, "You've seen enough blue."

286
00:24:49,416 --> 00:24:51,125
Are you an anarchist?

287
00:24:51,666 --> 00:24:55,375
I wanna walk on the beach. Okay?
Why are these buildings in the way?

288
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:58,333
-Because it's their property.
-Their property? Ugh.

289
00:24:58,416 --> 00:25:00,333
Who said so? Who gave them?

290
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:06,000
So, you just came to Istanbul
and noticed something no one ever had?

291
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:07,083
Exactly.

292
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:11,833
You Istanbulites
have normalized everything.

293
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:14,291
You can't even see the obvious.

294
00:25:14,375 --> 00:25:17,750
I think you're talking
as a mansion flat but with a class anger.

295
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:19,958
There is no such thing as a mansion flat.

296
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:22,958
That's some nonsense
the capitalist system made up

297
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:25,125
to sell more houses. Do your research.

298
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:29,000
No, there is such a thing
as a mansion flat. It's built as a block.

299
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:33,583
-An insult to architectural terminology.
-It's not an insult to any terminology.

300
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:38,166
Nesrin's house is like a mansion flat too.
Start the ban with her.

301
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:01,666
Mommy, I'm home!

302
00:26:05,416 --> 00:26:07,500
Mommy, are you still sleeping?

303
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:12,875
Mom?

304
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,000
Mom!

305
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Mom!

306
00:26:39,916 --> 00:26:40,750
Mom.

307
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:05,791
Where were you, sweetie?

308
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:10,333
Went out for a walk?

309
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:27,291
With these cookie-cutter buildings,

310
00:27:28,708 --> 00:27:30,916
anyone would get confused, right?

311
00:27:33,541 --> 00:27:35,250
Everyone is lost already.

312
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:40,583
You are lost.

313
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:45,208
Zehra is lost.

314
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,291
I'm already lost.

315
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,333
Who is Zehra?

316
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:01,833
Aylin's daughter, Zehra.

317
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:05,666
Look.

318
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:08,666
You and me.

319
00:28:25,125 --> 00:28:26,250
Come on, Zehra!

320
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:30,208
-Bring down the mansions!
-Go on, don't give up.

321
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:32,458
-Okay.
-I hope she does it.

322
00:28:33,875 --> 00:28:36,500
It's going. It's gone.

323
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:37,666
-Nice!
-Not bad.

324
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:40,125
-I'll do it next time.
-Great! Good job!

325
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:43,416
-Nice!
-I wanna swap teammates.

326
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,708
-You can't do that.
-Oh, come on!

327
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,375
-Leave my teammate alone!
-Go away.

328
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:53,125
-Can you move? I'm trying to bowl here.
-Okay, I'm going.

329
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:55,958
-Here we go!
-He's doing it! What did I do?

330
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:57,375
He won't score anyway.

331
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:03,375
My dear teammate!

332
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,083
Good job!

333
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:07,208
-They destroyed us!
-Here comes the strike!

334
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:09,125
-Knock them all down.
-I'll save us.

335
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:12,125
-We can still catch up.
-You have to hit them all.

336
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,958
-I will. Promise.
-Here it comes.

337
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:16,250
My teammate is bowling. She did it!

338
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:17,500
Is it a hit?

339
00:29:18,833 --> 00:29:20,541
She did it!

340
00:29:21,041 --> 00:29:24,375
What's the deal with our team?

341
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:27,041
-You know what, it was great.
-That's my teammate!

342
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:28,666
Did you hide your ball?

343
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,250
-What, did you bless it?
-Go on, show them.

344
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:33,041
-For our stolen youth.
-Okay.

345
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:34,458
That's it! Go get them!

346
00:29:34,541 --> 00:29:35,708
Go on, baby.

347
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:40,000
What happened to our stolen youth?

348
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:45,375
-Not so bad.
-It counts.

349
00:29:45,458 --> 00:29:48,500
You still have suffering to endure.

350
00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:50,250
-Don't say it.
-I'll save my team.

351
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:53,250
-If you strike, we win.
-Okay. I'll try with all my luck.

352
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,333
Let's go.

353
00:29:55,416 --> 00:29:57,791
-Should I pick this one?
-Look at the score.

354
00:29:58,333 --> 00:29:59,250
Take this one.

355
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:03,541
-I'll eat you up.
-What is it?

356
00:30:04,333 --> 00:30:07,666
I need to go to the restroom.
Could you take my turn?

357
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,916
-Okay.
-Okay.

358
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,333
-Something wrong?
-No, all good.

359
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:17,291
I have to use the restroom.
Harun will take my turn.

360
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:22,500
No. Swapping players during a game
is what I hate the most.

361
00:30:22,583 --> 00:30:23,875
I don't accept it.

362
00:30:23,958 --> 00:30:27,416
There must be a limit to saying
"What I hate the most is…"

363
00:30:28,833 --> 00:30:30,291
What can I do, honey?

364
00:30:31,291 --> 00:30:34,041
My hate spectrum is so wide.

365
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:35,833
Have fun.

366
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:38,625
Pelin.

367
00:30:40,541 --> 00:30:41,916
-What?
-"What?"

368
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,458
I couldn't ask in front of Zehra.
How do you throw it?

369
00:30:45,708 --> 00:30:47,666
You roll straight for a score.

370
00:31:21,291 --> 00:31:24,875
NO ENTRY

371
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,000
I couldn't bear your absence,
so I ran after you.

372
00:32:44,791 --> 00:32:46,583
What were you doing in there?

373
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:51,958
It says "No entry."
So I thought I should go in.

374
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:54,208
-That's so you.
-Yes. Thanks.

375
00:32:55,125 --> 00:32:56,708
You removed your makeup.

376
00:32:58,416 --> 00:33:03,250
-Did you cry because of Pelin?
-No. I didn't cry. I just…

377
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:05,375
I just didn't like it and wiped it off.

378
00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:08,708
-Can I say something?
-Sure.

379
00:33:09,791 --> 00:33:10,791
We won.

380
00:33:11,458 --> 00:33:13,250
I knocked them all down after you left.

381
00:33:27,916 --> 00:33:31,791
I feel like if this happens,
everything will be left unfinished.

382
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:36,208
Everything is left unfinished
in this world.

383
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:52,166
Who are you to

384
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:56,458
Get involved in things like this?

385
00:33:57,041 --> 00:34:01,541
Are you the lazy one asking me that?

386
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:08,125
This is not aging
You are getting old

387
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:09,916
It's a downfall

388
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,708
You are a hollow body
With a resentful soul

389
00:34:15,833 --> 00:34:18,583
Guys, the doctor is here!
I can't believe it!

390
00:34:18,666 --> 00:34:20,041
She's a great doctor.

391
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:23,041
Just line up if you have a condition.
She knows best.

392
00:34:23,125 --> 00:34:27,375
-Ms. Doctor! You have a song request?
-Wow. You look beautiful.

393
00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:29,541
Come. What would you like to drink?

394
00:34:30,583 --> 00:34:32,750
-What do you want?
-I'm not drinking.

395
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:35,166
-I'm here to talk to you.
-We have no hot drinks.

396
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:39,208
But there's this great beer.
I want you to taste it.

397
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:41,666
-Please, come here. Come.
-Please.

398
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:43,750
Okay!

399
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:48,333
Can't I treat my big sister? My sister's
visiting me at work for the first time!

400
00:34:48,416 --> 00:34:49,833
-Welcome.
-Come on.

401
00:34:50,875 --> 00:34:51,875
Emel.

402
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,500
Look.

403
00:34:54,416 --> 00:34:57,625
Let's talk. Tell me what's troubling you.

404
00:34:58,458 --> 00:35:00,000
Let's not go on like this.

405
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:06,875
What happened to you? Are you Gandhi now?
Are you gonna bring peace?

406
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:14,750
Emel, I don't think you realize
how serious it is, but Mom is not well.

407
00:35:16,208 --> 00:35:18,458
-I came here from home.
-Is that so?

408
00:35:18,541 --> 00:35:19,541
She went out.

409
00:35:20,208 --> 00:35:21,791
She couldn't find her way back.

410
00:35:22,291 --> 00:35:25,000
I found her lost on the street,
and took her home.

411
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:27,666
I'm glad you're with Mom.
What would we do without you?

412
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,666
-Emel, I'm serious.
-I'm serious too.

413
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,666
-I'm glad we have you.
-Emel, I'm serious.

414
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:34,000
I'm moving to France very soon.

415
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:37,500
-Wow! Did you hear that?
-Look, all my documents are ready.

416
00:35:37,583 --> 00:35:41,333
It's very soon. I'm leaving
once I pass the language exam, Emel.

417
00:35:41,416 --> 00:35:46,125
Good for you!
You'll pass the language exam, no doubt.

418
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:48,833
-Good for you.
-I don't want to worry about here.

419
00:35:48,916 --> 00:35:52,916
I want you to be able to take care
of yourself and Mom. I'm begging you.

420
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,875
So, you'll fucking leave
this fucking country like Dad did!

421
00:35:57,416 --> 00:35:59,291
But you want a clear conscience, right?

422
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:04,041
-Could you really sell Dad's car?
-What does it have to do with Dad?

423
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:05,791
You will go and I will stay!

424
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:11,750
I have to be well to take care of Mom.
You don't even care about me. You don't.

425
00:36:11,833 --> 00:36:13,875
-That's what you mean, right?
-No.

426
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:17,958
-That's what you're saying.
-I'm saying, I will do everything I can.

427
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:20,625
-But I won't be here physically…
-What are you gonna do?

428
00:36:20,708 --> 00:36:22,625
-What are you gonna do?
-Financial support!

429
00:36:22,708 --> 00:36:24,208
-Financial?
-I'll pay the bills!

430
00:36:24,291 --> 00:36:27,958
-You solve everything with money.
-Whatever it takes! Whatever I can do!

431
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:30,250
-I can hire a full-time caregiver!
-Tell me!

432
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:34,333
-Did you ask Mom if she wants a caregiver?
-Have you ever taken care of Mom?

433
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:36,875
Did you even care?

434
00:36:39,208 --> 00:36:42,958
You were broke and came back home!
That's it! What's with this devoted act?

435
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:46,500
Nesrin! If you wanna go, just fucking go!

436
00:37:16,166 --> 00:37:20,875
I was just thinking, maybe we should
stay up all night? Wouldn't it be great?

437
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:24,375
And now you've come up with
a stay-up-all-night project, Zehra?

438
00:37:24,458 --> 00:37:26,833
Well, I'm exhausted, man.

439
00:37:27,833 --> 00:37:31,000
What if we hang out together?
I can come if you want.

440
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:32,875
I don't feel like going home.

441
00:37:32,958 --> 00:37:36,375
I would invite you,
but we're in a complicated situation.

442
00:37:36,458 --> 00:37:41,291
Man, take me out of this home too.
This is an asylum.

443
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:44,166
By the way,
is our library open 24 hours a day?

444
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:50,708
No. I wish. It's ridiculous.
Millions of us are studying in cafés.

445
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:53,291
What is it? Why do you ask?

446
00:37:54,291 --> 00:37:55,291
No reason.

447
00:37:57,041 --> 00:38:00,291
Maybe I'll do a project
on places open 24 hours a day.

448
00:38:00,375 --> 00:38:02,166
Wow! That's a nice subject.

449
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:05,250
Okay then. Kisses. Good night.

450
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:07,791
Kisses. Good night.

451
00:38:09,166 --> 00:38:10,958
I'm off too. Kisses.

452
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,333
The letter B.

453
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,708
Bezm-i Alem Valide Sultan Mosque.

454
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:45,916
Located at the seaside,
between Kabataş and Beşiktaş,

455
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,250
opposite the large courtyard gate
by the clock tower of Dolmabahçe Palace,

456
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:55,750
it's called "Dolmabahçe Mosque"
due to its location.

457
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,541
They call this place your home,
dear Allah.

458
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:04,000
Is that true? Can you fit inside a home?

459
00:39:05,625 --> 00:39:07,333
I can't either, don't worry.

460
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:13,083
I couldn't fit in anywhere again,
and took shelter in this Muslim temple

461
00:39:13,166 --> 00:39:15,500
built by the Armenian Balyan family.

462
00:39:17,541 --> 00:39:21,541
But I feel like I fit in this city.
I tucked myself in.

463
00:39:26,458 --> 00:39:31,375
Because in this city, some people yell,
"Move back, there's plenty of room."

464
00:39:31,458 --> 00:39:37,041
Even though some people steal my chance
to grasp life for the sake of punctuality,

465
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:40,666
I think I'm holding onto the hopes
of those metrobus drivers.

466
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:46,333
I squeezed myself into the hope that
there's always some space back there.

467
00:39:47,708 --> 00:39:51,208
I'm a little hungry.
And this place smells like feet.

468
00:39:51,833 --> 00:39:54,916
Or am I in a giant bag of chips
that smell like feet?

469
00:39:55,458 --> 00:39:58,208
I wish I had something crunchy to eat.

470
00:39:58,708 --> 00:40:01,166
But if I go out,
I can't come back in here.

471
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:04,583
How come Allah's home
has limited visiting hours?

472
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:07,791
I'm glad you were home when I came, Allah.

473
00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:12,708
What? Yes. "Nonsense, guys!
I'm always home," you say?

474
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,000
Or am I going insane?

475
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:23,500
I told you I was hungry, dear Allah.

476
00:40:24,333 --> 00:40:25,625
Anyway.

477
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,958
What's left until the morning?

478
00:43:50,375 --> 00:43:55,916
