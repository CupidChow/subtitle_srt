1
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:13,875
FENER, LIGHTS, LIGHTHOUSES

2
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:16,750
SHOWS DANGEROUS ROCKS, STRAITS,
HARBORS, CAPES FROM MILES AWAY

3
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:18,500
DURING NIGHTTIME TO PREVENT DANGER.

4
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:20,583
IT WAS USED
IN BATTLES WITH FIRE IN THE PAST.

5
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,541
Sit down. Your soup is getting cold.

6
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:25,916
Aren't you going to ask?

7
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:30,125
I already knew.

8
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:32,875
How?

9
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,250
You're not the only one with tricks.

10
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,583
They called me from the Association
after your scholarship interview.

11
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,125
So, that was the reason
for the secrecy that day.

12
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:54,083
That's the way things are
in this country, Zehra.

13
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:59,500
Some people are at a disadvantage
because they wear a hijab,

14
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:03,708
some because they don't,
but generally it's because they are women.

15
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:07,000
I hope one day
I'll be done learning about this country.

16
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,916
So I can just focus on living.

17
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,583
I couldn't find an alternative but to run.
I hope you can find one.

18
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,416
I won't run away.

19
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,666
Answer it. Maybe it's something important.

20
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:38,625
What am I going to say?
She's kind of messed up now, so…

21
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:43,125
So, she shouldn't have to
deal with this too?

22
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,250
I don't know.

23
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:52,166
Aylin is the most special person
in my life.

24
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,208
We grew up together.

25
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:59,791
We went through everything together.
We shared everything.

26
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:04,500
I grew up with her glamorous stuff,

27
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,791
her big round eyes,

28
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,958
her arrogant ways…

29
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:17,125
and of course, with that stubbornness
fused into her soul.

30
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:19,583
What happened?

31
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,375
How did you two end up like this?

32
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,291
Life.

33
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:33,333
If you ask,
we'd both give different answers.

34
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,791
But nothing can change the past.

35
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:45,583
So, answer it.

36
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:48,666
Tell her.

37
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,250
She'll find out anyway.

38
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,166
Besides, this isn't your concern.

39
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:56,958
Relax.

40
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,541
Yes, Mommy?

41
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:11,916
Aleikum salam, Mommy.

42
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,875
I'm on the way. We're on the way.

43
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,166
We're coming by car, Mom.

44
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,583
With Nesrin.

45
00:05:55,166 --> 00:06:01,708
ISTANBUL ENCYCLOPEDIA

46
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,125
She is doing death rabita.

47
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,333
She can't talk right now.

48
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,125
Mommy.

49
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,500
-How is Grandma?
-Still in the ICU.

50
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,041
What did the doctors say?

51
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,416
That it would be clearer
after today's tests.

52
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,833
Let's go to the hospital.

53
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:47,916
I just got back.
The next visiting hours are this evening.

54
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,416
-Maybe if I talked to the doctors--
-Don't you have a bag?

55
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,083
We left in a hurry,
so I couldn't bring it, Mom.

56
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,250
Okay then. Eat something if you're hungry.

57
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:07,333
If not, get some rest.
We'll think about it later.

58
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,000
I'll get something for you.

59
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,666
-It's fine, Zehra.
-No, I will. Get some rest.

60
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,208
Mommy.

61
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:30,583
What are you doing?

62
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:35,875
She drove me all the way here.
You're acting like she doesn't exist.

63
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:39,166
Take this bedding. And here's a pillow.

64
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,375
-Doesn't she mean anything to you?
-And there's a quilt in the living room.

65
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,875
EBRU ART

66
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,625
You didn't have to, dear Zehra.

67
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,250
It's nothing.

68
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:34,916
You drove all night.
You should get some rest.

69
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,166
It will be like this
until I get my license.

70
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:43,916
Not everything works out
like it does in our dreams.

71
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,375
Also, I'm the host here.

72
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,541
Thanks.

73
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,375
What are you going to do today?

74
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,208
I have a lot of loose ends
to tie up in this city.

75
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:15,041
Welcome back to your hometown as well.

76
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:30,833
May God heal her.

77
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:31,916
Thanks.

78
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,000
Hopefully, she gets well.

79
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,458
She will.

80
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,458
How is Istanbul?

81
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,041
How is it different from here?

82
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,791
If you sit in a café in Istanbul,
you wouldn't know anyone.

83
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:58,291
And nobody knows you.

84
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,333
Still, you don't feel like a stranger.

85
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,291
Here, you know everyone.

86
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,208
And everyone knows you.

87
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:12,875
But you're still a stranger,
and all alone.

88
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,166
Why are you laughing?

89
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,625
You forgot about me and just left.

90
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,666
I passed the exam
and went to university, Ömer.

91
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,375
So, you couldn't even say goodbye?

92
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,916
I couldn't.

93
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,625
I'm here to say goodbye now.

94
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,708
Let's end this unfinished thing.

95
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,875
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

96
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,625
You changed your number.

97
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,916
Closed your social media.
I couldn't reach you.

98
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,166
I had to.

99
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,791
-Why?
-Why are you asking?

100
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:04,041
-I just wondered if you were happy.
-I am.

101
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,541
I'm very happy.

102
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:10,708
Did you close your socials
because you took off your hijab?

103
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:12,791
Who told you that?

104
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:17,416
-Don't worry, your mom--
-Who told you that?

105
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,833
I heard it somehow.

106
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:20,916
Fine.

107
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:24,791
So you heard.

108
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,125
How can one be happy like that, Zehra?

109
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,541
Like this.

110
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:37,916
Not being able to share
a photo of a nice moment,

111
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,916
always running, always hiding?

112
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,416
Yes, exactly like that.

113
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,750
Constantly being in between?

114
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,541
They say, "The one in between is human."

115
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:53,041
Maybe I'm trying to be a human.

116
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:56,000
It's not that.
It's running away from your identity.

117
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,833
Who lives life with just one identity?

118
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:05,875
Who shows their true self,
or settles for who they are?

119
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:10,916
-I don't care what anyone thinks.
-You're even smoking in secret.

120
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,375
That's irrelevant.

121
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,583
Why was this pack hidden in my house?

122
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:24,625
-I buy, you hide, Zehra.
-Yes, you buy, I hide.

123
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:28,791
Because you didn't have the balls
to take this fucking pack to home, Ömer.

124
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,583
So, I was the one taking the risk.

125
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:35,458
Okay, I couldn't admit I was smoking then.
I can now. That's over.

126
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:38,291
-How about you?
-Smoke one then, man.

127
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,791
Smoke.

128
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,500
Go ahead.

129
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:53,958
You don't have the guts to smoke,
yet you're lecturing me about my hijab?

130
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,208
Of course you would.

131
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,208
I'm the one who is visible.

132
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,458
If you'd gone to Istanbul,
you wouldn't have closed your socials.

133
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:05,291
Because there is nothing you represent
with your body.

134
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:09,125
You think nobody can say anything to you
because you're a man, but…

135
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,125
I know you inside out.

136
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,958
Didn't you say you loved me
until recently?

137
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,208
Yes, I did.

138
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:20,583
But I had to end it with you to grow up.
Do you get it?

139
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,291
-Grow up?
-Grow up.

140
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:25,166
Because I went to Istanbul,
but you stayed in Amasya.

141
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,541
Because you're as small as Amasya.

142
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,208
In fact, you are the sum of Amasya.

143
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,583
You can't even smoke.

144
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,000
Go on, smoke. Smoke.

145
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,791
Smoke and I'll put your photo
on all social media.

146
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,166
Smoke.

147
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,625
Smoke it if you're a man.

148
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:12,708
Come on in.

149
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:14,833
Aylin.

150
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,250
Aylin.

151
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,125
Aylin, look at me.

152
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:27,875
Why did you come?

153
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,250
I wanted to see you.

154
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:34,958
While my mom is dying?

155
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:38,291
She's also my Aunt Ayşe.

156
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,083
Did it occur to you after 20 years?

157
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:45,666
I'm here now.

158
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:49,375
Is it this easy to confront me
as if nothing happened?

159
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,000
I'm going abroad.

160
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,500
I'm not coming back.

161
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,041
You think about your past more

162
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,125
when you're about to leave somewhere.

163
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,333
And I thought of you.

164
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:17,625
I realized that I haven't had a feeling

165
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,125
that's so sincere,

166
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:24,125
so innocent for anyone else.

167
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,625
And then…

168
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,625
Zehra showed up.

169
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:36,916
And here I am.

170
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,208
I just wanted to see you.

171
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,083
Nesrin.

172
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,583
I see that you ruined your life.

173
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,333
I won't let you ruin mine too.

174
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:04,875
How do you find the confidence
to show up after all those years?

175
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,333
Even the image of you has faded.

176
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,666
What are you doing here? Just go.

177
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,166
I'm happy. I don't want to talk.

178
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,250
Are you really happy?

179
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:25,666
Whether I'm happy or not,
what difference does it make?

180
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,875
Since when did you start acting
based on the emotions of others?

181
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:33,916
When did you stop saying, "me, me, me"?

182
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,458
See?

183
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:41,416
You also have stuff piled up inside.

184
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:46,041
Come on, let's talk. Let's confront them.
Or whatever you call it.

185
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:50,041
-I have nothing to say to you.
-Aylin! Look at me!

186
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:53,250
Look at my face! Talk to me.
Say what you have to say.

187
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,583
Don't be silent.

188
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:58,166
Spit on my face if you want, or hit me!
But don't stay silent!

189
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,583
-Who do you think you are?
-I am Nesrin! I am--

190
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:04,000
-You show up on a day like this!
-Tell me!

191
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,916
-Look at my face and tell me!
-What are you talking about?

192
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,666
-Why?
-Because of you!

193
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,541
Because you are the most selfish person
I have ever seen!

194
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,875
And you are the most stubborn person
I have ever seen!

195
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:21,458
Is this it?
Is this your problem? My faith?

196
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,625
No, it's not your faith!

197
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:28,958
But it's you changing your whole life
out of spite.

198
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,083
You are so sure of yourself.

199
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,875
Your name is Aylin!

200
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:40,750
Can you show me another person
in this world named Aylin who's in hijab?

201
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:46,625
Why did your mom name you Aylin?
Why did I use to call out "Aylin!"?

202
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,291
Suddenly, you became religious!

203
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,125
Suddenly, you married Hamdi,

204
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,375
a man you wouldn't have even looked at
in school!

205
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:57,708
-Don't speak ill of the deceased.
-You suddenly started wearing hijab.

206
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:02,041
How can a person change
so suddenly and hastily?

207
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,291
You don't have the right to ask me that.

208
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:08,916
Those able to see beauty can still see it.

209
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,375
Unless they don't have a veil
over their eyes.

210
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:14,291
You used to write poems and stories.

211
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:18,875
I used to call you
the woman who melts and bends words.

212
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:22,000
I still am. Don't you worry.

213
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,625
What did I do to you?

214
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:25,958
What did I do to you?

215
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,791
What did you do?

216
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:29,791
What did I do?

217
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:33,833
Didn't you leave me in this city
we swore we would escape together?

218
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:36,666
I went to university, Aylin.

219
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,708
Was I not supposed to go?

220
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:43,958
-And you? Why didn't you come?
-I did!

221
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,625
-I came to visit you as soon as you left!
-Just once! And you never came back!

222
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,916
Yes. Because you changed!

223
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:55,250
What do you mean?
What do you mean by "You changed"?

224
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:58,833
I saw it with my own eyes.

225
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:00,666
You changed.

226
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:03,708
Istanbul changed you instantly.

227
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,708
You didn't even come to greet me.

228
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:11,208
And when we finally met,
you said you had something to do and left!

229
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,625
Then the letters
started coming less and less.

230
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:18,875
They became careless.

231
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:24,166
I became one of those people
that you brushed off.

232
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:28,416
Is all this nonsense
because you came during my exam week

233
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,958
and I couldn't be with you?

234
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:34,833
-This 20 years of nonsense.
-No, you betrayed our dream!

235
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:38,291
Our dream was to go to Istanbul,
and you didn't come.

236
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:44,125
No! Our dream was to go together!
Your dream was to go to Istanbul!

237
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:46,500
I was never a part of that dream!

238
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,333
You left me behind like Amasya.

239
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:54,791
No, you took the easy way out.
Aylin, you took the easy way out.

240
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:57,875
You could have come.
You could have come one year later.

241
00:22:57,958 --> 00:23:00,833
You could've studied one more year.
But you were too stubborn.

242
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:05,541
You got married,
started wearing hijab, and had a child.

243
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:07,833
You didn't even go to university.

244
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:12,958
Yes, I did all that
because that was so easy.

245
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:18,541
Aylin, you gave me the news
just three days before the wedding.

246
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:23,666
I came here even though I was shocked.
But you didn't even look at my face then.

247
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,583
You humiliated me in front of everybody.

248
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:29,791
Then I heard you're wearing a hijab.
Did you receive a revelation?

249
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:33,291
Why did you do this to yourself?
Please, tell me why you did this!

250
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:38,916
Don't you dare dig up the past now.

251
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:41,833
Come on.

252
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,458
Let's dig it up, please.

253
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:48,458
Let's dig it up.

254
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:58,208
-Let's do it.
-Let's do it.

255
00:23:58,291 --> 00:24:01,083
Let's do it. You know what happened?

256
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:04,583
-What did you do?
-What did I do?

257
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:07,833
First, you ran away from Amasya.

258
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,416
And now,
you're running away from Istanbul.

259
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:14,333
You have been running for years.

260
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:19,083
What have you achieved in all those years?

261
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,541
Nothing.

262
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:25,166
Because you were never brave.

263
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:30,791
You could never stand your ground,
look pain in the eye and say,

264
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:36,000
"What am I running from?"

265
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:42,916
You think I'm foul like still water.

266
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:46,250
You think I chose an ordinary life.

267
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:51,916
But I chose to stay
in the eye of the storm, Nesrin.

268
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:55,083
You should've fought.

269
00:24:57,583 --> 00:24:59,083
You should've come too.

270
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:02,125
Is staying here the brave thing?

271
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,750
Yes.

272
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:11,791
Because I can exist in a small city
with all my loneliness.

273
00:25:12,458 --> 00:25:13,458
But you…

274
00:25:14,708 --> 00:25:19,166
In courses, clubs, alleys, streets
and empty crowds,

275
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:22,416
you make airbags for yourself.

276
00:25:28,958 --> 00:25:31,833
But you won't be able to escape
from life's blow.

277
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:43,875
There is only one thing I want from you.

278
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:49,916
Just like you did before,

279
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:52,666
leave again.

280
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:02,458
Leave me alone
with the loneliness I'm used to.

281
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:08,583
Because I've found Allah here.

282
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:13,416
What've you found over all those years?

283
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:18,000
What are you still looking for?

284
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:47,166
When I came back,

285
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:53,416
I realized that I want to leave this city,
just like you did years ago.

286
00:26:57,041 --> 00:26:58,458
But it's like…

287
00:27:01,041 --> 00:27:04,458
this place makes you feel in your bones
that you can't run away.

288
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,875
I used to think I'd be happy if I ran.

289
00:27:10,916 --> 00:27:12,500
But that didn't happen.

290
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,125
What would you want?

291
00:27:21,416 --> 00:27:25,041
To never have this poisonous idea.

292
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:32,958
And to stay here the way I was years ago.

293
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,291
But that's impossible.

294
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:57,583
My condolences.

295
00:30:57,666 --> 00:30:59,958
-My condolences.
-My condolences.

296
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,958
-Thank you.
-May God rest her soul.

297
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:14,375
May she rest in Heaven.
May Allah rest her soul.

298
00:31:29,416 --> 00:31:30,750
My condolences, Zehra.

299
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:34,416
Thank you.

300
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:36,916
I apologize.

301
00:31:39,708 --> 00:31:42,291
I think it was hard for me
to be away from you.

302
00:31:44,125 --> 00:31:45,583
I was talking nonsense.

303
00:31:45,666 --> 00:31:46,666
No.

304
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:51,125
You were right.

305
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:55,000
I'm glad you reminded me.

306
00:31:56,541 --> 00:31:57,875
May Allah rest her soul.

307
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:44,375
I…

308
00:32:47,708 --> 00:32:49,416
I have to leave tomorrow.

309
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,583
Come with me.

310
00:32:58,083 --> 00:32:59,083
Where?

311
00:32:59,833 --> 00:33:00,958
To Istanbul.

312
00:33:02,541 --> 00:33:04,791
Come, let's go together.

313
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:07,458
It would clear your mind.

314
00:33:08,291 --> 00:33:09,291
No.

315
00:33:09,833 --> 00:33:12,250
-Why?
-I'm fine here.

316
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:15,125
You can always come back here.

317
00:33:18,416 --> 00:33:21,041
I swore I'd never set foot
in Istanbul again.

318
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:24,916
I would have come with Zehra if I wanted.

319
00:33:26,583 --> 00:33:27,875
I don't know, Aylin.

320
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:30,916
You went through tough times.

321
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,750
You still do.

322
00:33:35,375 --> 00:33:36,625
Your husband died.

323
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:39,166
Your mom died.

324
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:44,041
And Zehra isn't here anymore.

325
00:33:46,166 --> 00:33:47,791
Then you stay here, Nesrin.

326
00:33:51,458 --> 00:33:53,291
Would you stay if I ask you to?

327
00:33:57,291 --> 00:33:58,291
You can't.

328
00:34:01,541 --> 00:34:02,666
That's life.

329
00:34:06,666 --> 00:34:09,541
You think your life
is everything that's missing.

330
00:34:11,958 --> 00:34:13,958
We had a beautiful friendship.

331
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:20,916
But that innocent feeling has hardened.

332
00:34:22,916 --> 00:34:24,291
Its memory has faded.

333
00:34:25,583 --> 00:34:28,083
All that's left
is to recall it now and then.

334
00:34:30,125 --> 00:34:31,916
I'm fine here by myself.

335
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:43,000
Sometimes a thought pops into my head.

336
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:47,541
I find myself arguing with you for hours.

337
00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:52,416
Maybe I missed years along the way.

338
00:34:53,208 --> 00:34:55,458
I missed my conversations with my mom.

339
00:34:57,541 --> 00:35:01,000
Even though I knew all this,
I couldn't give up.

340
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:03,916
I'm sorry.

341
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:10,041
For not leaving this city with you.

342
00:35:12,416 --> 00:35:13,416
I'm sorry.

343
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,958
Your Aunt Nesrin needs to leave.
Help me see her off.

344
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:39,208
I'm going to Istanbul with Nesrin.

345
00:36:56,291 --> 00:37:00,041
"It's said that it was used
in battles with fire in the old days."

346
00:37:00,541 --> 00:37:02,750
It's true. It was used.

347
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:07,125
My self was used in wars and in defense.

348
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:12,750
I was the commander,
the private, and the battle itself.

349
00:37:12,833 --> 00:37:14,750
I shot, got shot, and gave the order.

350
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:18,250
Yet I'm a magical gift to myself
that must be accepted.

351
00:37:18,916 --> 00:37:20,875
But why did I fight, and with whom?

352
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:24,708
To disassociate from myself?
To injure myself?

353
00:37:24,791 --> 00:37:28,583
To run to others to say, "I exist!"
Why did I come here?

354
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:31,458
I found new gods, my God.

355
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,625
God of Deadlines. God of Scholarship.

356
00:37:34,708 --> 00:37:37,708
God of Approval.
And God of Unconditional Love.

357
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,416
I worshiped them without seeing.

358
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:43,500
But I never had faith.

359
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:49,291
I kept poking my eyes with needles
made out of anticipation.

360
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,125
I learned to worship without faith.

361
00:37:53,708 --> 00:37:55,916
What defense can give myself to me now?

362
00:37:57,916 --> 00:38:01,916
My anger is extinguished.
My lesser gods, I forgive you all.

363
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:09,833
It's okay.

364
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:17,291
Okay. I'm gonna stop now.
It's okay, dear. It's okay.

365
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:35,125
Stop.

366
00:38:36,958 --> 00:38:37,958
Zehra.

367
00:38:39,625 --> 00:38:40,833
Zehra.

368
00:38:42,958 --> 00:38:44,958
I'm a disgusting person!

369
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:50,500
I don't know what I want!
I don't know who I am!

370
00:38:51,583 --> 00:38:54,833
I have no identity! I'm not even a person!
I have no personality!

371
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:59,333
My grandma died,
and I didn't even feel sad!

372
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:01,958
I couldn't be there for Mom!

373
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:07,250
I'm a disgusting person!

374
00:39:08,458 --> 00:39:10,958
I'm disgusting. Don't look at me!

375
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:51,625
I came not to fight,
to prove, to fear, or to run.

376
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:56,291
I came only on a bright quest
for discovery and testimony.

377
00:43:26,833 --> 00:43:32,000
