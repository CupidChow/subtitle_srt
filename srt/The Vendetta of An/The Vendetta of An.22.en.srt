1
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,360
Your identity is no longer hidden.

2
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,680
What do you mean to do with

3
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,040
those two disciples of yours?

4
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,560
The fact that we are still alive
is nothing but fortune.

5
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,960
I trust you will not betray us.

6
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,280
And that is because your children

7
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,440
rest in the heavens,

8
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,840
watching over you.

9
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,200
Someone kind crossed paths with you.

10
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,000
They even set polished rice
before an unclaimed memorial tablet.

11
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,200
Chang'an

12
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,200
is indeed a place of deep prosperity.

13
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,600
We have reached the final brink.

14
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,000
Soon, my children,

15
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,200
our answer will come soon.

16
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,760
Thirty years have passed.

17
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,680
When Chang'an falls,

18
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,440
even in the winter,

19
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,000
the people of Tiemo will have more grain
than they could ever finish.

20
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,000
If only you had been born in such times,

21
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,520
how good that would have been.

22
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,160
These past few days
I have felt something is wrong.

23
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,079
Huai'an has not returned.

24
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,040
Around the clinic,
there have been many unfamiliar faces.

25
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,240
All of this was arranged by you.

26
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,440
Why?

27
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,280
Master.

28
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,480
If you mean to kill me,

29
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,440
at least let me die knowing why.

30
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,840
It is a simple truth.

31
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,360
The people of Tiemo have entered the city.

32
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,880
I am Tiemo as well.

33
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,160
Every Tiemo shadow guard in the city
is searching for Xie Huai'an.

34
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,240
He is capable,

35
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,600
and he vanished without a trace.

36
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,680
Fortunately I have you two.

37
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,280
He has very few friends.

38
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,320
For your sake,

39
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,480
he would do anything foolish.

40
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,720
Xiaoqing's life is hanging by a thread.

41
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,040
Do not resist.

42
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,000
Take her away quickly,

43
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,040
and treat her wounds.

44
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,680
Master.

45
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,840
Xiaoqing.

46
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,560
Master.

47
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,600
Xiaoqing.

48
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,440
-What happened to you?
-It hurts.

49
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,920
Do not be afraid.

50
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,520
I am here.

51
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,960
You can only return to the clinic.

52
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,240
There are many of our people
on Xiaocaomen Street.

53
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,800
They will look after you both.

54
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,080
Master.

55
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,920
Must it truly be this way?

56
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,240
For the great cause of Tiemo,

57
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,320
the lives of a child or two taken in

58
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,680
are not worth much.

59
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,680
Xiaoqing.

60
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,320
Let us go home.

61
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,760
Xiaoqing.

62
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,560
Hold on. We are almost at the clinic.

63
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,560
Do not worry.

64
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,640
I will heal you, I promise.

65
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,040
The wounds can be mended.

66
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,800
But what of the heart?

67
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,920
I will kill them for you.

68
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,440
And Master?

69
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,320
Will you kill him too?

70
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,720
UMBRELLAS

71
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,920
You collapsed before Gu Yu's grave.

72
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,920
Our people carried you back.

73
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,480
How many days has it been?

74
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,240
Four days.

75
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,440
The physician examined you.

76
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,120
He said you did not faint from injury

77
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,640
but fell asleep.

78
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,040
Four days.

79
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,720
News of Gu Yu's death

80
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,080
must have reached the north by now.

81
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,000
The death of a general

82
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,280
can shake an army's resolve.

83
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,680
The Baiwenhu Army

84
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,200
may not hold.

85
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,120
Now that the Tiemo forces march south,

86
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,160
what of Chang'an

87
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,520
as it stands today?

88
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,280
Yesterday,

89
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,640
Tiemo troops breached the North Office.

90
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,520
The North Office

91
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,720
is only 1300 li from Chang'an.

92
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,320
The Huben Army excels
at gathering intelligence.

93
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,120
Nothing that happens in Chang'an
escapes your eyes.

94
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,000
Tell me,

95
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,840
my friends…

96
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,840
Are they all dead?

97
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,840
I fear

98
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,560
they may wish they were.

99
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,360
Good.

100
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,000
If so,

101
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,400
then they are still alive.

102
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,120
And if they live, there is hope.

103
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,680
My pageboy…

104
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,120
Where is he now?

105
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,720
You are…

106
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,360
Have we met before?

107
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,760
The last time we met was 15 years ago.

108
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,680
Back then, you were
a young prince of Chang'an,

109
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,560
studying at the Grand Academy.

110
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,520
To shirk your lessons,

111
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,960
you often claimed to be ill.

112
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,680
You are…

113
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,160
After all these years,

114
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,320
there is something I have always wondered.

115
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,200
The gift I gave you…

116
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,280
Did you ever use it?

117
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,520
I have a gift for you.

118
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,760
Mentor.

119
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,120
Wu Zhongheng?

120
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,600
It is me.

121
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,080
Who are you, truly?

122
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,880
Xie Huai'an did not have time
to tell you, I suppose.

123
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,320
I am Tiemo.

124
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,800
All of Chang'an speaks of Gu Yu's death.

125
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,480
Yes.

126
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,800
I was the one who killed him.

127
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,520
Do not be alarmed.

128
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,400
I will not kill you.

129
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,640
Sit. Let us speak of old times.

130
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,600
Come. Sit.

131
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,160
How long have you been hiding?

132
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,840
More than 20 years.

133
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,520
I traveled across your entire land,

134
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,640
then spent a few more years
building a reputation,

135
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,560
befriending the powerful.

136
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,000
Liu Ziwen, Yan Fengshan,

137
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,160
Grand Preceptor Cen Weizong,

138
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,680
even your father
were all good friends of mine.

139
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,800
During my years at the Grand Academy,

140
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,240
I saw for myself
the brightest talents of Chang'an.

141
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,520
Xie Huai'an, Gu Yu,

142
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,920
and your elder brother,

143
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,680
Xiao Wuyang.

144
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,920
And you

145
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,600
were the most timid of them all.

146
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,760
You are not the first
to say that about me.

147
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,520
Once,

148
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,320
Yan Fengshan said the same thing.

149
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,680
Do not pity yourself.

150
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,560
Because it is precisely your timidity

151
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,720
that makes you
the ideal candidate for the throne.

152
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,800
Many who hold power think so.

153
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,960
And so do

154
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,240
the faraway people of Tiemo,

155
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,040
those who serve at the altar
on Mount Shiluoman.

156
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,960
You see,

157
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,200
timidity can sometimes be
a means of survival.

158
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,840
It allows you to live
far longer than most.

159
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,640
Take Gu Yu,

160
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,880
a man who always charged to the front.

161
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,960
Men like him only die first.

162
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,400
By the way,

163
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,000
was it

164
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,640
Xie Huai'an's idea to send you away?

165
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,920
You were born into the imperial line,

166
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,280
yet you scare so easily.

167
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,880
Yan Fengshan kept you
under his thumb for years.

168
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,800
The throne slipped
from your grasp long ago.

169
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,480
But in the great city of Chang'an,

170
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,400
he is hardly the only one
who wants to become another Yan Fengshan.

171
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,120
Whoever grows powerful

172
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,440
will try to control you.

173
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,320
And this truth

174
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,680
is something
Xie Huai'an certainly understands.

175
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,040
He should have killed
you the moment he had you

176
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,080
under control.

177
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,560
If peace is what he wanted,

178
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,520
your death would have settled everything.

179
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,359
He is more human

180
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,680
than you or Yan Fengshan ever were.

181
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,640
Indeed.

182
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,720
You threw snakes at him back then,

183
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,000
yet he can still call you friend.

184
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,400
He truly has a kindness
that serves him little.

185
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,640
When I entered Chang'an,

186
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,680
my first move against the Huben Army

187
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,000
was to give him a new face

188
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,880
and a forged identity,

189
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,520
fooling everyone.

190
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,960
Even Yan Fengshan

191
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,080
might never have guessed it.

192
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,480
What I did not expect

193
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,720
was that this plan

194
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,200
would be uncovered by the King of Tiemo.

195
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,080
Zhu Zhilong is Tiemo as well.

196
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,720
It turns out

197
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,680
they had infiltrated us
long before we knew it.

198
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,760
My poor friends, both of them.

199
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,160
I want to go out.

200
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,880
Do you know where you are?

201
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,840
Of course I do.

202
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,040
This was once my sister's home.

203
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,920
The pear tree in the courtyard

204
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,760
was planted by her own hand.

205
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,560
To me,

206
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,160
this is where the general lived

207
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,560
and where he died.

208
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,320
Perhaps people like us

209
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,320
are fated

210
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,320
to choose in the midst of chaos

211
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,640
between vengeance

212
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,080
and duty to the realm.

213
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,320
You do not need to choose.

214
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,640
I have already given you my word.

215
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,160
When the Tiemo are defeated,

216
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,480
you may come to settle your debt
with me at any time.

217
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,120
And in doing so,

218
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,320
you will honor the Huben Army
and General Fengshan.

219
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,720
With the general gone,

220
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,600
the Huben I can command is limited.

221
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,800
But if you fight the Tiemo,

222
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,000
I will help you.

223
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,800
For now,

224
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,000
I need time to think.

225
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,640
I said

226
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,040
I want to go out for a walk.

227
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,600
Before he died, Yan Fengshan said

228
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,240
that the streets of Chang'an

229
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,280
might offer a different view.

230
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,480
Then tomorrow,

231
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,760
walk around Chang'an.

232
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,080
Chang'an

233
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,680
can be beautiful at times.

234
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,640
I will leave this for you.

235
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,040
Let us look over there.

236
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,800
Steamed buns.

237
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,920
‎FFENG'S CURED HAM SHOP,
‎EIGHT-DIRECTIONS GOODS SHOP

238
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,320
Huai'an.

239
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,400
An army may fall to the last man.

240
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,160
But Chang'an

241
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,400
must not fall.

242
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,440
This is Gu Yu's

243
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,440
battle report that he hid inside his body.

244
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,440
Once you read it,

245
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,520
you will know where you must go.

246
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,520
Right now my friends' fate is unknown

247
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,560
and I have no one else to trust,

248
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,000
so I can only leave it in your hands.

249
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,440
But if you have other plans,

250
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,920
you are free to choose another path.

251
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,960
But I fear that Chang'an

252
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,520
can no longer be held.

253
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,960
I will deliver this to where it must go.

254
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,160
Thank you.

255
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,480
Is there any news of Xiao Wuyang?

256
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,800
There has been no word at all.

257
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,200
What are you planning to do?

258
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,920
You mean to head north.

259
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,480
Gu Yu is dead.

260
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,760
I have no allies left to rely on.

261
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,760
The deposed emperor and Ye Zheng
are both in their hands.

262
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,120
The Tiemo are waiting for me.

263
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,480
This is the only road left to me.

264
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,120
I will go to the Tiemo,

265
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,760
and help them kill Xiao Wuyang.

266
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,800
In the imperial court,

267
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,120
the ones the Tiemo fear most
are Yan Fengshan and Xiao Wuyang.

268
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,240
Now that Yan Fengshan is dead,

269
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,440
our only chance

270
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,680
lies with Xiao Wuyang.

271
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,240
You should go.

272
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,360
And you

273
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,000
had better not die.

274
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,440
You owe no debt of life to the Tiemo.

275
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,240
You owe it to General Fengshan.

276
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,680
I owe him nothing.

277
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,680
Go.

278
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,400
Take care.

279
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,600
Father.

280
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,360
I failed to protect my sister.

281
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,400
No one walks away

282
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,440
unscathed

283
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,240
after facing Yan Fengshan.

284
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,720
You guarded her all these years

285
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,400
and did everything you could.

286
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,560
In the end,

287
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,320
you even avenged her.

288
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,680
Do not be so hard on yourself.

289
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,720
Seeing my son so weak and worn

290
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,440
breaks my heart.

291
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,120
A father

292
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,880
always aches for his child.

293
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,720
Since you came to Chang'an,

294
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,560
you have already lost too much.

295
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,280
Then take the red ribbon down.

296
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,760
Father.

297
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,360
Though our family's vengeance is repaid,

298
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,320
Chang'an

299
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,240
is far from peaceful.

300
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,840
I waited all night.

301
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,640
I only wished to tell
you one thing, Father.

302
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,720
The King of Tiemo has arrived in Chang'an.

303
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,680
Then take the red ribbon down.

304
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,480
Very well.

305
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,720
I didn't dare come

306
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,160
until everything was settled.

307
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,200
Xie Huai'an's friends

308
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,240
can no longer escape.

309
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,880
We need only wait for him to show.

310
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,440
White Hair entered
Yan Fengshan's courtyard.

311
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,920
I cannot tell whether he won or lost,

312
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,400
so I sent you in.

313
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,200
For that,

314
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,080
you had to kill
the master you served for years.

315
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,600
Do you regret it?

316
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,280
No.

317
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,840
I have only ever
served one master with my life.

318
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,080
Yan Fengshan is dead.

319
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,520
The Huben Army is no longer a threat.

320
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,040
Gu Yu is dead as well.

321
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,000
Our forces

322
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,720
can march straight
into the heart of their empire.

323
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,160
Only one danger remains.

324
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,280
Xiao Wuyang.

325
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,320
If he dies,

326
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,960
Chang'an will fall.

327
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,280
Xiao Wuyang stands alone now.

328
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,840
This time, if our plan is thorough,

329
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,800
he will not survive.

330
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,680
I saw something like this once,
a man on the edge of death,

331
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,240
hanging high on a platform.

332
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,960
He was an ordinary man,

333
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,760
yet he lived for seven days and nights.

334
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,760
If someone ordinary
can fight so hard to survive,

335
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,960
what about the King of Death, Xiao Wuyang?

336
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,720
Yes.

337
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,480
The noodles are here.

338
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,480
Chili oil noodles.

339
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,520
Scallions dipped in vinegar.

340
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,159
It has been more than ten years.

341
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,719
Sha,

342
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,239
you still remember my favorite bite.

343
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,880
Of course I do.

344
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,040
Had I forgotten,

345
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,600
I would have lost my head.

346
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,480
Sha,

347
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,960
Cen Pickles came by, didn't he?

348
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,040
No.

349
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,080
After the Liu clan was wiped out,

350
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,400
Yan Fengshan purged Liu's faction,

351
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,120
and he never showed himself again.

352
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,480
Does he still need to hide
from Yan Fengshan's blade?

353
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,360
Don't you also…

354
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,960
Don't you also hide from him?
Unbelievable.

355
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,600
Sha,

356
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,000
that you've survived this long
with that temperament

357
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,040
feels like a miracle to me.

358
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,640
Eat while it's hot.

359
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,920
Sha,

360
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,240
in this world,

361
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,120
I have patience for very few people.

362
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,280
You are one of them.

363
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,880
Cen Pickles is the other.

364
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,680
If he came to you,

365
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,880
and you don't wish to tell me,
or he forbade you to say,

366
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,240
it doesn't matter.

367
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,640
Just pass on a message for me.

368
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,360
Tell him I have arrived in Chang'an.

369
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,000
And tell him I hope

370
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,920
we are still friends.

371
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,600
Cen Pickles,

372
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,400
who is he?

373
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,080
A man surnamed Cen.

374
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,880
Twenty years ago,

375
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,240
everyone knew his name.

376
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,400
The Grand Preceptor, Cen Weizong?

377
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,280
He was a friend of His Majesty?

378
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,360
The founding emperor,

379
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,840
Liu Ziwen,

380
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,320
the Grand Preceptor Cen Weizong,

381
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,840
and the man just now,

382
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,600
when they were young, often gathered here.

383
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,080
Yan Fengshan

384
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,680
would sometimes come along too.

385
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,400
He was younger than the rest of them.

386
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,160
And in their eyes,

387
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,960
the so-called General Fengshan

388
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,040
was just an inexperienced young man.

389
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,480
An inexperienced young man?

390
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,800
Later,

391
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,200
didn't he rule the empire
for over ten years?

392
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,920
In your eyes,

393
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,080
I am also an inexperienced young man,
aren't I?

394
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,080
You…

395
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,280
You are not human.

396
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,440
When I had nowhere left to go,

397
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,600
the boss took me in.

398
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,800
Later,

399
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,600
I went outside the city
to collect his body.

400
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,720
He was crushed to death.

401
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,680
Not even beasts would do such a thing.

402
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,160
I remember the boss's kindness.

403
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,720
But I was born a Tiemo man.

404
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,080
My life was not his to give.

405
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,440
Can I have a bowl of noodles?

406
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,040
Get out.

407
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,640
After more than ten years apart,

408
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,400
I meet you again.

409
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,080
This is Yang Chuhao's courtyard.

410
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,360
Why did you suddenly
decide to sun his books?

411
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,680
In his study,
there truly are many fine volumes.

412
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,200
I even found a travelogue
written by a friend

413
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,880
from my youth.

414
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,720
Reading it

415
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,040
was like meeting an old friend again.

416
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,400
An old friend?

417
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,480
Then I am also one of your old friends.

418
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,360
Of course.

419
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,920
At the Grand Academy, I once asked you,

420
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,200
when you grew up,

421
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,480
what kind of achievement you wished for.

422
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,520
Do you remember?

423
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,520
Of course I do.

424
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,200
I asked you, when you grew up,

425
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,720
what kind of career you wished to build?

426
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,560
In times of peace, to aid a wise ruler.

427
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,000
And in times of chaos?

428
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,400
In times of chaos,

429
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,840
to kill every enemy.

430
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,640
White Hair,

431
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,560
have you come to kill me?

432
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,760
Mentor,

433
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,760
these hands of a scholar

434
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,680
now hold no iron, no blade.

435
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,840
How could they possibly
kill the King of Tiemo?

436
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,760
I came

437
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,240
to trade for my friend's life.

438
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,880
You say you came to save a friend,

439
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,080
but I do not believe
you would bow your head so readily.

440
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,120
It has been over ten years,

441
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,920
and your intellect alone
is enough to chill one's bones.

442
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,600
You killed Yan Fengshan with strategy,

443
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,800
because you understood him.

444
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,520
White Hair,

445
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,880
as for me,

446
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,120
how well do you understand me?
