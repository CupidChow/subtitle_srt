00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:30,020
[The Vendetta of An]

2
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,100
Your identity is no longer hidden.

3
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,410
What do you mean to do with

4
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,930
those two disciples of yours?

5
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,820
The fact that we are still alive

6
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,330
is nothing but fortune.

7
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,620
I trust you will not betray us.

8
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,050
And that is because your children

9
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,020
rest in the heavens,

10
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,620
watching over you.

11
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,940
Someone kind crossed paths with you.

12
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,100
They even set polished rice

13
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:11,870
before an ownerless memorial tablet.

14
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:15,920
Chang'an

15
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,880
is indeed a place of deep prosperity.

16
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,010
We have reached the final brink.

17
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,730
Soon children,

18
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,780
our answer will come soon.

19
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,290
30 years have passed.

20
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,480
When Chang'an falls,

21
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,100
even in the winter,

22
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,240
the people of Tiemo will have

23
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,660
more grain than they could ever finish.

24
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,570
If only you could have been born in such times,

25
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,290
how good that would have been.

26
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,380
[Episode 22]

27
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,780
These past few days I have felt something is wrong.

28
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,740
Huai'an has not returned.

29
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,540
Around the Taiyiji Clinic,

30
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,050
there have been many unfamiliar faces.

31
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,730
All of this was arranged by you.

32
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,050
Why?

33
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:30,810
Master.

34
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,250
If you mean to kill me,

35
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,130
at least let me die knowing why.

36
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,680
It is a simple truth.

37
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,200
The people of Tiemo have entered the city.

38
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,730
I am Tiemo as well.

39
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,710
Every Tiemo shadow guard in the city

40
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,080
is searching for Xie Huai'an.

41
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,780
He is capable,

42
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,340
and he vanished without a trace.

43
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,410
Fortunately I have you two.

44
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,020
He has very few friends.

45
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,930
For your sake,

46
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,170
he would do anything foolish.

47
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,290
Xiaoqing's life is hanging by a thread.

48
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,660
Do not resist.

49
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,540
Take her away quickly,

50
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:47,590
and heal her wounds.

51
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,790
Master.

52
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,380
Xiaoqing.

53
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,320
Master.

54
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,040
Xiaoqing.

55
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,190
What happened to you?

56
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,420
It hurts.

57
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,610
Do not be afraid.

58
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,060
I am here.

59
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,830
You can only return to the Taiyiji Clinic.

60
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,810
There are many of our people on Xiaocaomen Street.

61
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,810
They will look after you both.

62
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,610
Master.

63
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,600
Must it truly be this way?

64
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,820
For the great cause of Tiemo,

65
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,980
the lives of a child or two taken in

66
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,370
are not worth much.

67
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,130
Xiaoqing.

68
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:04,900
Let us go home.

69
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,490
Xiaoqing.

70
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,250
Hold on.

71
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,170
We are almost at the clinic.

72
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:29,900
Do not worry.

73
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,460
I will heal you, I promise.

74
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,460
The wounds can be mended.

75
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,580
But what of the heart?

76
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,670
I will kill him for you.

77
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,020
And Master?

78
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,100
Will you kill him too?

79
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,520
You collapsed before Gu Yu's grave.

80
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,050
Our people carried you back.

81
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,150
How many days has it been?

82
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,850
Four days.

83
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,260
The physician examined you.

84
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,900
He said you did not faint from injury

85
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,570
but fell asleep.

86
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,570
Four days.

87
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,300
News of Gu Yu's death

88
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,570
must have reached the north by now.

89
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,840
The death of a general

90
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,930
can shake an army's resolve.

91
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,380
The Baiwenhu Army

92
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,730
may not hold.

93
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,810
Now that the Tiemo forces march south,

94
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,930
what of Chang'an

95
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,180
as it stands today?

96
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,780
Yesterday,

97
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,250
Tiemo troops breached the North Office.

98
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,060
The North Office

99
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,530
is only 1300 li from Chang'an.

100
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,510
The Huben Army excels

101
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,130
at gathering intelligence.

102
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,190
Nothing that happens in Chang'an

103
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,960
escapes your eyes.

104
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,770
Tell me,

105
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,300
my friends...

106
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,670
Are they all dead?

107
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:37,710
I fear

108
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,060
they may wish they were.

109
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:44,820
Good.

110
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,580
If so,

111
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,110
then they are still alive.

112
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,700
And if they live, there is hope.

113
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,300
My pageboy...

114
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,770
Where is he now?

115
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,760
You are...

116
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,240
Have we met before?

117
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,210
The last time we met

118
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,550
was 15 years ago.

119
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,340
Back then you were a young prince

120
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,340
of Chang'an,

121
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,940
studying at the Grand Academy.

122
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,130
To escape your lessons,

123
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,370
you often claimed to be ill.

124
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,320
You are...

125
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:53,920
After all these years,

126
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,010
there is something I have always wondered.

127
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,010
The gift I gave you...

128
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,010
Did you ever use it?

129
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,220
I have a gift for you.

130
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,460
Mentor.

131
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,060
Wu Zhongheng?

132
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,300
It is me.

133
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,220
Who are you, truly?

134
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,600
Xie Huai'an did not have time to tell you,

135
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,540
I suppose.

136
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,010
I am Tiemo.

137
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,650
All of Chang'an speaks of Gu Yu's death.

138
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,080
Yes.

139
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,530
I was the one who killed him.

140
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,060
Do not be alarmed.

141
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,280
I will not kill you.

142
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,300
Let us sit,

143
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,250
and speak of old times.

144
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,410
Come. Sit.

145
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:21,770
You...

146
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,130
How long have you been hiding?

147
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,820
More than 20 years.

148
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,420
I traveled across

149
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,300
your entire land,

150
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,100
then spent a few more years

151
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,250
building a reputation,

152
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,080
befriending the powerful.

153
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,580
Liu Ziwen, Yan Fengshan,

154
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,850
Grand Preceptor Cen Weizong,

155
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,410
even your father

156
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,300
were all friends of mine.

157
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,540
During my years at the Grand Academy,

158
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:51,330
I saw for myself

159
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:52,930
the brightest talents of Chang'an.

160
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,200
Xie Huai'an,

161
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,130
Gu Yu,

162
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,570
and your elder brother,

163
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,430
Xiao Wuyang.

164
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,560
And you

165
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:05,090
were the most timid of them all.

166
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,540
You are not the first to say that about me.

167
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,190
Once,

168
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,110
Yan Fengshan said the same thing.

169
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,180
Do not pity yourself.

170
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,380
Because it is precisely your timidity

171
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,090
that makes you

172
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,210
the ideal candidate for the throne.

173
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,680
Many who hold power think so.

174
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,730
And so do

175
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,900
the faraway people of Tiemo,

176
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,350
those who serve at the altar on Mount Shiluoman.

177
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,710
You see,

178
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,470
timidity can sometimes be

179
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,810
a means of survival.

180
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,040
It allows you to live

181
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,640
far longer than most.

182
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,540
Take Gu Yu,

183
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,730
a man who always charged to the front.

184
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,730
Men like him only die first.

185
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,010
By the way,

186
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,670
was it

187
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:08,160
Xie Huai'an's idea to send you away?

188
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,760
You were born into the imperial line,

189
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,980
yet you scare so easily.

190
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,440
Yan Fengshan kept you under his thumb for years.

191
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,660
The throne slipped from your grasp long ago.

192
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,550
But in the great city of Chang'an,

193
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,500
he is hardly the only one

194
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,060
who wants to become another Yan Fengshan.

195
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,640
Whoever grows powerful

196
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,360
will try to control you.

197
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,240
And this truth

198
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,010
is something Xie Huai'an certainly understands.

199
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,580
He should have killed you the moment he had you

200
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:57,570
under control.

201
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,560
If peace is what he wanted,

202
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,010
your death

203
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:03,830
would have settled everything.

204
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,890
He is more human

205
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,130
than you or Yan Fengshan.

206
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:17,190
Indeed.

207
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,650
You threw snakes at him back then,

208
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:21,900
yet he can still call you a friend.

209
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,090
He truly has a kindness that serves him little.

210
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,490
When I entered Chang'an,

211
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,420
my first move against the Huben Army

212
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,660
was to give him a new face

213
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,660
and a forged identity,

214
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,290
fooling everyone.

215
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,420
Even Yan Fengshan

216
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,830
might never have guessed it.

217
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,010
What I did not expect

218
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,330
was that this plan

219
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,780
would be uncovered by the King of Tiemo.

220
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,570
Zhu Zhilong is Tiemo as well.

221
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,220
It turns out

222
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,430
they had infiltrated us

223
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,490
long before we knew it.

224
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,250
My poor friends, both of them.
(Watch on www.kisskh.at to support Admin)

225
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,900
I want to go out.

226
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,700
Do you know where you are?

227
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,490
Of course I do.

228
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,690
This is my sister's home.

229
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,580
The pear tree in the courtyard

230
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,380
was planted by her own hand.

231
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,090
To me,

232
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,860
this is where the general lived

233
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,200
and where he died.

234
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,810
Perhaps people like us

235
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:47,770
are fated

236
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,860
to choose in the midst of chaos

237
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,000
between vengeance

238
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:57,600
and duty to the realm.

239
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,860
You do not need to choose.

240
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,330
I have already given you my word.

241
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,180
When the Tiemo are defeated,

242
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,220
you may come to settle your debt with me at any time.

243
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,070
And in doing so,

244
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,980
you will honor the Huben Army

245
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,800
and General Fengshan.

246
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:33,940
With the general gone,

247
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,010
the Huben I can command is limited.

248
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,520
But if you fight the Tiemo,

249
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:40,450
I will help you.

250
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,460
For now,

251
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,700
I need time to think.

252
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,250
I said

253
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,800
I want to go out for a walk.

254
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,380
Before he died, Yan Fengshan said

255
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,040
that the streets of Chang'an

256
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,980
might offer a different view.

257
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,050
Then tomorrow,

258
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,420
walk around Chang'an.

259
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,610
Chang'an

260
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,290
can be beautiful at times.

261
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,560
Steamed buns.

An army may fall to the last man.

270
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,580
But Chang'an

271
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,050
must not fall.

272
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:13,260

285
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,010
This is Gu Yu's

286
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,090
battle report

287
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,280
that he hid inside his body.

288
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,220
Once you read it,

289
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,110
you will know where you must go.

290
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:30,230
Right now my friends' fate is unknown

291
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,430
and I have no one else to trust,

292
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,830
so I can only leave it in your hands.

293
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,030
But if you have other plans,

294
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,370
you are free to choose another path.

295
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:45,560
But I fear that Chang'an

296
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,070
can no longer be held.

297
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:00,180
I will deliver this

298
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,010
to where it must go.

299
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:08,940
Thank you.

300
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,180
Is there any news of Xiao Wuyang?

301
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,580
There has been no word at all.

302
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,970
What are you planning to do?

303
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,640
You mean to head north.

304
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,240
Gu Yu is dead.

305
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:35,540
I have no allies

306
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,660
left to rely on.

307
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,230
The deposed emperor and Ye Zheng

308
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,430
are both in their hands.

309
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,850
The Tiemo people are waiting for me.

310
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,330
This is the only road left to me.

311
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:51,940
I will go to the Tiemo,

312
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,420
and help them kill Xiao Wuyang.

313
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,380
In the imperial court,

314
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,290
the ones the Tiemo fear most

315
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:04,770
are Yan Fengshan and Xiao Wuyang.

316
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,770
Now that Yan Fengshan is dead,

317
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,980
our only chance

318
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,580
lies with Xiao Wuyang.

319
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,080
You should go.

320
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:09,770
And you

321
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:11,680
had better not die.

322
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:13,980
You owe no life to the Tiemo.

323
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,700
You owe it to General Fengshan.

324
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,220
I owe him nothing.

325
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,250
Go.

326
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,070
Take care.

327
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,250
Father.

328
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,940
I failed to protect my sister.

329
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,220
No one walks away

330
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:01,860
unscathed

331
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,600
after facing Yan Fengshan.

332
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,370
You guarded her all these years

333
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:08,900
and did everything you could.

334
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:10,990
In the end,

335
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,670
you even avenged her.

336
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,310
Do not be so hard on yourself.

337
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,700
Seeing my son

338
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,440
so weak and worn

339
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,540
breaks my heart.

340
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,370
A father

341
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,370
always aches for his child.

342
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:34,940
Since you came to Chang'an,

343
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:38,370
you have already lost too much.
(Watch on www.kisskh .ws to support Admin)

344
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,890
Then take the red ribbon down.

345
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:44,600
Father.

346
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:47,730
Though our family's vengeance is repaid,

347
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,810
Chang'an

348
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,580
is far from peaceful.

349
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,050
I waited all night.

350
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,810
I only wished to tell you one thing, Father.

351
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,330
The King of Tiemo has arrived in Chang'an.

352
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:41,090
Then take the red ribbon down.

353
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:47,700
Very well.

354
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:28,780
Everything is done.

355
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,460
Only then did I dare come before Your Majesty.

356
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,660
Xie Huai'an's friends

357
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,700
can no longer escape.

358
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,530
We need only wait for him to appear.

359
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,940
White Hair entered Yan Fengshan's courtyard.

360
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,330
I cannot tell whether he won or lost,

361
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:47,820
so I sent you in.

362
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,420
For that,

363
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:52,500
you had to kill the master you served for years.

364
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,130
Do you regret it?

365
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:56,780
No.

366
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,220
I have only ever served one master with my life.

367
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,430
Yan Fengshan is dead.

368
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,850
The Huben Army is no longer a threat.

369
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,470
Gu Yu is dead as well.

370
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,710
Our forces

371
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:18,050
can march straight into their empire's heartland.

372
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,610
Only one danger remains.

373
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:22,660
Xiao Wuyang.

374
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,570
If he dies,

375
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,460
Chang'an falls.

376
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:31,700
Xiao Wuyang stands alone now.

377
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:33,260
This time,

378
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,290
if our plan is thorough,

379
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,700
he will not survive.

380
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,710
I saw something like this once,

381
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:43,180
a man on the edge of death,

382
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,610
hanging high on a platform.

383
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,180
He was an ordinary man,

384
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:52,290
yet he lived for seven days and nights.

385
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,500
If someone ordinary

386
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,120
can fight so hard to survive,

387
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,420
what about the King of Death, Xiao Wuyang?

388
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,180
Yes.

389
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,890
The noodles are here.

390
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:10,700
Chili oil noodles.

391
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:14,010
Scallions dipped in vinegar.

392
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:17,490
It has been more than ten years.

393
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:19,100
Sha,

394
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,740
you still remember my favorite bite.

395
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,660
Of course I do.

396
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:26,280
If I ever forgot it,

397
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:29,020
I would lose my head.

398
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:36,930
Sha,

399
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,540
Cen Pickles came by, didn't he?

400
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,540
No.

401
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:48,370
After the Liu clan was wiped out,

402
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,290
Yan Fengshan purged Liu's faction,

403
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,890
and he never showed himself again.

404
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:55,700
Does he still need

405
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,370
to hide from Yan Fengshan's blade?

406
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:58,540
Don't you also…

407
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:11,010
Don't you also hide from him?

408
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:11,660
Unbelievable.

409
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:18,260
Sha,

410
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:21,460
that you've survived this long with that temperament

411
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,490
feels like a miracle to me.

412
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:25,730
Eat while it's hot.

413
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:27,220
Sha,

414
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:30,540
in this world,

415
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:34,660
I have patience for very few people.

416
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,100
You are one of them.

417
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:39,410
Cen Pickles is another.

418
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:42,120
If he came to you,

419
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,740
and you don't wish to tell me,

420
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,370
or he forbade you to say,

421
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,680
it doesn't matter.

422
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,060
Just pass on a message for me.

423
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,890
Tell him I have arrived in Chang'an.

424
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,490
And that I hope

425
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,330
we are still friends.

426
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,100
Cen Pickles,

427
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,660
who is he?

428
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:46,450
A man surnamed Cen.

429
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,270
Twenty years ago,

430
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:50,970
everyone knew his name.

431
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,780
The Grand Preceptor, Cen Weizong?

432
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:58,740
He was a friend of His Majesty?

433
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:05,970
The founding emperor,

434
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,450
Liu Ziwen,

435
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,890
the Grand Preceptor Cen Weizong,

436
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,260
and the man just now,

437
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,080
when they were young,

438
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,300
often gathered here.

439
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,490
Yan Fengshan

440
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:20,180
would sometimes come along too.

441
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:21,910
He was younger

442
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:22,950
than the rest of them.

443
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,540
And in their eyes,

444
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:28,540
the so-called General Fengshan

445
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:30,560
was just

446
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,930
an inexperienced young man.

447
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,010
An inexperienced young man?

448
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:51,100
Later,

449
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,580
didn't he rule the empire for over ten years?

450
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:56,260
In your eyes,

451
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:00,930
I am also

452
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:01,780
an inexperienced young man, aren't I?

453
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,540
You...

454
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:18,780
You are not human.

455
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,700
When I had nowhere left to go,

456
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,930
the boss took me in.

457
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,010
Later,

458
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,060
I went outside the city to collect his body.

459
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:45,450
He was crushed to death.

460
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,140
Not even beasts would do such a thing.

461
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,740
I remember the boss's kindness.

462
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,140
But I was born a Tiemo man.

463
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:34,450
My life was not his to give.

464
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,740
Can I have a bowl of noodles?

465
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,220
Get out.

466
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:48,580
After more than ten years apart,

467
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,010
I meet you again.

468
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:58,450
This is Yang Chuhao's courtyard.

469
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,140
Why did you suddenly

470
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:03,010
decide to sun his books?

471
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:09,410
In his study,

472
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:11,290
there truly are many fine volumes.

473
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,000
I even found

474
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,920
a travelogue written by a friend

475
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,290
from my youth.

476
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,100
Reading it

477
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,490
was like seeing an old friend again.

478
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:25,890
An old friend?

479
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:29,260
Then I am also one of your old friends.

480
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,620
Of course.

481
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,740
Back at the Grand Academy I asked you,

482
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:39,700
when you grew up,

483
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,930
what kind of achievement you wished for.

484
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:43,720
Do you remember?

485
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:47,850
Of course I do.

486
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,060
I asked you,

487
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:51,490
when you grew up,

488
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,330
what kind of

489
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:54,620
career you wished to build?

490
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:55,780
In times of peace,

491
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,140
to aid a wise ruler.

492
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,220
And in times of chaos?

493
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:00,970
In times of chaos,

494
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:02,260
to kill every enemy.

495
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:08,890
White Hair,

496
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:13,220
have you come to kill me?

497
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,060
Mentor,

498
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:24,220
these hands of a scholar

499
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,140
now hold no iron, no blade.

500
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:30,620
How could they possibly kill the King of Tiemo?

501
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:32,330
I came

502
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:35,720
to trade for my friend's life.

503
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,260
You say you came to save a friend,

504
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,170
but I do not believe

505
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:42,520
you would surrender quietly.

506
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:44,580
It has been over ten years,

507
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,140
and your intellect is enough to chill the bones.

508
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,850
You killed Yan Fengshan with strategy,

509
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,060
because you understood him.

510
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:56,740
White Hair,

511
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:01,180
as for me,

512
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,370
