[The Vendetta of An]

2
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,020
[A day ago]

3
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,050
Gu Yu was locked up

4
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,380
in Zuihua Tower at the market.

5
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,490
All this trash

6
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,260
was hauled from over there.

7
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:47,290
Yeah.

8
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,370
The trash from Zuihua Tower

9
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,130
gets dumped here.

10
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,410
Say it again.

11
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,770
What exactly happened that day?

12
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,260
I saw it myself.

13
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,380
Wang Pu and his men

14
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,380
chained up Gu Yu

15
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,930
and dragged him into Zuihua Tower.

16
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,140
Say it again.

17
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,020
Wang Pu and his men

18
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,420
chained up Gu Yu

19
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,200
and dragged him

20
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,650
into Zuihua Tower

21
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,060
like some stray dog.

22
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,340
Say it again.

23
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,650
Wang Pu had Gu Yu in chains.

24
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,770
Iron chains.

25
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,300
Two Huben men were dragging him along.

26
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,930
His legs wouldn't move at all.

27
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,690
His hands were gripping

28
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,580
the chain so tightly.

29
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,850
The wound on his neck

30
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:45,740
could be seen so clearly.

31
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,690
A wound on his neck?

32
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,770
Gu Yu was hurt.

33
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,460
There should've been

34
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,650
bloody rags in the trash.

35
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,240
Used ointments and medicine

36
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,210
would've given off

37
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,060
a smell.

38
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:15,990
No.

39
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:17,970
This isn't right.

40
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,690
So,

41
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,620
taking Gu Yu to Zuihua Tower

42
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,300
was nothing but a diversion.

43
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,530
What?

44
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,020
A diversion.

45
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,340
Huai'an,

46
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,010
I know

47
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,300
where they're keeping Gu Yu.

48
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,180
It was a girl.

49
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,060
General, who are you thinking of?

50
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,420
Don't you think

51
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,300
she looks a little like you?

52
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,130
Day in and day out together,

53
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,690
have you started to see me differently?

54
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:29,890
Of course.

55
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,490
Your wounds are almost healed.

56
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,420
Let me take the bandage off.

57
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,570
It's getting late.

58
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,690
You should rest, General.

59
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,570
Yuan.

60
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,910
This is for you.

61
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,320
Thank you

62
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,430
for taking such thoughtful care of me these days.

63
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,450
But didn't you tell me

64
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,130
that you'd grant anything I asked?

65
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,840
I'll agree to anything you want.

66
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,060
But first, your blade

67
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,180
should be set aside.

68
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,820
Don't blame me.

69
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,620
Aren't you

70
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,220
hiding a blade too?

71
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,010
General.

72
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,370
It feels like a lifetime

73
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,740
since we last met.

74
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,150
When word came that His Majesty had killed you,

75
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,770
I was the one who went to claim your body.

76
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,250
But the body wasn't yours.

77
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,980
Seeing you alive now

78
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,570
isn't a surprise.

79
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,220
What surprises me

80
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,660
is that we'd meet again here.

81
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,300
White Hair,

82
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,010
it's been a long time.

83
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,690
You've been planning against the Huben

84
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,560
for quite a while, haven't you?

85
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,060
Tonight isn't the time to reminisce.

86
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,810
We need to think fast

87
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,780
and get you out of here.

88
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,940
I'm not leaving. Not yet.

89
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,450
Maybe it's been too long since you saw me.

90
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,860
Perhaps you've forgotten

91
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,130
the way I work.

92
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,250
Maybe you forgot

93
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,220
that I'm still a general.

94
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,060
So many of my soldiers were slaughtered.

95
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,980
I have to stay here.

96
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:16,850
An eye for an eye.

97
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,490
There must be vengeance.

98
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,250
You're going to help me.

99
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,780
Gu Yu.

100
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,890
Wumei killed the men guarding you.

101
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,950
From now until the bodies are found,

102
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,870
it's a day at most.

103
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,060
Yan Fengshan has shown up.

104
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,040
He's back in Chang'an.

105
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,010
He's got at most a day.

106
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,180
So, you're going to use half a day

107
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,100
to help me plan a way to get revenge.

108
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,490
You can do it.

109
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,220
[Episode 12]

110
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,100
Mr. Wang Pu, we should pull back.

111
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,810
As of now,

112
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,300
Wang Pu already knows.

113
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,110
What he doesn't know

114
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,040
is that the Baiwenhu will strike back at the Huben.

115
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,450
General.

116
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,020
The Huben Army has started moving out.

117
00:14:59,240 --> 00:14:59,970
We need to go.

118
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:14,810
Mr. Wang!

119
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,180
Mr. Wang!

120
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,880
What is it?

121
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,060
You should take a look at the market.

122
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,900
Gu Yu.

123
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,320
He really is a commander

124
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,780
you can't help but admire.

125
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,780
A life for a life.

126
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,330
And the one plotting for him

127
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,330
is a sharp mind too.

128
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:13,900
Let me think.

129
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:15,300
Mr. Wang,

130
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,260
I did the same job for seven years

131
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,660
prior to joining the Hidden Soldier Alley.

132
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,300
Sorting things is second nature.

133
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,020
I'm quick to spot what's valuable.

134
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,420
There's always something

135
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,780
worth picking up where I look.

136
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,730
Digging clues out of trash.

137
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,090
They saved Gu Yu,

138
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,660
and even set a trap for me.

139
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,780
This garbage picker is the first one.

140
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:37,850
Di Lu?

141
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,850
He's been gone a long time.

142
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,090
He's probably dead.

143
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,020
Then, this grey-haired one

144
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:43,940
is the second.

145
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,140
If he's the suspicious one,

146
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,450
that means...

147
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,730
The people you told me to check on

148
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,540
have all been tailed.

149
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:55,900
No issues.

150
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,300
But if you're not convinced,

151
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,000
I can just kill them all.

152
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,580
Questioning them one by one

153
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,810
is beyond my patience.

154
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,410
That old witch.

155
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,130
Aunt Xin can't be trusted either.

156
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,000
From here on out, every word I say

157
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,920
must be kept in mind.

158
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,300
From West Third Alley to West Fifth Alley,

159
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,120
the whole area

160
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,410
must be sealed.

161
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,570
They'll try to break out from there.

162
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:27,570
Understood.

163
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,060
Take more men.

164
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,410
To the alley entrances.

165
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,570
Keep an eye on that old witch.

166
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,300
Don't you dare fight her.

167
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,740
You may not win.

168
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:37,730
Got that?

169
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:38,890
Got it.

170
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:39,700
Move.

171
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,260
Search all of Hidden Soldier Alley

172
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,980
for Li Sangeng and Wang Xing.

173
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,570
Wang Xing's real name

174
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,300
is Xie Huai'an.

175
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,370
Understood.

176
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:01,650
You two,

177
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:02,820
time to pull out.

178
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,140
The general ordered us

179
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,460
to keep you both safe.

180
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:11,920
It's time.

181
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,370
Once we're out,

182
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,820
you can become Han Ziling again.

183
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:34,810
Go!

184
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,070
Didn't expect the Huben

185
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:01,850
to react this fast.

186
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,130
No idea whether General Gu succeeded.

187
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,940
Most likely he failed.

188
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,980
The Huben's movements now

189
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:10,940
are too orderly.

190
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,260
Which means

191
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,970
their command center

192
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:14,940
hasn't fallen into chaos.

193
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,020
Wang Pu is still alive.

194
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,410
His counterattack

195
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,500
is coming our way.

196
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,170
Move.

197
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,810
The way ahead is full of Huben.

198
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,220
Alright.

199
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:14,940
Go warn Gu Yu.

200
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,740
Tell him the ward wall here is a trap.

201
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,810
They can't come here yet.

202
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,220
You all break out together.

203
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,260
You go. I'll stay.

204
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,650
No time to argue.

205
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,410
Hurry!

206
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:25,780
Wait.

207
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:30,980
You need to tell Gu Yu

208
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,460
that we already made it out.

209
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,290
Only after we escaped

210
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,090
did the ward wall get surrounded.

211
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,570
You get me?

212
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,420
I do.

213
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,210
- Go! - Protect the general!

214
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,060
Yes.

215
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,300
You two,

216
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,410
I'm heading out.

217
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,620
Take care.

218
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,620
Thank you both

219
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,700
for rescuing the general

220
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:54,610
for the Baiwenhu Army.

221
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,320
Hold on.

222
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,370
No time to waste.

223
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,020
Ziling.

224
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,500
Go.

225
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,980
With me here,

226
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:32,130
it doesn't matter how many more come.

227
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,300
I'll say it again.

228
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,090
With me here,

229
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,220
no number of men will make a difference.

230
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,770
General!

231
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,880
- General! - General!

232
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,790
I, Gu Yu, thank you all

233
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,940
for avenging our fallen soldiers.

234
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,370
We can't stay here.

235
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:24,800
Let's head to the ward wall.

236
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:26,700
No!

237
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,540
General,

238
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:30,940
the planned extraction point

239
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:31,740
is busted.

240
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,940
The Huben Army has it surrounded.

241
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,020
What about Xie Huai'an, Han Ziling,

242
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,740
and the others meant to receive us?

243
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,130
They've already made it out.

244
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,190
The Huben encirclement

245
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,840
formed after they escaped.

246
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,770
Mr. Xie Huai'an told me to inform you

247
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,490
so you don't fall into the trap.

248
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,060
Good. They're safe.

249
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,330
We have enough men to break through.

250
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,460
Let's move.

251
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,330
Break out from the west wall.

252
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:57,580
- Yes! - Yes!

253
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:00,510
Search thoroughly.

254
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,600
Leave no stone unturned.

255
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,200
- Yes. - Yes.

256
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:23,890
Head for the southwest corner

257
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:24,720
once we get out.

258
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,640
I pile the big trash over there.

259
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,050
Stack the wooden crates.

260
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,150
You can scale the wall.

261
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:32,090
This is the last chance.
(Watch on www.kisskh.ws to support Admin)

262
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,410
This way.

263
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:56,620
There's an ambush.

264
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,250
Ready.

265
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,320
General, let's go.

266
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,850
We've gone in circles

267
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,620
and ended up back here.

268
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,130
Where it began

269
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,780
is where it ends.

270
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,360
I figure Di Lu

271
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,740
wanted to drag us down with him.

272
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,700
But Di Lu isn't even here.

273
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:04,730
Right?

274
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,610
How many soldiers

275
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,980
can be mobilized from Chang'an?

276
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,060
A thousand.

277
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,130
Before entering Hidden Soldier Alley,

278
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,810
I ordered everyone to arm up.

279
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,460
They're ready to move.

280
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,460
You've seen how big Hidden Soldier Alley is.

281
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:37,730
A thousand men

282
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,190
are not enough to smash through.

283
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,500
With this badge, you may enter the palace,

284
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,700
and see His Majesty.

285
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,390
Mobilize the Imperial and Right Cavalry Guards

286
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,330
and

287
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,150
encircle Hidden Soldier Alley completely.

288
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:00,500
I want Xie Huai'an and Han Ziling

289
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,330
captured alive.

290
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,370
I know Huai'an's tricks

291
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,130
all too well.

292
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,890
He always says those sentimental things,

293
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,300
letting others take the path to life,

294
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,220
while he walks

295
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,300
toward the dead end himself.

296
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,090
You

297
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,460
lied to me.

298
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,410
They haven't come out yet.

299
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,780
Please forgive me, General.

300
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,610
I blame no one.

301
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,060
I know

302
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,370
I have to get out of there.

303
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,370
Tonight, in all of Chang'an,

304
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,650
there's something more important

305
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:48,850
than anyone's life or death.

306
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,220
But whether they live or die

307
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,220
depends on

308
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,260
how fast you can

309
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,580
get His Majesty to send troops.

310
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:00,830
Yes.

311
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:08,750
Let's go.

312
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:12,780
Take me to meet those four distinguished guests.

313
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:14,740
General,

314
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,700
should you change clothes first?

315
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,540
No need.

316
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,510
If you want people to bow their heads,

317
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,610
clean clothes won't do it.

318
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,700
What matters is

319
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,540
whether our blade

320
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,370
is hard enough.

321
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,570
Later on, I worried

322
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:33,980
Di Lu's body might be found.

323
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,370
So I went back down to the cellar.

324
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,890
But the body was already gone.

325
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,260
Di Lu once told me

326
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:44,980
that even in death,

327
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,740
he wanted to die in a wine jar.

328
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:48,840
So later,

329
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,270
I dug up his body and burned it.

330
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,170
I put the ashes in a wine jar,

331
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,260
and buried it back in the cellar.

332
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,410
So...

333
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:00,570
you were wrong.

334
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,370
Di Lu called you a friend,

335
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,330
and he was right.

336
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,330
From here on,

337
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,890
how many more will you kill?

338
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,330
I don't know.

339
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,780
Maybe just one.

340
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,240
Maybe a lot more.

341
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:33,770
Just one?

342
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,130
Yan Fengshan?

343
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:45,810
Yes.

344
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,540
Can you kill him?

345
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:49,740
I can.

346
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,260
As long as he uses the travel pass

347
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,700
I wrote for him to enter the city,

348
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,020
he'll be tailed.

349
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:06,740
He'll walk into an ambush.

350
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,980
And he'll end up dead.

351
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:28,940
The travel pass

352
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,000
for General Fengshan

353
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,060
to enter the city

354
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,170
has already been sent out?

355
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,330
Yes.

356
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,250
Xie...

357
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,640
Huai...

358
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:58,980
An...

359
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,120
How far is the exit

360
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,160
in the southwest corner?

361
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:09,810
It is very close.

362
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:11,400
A hundred bu away.

363
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,330
But the moment we move,

364
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,650
they will notice us.

365
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:18,850
Think again.

366
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,500
There must be another way.

367
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,060
It is already a dead end.

368
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,960
We've run out of time.

369
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:41,980
No.

370
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,300
There must still be another way.

371
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,170
The window behind you

372
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,300
opens to the back street.

373
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,500
I'll go and draw the Huben away.

374
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:01,850
You leave from here.

375
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,610
I'll draw the Huben away.

376
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,220
As long as my head's still on my neck,

377
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,980
I'll figure out a way to save myself.

378
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,460
Why'd you make that Baiwenhu man

379
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,260
trick Gu Yu?

380
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,610
Because you know

381
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:21,500
there are things

382
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,850
only Gu Yu can settle.

383
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:23,780
Correct?

384
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,350
When it's your turn,

385
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,740
you start playing a fool.

386
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,610
Xie Huai'an, answer me.

387
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,740
With all your wit,

388
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,130
are you able to take

389
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,060
the Huben's fists,

390
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,170
or outrun their blades?

391
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,540
You've got to stay alive.

392
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,260
Only you can bring down the Huben.

393
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,900
If you really feel guilty,

394
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,930
then carry my death with you

395
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,610
and kill Yan Fengshan.

396
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,330
When you finally destroy the Huben,

397
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,740
that'll count as avenging me.

398
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,610
I've always been a scholar.

399
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,330
To die like a hero,

400
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,260
like a real man,

401
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,060
is worth it.

402
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,060
Ziling.

403
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:28,810
Wait a moment.

404
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,610
Give it one more moment.

405
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:38,330
Ziling.

406
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,460
Don't cry, Huai'an.

407
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,330
When the day comes that you succeed,

408
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,650
pour me a cup of victory wine.

409
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,410
That's enough.

410
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:57,600
Take care.

I'm right here.

I'm not hiding or running.

425
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,040
If you want me dead,

426
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,810
you'd better catch me first.

Stop him!

438
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,290
I'll run a hundred bu for you.

439
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,060
Within these hundred bu,

440
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,210
I won't be caught.

441
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,530
Think of this

442
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,610

Where is Xie Huai'an?

456
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,770
He is already out of Hidden Soldier Alley.

457
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,820
A trash picker

458
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,820
managed to fool me.

459
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,730
I'll admit that took some skill.

460
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,170
Tell me.

461
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,090
What was your real name?

462
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,900
I'll carve it on your gravestone.

463
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,460
Han Ziling.

464
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,460
The "ling" of soaring ambition.

465
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,770
Soaring ambition.

466
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:42,820
What a pity.

467
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,090
In the end,

468
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,250
you stank from head to toe,

469
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,610
and died in a gutter.

470
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,060
I've already walked the path I chose.

471
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,340
The deposed emperor is safe.

472
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,380
I'll tell him

473
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:18,460
there was someone this stubborn

474
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,210
who still thought of him.

475
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,130
