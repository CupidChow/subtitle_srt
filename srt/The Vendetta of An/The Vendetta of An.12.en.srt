1
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,840
ONE DAY AGO

2
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,040
Gu Yu was locked up
in Zuihua Tower at the market.

3
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,400
All this trash was hauled from over there.

4
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,120
Yeah.

5
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,960
The trash from Zuihua Tower
gets dumped here.

6
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,440
Say it again.

7
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,880
What exactly happened that day?

8
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,200
I saw it myself.

9
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,600
Wang Pu and his men chained up Gu Yu

10
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,080
and dragged him into Zuihua Tower.

11
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,440
Say it again.

12
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,240
Wang Pu and his men

13
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,920
chained up Gu Yu and dragged him

14
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,160
into Zuihua Tower like some stray dog.

15
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,800
Say it again.

16
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,840
Wang Pu had Gu Yu in chains.

17
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,400
Iron chains.

18
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,680
Two Huben men were dragging him along.

19
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,040
His legs wouldn't move at all.

20
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,920
His hands were gripping the chain
so tightly.

21
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,960
The wound on his neck
could be seen so clearly.

22
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,360
A wound on his neck?

23
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,080
Gu Yu was hurt.

24
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,960
There should've been bloody rags
in the trash.

25
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,400
Used ointments and medicine

26
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,320
would've given off a smell.

27
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,280
No.

28
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,960
-This isn't right.
-So

29
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,440
taking Gu Yu to Zuihua Tower
was nothing but a diversion.

30
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,000
What?

31
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,160
A diversion.

32
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,680
Huai'an,

33
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,200
I know where they're keeping Gu Yu.

34
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,360
It was that girl.

35
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,079
General, who are you thinking of?

36
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,120
Don't you think
she looks a little like you?

37
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,440
Day in, day out together,

38
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,680
have you started to see me differently?

39
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,400
Of course.

40
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,840
Your wounds are almost healed.

41
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,720
Let me take the bandage off.

42
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,800
It's getting late.

43
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,960
You should rest, General.

44
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,960
Yuan.

45
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,280
This is for you.

46
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,520
Thank you

47
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,560
for taking such thoughtful care of me
these past days.

48
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,600
But didn't you tell me

49
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,240
that you'd grant anything I asked?

50
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,920
I'll agree to anything you want.

51
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,320
But first, your blade

52
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,480
should be set aside.

53
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,360
Don't blame me.

54
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,000
Aren't you

55
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,240
hiding a blade too?

56
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,600
General.

57
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,560
It feels like a lifetime

58
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,240
since we last met.

59
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,800
When word came
that His Majesty had killed you,

60
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,760
I was the one who went to claim your body.

61
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,560
But the body wasn't yours.

62
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,920
Seeing you alive now isn't a surprise.

63
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,800
What surprises me is
that we'd meet again here.

64
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,640
White Hair,

65
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,440
it's been a long time.

66
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,840
You've been planning against the Huben
for quite a while, haven't you?

67
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,320
Tonight isn't the time to reminisce.

68
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,760
We need to think fast
and get you out of here.

69
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,800
I'm not leaving. Not yet.

70
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,720
Maybe it's been too long since you saw me.

71
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,560
Perhaps you've forgotten the way I work.

72
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,200
Maybe you forgot that I'm still a general.

73
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,480
So many of my soldiers were slaughtered.

74
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,680
I have to stay here.

75
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,320
An eye for an eye.

76
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,440
There must be vengeance.

77
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,440
You're going to help me.

78
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,120
Gu Yu.

79
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,040
Wumei killed the men guarding you.

80
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,200
From now until the bodies are found,
it's a day at most.

81
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,520
Yan Fengshan has shown up.

82
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,240
He's back in Chang'an.

83
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,280
He's got at most a day.

84
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,320
So you're going to use half a day

85
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,920
to help me plan a way to get revenge.

86
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,800
You can do it.

87
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,480
Mr. Wang Pu, we should pull back.

88
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,200
By now,

89
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,400
Wang Pu already knows.

90
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,280
What he doesn't know

91
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,600
is that the Baiwenhu
will strike back at the Huben.

92
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,520
General.

93
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,280
The Huben Army has started moving out.

94
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,480
We need to go.

95
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,320
Mr. Wang!

96
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,400
Mr. Wang!

97
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,960
What is it?

98
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,840
Please take a look at the market.

99
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,040
Gu Yu.

100
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,080
He really is a commander
you can't help but admire.

101
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,240
A life for a life.

102
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,680
And the one plotting for him
is a sharp mind too.

103
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,280
Let me think.

104
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,800
Mr. Wang,

105
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,200
I did the same job for seven years

106
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,040
prior to joining Hidden Soldier Alley.

107
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,440
Sorting things is second nature.

108
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,400
I'm quick to spot what's valuable.

109
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,840
There's always something
worth picking up wherever I look.

110
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,080
Digging clues out of trash.

111
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,000
They saved Gu Yu,
and even set a trap for me.

112
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,040
This garbage picker is the first one.

113
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,320
Di Lu?

114
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,280
He's been gone a long time.
He's probably dead.

115
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,440
Then, this grey-haired one is the second.

116
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,400
If he's the suspicious one,

117
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,120
that means…

118
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,080
The people you told me to check on

119
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,840
have all been tailed.

120
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,880
No issues.

121
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,280
But if you're not convinced,

122
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,160
I can just kill them all.

123
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,800
Questioning them one by one

124
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,560
is beyond my patience.

125
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,640
That old witch.

126
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,440
Aunt Xin can't be trusted either.

127
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,920
From here on,
every word I say must be kept in mind.

128
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,119
From West Third Alley
to West Fifth Alley, the whole area

129
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,720
must be sealed.

130
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,440
They'll try to break out there.

131
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:28,960
Understood.

132
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,200
Take more men.

133
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,680
To the alley entrances.

134
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,480
Keep an eye on that old witch.

135
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,480
Don't you dare fight her.

136
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,200
You may not win.

137
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,080
-Got that?
-Got it.

138
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,000
Move.

139
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,680
Search all of Hidden Soldier Alley

140
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,200
for Li Sangeng and Wang Xing.

141
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,640
Wang Xing's real name

142
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,400
is Xie Huai'an.

143
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,640
Understood.

144
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,960
You two, time to pull out.

145
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,760
The general ordered us
to keep you both safe.

146
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,040
It's time.

147
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,720
Once we're out,

148
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,800
you can become Han Ziling again.

149
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,160
Go!

150
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,200
Didn't expect the Huben
to react this fast.

151
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,480
No idea whether General Gu succeeded.

152
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,160
Most likely, he failed.

153
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,760
The Huben's movements now are too orderly.

154
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,760
Which means

155
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,080
their command center
hasn't fallen into chaos.

156
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,320
Wang Pu is still alive.

157
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,640
His counterattack is coming our way.

158
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,480
Move.

159
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,680
The way ahead is full of Huben.

160
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,880
All right. Go warn Gu Yu.

161
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,840
Tell him this ward wall is a trap.

162
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,000
They can't come here yet.

163
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,560
You all break out together.

164
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,480
You go. I'll stay.

165
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,400
No time to argue. Hurry!

166
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,000
Wait.

167
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,400
You need to tell Gu Yu

168
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,400
that we already made it out.

169
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,280
Only after we escaped

170
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,480
did the ward wall become surrounded.

171
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,520
-You get me?
-I do.

172
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,600
-Go!
-Protect the general!

173
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,520
Yes.

174
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,320
You two, I'm heading out.

175
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,880
Take care.

176
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,480
Thank you both for rescuing the general
for the Baiwenhu Army.

177
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,960
-Hold on.
-No time to waste.

178
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,360
Ziling.

179
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,840
Go.

180
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,040
With me here,

181
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,320
it doesn't matter how many more come.

182
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,640
I'll say it again.

183
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,320
With me here,

184
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,480
no number of men will make a difference.

185
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,040
General!

186
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,280
-General!
-General!

187
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,520
I, Gu Yu, thank you all

188
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,360
for avenging our fallen soldiers.

189
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,360
We can't stay here.

190
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,240
Let's head to the ward wall.

191
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,120
No!

192
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,680
General,

193
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,680
the planned extraction point is busted.

194
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,200
The Huben Army has it surrounded.

195
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,680
What about Xie Huai'an, Han Ziling,
and the others meant to receive us?

196
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,400
They've already made it out.

197
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,600
The Huben encirclement formed
after they escaped.

198
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,080
Mr. Xie Huai'an told me to inform you

199
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,720
so you don't fall into the trap.

200
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,520
Good. They're safe.

201
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,680
We have enough men to break through.

202
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,560
Let's move.

203
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,320
Break out from the west wall.

204
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,800
-Yes!
-Yes!

205
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,520
Search thoroughly.
Leave no stone unturned.

206
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,840
-Yes.
-Yes.

207
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,960
Head for the southwest corner
once we get out.

208
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,000
I pile the big trash over there.

209
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,280
Stack the wooden crates.

210
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,480
You can scale the wall.

211
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,080
This is the last chance.

212
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,720
This way.

213
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,760
Ready.

214
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,160
General, let's go.

215
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,080
We've gone in circles
and ended up back here.

216
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,120
Where it began is where it must end.

217
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,640
I figure Di Lu

218
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,160
wanted to drag us down with him.

219
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,320
But Di Lu isn't even here.

220
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,400
Right?

221
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,000
How many soldiers
can be mobilized from Chang'an?

222
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,360
A thousand.

223
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,440
Before entering Hidden Soldier Alley,

224
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,040
I ordered everyone to arm themselves.

225
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,120
They're ready to move.

226
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,720
You've seen how big
Hidden Soldier Alley is.

227
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,000
A thousand men are not enough
to smash through.

228
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,560
With this badge, you may enter the palace,

229
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,240
and see His Majesty.

230
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,680
Mobilize the Imperial
and Right Cavalry Guards

231
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:58,520
and encircle
Hidden Soldier Alley completely.

232
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:03,200
I want Xie Huai'an
and Han Ziling captured alive.

233
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,520
I know Huai'an's tricks all too well.

234
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,320
He always says those sentimental things,

235
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,680
letting others take the path to life,

236
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,600
while he walks

237
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,520
toward the dead end himself.

238
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,480
You

239
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,800
lied to me.

240
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,480
They haven't come out yet.

241
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,880
Please forgive me, General.

242
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,160
I blame no one.

243
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,400
I know I have to get out of there.

244
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,840
Tonight, in all of Chang'an,

245
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,880
there's something more important
than anyone's life or death.

246
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,240
But whether they live or die

247
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,320
depends on how fast you can

248
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,840
get His Majesty to send troops.

249
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,520
Yes.

250
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:09,920
Let's go.

251
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,080
Take me to meet those
four distinguished guests.

252
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,320
General,

253
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,160
should you change clothes first?

254
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,880
No need.

255
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,760
If you want heads to bow,

256
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,960
clean clothes won't do it.

257
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,040
What matters is

258
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,960
whether our blade

259
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,560
is hard enough.

260
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,320
Later on, I worried
Di Lu's body might be found.

261
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,600
So I went back down to the cellar.

262
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,280
But the body was already gone.

263
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,640
Di Lu once told me

264
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,240
that even in death,
he wanted to die in a wine jar.

265
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,360
So later,

266
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,920
I dug up his body and burned it.

267
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,600
I put the ashes in a wine jar,

268
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,640
and buried it back in the cellar.

269
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,720
So…

270
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,960
you were wrong.

271
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,680
Di Lu called you a friend,

272
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,440
and he was right.

273
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,640
From here on,

274
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,280
how many more must you kill?

275
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,640
I don't know.

276
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,120
Maybe just one.

277
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,200
Maybe a lot more.

278
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,400
Just one?

279
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,400
Yan Fengshan?

280
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,120
Yes.

281
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,760
Can you kill him?

282
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,000
I can.

283
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,080
As long as he uses the travel pass
I wrote for him to enter the city,

284
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,360
he'll be tailed.

285
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,040
He'll walk into an ambush.

286
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,360
And he'll end up dead.

287
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,280
‎TRAVEL PASS

288
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,440
The travel pass

289
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,360
for General Fengshan to enter the city

290
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,320
has already been sent out?

291
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,440
Yes.

292
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,640
Xie…

293
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,840
Huai…

294
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,160
An…

295
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,440
How far is the exit

296
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,480
in the southwest corner?

297
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,240
It is very close.

298
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,040
A hundred bu away.

299
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,920
But the moment we move,
they will notice us.

300
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,120
Think again.

301
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,640
There must be another way.

302
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,360
It is already a dead end.

303
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,320
We've run out of time.

304
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,320
No.

305
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,920
There must still be another way.

306
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,760
The window behind you

307
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,800
opens to the back street.

308
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,440
I'll go and draw the Huben away.

309
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,200
You leave from here.

310
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,000
I'll draw the Huben away.

311
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,640
As long as my head stays on my neck,

312
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,240
I'll figure out a way to save myself.

313
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,560
Why did you make that Baiwenhu man
trick Gu Yu?

314
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,920
Because you know

315
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,080
there are things only Gu Yu can settle.

316
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,040
Correct?

317
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,880
When it's your turn,
you start playing a fool.

318
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,920
Xie Huai'an, answer me.

319
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,920
With all your wit,

320
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,960
can you withstand the Huben's fists,
or outrun their blades?

321
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,960
You've got to stay alive.

322
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,520
Only you can bring down the Huben.

323
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,080
If you really feel guilty,

324
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,760
then carry my death with you
and kill Yan Fengshan.

325
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,600
When you finally destroy the Huben,

326
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,080
that'll count as avenging me.

327
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,920
I've always been a scholar.

328
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,520
To die like a hero, like a real man,

329
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,360
is worth it.

330
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,360
Ziling.

331
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,120
Wait a moment.

332
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,920
Give it one more moment.

333
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,720
Ziling.

334
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,800
Don't cry, Huai'an.

335
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,680
When the day comes that you succeed,

336
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,040
pour me a cup of victory wine.

337
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,800
That's enough.

338
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,120
Take care.

339
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,280
Come on!

340
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,159
I'm right here.

341
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,320
I'm not hiding or running.

342
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,480
If you want me dead,

343
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:51,400
come catch me yourself.

344
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,280
After him!

345
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Stop him!

346
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,680
I'll run 100 bu for you.

347
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,400
Within these 100 bu, I won't be caught.

348
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,800
Think of this

349
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,120
as me seeing you off.

350
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,320
Where is Xie Huai'an?

351
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,840
He is already out of Hidden Soldier Alley.

352
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,160
A mere trash picker

353
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,320
managed to fool me.

354
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,800
I'll admit that took some skill.

355
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,520
Tell me.

356
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,600
What was your real name?

357
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,040
I'll carve it on your gravestone.

358
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,800
Han Ziling.

359
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,440
The ling of soaring ambition.

360
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,120
Soaring ambition.

361
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,040
What a pity.

362
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,400
In the end,

363
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,520
you stank from head to toe,

364
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,760
and died in the gutter.

365
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,160
I've already walked the path I chose.

366
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,680
The deposed emperor is safe.

367
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,760
I'll tell him

368
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,920
there was someone this stubborn

369
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,760
who still thought of him.

370
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,440
Your letter

371
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,840
will reach him, without fail.
