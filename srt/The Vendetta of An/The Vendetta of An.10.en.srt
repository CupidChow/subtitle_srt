1
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,800
BEFORE XIE HUAI'AN ENTERS CHANG'AN

2
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,160
I have lost.

3
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,280
Then please, Han,

4
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,080
return the way you came as we agreed.

5
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,160
On this matter,

6
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,440
forgive me, but I must go back on my word.

7
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,960
Do you know why His Majesty
has summoned you?

8
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,000
Yes,

9
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,560
and that's exactly why

10
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,760
I must go.

11
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,960
If you wish to save Xiao Wenjing,

12
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,080
you should not go.

13
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,680
If you do not believe me,

14
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,280
let's wager once more.

15
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,800
I will find someone
and disguise him as you

16
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,680
to meet the Emperor in your place.

17
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,280
If he dies, I win,

18
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,240
and you will do one thing for me.

19
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,400
But how will that man

20
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,320
know what I am supposed to say?

21
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,640
He won't need to say anything,

22
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,800
because the Emperor won't ask.

23
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,040
The moment Han Ziling meets the Emperor

24
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,840
will already be the time of his death.

25
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,960
FLATBREAD WITH SOUP

26
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,520
How did you know

27
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,640
I would die after seeing His Majesty?

28
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,040
Because I knew
what His Majesty intended to do,

29
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,440
and I knew

30
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,560
you were recommended by Gu Yu.

31
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,720
General Gu has always been loyal.

32
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,120
Did His Majesty suspect him of treachery?

33
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,000
His Majesty knew

34
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,040
Gu Yu was a good man.

35
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,280
And for that very reason,

36
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,680
he knew anyone Gu Yu recommended

37
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,000
would never harm the deposed emperor.

38
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,040
Killing you

39
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,560
was to warn Gu Yu

40
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,960
not to interfere.

41
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,760
Better to settle it early

42
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,920
than fall out
with the Gu family afterward.

43
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,680
Who was the man dying in my place?

44
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,600
A wanted criminal.

45
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,000
I promised to give his family

46
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,200
1,000 liang of gold
if he agreed to do this.

47
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,560
So it seems, Xie,

48
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,160
you are not a good man.

49
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,080
A good man can help neither you

50
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,800
nor the one you wish to save.

51
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,880
What do you want me to do?

52
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,600
Infiltrate a place for me.

53
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,760
Hidden Soldier Alley.

54
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,120
-Dump it in the back.
-All right.

55
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,080
I also prepared a gift for you.

56
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,040
You'll like it.

57
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,400
I am sorry, Di.

58
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,960
I must rescue Gu Yu.

59
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,280
WINE

60
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,000
He kept staring at me just now.

61
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,840
He just realized
you and I were working together.

62
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,280
He checked my travel passes and wounds,

63
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,360
but our planning

64
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,560
left him with no reason to suspect me.

65
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,440
He truly took you as a friend.

66
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,840
Yet I was your undercover agent.

67
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,000
Because of an accident,

68
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,120
his death became inevitable.

69
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,680
Scheming…

70
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,200
Both you and I know how to do it.

71
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,600
But in the end,

72
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,600
it is still a blade going in white

73
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,720
and coming out red.

74
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,320
But you did nothing wrong.

75
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,040
If you had hesitated,

76
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,760
the ones buried underground

77
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,960
would be you and me.

78
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,360
I know.

79
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,440
Whether I liked him had little to do
with whether I should kill him.

80
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,640
In the end,

81
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,480
people only kill to save themselves.

82
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,760
Di Lu
was well-liked in Hidden Soldier Alley.

83
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,640
His death won't stay hidden for long.

84
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,680
We need to match our accounts.

85
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,880
This house faces north and is always damp.

86
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,080
The smell of wine will
linger for more than ten days.

87
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,160
It can cover the smell
of the corpse for a while.

88
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,960
Invited by Di Lu,

89
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,520
you and I went to try
his homemade pine needle wine.

90
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,360
We entered his home
in the first half of the Xu hour.

91
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,920
We drank, talked, and enjoyed ourselves.

92
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,600
We even got a bit carried away

93
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,320
and accidentally knocked over a few jars.

94
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,560
We left before the Hai hour.

95
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,440
After returning home,

96
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,760
you had a hangover headache
and stayed in bed,

97
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,400
while I was busy writing travel passes.

98
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,240
When we saw each other again,

99
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,080
two or three days had passed.

100
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,960
And from that day on,
neither of us ever saw Di Lu again.

101
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
Who is it?

102
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,120
Me, Li Sangeng.

103
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,880
What is it?

104
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,720
Mr. Li Mingtai needs a travel pass,

105
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,600
but he is ill and bedridden,

106
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,080
so he sent me on his behalf.

107
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,520
Please prepare a travel pass for him.

108
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,840
It's a hot day. Come in for some tea.

109
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,880
Everyone, take a break.

110
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,760
-All right.
-All right.

111
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,200
Li Mingtai is bedridden?

112
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,200
Was that your doing?

113
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,760
I needed a proper excuse to visit you,

114
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,440
so I treated him to
some questionable buns.

115
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,240
These past few days, I walked every lane.

116
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,760
So far, I've heard no talk of Di Lu.

117
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,800
He often took commissions
and disappeared for days.

118
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,600
A short absence may not raise suspicion.

119
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,040
A few more days and the lie won't hold.

120
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,200
Tell me, what have you learned?

121
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,800
Before I came, you told me

122
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,160
Hidden Soldier Alley was a concept,

123
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,040
not just a single alley.

124
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,080
So after I entered the alley,

125
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,640
the first thing I did
was confirm its full layout.

126
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,160
Here in Yanzuo Ward,

127
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,160
from south to north is 450 bu,

128
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,440
and from west to east is 650 bu.

129
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,240
Within this entire area,

130
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,400
everything except the outermost ring

131
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,800
is Hidden Soldier Alley.

132
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,480
The outermost ring

133
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,600
is where common people live,

134
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,320
meaning it offers the best cover.

135
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,480
And in danger,

136
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,480
the best hostages.

137
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,880
Now look at the row houses
on the west side.

138
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,560
They look densely packed,

139
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,840
but they produce
very little trash each day.

140
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,800
That means the fewest soldiers
are hidden there,

141
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,480
and the defense is thinnest.

142
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,680
So where are the troops kept?

143
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,160
The northwest and the southeast.

144
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,920
Both areas have many soldiers.

145
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,760
Avoid them when you move.

146
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,160
Even on ordinary days,
go around them if you can.

147
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,360
Any leads

148
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,960
on Gu Yu?

149
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,000
None needed.

150
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,040
Almost everyone knows where he is.

151
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,960
Capturing Gu Yu

152
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,960
is quite a feat for Wang Pu.

153
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,200
That night, I saw it with my own eyes.

154
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,440
Wang Pu, with two Huben guards,
dragged Gu Yu

155
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,600
through the streets and alleys

156
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,320
into the Zuihua Tower by the market.

157
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,920
What is it?

158
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,360
Do you know General Gu personally?

159
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,280
For me, my family, and the realm,

160
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,000
Gu Yu

161
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,720
is someone I can't afford to lose.

162
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,440
I want to take a look

163
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,640
around the Zuihua Tower by the market.

164
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,440
Deliver Li Mingtai's travel pass yourself.

165
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,160
He lives in one of the row houses
on the second floor.

166
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,240
When the window opens, it faces

167
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,360
directly toward
the Zuihua Tower by the market.

168
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,200
Why else
do you think I treated him to those buns?

169
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,680
Who is it?

170
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,920
Wang Xing. I've brought your travel pass.

171
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,040
I feel terrible and can't get out of bed.

172
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,520
Slide it through the door.

173
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,160
TRAVEL PASS

174
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,120
Thank you.

175
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,440
You are welcome.

176
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,200
ZUIHUA TOWER

177
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,640
General, please wipe your face.

178
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,840
What is it, General?

179
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,120
Have I done something wrong?

180
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,520
How many people did Wang Pu pass over

181
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,480
before choosing you?

182
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,040
As far as I know,

183
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,320
around 30 people.

184
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,680
General, look at me.

185
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,520
Do I resemble your former attendant?

186
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,760
Former?

187
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,400
I am your attendant now,

188
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,160
and I will remain so.

189
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,920
You may be staying here
for quite some time.

190
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,280
As for the girl named Wumei,

191
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,960
she belongs to your past.

192
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,800
Mr. Wang Pu said

193
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,440
he wanted you to feel at home.

194
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,520
Is that so?

195
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,960
Wumei always did whatever I asked.

196
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,000
I can do that too,

197
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,200
perhaps even better.

198
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,480
Aside from

199
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:28,760
letting you leave this place,

200
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,400
I can do whatever else

201
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,600
you need.

202
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,880
Then bring me a small carving knife

203
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,520
and a piece
of white camphor wood I can carve.

204
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,840
If I am really going to stay here
for a long time,

205
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,720
I need something

206
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,200
to pass the time.

207
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,920
You said you would do whatever I asked.

208
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,000
Surely

209
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,720
a simple carving knife
isn't beyond your reach, is it?

210
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,080
Of course not.

211
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,640
Go, then.

212
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,240
What did you get out of him?

213
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,960
He wouldn't say a word.

214
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,760
The Baiwenhu Army is well-trained.

215
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,560
It is hard to make them betray each other.

216
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,240
Open it.

217
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,280
How many of you came in?

218
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,720
Say one name,

219
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,960
and you can trade his life for yours.

220
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,080
You'll walk free,
and he'll suffer in your place.

221
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,880
Then again,

222
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,680
you are like brothers.

223
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,720
How could you betray one another?

224
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,480
How about this?

225
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,360
Say one name,

226
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,200
and both you and he walk free.

227
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,560
What do you say?

228
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,440
Your partners are on my turf.

229
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,880
Sooner or later, I'll find them.

230
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,320
But if I can help save one, I will.

231
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,400
I, Wang Pu,

232
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,560
am a man of my word.

233
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,040
Is my offer not good enough?

234
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,920
Not even one word?

235
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,520
How impolite.

236
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,280
So you are not mute after all.

237
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,120
The regional commanders
are entering the Capital.

238
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,400
I must go pay them a visit.

239
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,120
There must still be

240
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,040
some of their men
hidden in Hidden Soldier Alley.

241
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,720
To save Gu Yu,

242
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,560
they will try anything.

243
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,160
Watch

244
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,640
everything closely.

245
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,840
Yes, sir.

246
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,720
Covering your face
only makes you more suspicious.

247
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,800
Could you endure this work
without covering your face?

248
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,040
Thank you for putting up with all this.

249
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,920
A Baiwenhu soldier
was just burned to death.

250
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,320
He must have come to rescue Gu Yu.

251
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,040
The Baiwenhu soldiers who slipped in
have been exposed?

252
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,800
If you can reach the remaining ones,

253
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,200
tell them to be very careful.

254
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,720
Also,

255
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,000
you and I must be careful too.

256
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,280
-Take care.
-Take care.

257
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,280
This thing is fine, isn't it?

258
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,200
A couple of days ago,

259
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,000
Di Lu came to ask me for a few of these.

260
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,880
He said he'd had
a misunderstanding with the new guy

261
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,240
and wanted to
give him these as an apology.

262
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,520
Then he vanished.

263
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,480
You were the last person to see him.

264
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,440
Tell me,

265
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,360
where did he go?

266
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,440
He's dead.

267
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,440
His body

268
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,200
is buried under the wine jars
in his house.

269
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,800
White Hair,

270
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,880
if you hadn't dyed your hair white,

271
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,000
I wouldn't have recognized you.

272
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,240
Since you know who I am,

273
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,480
you should know

274
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,080
I am here for revenge.

275
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,760
No one who deserves death

276
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,360
will escape me.

277
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,200
Aren't you afraid
you'll fall into my hands?

278
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,640
I won't spare you either.

279
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,640
Of course I'm not afraid.

280
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,640
There's someone locked up

281
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,640
in the Imperial Guard prison.

282
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,600
I wonder how he is now.

283
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,920
Before I came here,

284
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,120
I took

285
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,320
a gold coin from him.

286
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,440
To the Huben Army,

287
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,600
Qingyi is nothing
more than an expendable pawn.

288
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,920
And expendable pawns

289
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,280
should be tossed away,

290
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,920
just like Liu Ziyan.

291
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,640
But to me, he is still useful.

292
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,800
If nothing happens to me,
nothing will happen to him.

293
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,280
If something happens to me,

294
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,240
he won't even have a body left to bury.

295
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,880
His fate

296
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,000
is in your hands.

297
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,640
Yes, he's my disciple.

298
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,560
So what?

299
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,520
The rules of the Huben Army

300
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,560
come above all else.

301
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,520
You are right about that.

302
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,120
But if you truly believed that,

303
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,680
you would have reported me to Wang Pu

304
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,040
the moment you sensed something was wrong,

305
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,200
instead of waiting here,

306
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,880
fearing I had a plan.

307
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,840
Rules are rigid. People are flexible.

308
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,480
I know the bond between you and Qingyi

309
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,320
goes beyond master and disciple.

310
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,320
Many years ago,

311
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,120
your only child died young.

312
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,720
A few years later,

313
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,480
you found Qingyi

314
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,800
eating offerings at your child's grave,

315
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,680
and you took him in
as a gift sent from above.

316
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,840
You don't want

317
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:51,960
your second child
to die like this, do you?

318
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,880
All you need to do is keep silent

319
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,080
and let me stay hidden
in Hidden Soldier Alley.

320
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,720
Once I leave,

321
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,800
your second child

322
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,680
will return to you unharmed.

323
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,400
He once schemed against you,

324
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,080
and he has done his share
of deeds for the Huben Army.

325
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,000
Will you really spare him?

326
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,800
I will leave no enemy alive.

327
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,600
But I still have

328
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,160
some humanity left.

329
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,680
Aunt Xin.

330
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,320
You were one of my father's
earliest subordinates.

331
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,280
I still remember that bond.

332
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,440
All right.

333
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,400
You should go.

334
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:35,880
You don't want your second child
to die like this, do you?

335
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,240
All you need to do is keep silent

336
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,400
and let me stay
hidden in Hidden Soldier Alley.

337
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,960
Once I leave,

338
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,120
your second child

339
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,800
will return to you unharmed.

340
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,160
GRAVE OF LIU ZIQI, BELOVED SON

341
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,480
Beat me or scold me,
but let me finish eating.

342
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,760
I come up the mountain every three days

343
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,040
to leave some flatbread and fruit here.

344
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,760
You can come eat.

345
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,400
Who is he to you?

346
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,440
He was my child.

347
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,400
When he passed, he was about your age.

348
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,440
Can you teach me how to survive?

349
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,720
I can't eat grave offerings forever.

350
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,480
All I know is how to kill.

351
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,920
This path leads nowhere good.

352
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,640
I killed the leader of the opera troupe
and escaped.

353
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,000
I'm already on this path.

354
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,280
I never dare walk past this place
too fast,

355
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,160
afraid you'll mistake me for an assassin

356
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,360
and kill me.

357
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,520
I rarely strike without reason.

358
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,480
That is true.

359
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,080
Have you found Di Lu?

360
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,320
No.

361
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,240
I checked everyone you told me

362
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,240
to look into.

363
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,760
Nothing seemed off.

364
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,120
If you still don't trust them,

365
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,000
I can kill them all.

366
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,800
I don't have the patience

367
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,400
to question every one of them.

368
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,920
Don't kill them.

369
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,000
We need every man we have right now.

370
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,080
I'm going away for two days

371
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,360
to take care

372
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,880
of something important.

373
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,080
Do what you must.

374
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,320
It's chilly at night.

375
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,080
Keep yourself warm.

376
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,199
Hey.

377
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,360
Are you all right?

378
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:37,000
Ungrateful mutt, you're courting death!

379
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,080
Don't run!

380
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,440
Can you stop chasing me?

381
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,080
Stop running! Stand still!

382
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,320
This is bad.

383
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,160
Don't run!

384
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,720
Stop right there!

385
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,080
Got you.

386
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,680
So you made me eat like a dog, huh?

387
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,720
And you thought you could outrun me?

388
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,120
Which one of us looks more like a dog now?

389
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,560
I didn't want to kill anyone.

390
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,560
I'll ask you one last time.

391
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,720
Do you have to go

392
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,600
-into Hidden Soldier Alley?
-Yes.

393
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,960
Is the Huben Army

394
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,400
really worth all this?

395
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,080
I have to die.

396
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,160
If you go in,

397
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,640
my master dies.

398
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,280
I was sent to the north

399
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,800
and stayed there for three years.

400
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,360
I have a wife

401
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,600
and a six-year-old daughter.

402
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,240
The neighbors all thought
the man of the house had died.

403
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,080
A rogue at the alley entrance

404
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,480
set his sights on my wife.

405
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,960
I have to go back and kill him myself.

406
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,480
At the entrance
of Wazi Alley in Guiyi Ward,

407
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,240
there's a breakfast stall.

408
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,560
My wife

409
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,680
often wears a worn-out purple robe.

410
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,560
Go see for yourself.

411
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,720
Your courtyard is quiet today.

412
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,720
Sit.

413
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,880
In the next few days,

414
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,040
I need to issue
confidential travel passes.

415
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,960
Wang Pu sent word

416
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,880
to keep the handlers to a minimum,

417
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,280
so I sent my helpers home.

418
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,760
So it seems you are no longer suspected.

419
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,800
Right.

420
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,240
What are they treating
as such a grave matter?

421
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,200
PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION

422
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,560
"Height six chi."

423
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,960
"Square forehead, broad face,
a nose rising straight to the brow,

424
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,120
and long hanging earlobes."

425
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,720
"From Binning to Chang'an."

426
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,960
Is this describing

427
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,760
Yan…
