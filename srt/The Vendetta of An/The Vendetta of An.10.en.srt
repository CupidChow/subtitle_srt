[The Vendetta of An]

00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,020
[Before Xie Huai'an enters Chang'an]

3
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,820
I have lost.

4
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,100
Then please, Han,

5
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,570
return the way you came

6
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,820
as we agreed.

7
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,980
On this matter,

8
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,500
forgive me,

9
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,130
but I must go back on my word.

10
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,750
Do you know why His Majesty

11
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,500
has summoned you?

12
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:16,820
Yes,

13
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,170
and that's exactly why

14
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,570
I must go.

15
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,660
If you wish to save Xiao Wenjing,

16
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,500
you should not go.

17
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,260
If you do not believe me,

18
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,940
let's wager once more.

19
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,410
I will find someone

20
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,850
and disguise him as you

21
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,410
to meet the Emperor in your place.

22
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,500
If he dies,

23
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,850
I win,

24
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,940
and you will

25
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:43,730
do one thing for me.

26
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,010
But how will that man

27
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,100
know what I am supposed to say?

28
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,260
He won't need to say anything,

29
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,570
because the Emperor won't ask.

30
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,540
The moment Han Ziling meets the Emperor

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,570
will already be the time of his death.

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,100
How did you know

33
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,360
[Flatbread with Soup]

34
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,500
I would die after seeing

35
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,410
His Majesty?

36
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,010
Because I knew

37
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,780
what His Majesty intended to do,

38
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,060
and I knew

39
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,220
you were recommended by Gu Yu.

40
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,380
General Gu has always been loyal.

41
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,060
Did His Majesty suspect him of treachery?

42
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,540
His Majesty knew

43
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,690
Gu Yu was a good man.

44
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,890
And for that very reason,

45
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,500
he knew anyone Gu Yu recommended

46
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,570
would never harm

47
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,940
the deposed emperor.

48
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,820
Killing you

49
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,220
was to warn Gu Yu

50
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,750
not to interfere.

51
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,540
Better

52
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,380
to settle it early

53
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,780
than fall out

54
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,610
with the Gu family afterward.

55
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,060
Who was the man dying

56
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,340
in my place?

57
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,340
A wanted criminal.

58
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,650
I promised to give his family

59
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,900
1,000 liang

60
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,740
of gold

61
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,900
if he agreed to do this.

62
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,180
So it seems,

63
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,860
Xie,

64
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,860
you are not a good man.

65
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,890
A good man can help neither you

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,620
nor the one you wish to save.

67
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,810
What do you want me to do?

68
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,450
Infiltrate a place for me.

69
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,420
Hidden Soldier Alley.

70
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,300
Dump it in the back.

71
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:07,890
All right.

[Episode 10]

73
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,860
I also prepared a gift for you.

74
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,010
You'll like it.

75
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,370
I am sorry, Di.

76
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,810
I must rescue Gu Yu.

77
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,890
He kept staring at me just now.

78
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,980
He just realized

79
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,690
you and I were working together.

80
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,010
He checked my travel passes and wounds,

81
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,370
but our planning

82
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,450
left him with no reason to suspect me.

83
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,220
He truly took you as a friend.

84
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,570
Yet I was your undercover agent.

85
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,780
Because of an accident,

86
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,490
his death

87
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,100
became inevitable.

88
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,540
Scheming...

89
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:05,980
Both you and I

90
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,220
know how to do it.

91
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,420
But in the end,

92
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,420
it is still a blade going in white

93
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,620
and coming out red.

94
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,180
But you did nothing wrong.

95
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,980
If you had hesitated,

96
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,660
the ones buried underground

97
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,740
would be you and me.

98
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,060
I know.

99
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,930
Whether I liked him had little to do

100
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,180
with whether I should kill him.

101
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,490
In the end,

102
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,980
people only kill to save themselves.

103
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:43,780
Di Lu

104
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,570
was well-liked in Hidden Soldier Alley.

105
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,540
His death won't stay hidden for long.

106
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,490
We need to match our accounts.

107
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,330
This house faces north

108
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,100
and is always damp.

109
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,810
The smell of wine will linger for more than ten days.

110
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,370
It can cover

111
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,810
the smell of the body for a while.

112
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,810
Invited by Di Lu,

113
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,490
you and I went to try

114
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:19,490
his homemade pine needle wine.

115
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,060
We entered his home in the first half of the Xu hour.

116
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,010
We drank, chatted, and enjoyed each other's company.

117
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,540
We even grew a bit carried away

118
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,250
and accidentally knocked over a few jars.

119
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,450
We left before the Hai hour.

120
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,300
After returning home,

121
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,900
you had a hangover headache

122
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,850
and stayed in bed,

123
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,450
while I was busy

124
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,300
writing travel passes.

125
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:37,930
When we saw each other again,

126
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,930
it was already two or three days later.

127
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,420
And from that day on,

128
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,850
neither of us ever saw Di Lu again.

129
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,300
Who is it?

130
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:34,900
Me,

131
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,850
Li Sangeng.

132
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,730
What is it?

133
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,210
Mr. Li Mingtai

134
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,450
needs a travel pass,

135
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,500
but he is ill and bedridden,

136
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,780
so he sent me on his behalf.

137
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,780
Please prepare a travel pass for him.

138
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,450
It's a hot day.

139
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,730
Come in for some tea.

140
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:04,850
Everyone,

141
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:05,780
take a break.

142
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,030
- All right. - All right.

143
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:08,450
All right.

144
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,060
Li Mingtai is bedridden?

145
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:23,930
Was that your doing?

146
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,480
I needed

147
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,610
a proper excuse to visit you,

148
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,090
so I treated him to some questionable buns.

149
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,850
These past few days, I walked every lane.

150
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,420
So far, I've heard no talk of Di Lu.

151
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,500
He had gone out on assignment before.

152
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,690
A short absence

153
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,380
may not raise suspicion.

154
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,810
But give it a few more days, and it won't hold.

155
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:49,500
Tell me,

156
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,850
what have you learned?

157
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,380
Before I came,

158
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,730
you told me

159
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,850
Hidden Soldier Alley was a concept,

160
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,780
not just a single alley.

161
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,020
So after I entered the alley,

162
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,970
the first thing I did

163
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,080
was confirm

164
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,540
its full layout.

165
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,300
Here in Yanzuo Ward,

166
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,090
from south to north is 450 bu,

167
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:18,380
and from west to east is 650 bu.

168
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:19,900
Within this entire area,

169
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,060
everything except the outermost ring

170
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,450
is Hidden Soldier Alley.

171
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,300
The outermost ring

172
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,300
is where common people live,

173
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,210
meaning

174
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,140
it offers the best cover.

175
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,020
And in danger,

176
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,140
the best hostages.

177
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,850
Now look at the row houses on the west side.

178
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,260
They look densely packed,

179
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,660
but they produce very little trash each day.

180
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,660
That means the fewest soldiers are hidden there,

181
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,300
and the defense is thinnest.

182
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,660
So where are the troops kept?

183
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,930
The northwest

184
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,260
and the southeast.

185
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,210
Both areas

186
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:56,570
have many soldiers.

187
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,780
Avoid them when you move.

188
00:12:59,240 --> 00:12:59,970
Even on ordinary days,

189
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,210
go around them if you can.

190
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,260
Any leads

191
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,690
on Gu Yu?

192
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,660
None needed.

193
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,780
Almost everyone knows where he is.

194
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,780
Capturing Gu Yu

Qingyi

356
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,740
is nothing more than an expendable pawn.

357
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,740
And expendable pawns

358
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,980
should be tossed away,

359
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,460
just like Liu Ziyan.

360
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,850
But to me,

361
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,570
he is still useful.

362
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,570
If nothing happens to me, nothing happens to him.

If something happens to me,

364
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,850

00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,540
Yes, he's my disciple.

368
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,460
So what?

369

The rules of the Huben Army

come above all else!

371
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,220
You are right about that.

372
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,490
But if you truly believed that,

373
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,460
you would have reported me

374
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,410
to Wang Pu

375
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,850

People are flexible.

381
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,410
I know the bond between you and Qingyi

382
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,130
goes beyond master and disciple.

383
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,170
Many years ago,

00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,460
A few years later,

386
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,170
you found Qingyi

387
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,650
eating offerings at your child's grave,

388
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:43,700
and you took him in as a gift sent from above.

389
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,570
You don't want

390
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,770
your second child

391
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,780
to die like this, do you?

392
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,370
All you need to do is keep silent

393
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,740
and let me stay hidden in Hidden Soldier Alley.

394
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,460
Once I leave,

395
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,890
your second child

396
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,700
will return to you unharmed.

397
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:10,870
He schemed against you,

398
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:15,370
and he has done his share of deeds for the Huben Army.

399
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,650
Will you really spare him?

400
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,540
I will leave no enemy alive.

401
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,460
But I still have

402
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:29,090
some humanity left.

403
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,460
Aunt Xin.

404
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,850
You were one of my father's

405
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,330
earliest subordinates.

406
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,650
I still

407
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,130
remember that bond.

408
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,060
All right.

409
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,460
You should go.

410
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,560
You don't want your second child

411
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,280
to die like this, do you?

412
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:37,130
All you need to do is keep silent

413
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:40,190
and let me stay hidden in Hidden Soldier Alley.

414
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,740
Once I leave,

415
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,170
your second child

416
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,940
will return to you unharmed.

417
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:13,260
[Grave of Liu Ziqi, beloved son]

418
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,300
Beat me or scold me if you want,

419
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:22,540
but let me finish eating first.

420
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,610
I come up the mountain every three days

421
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,060
to leave some flatbread and fruit here.

422
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:35,410
You can come eat.

423
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,260
Who is he to you?

424
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,260
He was my child.

425
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,890
When he passed, he was about your age.

426
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,260
Can you teach me how to survive?

427
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,500
I can't eat grave offerings forever.

428
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,300
All I know is how to kill.

429
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,980
This path will bring you no good.

430
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,850
I killed the members of my opera troupe

431
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:12,460
and escaped.

432
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,810
I'm already on this path.

433
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:57,890
I never dare walk past this place

434
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,020
too fast,

435
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,940
afraid you'll mistake me for an assassin

436
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,130
and kill me.

437
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,170
I rarely strike without reason.

438
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,260
That is true.

439
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,060
Have you found Di Lu?

440
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,260
No.

441
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,020
I checked everyone you told me

442
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:21,850
to look into.

443
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,570
Nothing seemed off.

444
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,020
If you still don't trust them,

445
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,650
I can kill them all.

446
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,610
I don't have the patience

447
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,500
to question every one of them.

448
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:41,500
Don't kill them.

449
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:44,130
We need every man we have right now.

450
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,890
I'm going away for two days

451
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,260
to take care

452
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,500
of something important.

453
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:58,540
Do what you must.

454
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:02,980
It's chilly at night.

455
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,890
Keep yourself warm.

456
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:09,500
Hey!

457
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:10,980
Are you all right?

458
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,690
Ungrateful mutt,

459
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,130
you're courting death!

460
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:08,900
Don't run!

461
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,340
Can you stop chasing me?

462
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,940
Stop running! Stand still!

463
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,130
This is bad.

464
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:36,900
Don't run!

465
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,990
Stop right there!

466
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:43,940
Got you!

467
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,460
So you made me eat like a dog, huh?

468
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,570
Thought you could outrun me?

469
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:06,340
Which one of us looks more like a dog now?

470
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,610
I didn't want to kill anyone.

471
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,340
I'll ask you one last time.

472
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,210
Do you have to go

473
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,980
into Hidden Soldier Alley?

474
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,460
Yes!

475
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:32,860
Is the Huben Army

476
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,210
really worth all this?

477
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,160
If I don't go in, I will die!

478
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:38,980
If you go in,

479
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,380
my master dies.

480
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:42,940
I was sent to the north

481
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,820
and stayed there for three years.

482
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,380
I have a wife

483
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,340
and a six-year-old daughter.

484
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:51,060
The neighbors all thought the man of the house had died.

485
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,730
A rogue at the alley entrance

486
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,210
set his sights on my wife.

487
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,130
I have to go back and kill him myself.

488
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,290
At the entrance of Wazi Alley in Guiyi Ward,

489
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,860
there's a breakfast stall.

490
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,210
My wife

491
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,030
often wears

492
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:14,500
a worn-out purple robe.

493
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,380
Go see for yourself.

494
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,130
Your courtyard

495
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:38,860
is quiet today.

496
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,280

497

In the next few days,

498
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,170
I need to issue confidential travel passes.

499
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,940
Wang Pu sent word

500
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,770
to keep the handlers to a minimum,

501
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,250
so I sent my helpers home.

502
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:00,900
So it seems

503
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,540
you are no longer suspected.

504
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:04,730
Right.

505
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,340
What are they treating

506
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,250
as such a big deal?
