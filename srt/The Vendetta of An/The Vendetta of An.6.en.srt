1
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,680
XUE PAVILION

2
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,560
It's ready.

3
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,400
Made with what we procured, is it?

4
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,000
It's made with the gold we procured.

5
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,560
I watched him the whole time.

6
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,400
Second Master, four cun, as ordered.

7
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,960
It'll be easy for a child to handle.

8
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,360
However, Young Master is still very young.

9
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,320
Should we give him something this sharp?

10
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,680
Why not?

11
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,760
I was already
slaughtering sheep when I was his age.

12
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,840
The young master of the Huben Army
will lead the army in the future.

13
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,320
He has to prove himself capable.

14
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,919
Don't tell my brother.

15
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,320
-Huai'an!
-Huai'an!

16
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,200
-Huai'an!
-Huai'an!

17
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,200
Regarding this matter,

18
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,160
I can only

19
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,720
rely on you.

20
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,920
All right.

21
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,000
I'll do it on your behalf.

22
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,600
You must hang in there.

23
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,000
Please hang in there.

24
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,840
Huai'an.

25
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,160
Please hang in there!

26
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,720
Huai'an?

27
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,880
-Huai'an.
-Xie Huai'an.

28
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,240
-Huai'an.
-Hang in there.

29
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,320
Where is the physician?

30
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,240
Xiaoqing's gone to notify him.
He'll be here soon.

31
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,240
Why did she go to notify him?

32
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,320
Just bring him here!

33
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,720
Huai'an?

34
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,720
Brother.

35
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,000
Hurry!

36
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,720
Prepare the anti-bleeding decoction.

37
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,240
I'll pull out the sword.

38
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,520
You, help me stop the bleeding.

39
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,640
Okay.

40
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,800
Can you do this?

41
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,440
I cannot.

42
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,720
Go away.

43
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,480
Don't stare at me. If he can't do it,

44
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,800
-I can't do it.
-Useless fools.

45
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,800
I'll do it.

46
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,160
He'll bleed a lot.

47
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,120
I'm not afraid.

48
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,120
Hang in there.

49
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,360
I rushed here upon hearing
that Mr. Xie was attacked.

50
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,200
What's the current situation?

51
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,280
How is Mr. Xie doing?

52
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,040
Guys,

53
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,680
why are you all keeping quiet?

54
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,440
Please tell me something.

55
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,400
This…

56
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,280
You want me to head back?

57
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,640
I…

58
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,720
How am I supposed to report back?

59
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,040
It's all my fault.

60
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,520
This wouldn't have happened

61
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,440
had I not failed
to deliver the letter back then.

62
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,520
I was at the entrance just now.
I didn't dare to enter.

63
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,320
I was afraid that he might…

64
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,440
In his letter, he stated

65
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,600
that he would spend the rest of his life

66
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,400
avenging his family.

67
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,160
He was ready for a life like this.

68
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,800
He won't blame anyone

69
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,880
even if he dies in the process.

70
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,200
Don't be afraid.

71
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,920
Huai'an won't fall yet.

72
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,560
Young Master!

73
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,640
The Young Master is here.

74
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,480
Young Master.

75
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,560
Uncle!

76
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,760
Uncle! Father is still alive!

77
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,200
Hurry and find a physician!

78
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,040
Father. Please don't die.

79
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,600
Father!

80
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,680
Don't leave me!

81
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,120
Don't leave me!

82
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,080
Don't leave me!

83
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,360
Father?

84
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,640
Where are we?

85
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,400
It was Uncle!

86
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,680
Uncle rescued us!

87
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,760
Protect your sister.

88
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,400
You two

89
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,720
must live on.

90
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,120
Father!

91
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,440
Father!

92
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,600
Protect your sister.

93
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:45,520
You two must live on.

94
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,640
Father…

95
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,000
Master.

96
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,360
I know what you guys are trying to ask.

97
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,280
You see…

98
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,360
I don't know.

99
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,000
What do you mean?

100
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,840
He won't die if he manages
to regain consciousness.

101
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,720
That sounds ominous.

102
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,720
What if he doesn't?

103
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,600
Great question.

104
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,360
His injuries are too grievous.

105
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,280
He has lost too much blood.

106
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,360
He might not wake up again.

107
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,040
I already fed him
the medicine I prescribed.

108
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,560
At least his heart can keep beating.

109
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,280
If he doesn't regain consciousness,

110
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,800
he will age very slowly.

111
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:50,280
By the time we die,
grow old or turn to ashes,

112
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,080
his hair might only just have turned gray.

113
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,960
Does that mean
he'll be in an eternal coma?

114
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,680
You could say so.

115
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,320
He will regain consciousness.

116
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,440
He begged me for a favor
before he fainted.

117
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,080
I know.

118
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,960
There are many things
he has yet to accomplish.

119
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,840
A person like him,
if he has any unfulfilled wishes,

120
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,920
he will surely wake and fulfill them.

121
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,640
Xiaoqing,

122
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,320
the messenger under you is being targeted.

123
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,920
You are being targeted as well.

124
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,920
Let's investigate the case together.

125
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,720
I've worn this charm

126
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,360
as long as I can remember.

127
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,480
Although I've faced many trials,

128
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,960
it did keep me safe until now.

129
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,480
I'll hand it to you.

130
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,400
May you overcome this ordeal.

131
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,480
What does this mean?

132
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,880
The general sent us a letter.

133
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,280
He said you made a mistake.

134
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,960
I want to know

135
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,600
what Yan Fengshan deemed my mistake to be.

136
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,760
When the city fell, your subordinates,

137
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,680
they failed to capture
the deposed emperor.

138
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,560
That was one of your mistakes.

139
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,400
Now that your nephew
has the deposed emperor with him,

140
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,040
there's no way he can be killed off.

141
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,360
You disobeyed the general's order.

142
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,560
Not only did you intervene personally,

143
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,640
but you also mobilized
many of our men without permission.

144
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,240
You completely lost sight
of the bigger picture.

145
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,440
And, Qingyi died because of you.

146
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,000
That was your second mistake.

147
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,440
There's no place for you
in Hidden Soldier Alley anymore.

148
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,360
After him!

149
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,080
Give it to me.

150
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,680
-Just let him play with it.
-Give it to me!

151
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,880
Give it to him.

152
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,440
Give it to me!

153
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,560
Here you go.

154
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,640
Sir, you're seriously wounded.

155
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,360
I didn't dare hire a physician.

156
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,880
I only used the Liu family's
anti-bleeding mix on you.

157
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,360
I was fortunate.

158
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,000
I'm still alive.

159
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,600
Xingzi,

160
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,320
since when did you get yourself a family?

161
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,640
I'm a single man in my thirties.

162
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,480
I was not careful with my coin
when I had some.

163
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,480
Speaking of which,

164
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,680
Sir, you have rarely visited me
all these years.

165
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,880
I never thought I'd see you wounded.

166
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,560
So,

167
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,600
is there anything I can do for you?

168
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,200
Where's your carriage?

169
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,119
I have one.

170
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,319
I keep it
at the marketplace's carriage house.

171
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,400
Can I leave the city in it?

172
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,079
You can. It's fully licensed.

173
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,280
Take me out of the city.

174
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,000
Sir,

175
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,400
I saw that you had a travel pass with you

176
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,599
when I was dressing your wound.

177
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,920
Must I go with you?

178
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,160
Right now,

179
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,880
you're the only person I can trust.

180
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,640
Back then, you joined hands with me
to strike down my brother.

181
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,880
Back then, I…

182
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,520
I merely struck him down

183
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,720
as proof of my loyalty, Sir.

184
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,120
I did it so that I could survive.

185
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,360
Poor people like us

186
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,160
do everything we can to survive.

187
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,600
If you wish to survive,

188
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,880
you have to follow my command.

189
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,000
It is not as though I will harm you.

190
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,600
Am I right?

191
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,520
I'll go and get the carriage.

192
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,720
-It'll take two or three days.
-You have two.

193
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,680
In two days, at sunset,

194
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,320
in the alley west of Yanping Gate,

195
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,800
I'll wait for you there.

196
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,120
Okay.

197
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,320
Xingzi.

198
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,720
Once you've done me this favor,

199
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,520
we shall be even.

200
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,280
We won't see each other again

201
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,800
after I leave the city.

202
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,240
Thank you, sir.

203
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,080
You're chopping firewood at night.
Don't you think it's noisy?

204
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,160
What's wrong?

205
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,120
I was just trying to help her out.

206
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,600
Besides, it's not as if we're
in a stranger's house.

207
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,920
This is Miss Bai Wan's residence.

208
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,440
I'm chopping firewood for her.

209
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,560
What has that to do
with Miss Bai Wan herself?

210
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,960
You were being noisy
by chopping firewood at night.

211
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,920
What I meant was,

212
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,200
Miss Bai Wan was far calmer than we were

213
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,320
when the physician was
pulling the sword from Xie Huai'an.

214
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,040
Now, he needs people to tend to him.

215
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,000
And Miss Bai Wan is
more meticulous than we are.

216
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,920
So I thought
I'd at least chop firewood to help them.

217
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,640
Unlike you, who only stand here
like a statue.

218
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,120
Say,

219
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,200
what's the relationship
between Bai Wan and Xie Huai'an?

220
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,560
That has nothing to do with you.

221
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,200
You should rest early.

222
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,720
You have to take over my shift tomorrow.

223
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,960
Of course it has nothing to do with me.

224
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,760
I know I've fallen from grace.

225
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,240
But back then,
I was a member of the imperial family.

226
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,200
Within the Capital,
among the high-ranking noble families,

227
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,680
I know every matter
related to them, big or small.

228
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,800
I even witnessed some of them.

229
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,400
For example,

230
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,920
Xie Huai'an has a younger sister.

231
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,520
When his sister turned a year old,

232
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,280
she received a birthday gift

233
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,160
that was very eye-catching.

234
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,280
It was a Hard Bamboo Carved Amulet.

235
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,680
And, I saw it last night.

236
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,680
Hey, lower your voice.

237
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,720
What are you saying?

238
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,560
The siblings have been reunited.
Isn't that great?

239
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,000
What are you doing? It's spilling!

240
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,080
That was hot!

241
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,880
Listen.
You'd better keep this to yourself.

242
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,880
If you tell anyone about it,

243
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,400
I'll break your legs.

244
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,120
Huai'an doesn't want her to know
that she's a member of the Liu family.

245
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,200
He said every member
of the Liu family was ill-fated.

246
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,440
Indeed.

247
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,000
And, they don't live long either.

248
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,520
If he doesn't make it this time…

249
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,760
If he passes…

250
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,480
I'll have to flee again.

251
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,280
Don't worry.

252
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,040
If anything happens to Huai'an,

253
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,880
I'll drag you down with him.

254
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,080
What has this got to do with me?

255
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,400
It's because you're a jinx.

256
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,360
He'll be fine.

257
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,840
Grand Preceptor already said
that he could live until the age of 83.

258
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,320
Grand Preceptor? Which one?

259
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,200
The one who was in power when
my father was the emperor, Cen Weizong.

260
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,800
Cen Weizong?
He's a renowned fortune-teller.

261
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,840
That's why I said
his prediction will be accurate.

262
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,600
When did he have his fortune told?

263
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,960
It was when…

264
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,480
Ten…

265
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,680
I think when he was 12.

266
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,360
Huai'an was on the run when he was 12.

267
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,520
He wouldn't have had time
for a fortune reading.

268
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,320
Grand Preceptor told my fortune
when I was 12.

269
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,880
He said I could live until the age of 83.

270
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,920
How could I live until 83
without Xie Huai'an's protection?

271
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,600
If I do live until 83,

272
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,960
doesn't that mean he'll be protecting me
until he's 83?

273
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,520
That's why
Xie Huai'an can live until 83 as well.

274
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,080
Don't worry about it.

275
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,160
Here.

276
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,680
So bitter.

277
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,040
I'll accomplish

278
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,080
the task you assigned once it's dawn.

279
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,400
But I have limited capabilities.

280
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,800
Your revenge must be taken step by step.

281
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,520
If you want full revenge,

282
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,680
you have to wake up

283
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,920
and do it yourself.

284
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,400
What are you staring at?

285
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,840
There's only one bowl here.

286
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,960
I cannot believe she keeps
only one bowl and one teacup in her house.

287
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,160
Is he okay?

288
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,440
He's fine. He's still unconscious.

289
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,480
I have something to do outside.

290
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,880
You're leaving at this moment?

291
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,960
Xiaoqing told me what happened.

292
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,920
Huben attacked you guys out of the blue.
And, there was a huge commotion.

293
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,040
I'm sure security in the city
will be tightened.

294
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,040
They will not dare strike again.

295
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,640
If you're still worried,

296
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,360
tell Commander Wang
to post men here in secret.

297
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,280
It'll be fine.

298
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,200
Okay.

299
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,280
Please go ahead.

300
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,520
I'll keep an eye on him.

301
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,080
You can have the noodles.

302
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,360
Why don't you have them?

303
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,560
Really?

304
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,680
It smells great.

305
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,840
In the future, you can be my book-boy.

306
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,440
Or my cook, perhaps.

307
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,560
Miss, come and take a look.

308
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,240
Look at all the varieties.

309
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,840
-Let's take a look.
-Please take a look.

310
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,640
-Fine goods for sale.
-What do you think?

311
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,000
-How much?
-This one?

312
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,720
It suits you. You can have it for one wen.

313
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,360
-It's raining!
-Let's go! Let's go!

314
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,120
The rain came out of nowhere.

315
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,800
-Let's hurry.
-It's raining. Let's hurry!

316
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,280
‎-Quick, get out of the way.
‎-Hurry up.

317
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,520
Let's seek shelter under the roof.

318
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,600
‎-It's starting to rain.
‎-Come on, move.

319
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,880
Please come again tomorrow.

320
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,040
-Come back tomorrow, sir.
-Let's go, let's go.

321
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,640
These ornaments are exquisite.

322
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,560
I wish to buy some after the rain stops.

323
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,920
Sure. Thank you.

324
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,720
‎Get under cover for a bit.

325
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,920
You’re drenched.

326
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,120
‎-You all right?
‎-Same here.

327
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,760
Miss, you've truly done me a huge favor.

328
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,560
These accessories aren't made
with gold or jade.

329
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,000
I wouldn't be able to sell them out
if they were drenched.

330
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,600
Don't mention it.

331
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,720
From your accent,
I'd say you're not from Chang'an.

332
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,480
I'm not that lucky.

333
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,640
Both my husband and I came from Huzhou.

334
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,960
We run a small trade
to make a living in Chang'an.

335
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,480
In Chang'an, food is costly.
Rent is worse.

336
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,480
It's tough to live here.

337
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,240
Since that's the case,
why didn't you return to Huzhou?

338
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,840
I've tried to persuade my husband
for many years.

339
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,320
But he always told me

340
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,640
that we should give it more time.

341
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,920
He kept saying that.

342
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,880
And now,
our daughter is already 6 years old.

343
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,200
Even so, he still won't leave.

344
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,880
I wonder why.

345
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,520
Miss, what about you?

346
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,080
You owe a blood debt.

347
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,440
That is why you cannot leave.

348
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,640
Miss, what do you mean?

349
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,680
My daughter's bangle.

350
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,680
Why do you have it with you?

351
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,720
Tell your husband this.

352
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,480
It's time for him to clear the debt
he owed 15 years ago.

353
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,520
Your daughter will return to you

354
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,160
once he does so.

355
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,920
It doesn't seem like

356
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,840
the rain will stop anytime soon.

357
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,720
Father.

358
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,720
Are you cold?

359
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,920
Yes.

360
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,880
If this keeps up,

361
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,040
you won't be able to survive.

362
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,080
But Father, I lost you.

363
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,440
At first,

364
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,360
I could've saved you.

365
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,680
I don't want to live anymore.

366
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,720
Whenever you face this moment,

367
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,440
you have to find a reason to live.

368
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,640
I took my sister

369
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,680
out of the Grand Preceptor's Residence.

370
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,520
We left Chang'an.

371
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,880
We walked 70 li.

372
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,360
And, we arrived at Nanwei Trough.

373
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,640
It was too cold.

374
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,280
We were starving.

375
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,920
I couldn't walk anymore.

376
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,080
In the town,
there wasn't a single oil lamp.

377
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,400
There was no fire at all.

378
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,320
But my sister and I…

379
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,200
we wanted to have some hot soup.

380
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,640
I hid her

381
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,080
in a thatched hut by the roadside.

382
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,720
And, I left.

383
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,640
When I found some food
and returned to the hut,

384
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,200
my sister

385
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,000
had already been taken in
by a kind-hearted soul.

386
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,480
She was so young.

387
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,280
She wouldn't have survived

388
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,920
had she stayed with me.

389
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,920
Perhaps she would be able
to grow up safely

390
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,960
if she weren't a member of the Liu family.

391
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,040
After that,

392
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,840
I hid among the reeds of Nanwei Trough

393
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,160
and sustained myself for seven years

394
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,280
as I watched over her.

395
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,920
Her foster family

396
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,160
treated her kindly.

397
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,280
You've already done a great job.

398
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,520
Can you still go on?

399
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,040
I… I'm so worn out.

400
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,560
Why don't you hang on for a little longer?

401
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,720
Until the next blooming season?

402
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,240
I just think

403
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,000
that my son

404
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,600
deserves to see the flowers bloom again.

405
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,640
After the blooming season,

406
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,400
you can wait just a little longer.

407
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,040
Once the petals fall
and the July rains pass,

408
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,720
you can wait just a little longer.

409
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,120
You can wait until your wife
sets a meal before you.

410
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,680
Just lead a peaceful life

411
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,240
as you keep on waiting.

412
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,480
On the surface,

413
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,720
it seems a good life.

414
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,840
It is a life of merely getting by.

415
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,760
Father, your hands are so cold.

416
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,760
You were hunted down.

417
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,440
No matter how I tried to catch up,

418
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,800
I could never catch up to that carriage.

419
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,000
-Father!
-I could only stare.

420
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,120
You were stabbed many times.

421
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,120
-There was blood everywhere.
-Father!

422
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,600
That was my last image of you.

423
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,680
As a son,

424
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,800
from now on,

425
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,000
I merely live

426
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,560
to avenge you.

427
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,520
I don't want you living like this.

428
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,960
But I want to.

429
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,760
Even if I have to sacrifice everything,

430
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,360
I won't hesitate at all.

431
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,040
Revenge…

432
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,679
-Revenge…
-What am I to do if you never wake?

433
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,000
Don't tell me you're already…

434
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,080
Keep talking like that
and you'd better leave.

435
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,120
Revenge…

436
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,840
I think he talked just now.

437
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,400
Come here.

438
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,240
What did he say?

439
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,440
I think he's trying to say

440
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,800
that he wants to find

441
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,960
his mother.

442
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,760
Water.

443
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,800
Water?

444
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,400
-He wants water. Hurry.
-I'll go and get some.

445
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,720
How is he? Has he regained consciousness?

446
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,520
-He talked just now.
-Yeah.

447
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,400
He said he wanted to find his mother.

448
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,880
He also said he wanted some water.

449
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,440
I want to seek revenge.

450
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,560
He's saying

451
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,000
that he wants revenge.

452
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,000
Huai'an?

453
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,080
-Huai'an, you're awake.
-Huai'an?

454
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,360
Finally, my bodyguard is awake.

455
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,200
How long was I out?

456
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,040
Two days.

457
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,680
Be careful.

458
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,120
Regarding the task I told you…

459
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,240
Don't worry about it.
Everything has been arranged.

460
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,240
He hasn't left the city.

461
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,840
Good.

462
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,760
He hasn't left the city, huh?

463
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,000
That means I still stand a chance
to hunt him down.

464
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,240
Hunt him down?

465
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,160
Hunt who?

466
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,400
Liu Ziyan.

467
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,320
He does not deserve to draw breath.

468
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,680
Sir.

469
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,120
All three divinations forebode misfortune.

470
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,320
You're leaving the city at this hour?

471
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,800
I'm on an errand
for the Peacekeeper Corps.

472
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,120
Sir, I have no choice either.

473
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,120
This is the official letter
and travel pass.

474
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,040
You may pass.

475
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,400
Thank you, sir.

476
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,400
Hurry!

477
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,720
I've been getting by
in Chang'an for many years.

478
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,680
In the end, I still
have to leave this city.

479
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,080
What is it?

480
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,280
The carriage hit a rock.

481
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,200
It's dark out.

482
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,680
Be careful.

483
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,960
If I die now,

484
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,960
you'll never learn

485
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,680
what your father

486
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,080
told me

487
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,760
before he died.

488
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,080
It doesn't matter.

489
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,840
That no longer matters to me.

490
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:04,960
Young Master!

491
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,880
I had no choice either back then.

492
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,760
If I didn't help him out,
I would've been dead!

493
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,320
If I didn't stab your father,

494
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,000
my parents would've been killed!

495
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,680
I was selfish. I was a coward.

496
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,160
I deserve to die!

497
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,760
But you see,

498
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,640
my daughter is innocent in all this.

499
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,040
You can do whatever you want to me.

500
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,680
But please spare my daughter!

501
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:45,400
FAIR DEALS FOR ALL

502
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,080
NEW FORTUNE, LONG LIFE

503
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,360
You've settled your debt.

504
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,640
You may reunite with your family.

505
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,160
Young Master, thank you!

506
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,800
Young Master, thank you
for your great kindness!

507
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,840
Thank you so much!

508
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,600
My dear girl.

509
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,800
Hurry. Greet your father.

510
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,440
-Father.
-Let me carry you.

511
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,760
Father, you're drenched.

512
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,040
I'm fine.

513
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,040
I'm fine.

514
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,200
Let me dry you.

515
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,120
I thought you would kill him.

516
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,240
I'm different from those people.

517
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:51,760
Let's go.

518
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,400
Let's head home.

519
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,120
Okay. Let's head home.

520
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,720
Let's head home.

521
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,520
DAHUANG

522
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,600
LIU ZIWEN

523
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,240
LIU ZIWEN

524
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:03,800
LIU ZIWEN

525
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:13,440
On the 7th day of the 12th month,
in the 17th year of Qiansheng,

526
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,640
we encountered the body
of General Liu Ziwen along the road.

527
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,720
Our hearts were heavy with grief.

528
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,960
We, mere commoners,

529
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:25,240
respecting the name
and virtue of the General,

530
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:29,240
pooled our efforts
to give him a proper burial here.

531
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,320
We performed the rites
on behalf of future generations,

532
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,840
placed him in his coffin,

533
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,560
and interred him in his tomb,

534
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,360
so as to comfort
the heroic spirit of the General.

535
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,560
Father.

536
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,120
So, you were here all along.

537
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,600
The city of Chang'an

538
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,040
has never forgotten about you.

539
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,800
Father.

540
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,520
I'm still alive.

541
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,360
My sister is alive as well.
