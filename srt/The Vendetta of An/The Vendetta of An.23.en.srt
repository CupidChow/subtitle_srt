1
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,600
Many years ago,

2
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,560
on the land of the Tiemo people,

3
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,960
a woman from Chang'an was captured.

4
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,160
The Tiemo believed she was a shadow guard.

5
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,600
A shadow guard captured,

6
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,480
and more shadow guards would come for her.

7
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,880
Every shadow guard
carries invaluable military intelligence,

8
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,760
immeasurable in worth.

9
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,639
She was hung upon a turning pole,
used as bait.

10
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,360
Under sun and rain,

11
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,680
for seven days in full.

12
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,640
No one came to save her.

13
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,280
Even the Tiemo people

14
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,160
eventually lost interest in her.

15
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,800
Except for one patient man.

16
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,640
On the seventh night,

17
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,360
the soldiers guarding her abandoned her,
thinking she was dead.

18
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,160
And that man had waited

19
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,000
for this very moment.

20
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,600
He loved to gamble

21
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,320
and was skilled in disguise.

22
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,400
He saw she was still alive

23
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,440
and knew a woman who survived seven days

24
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,880
could not be a common shadow guard.

25
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,880
She might be of the Huben Army.

26
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,520
He helped her when her will

27
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,120
was weakest.

28
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,920
He drew out key intelligence

29
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,040
and once he had what he needed,

30
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,040
he then killed her completely.

31
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,320
That man was calm

32
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,279
and cruel.

33
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,520
That man,

34
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,080
back then in Tiemo,
was known as a brilliant conspirator.

35
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,640
The intelligence he obtained
turned the war in their favor.

36
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,920
And so,

37
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,720
he was awarded great military merit.

38
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,840
After that,

39
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,520
he rose to become the new King of Tiemo.

40
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,040
Wu Zhongheng.

41
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,280
I never truly knew the man.

42
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,800
He deceived my father,

43
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,200
and he deceived me as well.

44
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,840
The Huben elites
who came to save her that year

45
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,360
had already advanced deep
into the Chen Valley.

46
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,960
I used the intel
I coaxed out of that woman,

47
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,840
I led 100 Huben elites

48
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,000
straight into a granary,

49
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,640
and left them
to butcher one another inside.

50
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,000
What I never foresaw

51
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,480
was that one Huben elite

52
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,800
would make it out alive,
and return to Chang'an.

53
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,840
He later grew in power, overtook me,

54
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,400
and killed your father, Liu Ziwen.

55
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,920
Then he reshaped the balance in Tiemo,

56
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,960
forcing my plans

57
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,040
to be delayed for 15 more years.

58
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,280
Yan Fengshan.

59
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,800
A name one remembers
even at the brink of death.

60
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,200
Perhaps this is simply karma.

61
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,160
White Hair.

62
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,160
Back then,
living under the name Wu Zhongheng,

63
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,040
I moved among your father's generation.

64
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,200
All those years,

65
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,680
not once did I hear anyone
mention your mother.

66
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,040
Where was she, I wonder?

67
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,440
A woman

68
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,840
for whom 100 Huben elites
would give their lives

69
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,720
must have held a noble and rare status.

70
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,840
What a pity.

71
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,040
I cut her down from that pole,

72
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,560
yet she left not a single word behind.

73
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,520
Had she spoken even once,

74
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,280
it might have eased the longing
of a family somewhere in Chang'an.

75
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,920
My mother is in the north.

76
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,720
When all this ends,

77
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,160
she will return.

78
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,080
Is that so?

79
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,280
I hope you are right.

80
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,080
Truth is,

81
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,520
I never killed for pleasure.

82
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,760
I killed only to reach

83
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,920
my goal.

84
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,800
Nothing more.

85
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,200
The deposed emperor is in your grasp,

86
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,640
and so are my friends.

87
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,360
These past days,

88
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,000
you have been waiting for me.

89
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,240
Speak.

90
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,280
What do you want from me?

91
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,160
Kill Xiao Wuyang for me.

92
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,360
Why do you not do it yourself?

93
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,320
You endured 15 years to stay alive,

94
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,320
playing the long game for vengeance.

95
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,480
And I endured 25 years.

96
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,160
Of course I will leave the greatest chance
for myself.

97
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,760
Very well.

98
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,240
Then tell me, why choose me?

99
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,200
Because you plotted the death
of Yan Fengshan,

100
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,400
which means you can do it again

101
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,120
and bring me Xiao Wuyang's head.

102
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,800
You truly are my mentor.

103
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,800
I know one thing.

104
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,800
On that throne in Chang'an,

105
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,920
there will never be room for two.

106
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,320
As it stands,

107
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,120
Tiemo is at our gates.

108
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,440
I will help you kill him.

109
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,640
But after it is done,

110
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,960
you will release my friends.

111
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,720
Do not worry.

112
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,360
I

113
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,480
do not kill for pleasure.

114
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,520
I kill only to achieve a goal.

115
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,320
I took your friends
only to force your hand.

116
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,680
I made a promise to Gu Yu.

117
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,040
He wished to die in his homeland,

118
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,320
and I granted him that.

119
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,240
If you kill Xiao Wuyang for me,

120
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,200
I will grant you the same,

121
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,400
your friends will be safe.

122
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,160
It's nearly done.

123
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,080
Dinner is ready.

124
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,240
Thank you, my dear.

125
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,160
‎It's time for dinner.

126
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,400
Father, Mother, let's eat.

127
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,520
‎Grandpa.

128
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,440
Qinghe,

129
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,000
-sit and eat properly.
-Grandfather.

130
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,640
-You little kid.
-Alright, Qinghe, no more fussing.

131
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,560
Let's eat first.

132
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,600
Here.

133
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,600
Sit down first.

134
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,960
Grandfather, I want meat.

135
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,760
Meat? Meat it is, have some.

136
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,840
Tasty.

137
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,120
Grandmother, have some meat.

138
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,720
-Sit down first.
-Qinghe, sit.

139
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,160
-Sit and eat.
-Let me serve some soup for you.

140
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,400
What a handful!

141
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,160
I owe debts and never pay them.

142
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,480
I'm shameless to the core.

143
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,280
I'm shameless to the core,

144
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,960
not even man enough to repay what I owe.

145
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,920
I'm shameless to the core,

146
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,520
not even man enough to repay what I owe.

147
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,520
Truly penniless.

148
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,200
So poor.

149
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,000
Then why gamble?

150
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,320
A poor man only gambles to rise again.

151
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,520
What good are you alive?

152
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,360
Tomorrow,

153
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,280
go fish with Liang.

154
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,840
He's an honest man.

155
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,080
You'll be paid daily.

156
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,360
Thank you, Master Lu. Thank you.

157
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,440
Master Lu,
you're like a second father to me.

158
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,320
-Thank you, Master Lu.
-I just worry you'll skip out,

159
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,800
and ruin my reputation.

160
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,880
You'll see me every day after work.

161
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,200
I'll take half your wages

162
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,400
until every debt is paid.

163
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,880
If you slack off,

164
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,600
I'll cut your flesh to settle the debt.

165
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,560
Your Majesty. You're back.

166
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,680
-The food is still warm.
-Good.

167
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,720
Your Majesty.

168
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,600
You're still badly injured.

169
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,200
Why go out again?

170
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,120
You…

171
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,080
And those people, they…

172
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,360
They failed to kill me once.

173
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,720
They'll try again.

174
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,560
I need to be ready.

175
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,400
Enough. It's alright now.

176
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,920
Let's eat.

177
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,320
Come.

178
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,840
Come. Sit and eat with me.

179
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,080
I have plenty.

180
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,680
Here, there is no emperor.

181
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,920
Only the shopkeeper
and the one he shelters.

182
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,240
-Sit, eat.
-Alright.

183
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,440
Yan Fengshan is dead.

184
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,040
Aside from that news,
is there anything good to hear?

185
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,160
The armies surrounding the city
have withdrawn.

186
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,240
The forces of the regional commanders

187
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,880
are already returning
to their feudal towns.

188
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,440
Many people went out recently,
they saw it themselves.

189
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,440
These days, I walked along Cangshui River,

190
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,040
heard many talking
about the troop movements.

191
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,600
It matches what you said.

192
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,240
Why aren't you eating? Eat.

193
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,040
Sir.

194
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,080
Come.

195
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,360
Sit here. Talk to me.

196
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,120
Have you heard anything
about the Tiemo lately?

197
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,520
The Tiemo?

198
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,560
Your Majesty, we're in Chang'an.

199
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,560
How could the Tiemo get in?

200
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,120
The ones who ambushed me
that night were Tiemo.

201
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,360
I thought they were sent by Yan Fengshan.

202
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,560
Huben guards kill with precision,

203
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,280
nothing like the sweeping blade work
of open battle.

204
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,320
I fought on the northern front for years.

205
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,240
I know their ways well.

206
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,720
Those attackers that night
were Tiemo without a doubt.

207
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,560
Enough.

208
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,960
I met someone in Cangshui River today,

209
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,680
a young debt collector named Lu Xiaobing.

210
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,800
Do you know of him?

211
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,160
I do.

212
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,600
Cruel, ruthless man.

213
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,880
Your Majesty, a life like gold,

214
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,720
must never deal with someone like him.

215
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,600
Sir.

216
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,880
You are a little late.

217
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,520
In your name, I borrowed money from him.

218
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,600
I expect he will come
looking for you soon.

219
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,000
He will come here?

220
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,200
Your Majesty,

221
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,160
that exposes your location.
What should we do?

222
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,960
-How do we handle this?
-Enough, sir.

223
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,960
Do not worry. I have my own way.

224
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,040
Several of my employers said the same.

225
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,360
The salt-shop keeper borrowed gold.

226
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,720
All added up, it's about four liang now.

227
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,840
Old man, think carefully.

228
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,440
Nine out, thirteen returned.

229
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,200
If you can't repay,

230
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,680
I'll burn your shop down.

231
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,760
I will repay.

232
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,360
And this one,
the worn-out looking fellow here.

233
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,360
What's your story?

234
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,680
I look worn-out?

235
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,040
A little.

236
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm the one who borrowed the gold.

237
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,000
Here.

238
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,040
Borrowing so much money,

239
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,720
planning a business?

240
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,080
Or planning to flee with it?

241
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,480
I want to pay you for your help.

242
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,920
For you.

243
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,880
Handle something for me.

244
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,280
WARRANT

245
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,400
Who is he?

246
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,280
My brother.

247
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,040
He's wanted.

248
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,040
I believe he'll show up around here.

249
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,600
I'm waiting to meet him again.

250
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,920
Keep an eye out for me every day.

251
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,360
If you hear anything, tell me at once,
quietly.

252
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,240
Do it well,

253
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,880
and this gold will be your reward.

254
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,200
Let me get this straight.

255
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,920
You borrowed money
from several of my employers,

256
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,920
then you handed that money back to me.

257
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,920
And when it's time to collect,

258
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,440
I'll have to chase you for payment?

259
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,480
We'll talk about repayment when it's due.

260
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,680
But for now, I am your employer.

261
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,200
Do the job well for me.

262
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,840
-Xiaobing is back.
-Yes.

263
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,080
Xiaoding.

264
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,840
Xiaoding. You haven't eaten yet?

265
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,040
-Waiting for you.
-Alright.

266
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,800
Perfect timing then.

267
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,160
We'll have something extra today.

268
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,320
Listen,
I met a really strange fellow today.

269
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,680
He gave me four liang of gold.

270
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,960
That much?

271
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,120
Yeah.

272
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,520
Tell me, what brother
is worth four liang of gold?

273
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,840
Besides,

274
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,920
where would I find him a brother?

275
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,520
Xiaobing. I think maybe it's time.

276
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,960
-Time for what?
-Xiaobing, you're not young anymore.

277
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,840
You should find a wife.

278
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,080
But dragging me along
like baggage won't help.

279
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,160
If you know some wealthy family,

280
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,800
fix me up a bit,

281
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,960
dress me like a boy,

282
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,360
send me as their younger brother.

283
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,400
You're dreaming way too big.

284
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,840
I didn't raise you for nothing.

285
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,800
Besides, if such luck really existed,

286
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,400
a rich family seeking a younger brother,

287
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,640
I should go first.

288
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,120
Do you even know…?

289
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,800
Eat.

290
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,800
Come on, have more. More meat.

291
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,240
This is good meat.

292
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,720
Wuyang.

293
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,600
If I come back alive,

294
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,680
I'll keep looking after you.

295
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,160
If I die,

296
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,760
then let it be a death for the realm.

297
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,200
At least I won't shame the Xiao family.

298
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,400
Put this on later.

299
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,520
When Xiao Wuyang dies,

300
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,600
your friends will be safe.

301
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,560
WONTONS

302
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,360
IMPERIAL PHYSICIAN'S HALL

303
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,160
Morning, Mr. Sha.

304
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,160
Morning.

305
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,520
Mr. Sha.

306
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,040
Morning, Mr. Sha.

307
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,640
Grand Preceptor.

308
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,520
There is no Grand Preceptor anymore.

309
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,480
Here in Chang'an,
there's only Cen Pickles.

310
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,720
Your Majesty.

311
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,320
Many years ago,

312
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,760
Liu Ziwen and Grand Preceptor
Cen Weizong were both here.

313
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,800
I heard them speak once

314
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,160
of their vision for Cangshui River.

315
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,640
Had I not seen it myself,

316
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,840
I would never believe it's true.

317
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:01,560
They said it still isn't fully built.

318
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,800
But still, it has sheltered many people.

319
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,440
I suppose everyone here
has some skills to survive.

320
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,800
Out there, they could make a living too.

321
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,320
I wonder

322
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,640
why they choose to stay
in a place with no daylight.

323
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,480
Your Majesty.

324
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,640
People here are like duckweed.

325
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,920
When they first arrive,
each has their own reason.

326
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,240
Once duckweed takes root,

327
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,640
it becomes home.

328
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,040
Who

329
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,280
would willingly leave their home again?

330
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,920
The boatman in charge said
only his skiff can get outside.

331
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,440
But that's not true.

332
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,680
If one day

333
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,320
Your Majesty decides to leave,

334
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,040
you may find

335
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:12,120
an unsealed tunnel on that cliffside.

336
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,160
It leads out.

337
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,280
Your Majesty,

338
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,000
if that day comes,

339
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,040
I will guide Your Majesty through.

340
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,000
Me?

341
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,120
I cannot leave yet.

342
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,040
I must wait for Xie Huai'an.

343
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,120
Your Majesty.

344
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,560
You gave him four liang of gold

345
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:53,400
just so he could
wander around here every day?

346
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,840
I'll think of him
as my second pair of eyes.

347
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,280
You saw it too, didn't you?

348
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,720
He's wearing the shoes I gave him.

349
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,960
Anyone observant will notice.

350
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,400
Through him,
news will find its way back to me.

351
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,120
All for Xie Huai'an.

352
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,880
Yes.

353
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,360
The Tiemo assassins,

354
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,120
and Yan Fengshan's death,

355
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,760
all happened that same night.

356
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,800
Six days have passed since then.

357
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,520
Xie Huai'an still hasn't appeared.

358
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,200
He leaves no trace when he acts.

359
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,080
If he is late,

360
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,120
it means something went wrong.

361
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,240
It seems even here,

362
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,720
meeting him may not be easy.

363
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,320
That child has suffered too much.

364
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,680
Child?

365
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,280
Sir.

366
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,440
He even killed Yan Fengshan.

367
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,800
This child may well be

368
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,440
the most terrifying person in the empire.

369
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,800
Your Majesty.

370
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,840
When he was born,

371
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,920
I was already working
in the Liu household.

372
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,280
I watched with my own eyes

373
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,520
as his white hair turned black again.

374
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,680
In my eyes,

375
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,760
he is still just a child.

376
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,160
Do not worry.

377
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,600
I will protect him well.

378
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,040
You may live to see

379
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,120
his hair turn from black to white.

380
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,240
Xie Huai'an,

381
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,000
you should be here by now.

382
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,080
Have you ever thought about
how you might die?

383
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,000
Mr. Huai'an looks gentle and refined,

384
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,720
but when you speak,

385
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,120
your words could chill one's bones.

386
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,240
Gentle and refined, am I?

387
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,440
You are smart enough.

388
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,640
You should know how this ends for you.

389
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,120
I do not.

390
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,080
Then please, enlighten me.

391
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,480
You will die

392
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,080
long before you reach the summit.

393
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,680
Why not at the summit?

394
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,639
Had it been 30 years earlier,

395
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,320
you might have stood a chance.

396
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,639
Back then, the founding emperor
rose from nothing,

397
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,560
and my father

398
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,880
was still studying in the countryside.

399
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,480
The Grand Preceptor first made a living

400
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,960
selling pickled vegetables.

401
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,159
But in the end,
they both reached the peak.

402
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,719
Envy.

403
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,400
No need to envy them,

404
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,199
you simply chose the wrong road.

405
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,120
Did I?

406
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,000
Yan Fengshan, that great mountain,
has already fallen.

407
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,480
Xiao Wenjing is already in our hands.

408
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,360
Looking at the situation now,

409
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,560
only the Tiemo people
still have a chance to reach the summit.

410
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,960
As for me,

411
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,040
I was born a Tiemo man.

412
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,600
You are mistaken.

413
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,200
Yan Fengshan never reached the peak,

414
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,960
and the Tiemo never will.

415
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,000
WARRANT

416
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,320
Come look, come take a look.

417
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,400
The wanted man is back.

418
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,600
He must have seen the shoes you gave me,

419
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,960
so he left the umbrella there on purpose.

420
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,320
What is that supposed to mean?

421
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,160
This umbrella once appeared
in a very large plot.

422
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,720
Back then,

423
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,880
he lost his only family.

424
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,280
This is a warning to me

425
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,440
that there is a trap ahead.

426
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,360
So what does it have to do with you?

427
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,440
Enough.

428
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,000
You did what I asked. You may go.

429
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,480
The four liang is yours.

430
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,520
As for the rest,

431
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,840
I will repay the lenders gradually.

432
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,200
Four liang for running an errand?

433
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,040
It was not just an errand, it was risky.

434
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,320
Four liang, well deserved.

435
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,520
I am not blind either.

436
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,200
Your brother is no ordinary man.

437
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,040
Someone is watching him.

438
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,880
You're even more intriguing.

439
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,000
You want someone dead.

440
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,400
I, Lu Xiaobing,
collect debts in Cangshui River.

441
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,520
Everyone knows I keep my word.

442
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,440
Not a coin short, not a credit stolen.

443
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,680
You paid me four liang,

444
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,280
I can do a bit more for you.

445
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,640
No need.

446
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,760
I know you have family.

447
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,400
When young men try to be fearless,

448
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,440
they should think of home.

449
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,040
Live well.

450
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,320
Go on.

451
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,080
The King of Tiemo is in the open now.

452
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,720
We will face him this way.

453
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,400
This blade of yours,
can it kill Xiao Wuyang?

454
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,560
Of course not.

455
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,320
Mr. Huai'an must know that already.

456
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,080
No need to pry from me.

457
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,480
As for others like me who hold blades,

458
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,360
how many there are,

459
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,760
or where they stand,

460
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,280
I know nothing of it.

461
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,080
So you do not know the final killing move.

462
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,120
You are not at the core of this.

463
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,320
Does Mr. Huai'an know it then?

464
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,840
Think a little more,
and the answer comes naturally.

465
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,880
Set head against head,
we can never match Xiao Wuyang.

466
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:27,920
According to the plan,

467
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,800
there is a teahouse by the mudflat ahead.

468
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,760
That's the best spot
for us to wait for Xiao Wuyang.

469
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,400
Even if shadow guards swarm the place,

470
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,800
he will not win by ambush alone.

471
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,800
As for my mentor,
he wants to take down the King of Death.

472
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,640
I find myself truly curious

473
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,440
about what move he plans to use.

474
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,200
-Hurry.
-Here.

475
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:18,960
Move.

476
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,320
Strike the cicada first,

477
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,360
‎then the oriole.
