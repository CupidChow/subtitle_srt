1
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,960
It's getting cold.

2
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,280
The sooner we finish this,

3
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,560
the sooner I can go to sleep.

4
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,560
Greetings, Your Majesty.

5
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,600
I…

6
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,800
I want food.

7
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,280
I haven't eaten in a long time.

8
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,480
Don't go.

9
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,480
Don't go.

10
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,600
Don't go! Give me food.

11
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,520
Don't go!

12
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,800
Come back!

13
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,080
Come back! Give me food!

14
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,960
Give me food!

15
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,040
Give me…

16
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,360
Give me some warm food.

17
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,600
Something warm. Something edible.

18
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,840
Come back!

19
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,280
How long have you starved him?

20
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,000
He's a brat.

21
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,160
I cooked and sent him food
in the beginning,

22
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,240
but he asked for the golden milk pastry

23
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,240
so I just ignored him.

24
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,400
Now that I think about it,

25
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,160
it's been two or three days.

26
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,440
He won't starve to death anyway.

27
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,080
Huai'an.

28
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,960
You first treated him coldly

29
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,040
before offering him a feast.

30
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,640
Your way of treating an old acquaintance
is quite roundabout.

31
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,800
We are not close.

32
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,560
When I was 9 years old,

33
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,560
we joined the Grand Academy together.

34
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,360
He was the prince.

35
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,960
But every time,
I was the one who got first place.

36
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,440
Soon after,

37
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,240
I found a small snake in my desk drawer.

38
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,160
What do you think happened?

39
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,720
He was the one who put the snake there.

40
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,520
He thought I wouldn't discover the truth

41
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,040
and even sent me the antidote.

42
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,079
What a schemer.

43
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,640
Once I was 10 years old,
I no longer saw him.

44
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,600
Later, he became the emperor

45
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,760
and lived under Yan Fengshan's thumb.

46
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,760
I'm sure he has his own ways of survival.

47
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,160
It's done.

48
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,040
A fortunate fellow indeed.

49
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,400
Where are you going?

50
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,240
I'm taking food to that scoundrel.

51
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,640
I made this meal for you.

52
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,200
For me?

53
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,360
You've been risking your life for me.

54
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,760
Shouldn't I make a meal to thank you?

55
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,720
Come and eat.

56
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,720
Is this to be my final meal?

57
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,960
Don't speak ill fortune.

58
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,960
Even so, it's still worth it.

59
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,240
Your life is hanging by a thread.

60
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,640
The new emperor is looking for you.

61
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,760
As long as you are still missing,

62
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,360
his throne won't be secure.

63
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,440
Yan Fengshan of the Huben Army

64
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,040
means to use you to start a war.

65
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,600
When that day comes,

66
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,240
whether he wins or loses,

67
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,040
you will still die.

68
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,560
If you leave this place,

69
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,920
the only fate waiting for you

70
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,600
is death.

71
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,320
You…

72
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,520
you can save my life?

73
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,120
Only I know of a way.

74
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,200
What price must I pay?

75
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,480
You are the bait I'm using
to deal with Yan Fengshan.

76
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,080
I'm going to kill Yan Fengshan

77
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,440
and wipe out the entire Huben Army.

78
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,640
I need you to help me achieve that goal.

79
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,320
Who are you?

80
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,440
It's best that you don't recognize me.

81
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,600
You should also forget the fact
that you are the emperor.

82
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,680
I already knew

83
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,920
what kind of person you were
back in the Grand Academy.

84
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,640
I also know you have
your own way of staying alive.

85
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,080
But from today onward,

86
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,560
you will survive by the rules
I set for you.

87
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,120
Otherwise,

88
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,960
- you will die.
- You…

89
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,960
Are you Liu…?

90
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,960
That man is dead.

91
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,280
I am your master now. I am Xie Huai'an.

92
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,480
BEGINNING OF WINTER, WATER BEGINS
TO FREEZE, THE EARTH BEGINS TO HARDEN

93
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,080
PHEASANTS ENTER THE WATER FOR CLAMS

94
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,760
When I entered the city,

95
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,040
I saw my younger sister.

96
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,280
Has she been doing well?

97
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,360
She's doing fine.

98
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,760
Compared to 15 years ago,

99
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,320
things here

100
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,920
are much better.

101
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,000
My master will be here tomorrow.

102
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,280
Everything will proceed according to plan.

103
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,360
All right.

104
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,520
The vendetta of a gentleman

105
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,640
leaves no man standing.

106
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,440
When I received my first month's pay
as a registrar in Huainan,

107
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,960
I hired an artist
to draw these six portraits.

108
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,520
That was my seventh year on the run.

109
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,960
I was afraid that I might forget
these people's faces.

110
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,520
If I want to destroy the Huben Army,

111
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
I must kill these six first.

112
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,640
Pu Nichuan. In the 19th year of Qiansheng,

113
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,080
he scouted for Yan Fengshan
and infiltrated Tiemo.

114
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,000
When he was trapped,
he waited for help that never came.

115
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,840
Yan Fengshan deemed him an abandoned pawn.

116
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,840
Since then,
no one knows whether he's dead or alive.

117
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,680
Father!

118
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,320
I know very well
whether he's dead or alive.

119
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,200
Wei Qianting.

120
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,600
This man is elusive.
His whereabouts remain unknown.

121
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,160
I met him seven years ago.

122
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,520
<i>But he should be</i>

123
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,440
buried in the reed swamps
of Nanwei Trough now.

124
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,400
Yan Fengshan.

125
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,400
He overthrew the emperor
and ruled the court for many years.

126
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,560
People call him Emperor Yan.

127
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,600
In the use of shadow guards,

128
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,280
Yan Fengshan

129
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,520
is way superior to my father.

130
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,400
That is because he has
a particular man by his side.

131
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,880
On the night my family was wiped out,

132
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,080
<i>he was there as well,</i>
<i>but I couldn't see his face clearly.</i>

133
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,000
LEGACY OF IMPERIAL FAVOR

134
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,400
After so many years,

135
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,560
I still haven't found any clues about him.

136
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,240
Many within the Huben Army
are hiding in the shadows,

137
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,120
but everyone knows these two people.

138
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,240
Qingyi, who is in charge of surveillance
and intelligence.

139
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,320
He possesses the secrets of many
important officials of the imperial court.

140
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,480
Liu Ziyan.

141
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,480
The best assassin of the Huben Army.

142
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,280
He is in charge of killing.

143
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,080
Whom shall we deal with first?

144
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,920
My uncle, of course.

145
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,240
I've wanted to kill him for so long.

146
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,920
Aren't you the same?

147
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,600
As long as he is still alive,
I can't live in peace.

148
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,680
This day

149
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,280
will come soon.

150
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,160
YULONG RIDGE

151
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,760
Are you here to bid me farewell?

152
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,640
I'm afraid

153
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,800
this is my last time serving you.

154
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,400
Xiao Wuyang is not an easy target.

155
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,360
If the Huben Army
wants to win against him…

156
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,520
MYSTERIOUS PERSON

157
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,600
…it won't be a swift victory.

158
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,080
Why have you been mobilized at this time?

159
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,280
My subordinate let someone escape.

160
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,760
We hunted him through the city
for half a month,

161
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,720
but found nothing.

162
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,160
That man plays an important role
in the future.

163
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,560
I must attend to it myself.

164
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,120
This is interesting.

165
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,800
It is a serious matter.

166
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,560
Just go.

167
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,800
The person

168
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,200
serving you in the future
might not be as meticulous.

169
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,600
Please be understanding.

170
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,040
I've been imprisoned in Yulong Ridge
for more than a dozen years.

171
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,360
I'm already dead inside.

172
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,200
I'm not picky about my servants.

173
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,440
Ziyan.

174
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,240
One more thing.

175
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,400
Liu Ziwen is your elder brother.

176
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,040
Yan Fengshan wanted Liu Ziwen dead.

177
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,880
Why did you do Yan Fengshan's bidding?

178
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,480
There are many things

179
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,800
my brother couldn't tolerate,

180
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,680
but General Fengshan could.

181
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,160
At the Battle of Chen Valley,

182
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,480
I saved a civilian.

183
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,520
His wife died early, leaving him
to care for parents and children.

184
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,440
The whole family

185
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,040
made a living through chopping bamboo
and weaving dustpans.

186
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,080
When a war broke out,
they could no longer make a living.

187
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,280
A five-year-old child

188
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,160
sat on a wooden plate

189
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,360
and ate the bamboo dustpan.

190
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,560
The bamboo pricked
his torn mouth and lips.

191
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,520
He was so pitiful.

192
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,920
However, it's infuriating as well.

193
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,960
Did that family betray you?

194
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,200
I almost lost my life there.

195
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,160
Under my brother's command,
some acts were forbidden.

196
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,240
He said we killed people to save others.

197
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,440
But since that day,

198
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,880
I only kill others

199
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,480
so no one can kill me.

200
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,880
That sounds fair enough.

201
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,880
Ziyan,

202
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,120
farewell.

203
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,240
WENYUAN EATERY, HUA'S MUTTON BROTH

204
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,840
FENG'S CURED HAM SHOP

205
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,359
WINE HOUSE

206
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,440
How much are these vegetables?

207
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,000
Take a look. They are fresh.

208
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,000
Pick more and I'll give you a discount.

209
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,560
- This is a little wilted.
- No, thanks.

210
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,560
Look at something else.

211
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,240
APOTHECARY

212
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,960
<i>You always go to extreme lengths.</i>

213
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,480
The capital is ruled by the emperor…

214
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,480
STEADFAST AND UPRIGHT

215
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,040
…yet you dare kill someone as you please.

216
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,400
The enemies came and asked for your life.

217
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,640
They even accused my men of harboring you.

218
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,600
How much longer do you need

219
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,320
to move on from the Chen Valley incident?

220
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,840
It's not that I didn't move on,

221
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,040
but I've chosen another path
after that night.

222
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,320
You have a blade in your hand

223
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,440
but you can't see things clearly.

224
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,000
After today,

225
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,080
you are no longer of the Huben Army.

226
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,840
If you make another mistake,

227
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,360
I will kill you myself.

228
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,080
A military command is absolute.

229
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,800
You'd better kill me today.

230
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,840
Even if you spare me today,

231
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,760
I might

232
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,840
not spare you in the future.

233
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,080
Our brotherhood

234
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,880
ends

235
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,400
now.

236
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,440
My master bought this place.

237
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,520
It is now private property.

238
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,240
You must not go in, sir.

239
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,360
I wanted to visit a familiar place.

240
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,120
I didn't know
this place had another owner.

241
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,920
Forgive me.

242
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,040
Did you use to live here, sir?

243
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,000
Yes.

244
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,920
I was

245
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,920
a superintendent of this residence.

246
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,520
This courtyard

247
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,880
must have been exquisite in the past.

248
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,360
I wonder who once owned this residence.

249
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,960
Two brothers lived here.

250
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,040
The elder brother was the owner.
He was highly respected in Chang'an.

251
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,720
The younger brother

252
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,760
was more or less educated
and well-mannered.

253
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,200
He always followed his elder brother.

254
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,080
Look at this pear tree.

255
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,160
When winter gave way to spring,

256
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,920
it'd be full of pear blossoms.

257
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,320
When the sun set,

258
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,400
the courtyard would be bright
and full of guests.

259
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,520
All the officials would be sitting there,
sipping tea and drinking wine.

260
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,720
As for me,

261
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,880
I would play
with my master's two children.

262
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,080
It was so lively.

263
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,400
So how has this residence
fallen into such decline?

264
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,640
Young man, are you still

265
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,600
in your twenties…

266
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,160
Anyway, you are still young.

267
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,000
In your life,
there are many things you cannot control.

268
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,560
A couple of days ago,

269
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,960
I suddenly remembered I had left something
in this residence.

270
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,080
Can you do me a favor?

271
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,000
Help yourself, then.

272
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,760
Thank you.

273
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,400
Uncle! My father is still breathing!

274
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,680
Find a physician, quickly!

275
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,760
Father!

276
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,720
It seems like a blade.

277
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,040
When I had hardships,
I dealt with them with this blade.

278
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,520
Now, I'm having another hardship.

279
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,640
So I'm retrieving it for good luck.

280
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,680
A hardship?

281
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,320
Like killing someone?

282
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,520
Your guess

283
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,600
is close enough.

284
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,840
Behave now.

285
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,760
Otherwise, you will die a cruel death.

286
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,640
LAMB STEW WITH BREAD

287
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,520
Enjoy your meal.

288
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,760
Sir, please step inside.

289
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,200
Sir, shared tables are not permitted.

290
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,080
Why don't you sit inside?

291
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,640
There are many empty seats.

292
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,000
Hey, you.

293
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,360
I'm talking to you. Did you not hear me?

294
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,920
- Sir.
- How did you lose him?

295
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,600
Before leaving Anfu Gate,

296
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,400
at the palace steps,

297
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,120
Someone in a black robe stopped me.

298
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,160
He killed and wounded 17 of our men

299
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,880
and took the deposed emperor away.

300
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,920
<i>Survivors say</i>

301
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,880
<i>they wounded him in four places,</i>
<i>at least, with a blade.</i>

302
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,200
<i>The blades were poisoned.</i>

303
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,840
<i>Our men are posted</i>
<i>at all 12 gates of Chang'an.</i>

304
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,720
<i>No one has sighted him.</i>

305
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,280
Chang'an might have a million families,

306
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,480
but there aren't many places
that can harbor a martial arts expert.

307
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,200
Besides, he is hurt

308
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,520
and has an important person with him.

309
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,320
Only a few physicians
can treat the poison on our army's blades.

310
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,400
Keep investigating.

311
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,960
Yes, sir.

312
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,280
- Master.
- Mr. Long.

313
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,080
ZHU ZHILONG

314
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,120
Every time you send a letter,
you tell me how you

315
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,680
endure hardships and wander in suffering.

316
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,240
Looking at your physique,
it seems like you're doing well.

317
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,160
Master, Huai'an has nine lives.

318
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,080
He is very well.

319
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,120
On the other hand, I, your disciple,
almost lost my life.

320
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,720
If you died that easily,

321
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,600
it means I've misjudged you

322
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,360
and sent someone useless
to protect Huai'an.

323
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,840
I'm fine. I'm your disciple after all.

324
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,880
Is he the one?

325
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,680
A fine choice for the puppet.

326
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,040
Identical body size.

327
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,200
Come in.

328
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,480
You must wait a little longer.

329
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,360
He…

330
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,080
He is quite well.

331
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,880
What illness does he have?

332
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,640
He isn't ill.

333
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,080
He just

334
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,280
can't open his mouth
and ingest food or water.

335
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,120
He is kept alive only
by drip-feeding the medicine I concocted.

336
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,520
Why are you doing this?

337
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,000
To raise a new skin

338
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,200
for your appearance.

339
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,360
The Huben Army is looking for you.

340
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,800
From now on,

341
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,360
you can never
show your real face to others.

342
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,600
Otherwise, your life will be in danger

343
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,280
wherever you are.

344
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,280
You need to forget

345
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,160
about yourself.

346
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:32,920
It's his turn now.

347
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,640
Ye Zheng, give him a Breath-holding Pill.

348
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,400
No, I…

349
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,840
Wait.

350
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,560
- Open your mouth.
- Can you wait?

351
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,800
Wait.

352
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,200
This face suits him.

353
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,760
So long as he stays silent,
no one will grow suspicious of him.

354
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,800
Changing his face is just the first step.

355
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,040
His movements and bearing

356
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,520
must slowly change

357
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,840
until every move of his

358
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,600
resembles the other person
to complete the transformation.

359
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,080
If the Huben Army knows
the deposed emperor is here,

360
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,480
they will surely come here.

361
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,280
In the end,

362
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,800
Yan Fengshan will also appear.

363
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,040
This is my final opportunity.

364
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,440
Don't play with fire and burn yourself.

365
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,200
The Huben Army might just assassinate you

366
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,960
before you can successfully
lure out Yan Fengshan.

367
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,160
I've steeled myself for death

368
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,920
since the day I returned to Chang'an.

369
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,880
Master.

370
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,120
DEPOSED EMPEROR

371
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,920
ZHANG MO

372
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,000
SINGING-STRING TAVERN

373
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,400
I've looked at a few residences
around here.

374
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,680
This is the most suitable one.

375
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,880
The gate in front can be guarded,
and there's a rear exit.

376
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,800
More importantly,
there are fine restaurants around here.

377
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,000
There's a market north of this place,
and the Tangshui Alley is not far.

378
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,160
There's enough foot traffic here.
Being watched will not be a problem.

379
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,360
The south of this place

380
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,760
is next to the residents
of Chengqing Neighborhood.

381
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,120
It's calm too.

382
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,840
Wonderful.

383
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,920
The patron is satisfied.

384
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,040
What say you, Mo, the pageboy?

385
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,600
Me?

386
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,080
I think

387
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,200
it's not bad.

388
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,600
Your Majesty,

389
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,720
you exposed yourself
with your reaction just now.

390
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,440
Remember, you are now the pageboy, Mo.

391
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,400
<i>Your every movement and manner</i>

392
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,520
must match the other person.

393
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,600
Your Majesty, you do look the part now.

394
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,880
Like whom?

395
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,200
Like a servant.

396
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,520
I misspoke.

397
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,720
It is all right.

398
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,720
I am a servant.

399
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,080
A prisoner.

400
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,760
Xie and the rest

401
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,200
are doing this for Your Majesty's
own good.

402
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,920
No one in this world

403
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,240
treats another well without reason.

404
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,360
Xie Huai'an cares too much

405
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,080
about his own interests in this.

406
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,360
You mustn't tell him about this.

407
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,320
Don't worry. I'm leaving tomorrow.

408
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,360
You're leaving? Where for?

409
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,360
Xie said you had made good progress.

410
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,360
Therefore, I may go home now.
My home is in Huzhou.

411
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,880
Huzhou

412
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,760
is quite far.

413
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,160
My wife gave birth
to a son and a daughter.

414
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,600
We are a family of four.

415
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,240
You are free now.

416
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,000
I envy you.

417
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,960
Young Master, may I come in?

418
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,920
Come in.

419
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,640
I've avoided a reunion with you

420
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,760
because there were people around us.

421
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,320
He is more observant than others.

422
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,080
It's not a good thing
if he finds out about our past.

423
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,480
I appreciate

424
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,400
your concerns.

425
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:40,680
On your 10th birthday,
I prepared a pair of shoes,

426
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,680
wishing you a smooth road ahead.

427
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,600
However…

428
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,080
I was shocked to learn
that you were displaced for years.

429
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,920
I am fortunate to meet you again.

430
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,080
I've prepared another pair for you.

431
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,200
Young Master.

432
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,320
Zhang Mo,

433
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,560
thank you.

434
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,560
Please let me

435
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,120
put them on for you.

436
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,360
I… I was your pageboy.

437
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,120
Please allow me

438
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,640
to serve you

439
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,480
one last time.

440
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,560
This path you've chosen

441
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,880
will be full of hardships.

442
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,920
Forgive me

443
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,000
for not being able to accompany you

444
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,280
along the way.

445
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,200
Mo,

446
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,600
your life

447
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,520
should be your own.

448
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,040
Go back to Huzhou.

449
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,920
Your family

450
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,080
is waiting for you.

451
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,920
If I'm lucky enough to return alive,

452
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,320
remember to prepare a jar
of good wine for me

453
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,560
when I pass by Huzhou.

454
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,400
<i>From now on,</i>

455
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,920
<i>you cannot show your real face to others.</i>

456
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,520
You need to forget about yourself.

457
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,480
You are now the pageboy, Mo.

458
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,040
<i>Your Majesty,</i>

459
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,760
<i>you do look like it now. Like a servant.</i>

460
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,560
I also know you have
your own way of surviving.

461
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,400
But from today onward,

462
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,240
you must survive
with the rules I set for you.

463
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,920
Otherwise, you will die.

464
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,120
Give me something to eat. I'm hungry.

465
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,920
Something edible.

466
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,080
I may go home now.

467
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,480
My wife gave birth to a son
and a daughter.

468
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,040
<i>We are a family of four.</i>

469
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,040
<i>You are free now.</i>

470
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,280
Your Majesty, farewell.

471
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,480
Please be cautious henceforth,
Your Majesty.

472
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,160
Xie is a kind man.

473
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,600
I'm sure he will
find you a good place to stay.

474
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,000
Safe travels.

475
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,280
Mo!

476
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,160
Didn't you want me to be exactly like him?

477
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,880
Take a guess.

478
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,640
Who is the one

479
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,440
lying there now?

480
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,680
Who is it?

481
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,200
You deserve death.

482
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,360
You truly deserve to die.

483
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,240
Mother.

484
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:04,160
Why did you prepare so much food?

485
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,200
- Because Father is coming back.
- Really?

486
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,480
Yes.
Father will soon return from Chang'an.

487
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,560
Father is coming back!

488
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,720
Father is coming back!
