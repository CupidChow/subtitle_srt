1
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,320
General.

2
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,080
The man is here.

3
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,360
Do you have parents or brothers at home?

4
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,000
Do you have any relatives
or friends in your hometown?

5
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,920
General. I am an orphan.

6
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,560
Come.

7
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,280
Come up.

8
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,840
Forget your past and your name.

9
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,080
Remember every word I say.

10
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,760
Your surname is actually Xiao.

11
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,520
A child of the Xiao imperial bloodline
who has been lost outside.

12
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,080
The late emperor once ordered me
to bring you back.

13
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,320
I searched for years.

14
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,440
At last, you may return
to the rightful lineage.

15
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,400
The throne now stands empty.

16
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,320
Chang'an cannot go a single day
without an emperor.

17
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,200
Among the Xiao clan,
you are the only one left.

18
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,840
From this moment on,

19
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,280
you are the emperor of this land.

20
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,560
Is that true?

21
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,240
Of course it is not.

22
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,760
But if I say it is true,

23
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,360
then it is true.

24
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,600
Zhiying.

25
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,280
Dress him in the dragon robe.

26
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,120
See whether it fits or not.

27
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,040
Yes.

28
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,600
Come with me.

29
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,000
AWAKENING AND RETURNING TO PURITY

30
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,440
Do you know

31
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,440
you and I met when we were very young?

32
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,040
It was about 19 years ago.

33
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,920
Yan Fengshan

34
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,440
had not yet turned traitor.

35
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,160
He was cold, cruel,

36
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,200
and not like he is now,

37
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,400
still able to put on a guise of kindness.

38
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,880
At that time,

39
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,720
he adopted a child.

40
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,200
The child came from the northern border.

41
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,040
He had no parents.

42
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,840
Back then,

43
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,399
I saw you.

44
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,600
Back then, your eyes
always looked to the horizon.

45
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,280
Unlike how they are now.

46
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,920
What about me now?

47
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,360
The way you are now,

48
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,320
your eyes see only what's before you.

49
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
A man like that

50
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,080
easily grows obsessed.

51
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,520
You asked what tricks I have.

52
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,400
I have none.

53
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,240
You people are the ones
who control Chang'an.

54
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,160
But I do have a tale I wish to tell you.

55
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,200
It is about your origins
and Yan Fengshan's past.

56
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,240
How many dumplings will you have?

57
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,240
HOUSE SAUCES, SWEETS

58
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,680
Your origins are exactly so.

59
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,080
How you choose

60
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,680
is entirely up to you.

61
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,160
How

62
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,640
can I choose?

63
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,080
To avenge your blood kin is only right.

64
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,600
Let the past 20 years

65
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,560
be treated as no more than a dream.

66
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,840
If you carry out this task,

67
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,560
you may live for six more hours.

68
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,000
If you refuse,
Commander Wang is right outside the door.

69
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,400
He hides his skill deep within.

70
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,920
His blade is the same.

71
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,200
If you cannot pass that door,
you will die here all the same.

72
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,240
AWAKENING AND RETURNING TO PURITY

73
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,400
Xie Huai'an.

74
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,920
Living your whole life this way,

75
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,320
aren't you tired?

76
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,200
What you should ask me

77
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,080
is whether it is right to live this way.

78
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,480
I once believed I was right.

79
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,080
You killed far too many
who should not have died.

80
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,120
I will never let you win.

81
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,880
Whatever you intend to do,

82
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,520
I will never let you succeed.

83
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,480
Do you want to see
Yan Fengshan die with your own eyes?

84
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,400
Nothing would please me more.

85
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,560
My thanks.

86
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,080
Bamboo baskets.

87
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,320
Pork.

88
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,960
All of it is top-quality pork
slaughtered fresh today.

89
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,640
Sir, what would you like?

90
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,000
One and a half jin of hind leg meat,

91
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,680
for making dumplings for two people.

92
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,200
All right. One moment.

93
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,200
I'll give you a discount.

94
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,240
Pack them together.

95
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,560
-Sir. Here you go.
-No need.

96
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,760
You are back, General.

97
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,640
I haven't cooked for you in ages.

98
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,480
I shall practice today,
so I do not get rusty.

99
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,360
The people you assigned
to keep an eye on me

100
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,680
have already been eliminated.

101
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,600
I know. But I did not bother with it.

102
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,760
Xie Huai'an

103
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,560
is laying a trap for me.

104
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,680
That is fine.

105
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,520
I wanted to meet him anyway.

106
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,600
I figured as much.

107
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,640
White Hair is a ruthless man.

108
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,600
For you to return alive

109
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,880
is no small feat.

110
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,840
But I feel he has no tricks left.

111
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,960
He only told me

112
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,720
a piece of the past,

113
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,680
something about my origins.

114
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,800
Then he let me go.

115
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,840
He even asked me

116
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,080
whether I was willing
to make dumplings for you.

117
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,240
The dumplings are cooked,

118
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,080
General, do not eat yet.

119
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,480
In strategy,

120
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,280
I am no match for Xie Huai'an.

121
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,360
But I am not foolish enough

122
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,480
to let a piece of the past

123
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,920
erase the years I have spent
following you.

124
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,680
I waited for you here,

125
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,840
simply to ask for clarity.

126
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,840
I never spoke of the past to you
not because I did not want you to know,

127
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,000
but because I did not want
to remember it myself.

128
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,200
Since matters have come to this,

129
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,960
I shall tell you.

130
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,320
Twenty-five years ago,
in the northern borderlands,

131
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,440
there was a place called Chen Valley.

132
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,680
We called it Chen Valley,

133
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,920
but the Tiemo people called that place
Mingshanzi Gorge.

134
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,840
A tiny patch of land,

135
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,160
yet we and the Tiemo people
fought over it seven times.

136
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,480
In the final battle, we lost.

137
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,320
My soldiers and I were captured

138
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,600
and locked inside
the Tiemo army's granary,

139
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,320
waiting quietly for death.

140
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,160
The Tiemo people were toying
with the prisoners.

141
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,040
Each time they lowered the food,
there was less than before.

142
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,120
The last time,
they dropped only one steamed bun…

143
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,080
and one knife.

144
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,520
It seemed only I understood

145
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,920
that no matter how much food
the Tiemo people gave us,

146
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,840
none of us would survive
until the day they opened the granary.

147
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,840
Unless the Tiemo people
believed we were all dead.

148
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,640
So I killed every last one of them.

149
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,040
After that, many more days passed.

150
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,240
After I killed all the Tiemo people,

151
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,520
I wandered across the wasteland
for a long time.

152
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,520
At that time, I felt like a ghost,

153
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,800
not knowing where I should go,

154
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,560
not knowing
whether I even deserved to live.

155
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,040
I walked for a very long time.

156
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,560
At last, I returned to my own land.

157
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,840
A farming couple took me in.

158
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,960
They were not afraid of me.

159
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,960
Instead they gave me a bowl of hot rice.

160
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,720
Here, sir, do not be shy. Eat quickly.

161
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,600
Treat this as your own home.

162
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,000
Yes, sir, I still have some meat here.

163
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,200
It will be ready soon.

164
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,840
Go on, eat. There is more in the pot.

165
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,680
At that time,

166
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,600
or perhaps for many years after,

167
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,600
I had not truly stepped out
of that granary.

168
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,760
I believed that only by killing everyone

169
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,640
could I earn a single meal.

170
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,280
That child was you.

171
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,560
This story, is it the same
as the one White Hair told you?

172
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,280
If I had died in that granary,

173
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,640
or if your parents had not taken me in,

174
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,640
you would never have become a member
of the Huben Army.

175
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,000
The village where you were born
stood on a sunny hillside.

176
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,680
You could have been a farmer,

177
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,120
and after a day of work,
you could still go home to eat dumplings,

178
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,160
with your parents not yet old
sitting beside you.

179
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,360
Such a life would have been blessed.

180
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,400
But because of me,

181
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,040
your entire life changed.

182
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,000
So

183
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,280
today White Hair used you
in an attempt to poison me.

184
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,440
To avenge my blood kin is only just.

185
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,680
Let the past 20 years

186
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,160
be treated as a dream.

187
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,600
I do not blame you.

188
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,040
When I was seven,

189
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,599
I learned how to make dumplings.

190
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,880
I even wrapped

191
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,839
a copper coin inside one.

192
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,400
I had hoped you would take it,

193
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,440
and with it I wished you long life,

194
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,599
in peace and in safety.

195
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,040
Xie Huai'an even tried to sway me,

196
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,920
hoping I would come back and poison you.

197
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,600
How could that ever happen?

198
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,080
If not you, how would I be who I am today?

199
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,400
As for those parents,

200
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,800
I never laid eyes on them,

201
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,560
not even for a single day.

202
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,520
Their deaths mean nothing to me.

203
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,520
All these years, the one who raised me

204
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,520
was the General of the Huben Army,

205
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,480
Yan Fengshan.

206
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,080
He wants to watch you die
with his own eyes.

207
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,240
He entered the city with me.

208
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,760
Stop.

209
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,720
-Come here.
-Move these things out.

210
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,000
-Do you have a travel pass?
-Yes.

211
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,680
From Huai'an Commandery.
My surname is Zeng.

212
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,360
-Go on.
-Thank you.

213
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,880
Only three watchtowers nearby
have a view of this courtyard.

214
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,200
A man wearing a fisherman's hat,

215
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,240
with half his face covered,

216
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,480
and a fish maw mask on his upper face,

217
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,360
that is Xie Huai'an.

218
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,560
Before you returned,

219
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,560
I had already sent Zhiying
to hunt him down.

220
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,960
This

221
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,680
is the final plan

222
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,760
I offer to you.

223
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,600
The past

224
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,320
has nothing to do with me.

225
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,960
In this life,

226
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,960
I have no regrets.

227
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:22,080
To die with a father not yet old
beside me,

228
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,480
that is a fine life.

229
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,480
May you live a thousand years

230
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,320
in peace

231
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,320
and safety.

232
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,120
Wang Pu, you are truly foolish.

233
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:58,400
A man like White Hair would never believe
you would poison me.

234
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,960
He merely wanted you to return to my side,

235
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,640
so that I could watch you die
with my own eyes.

236
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,080
General.

237
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,120
The man wearing the fish maw mask
was not Xie Huai'an at all.

238
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,640
Hold your tongue.

239
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,040
We have known each other
for quite some time.

240
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,640
Yet I still failed
to see your true nature.

241
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,960
You would sell out the loyal and upright
and even abet villains

242
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,280
for money.

243
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,240
No wonder this temple has so few devotees.

244
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,840
It is not the location.

245
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,520
It is your wicked heart.

246
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,160
How shall we deal with him?

247
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,840
Mister, spare me. Sir, spare me.

248
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,920
Sir, spare me.

249
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,760
Please stand.

250
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,880
I am but a wanted man.

251
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,880
Your life

252
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,520
is not mine to spare.

253
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,840
You knew my identity long ago.

254
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,080
You waited and observed for a month,

255
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,960
and only when you thought I had gone mad

256
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,640
did you report me.

257
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,960
To have such careful judgment,

258
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,600
sir,

259
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,240
why waste it on a gambling table?

260
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,600
I, Xie Huai'an,

261
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,640
thank you

262
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,080
for taking me in during this time.

263
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,400
Thank you, sir.

264
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,840
Thank you for sparing my life.

265
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,400
-Thank you for sparing my life.
-Go.

266
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,760
Go.

267
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,040
-Commander Wang.
-Here.

268
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,000
Return to the Capital.

269
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,920
Prepare to gather all available men
in the Capital.

270
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,240
Yes.

271
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,640
The Tiemo secret envoy
has already set off.

272
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,960
This is our chance to strike back.

273
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,680
For this day,
I have waited a long time too.

274
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,960
I await your command.

275
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,080
Mr. Long.

276
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,600
You did not visit before,

277
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,200
nor did you send a letter.

278
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,400
There are many people worried about you.

279
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,760
I was watched too closely this time,

280
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,720
so I dared not write rashly.

281
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,240
Please forgive me, Mr. Long.

282
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,960
Come.

283
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,800
I will take you to see
the place your father left behind.

284
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,200
Look here.

285
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,600
I even added a bit more for you.

286
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,120
How is it enough?

287
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,080
Enough.

288
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,240
-That will be seven wen in total.
-All right.

289
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,520
-I packed it for you.
-All right.

290
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
All right then.

291
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,960
Here you go.

292
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,360
-Count it.
-Thank you.

293
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,360
You finally showed up.

294
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,680
What? Did you think I died?

295
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,840
No, no.

296
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,440
Sir,

297
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,200
I have something to attend to…

298
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,120
Come.

299
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,520
Well?

300
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,680
This place is nice, isn't it?

301
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,360
You will never see
scenery like this in Chang'an.

302
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,240
It is practically a paradise.

303
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,120
But this paradise has one flaw.

304
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,640
There is no sunlight.

305
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,680
Without sunlight, there are no crops.

306
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,880
So rice is more expensive than salt here.

307
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,680
Right. This paradise has another flaw.

308
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,600
You cannot see the sun,
so you cannot tell the time.

309
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,400
Rising with the sun and resting at sunset
is impossible here.

310
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,200
The salt shop where you work

311
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,880
has a salt hourglass for time, doesn't it?

312
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,880
How do you know that?

313
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,440
And the shops along the street
also have hourglasses for timing.

314
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,680
You know that too?

315
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,920
Have you been here before?

316
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,960
Using hourglasses to keep time
was an assignment from Mr. Wu Zhongheng

317
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,920
back when we were at the Grand Academy.

318
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,840
If I remember correctly,

319
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,640
you pretended to be sick
and never handed in your work.

320
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,280
And you…

321
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,640
Still pretending?

322
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,160
The hourglass in your shop
is the result of my assignment.

323
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,880
My father originally

324
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,480
designed this Cangshui River

325
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,120
because there was no daylight here,

326
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,440
which was why he moved everything inside.

327
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,000
Since there is me, why must there be you?

328
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,200
-Zheng.
-Look who is here.

329
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,400
Who else could it be?

330
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,160
Isn't that Xie Huai'an?

331
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,480
Why are you so cold?

332
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,240
It has been a long time.

333
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,640
I know.

334
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,800
It is because he came to see me first,

335
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,840
is that right?

336
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,880
Thank you for going to the trouble.
We just met.

337
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,560
Yet we spoke of strategy.

338
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,040
Do you want to hear the plan?

339
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,400
Come with me.

340
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,960
I will tell you slowly.

341
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,360
Little one.

342
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,040
No. When did you ever talk about strategy?

343
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,000
-You're the little one.
-Little Mo.

344
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,080
Get lost.

345
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,080
Chang'an is now sealed tight.

346
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,920
Yan Fengshan and the Huben Army
control everything.

347
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,160
But the civil court is still running,

348
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,840
so the people of Chang'an
have not been pushed to outrage.

349
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,400
The troops of Xiao Wuyang outside the city

350
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,160
are surrounded by
the four regional military commanders.

351
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,920
But they have not cut off supplies.

352
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,120
Otherwise the Wuyang Army
would fight to the last.

353
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,480
Yan Fengshan is truly capable.

354
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,520
He restrains the troops
without provoking war,

355
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,840
and controls the city
without stirring public anger.

356
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,480
If you ask me,

357
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,280
he is so capable,
he might as well make himself emperor.

358
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,320
He has held power for years,

359
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,040
and the people of Chang'an are used to it.

360
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,920
Now, he props up a fake emperor
to keep things calm.

361
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,440
If he suddenly declared himself emperor,

362
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,200
it would not benefit him at all.

363
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,080
He can still weigh the scales properly.

364
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,400
Isn't there a large army in the north?

365
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,400
The Baiwenhu main force.

366
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,360
The northern Baiwenhu Army.

367
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,600
They will not march south unless summoned.

368
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,720
This was once

369
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,080
my father's pact with the Gu family.

370
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,800
So when my brother attacked Chang'an
back then,

371
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,920
Gu Yu only brought 1,000 personal guards.

372
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,120
But look at the situation now.

373
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,880
Xie Huai'an,

374
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,920
if you need an imperial summons

375
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,080
I can give it to you.

376
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,400
With the situation as it is,

377
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,160
even if you wrote me an imperial edict
to summon them,

378
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,880
I would have no way
to send it to the north.

379
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,920
If we acted now,

380
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,960
your identity would be exposed
and everything would collapse.

381
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,960
Yan Fengshan is colluding
with the Tiemo people.

382
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,040
The Tiemo have stationed

383
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,840
a massive army in the northern borderlands
to deal with the Baiwenhu Army.

384
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,920
If the Baiwenhu Army marched south,

385
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,400
the entire heartland of the empire

386
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,600
would be opened to the Tiemo.

387
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,120
Yan Fengshan is deeply entangled with
the Tiemo.

388
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,840
So next,

389
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,000
how should we take him down?

390
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,560
The Tiemo people and Yan Fengshan

391
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,040
are not perfectly united.

392
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,880
Now that the Tiemo envoy has come south,

393
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,480
he is heading to Chang'an
to negotiate with Yan Fengshan.

394
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,640
This is our best chance.

395
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,640
I guess

396
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,320
Yan Fengshan will first cede land

397
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,160
in the far north

398
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,600
and use it

399
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,120
to bribe the Tiemo people

400
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,040
in exchange for their attack
on the Baiwenhu Army.

401
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,600
Once the Baiwenhu Army is defeated,

402
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,200
there will be no army left
to stand against Yan Fengshan.

403
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,320
Gu Yu.

404
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,000
Is Gu Yu still alive?

405
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,720
If he is,

406
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,680
you must send him to the north at once,

407
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,240
because only then will the Tiemo people
fail to defeat the Baiwenhu Army.

408
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,360
As to Gu Yu's life or death,

409
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,440
I am not certain.

410
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,200
And your brother?

411
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,320
Mr. Long says he can wake up,

412
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,960
but no one knows when.

413
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,320
How did you know I was awake?

414
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,960
I could see it.

415
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,120
I just could not guess

416
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,600
why you pretended to be unconscious.

417
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,880
I was not pretending.

418
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,240
Each day

419
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,360
I am only awake for a brief moment.

420
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,720
It feels like being in a dream,
doesn't it?

421
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:28,960
In the dream

422
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,160
it was the road
you had never wanted to take.

423
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,760
A brush with death,

424
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,240
I've been there too.

425
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,320
A long palace corridor.

426
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,600
Gu Yu and the Baiwenhu Army

427
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,080
pushed me out the door

428
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,280
and got farther and farther away from me.

429
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,960
The path by which I survived

430
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,000
was the path

431
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,680
I least wished to walk in my life.

432
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,440
Wumei once told me

433
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,280
that back then you were one step

434
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,200
from death.

435
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I do not blame you.

436
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,680
So

437
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,320
Xiao Wuyang

438
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,280
can die after all.

439
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,080
White Hair.

440
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,160
If one day I truly die,

441
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,600
will you, like your forefathers,

442
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,920
support the imperial clan?

443
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,440
I know

444
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,080
that is not where your ambition lies.

445
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,320
But you must care for the realm.

446
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,000
Heaven has given you such wisdom.

447
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,080
You must use it

448
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,320
to serve all the people.

449
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,040
But my father

450
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,800
once did exactly that.

451
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,920
And you must not die either.

452
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,640
Heaven has given you such skill,

453
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,600
and you too

454
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,200
should give back to all the people.

455
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,000
I will not.

456
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,640
Before Yan Fengshan dies,

457
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,840
I, Xiao Wuyang,

458
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,920
will not die.

459
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:05,400
Do not tell anyone
that I wake for brief moments

460
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,200
each day,

461
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,040
including

462
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,720
your pageboy outside the door.

463
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,200
Why did you stay in there
for so long before coming out?

464
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,240
Did my brother wake up?

465
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,360
I just figured out…

466
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,000
You'd figured out how to deal with them?

467
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,840
Once the Tiemo envoy

468
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,000
enters Chang'an,

469
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,160
I will make him disappear
for one night right under Huben's nose.

470
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,200
During that night,

471
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,640
you will meet with him.

472
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,800
Me?

473
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,640
If Yan Fengshan and the Tiemo
can negotiate,

474
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,320
why can't you?

475
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,880
Do not forget.

476
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,040
You are the Emperor.

477
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,080
The detailed plan

478
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,840
will be given to you
after you enter Chang'an.

479
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,640
What?

480
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,720
Are you scared?

481
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,880
When the nation is in peril,

482
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,160
even common folk have a duty.

483
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,960
How could I not?

484
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,600
I am not afraid.

485
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,760
You have improved.

486
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,120
Huai'an, we just met again.

487
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,440
Must we leave so soon?

488
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,720
Can't you rest for one night?

489
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,880
Gu Yu's life is uncertain.

490
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,360
I must go and find the truth.

491
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,120
There are other arrangements in the city
that cannot be delayed.

492
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,520
Take these.

493
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,320
You need money to buy medicine and salt.

494
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,920
Stop stealing the shopkeeper's salt.

495
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,600
That salt shopkeeper is a good man.

496
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,920
His scale gives 16.5 liang to a jin.

497
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,720
He says it's to help those in need.

498
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,560
And now I too am someone in hardship.

499
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,880
But once life gets better,

500
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,880
I'll repay him someday.

501
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:54,880
All right.

502
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,360
I am leaving.

503
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,800
Wait.

504
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,560
Look at the time.

505
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,760
It is already dark outside.

506
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,240
The road back to Chang'an
is long and dark.

507
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,040
Take a lantern.

508
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,240
Take care.

509
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,080
Thanks.

510
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,440
All of you live well.

511
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,240
You are not going back?

512
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,200
No.

513
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,560
I am going for a drink.

514
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,360
-Come on.
-What?

515
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,200
You know,

516
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,520
stealing salt is a job that suits you.

517
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,320
Wuyang,

518
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,880
please have mercy.

519
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,840
Wake quickly, I beg you.

520
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,160
If you wake up,

521
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,280
I won't have to go to that execution trap
Xie Huai'an arranged.

522
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,600
I am begging you. I am really scared.
