1
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,880
-Stay still!
-Let me go!

2
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,840
-Let me go!
-You finally showed up.

3
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,760
You must be the other survivor
of that slaughtered clan.

4
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,680
Today…

5
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,640
WEI QIANTING, HUBEN ARMY

6
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,840
…the circle is complete.

7
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,160
I am the other survivor.

8
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,240
Come on.

9
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,120
Why did that man come for me?

10
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,080
He is a man guilty of every evil.

11
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,840
You were just unlucky to cross his path.

12
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,880
It's all over now.

13
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,520
This one. Into the water?

14
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,120
Into the earth.

15
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,160
I told you, we met by chance.

16
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,080
I just saved you from being killed
as I was passing by.

17
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,160
Finish this cake, then you may go.

18
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,400
Sir, I'm worried about you.

19
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,680
You saved me and killed someone.

20
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,400
I'm afraid you'll get into trouble.

21
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,440
Don't worry.

22
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,800
Even if I do, I can slip away.

23
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,560
They won't be able to kill me.

24
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,680
Can you promise that?

25
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,560
Of course I can.

26
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,600
Then will you write to me
to tell me you're safe?

27
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,920
Wherever you go,

28
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,000
write to me every year,

29
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,600
so I know you're safe.

30
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,840
I'm going to a place called Huainan.

31
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,200
Once I'm settled there,

32
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,640
I'll write to you.

33
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,480
Pinky swear.

34
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,520
Thank you for saving her, sir.

35
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,000
-Thank you for saving her.
-Thank you.

36
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,400
We'll take our leave.

37
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,280
-Wan, let's go home.
-Thank you.

38
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,400
Come on.

39
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,120
I don't understand.

40
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,480
She's your sister,
yet you let her join another family.

41
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,080
You've been a boatman here

42
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,080
for seven years, three li from her family,

43
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,160
just to protect her from afar.

44
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,720
How long can you keep this up?

45
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,000
I don't know.

46
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,120
I only hope

47
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,200
she never remembers her past.

48
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,760
GENERAL LIU ZIWEN

49
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,480
I thought you would never
fall asleep in front of others.

50
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,760
I am a bit tired.

51
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,440
The sounds and the people here

52
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,560
make me feel

53
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,200
like I'm at home.

54
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,520
Back in Nanwei Trough,

55
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,480
it was like this too.

56
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,480
The sounds of Father chopping wood,

57
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,440
of Mother clattering at the stove,

58
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,440
and of my sister and me quarrelling.

59
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,440
Are they well?

60
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,280
They're very well.

61
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,120
All these years,

62
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,600
they've never forgotten

63
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,960
that you saved me.

64
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,960
Whenever your letters came,

65
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,360
I'd tell them whatever
I could safely share.

66
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,960
As for how you

67
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,880
traveled alone to avenge your family,

68
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,600
I didn't dare tell them.

69
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,880
Right,

70
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,040
it would've frightened them.

71
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,640
No,

72
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,200
I was afraid they'd feel for you

73
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,360
yet have no way to help.

74
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,640
Huai'an,

75
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,240
in a family,

76
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,600
people care for one another.

77
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,120
From the moment you saved me,

78
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,640
we became family.

79
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,000
Why aren't you chopping wood?

80
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,720
Am I such an annoyance to you?

81
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,120
Or did I do something wrong?

82
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,680
We've fought side by side
and risked our lives together,

83
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,600
yet when I show up,

84
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,880
you won't even open your eyes.

85
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,000
I know who she is.

86
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,760
When she was one month old,

87
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,840
that man brought her a protective charm.

88
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,240
I was there too.

89
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,000
And I know why
you never told her the truth.

90
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,040
You did the right thing.

91
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,560
Don't worry. I won't say a word.

92
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,960
I mean it.

93
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,080
You're quick to read faces and flatter.

94
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,320
Growing up in the palace

95
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,120
does give one some sense.

96
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,160
Sense or no sense,

97
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,320
if I had a younger sister,

98
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,400
I wouldn't want her raised amid blood
and turmoil either.

99
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,760
You did the right thing.

100
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,160
Thanks.

101
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,640
It's nothing.

102
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,000
Beautiful.

103
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,560
Shameless.

104
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,520
You aren't asleep?

105
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,160
You slipped into my home without a sound

106
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,800
and wrinkled the handkerchief
I embroidered through the night.

107
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,640
I was going to sell it for ten wen.

108
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,640
Tell me if this

109
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,360
is worth ten wen.

110
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,680
-You did it?
-Of course.

111
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,960
Are you sure he's dead?

112
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,400
Of course.
His body was riddled like a hornet's nest.

113
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,320
Satisfied?

114
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,280
What's wrong?

115
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,360
I'm not sure I've read your face right.

116
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,560
Your enemy is dead.
Shouldn't you be happy?

117
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,880
I hired you to kill for me,

118
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,600
yet you never took a single coin.

119
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,440
Still,

120
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,880
I work day and night,

121
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,320
weaving and embroidering nonstop.

122
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,280
Do you know why that is?

123
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,800
Because

124
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,040
you want to buy a house in Chang'an?

125
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,840
Because doing the same thing every day

126
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,200
keeps me from remembering the past.

127
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,200
Time passes a little faster that way.

128
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,680
IN MEMORY OF MADAM ZHU, HONORED
WITH DEVOTION BY HER DAUGHTER ZHAOLU

129
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,600
Mother, did you hear that?

130
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,280
We got our revenge.

131
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,080
There.

132
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,360
Excellent.

133
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,320
Doing my hair like this
is what I'm worst at.

134
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,560
Thank you, Miss Bai Wan.

135
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,400
Zhaolu's work is truly exceptional.

136
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,520
The work, the cut…

137
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,080
They even make me look dashing.

138
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,760
Yes, she has skill.

139
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,200
You even look human in them.

140
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,360
I'm seeing her later.

141
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,720
What gift should I bring?

142
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,760
She's a seamstress.

143
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,240
Give her a fine bolt of silk.

144
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm sure she'll like it.

145
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,320
But a surprise shows more thought.

146
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,400
The clothes look good.

147
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,600
Of course.

148
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,240
You made them.

149
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,040
You aren't so bad either.

150
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,840
Of course not.

151
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,880
You picked me.

152
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,160
So mushy.

153
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,240
He said he'd bring her something.
Look at those empty hands.

154
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,800
He already did.

155
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,440
Goodbye.

156
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,480
This is for you.

157
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,640
Is this the gift you prepared
for my departure?

158
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,200
I don't know what you like.

159
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,720
Anyway, the world is wide.

160
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,920
In the days ahead, take care of yourself.

161
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,080
Don't let hatred bind you anymore.

162
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,680
I'll remember that.

163
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,960
All these years in Chang'an,

164
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,560
meeting you

165
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,280
has been my greatest fortune.

166
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,520
Mine as well.

167
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,040
I came to see off my friend.

168
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,680
It's fine that you came along,

169
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,200
but why is he here?

170
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,320
Yes.

171
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,720
If no one keeps an eye on him
and he slips away,

172
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,360
he'll be a corpse when we find him again.

173
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,800
You really can't say a single kind word.

174
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,560
I thought you were going to propose,

175
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,480
so I came to back you up.

176
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,080
Who knew you'd just send her away?

177
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,960
Why do you all think I came to propose?

178
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,160
Do I look like someone who is sentimental?

179
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,240
I'm a swordsman.

180
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,480
A swordsman!
My life hangs by a thread every day.

181
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,200
A man like me can love many women.

182
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,120
Fine, I admit it.

183
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,960
I do like her.

184
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,360
But she came to Chang'an alone

185
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,680
for revenge and nothing else.

186
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,680
How much room could she possibly
have in her heart for me?

187
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,240
Besides,

188
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,680
I don't want her following me
into danger after danger.

189
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,080
It's better

190
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,640
to let go.

191
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,640
The world is wide.

192
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,800
If fate allows, we'll meet again.

193
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,160
Come on.

194
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,800
Besides Xiaoqing,

195
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,040
do you have any other friends in Chang'an?

196
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,760
When I was a student,
I had a few classmates I could talk to.

197
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:15,720
But most of them
took up official positions,

198
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,840
and we gradually lost touch.

199
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,480
Xiaoqing is your messenger,

200
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,240
but we get along well.

201
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,160
Having one or two people

202
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,480
you truly connect with is already enough.

203
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,880
Aside from painting,

204
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,520
what else

205
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,400
do you do?

206
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,840
I like the bustle of the marketplace.

207
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,960
Watching folks

208
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,480
choose their vegetables,

209
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,160
their meat,

210
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,600
and their clothes
is amusement enough for me.

211
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,160
Sometimes, I run into an old man

212
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,240
playing the flute on the street.

213
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,800
When I do, I sit beside him

214
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,120
and listen from dusk

215
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,760
until night falls.

216
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,680
Before Mr. Yang's death,

217
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,360
the Chang'an I saw

218
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,080
was ordinary

219
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,040
and real.

220
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,880
I came to Chang'an by chance.

221
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,240
After what happened in the reed marsh,

222
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,240
my parents sought help everywhere

223
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,000
and finally sent me here to study.

224
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,680
It was, in truth,

225
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,520
to shield me from danger.

226
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,560
As I grew older,

227
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,280
they finally felt safe
letting me live here alone.

228
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,840
Your family

229
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,720
must miss you very much.

230
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,640
Yes.

231
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,880
We haven't met for a year or two.

232
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,000
I miss them.

233
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,560
I should go home and see them.

234
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,920
Having family

235
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,040
and people you care about

236
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,160
is a fortunate thing.

237
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,320
If you hadn't kept in touch with me,

238
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,760
those trying to kill me

239
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,520
would never have found you.

240
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,840
Seven years ago, in the reed marsh,

241
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,880
your parents

242
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,560
nearly lost their daughter.

243
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,680
I understand

244
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,560
what you're saying.

245
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,240
But I'm a simple person.

246
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,240
If I choose to leave,

247
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,040
it's because I want to leave.

248
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,680
It has nothing to do
with whether Chang'an is safe.

249
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,760
And if I want to stay,

250
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,080
no one can drive me away.

251
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,520
Wan,

252
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,440
you're as stubborn

253
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,160
as when you were a child.

254
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,960
But this time,

255
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,560
I truly must go.

256
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,400
With my teacher gone,

257
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,920
my parents and sister
are surely worried about me.

258
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,560
I have to go home

259
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,200
so they know I'm safe.

260
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,760
From when we met seven years ago

261
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,120
until our reunion now,

262
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,960
your life has been filled
with blood and danger.

263
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,280
This painting of you

264
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,600
represents my wish for you.

265
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,240
I hope you can tend flowers,

266
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,320
keep a cat,

267
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,920
nap on the porch,

268
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,480
and live a peaceful life,

269
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,640
even for just one day.

270
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,240
I don't have the time to live like this

271
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,200
for a full day,

272
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,280
but even half a day would be something.

273
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,120
Mutton!

274
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,160
What would you like?

275
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,560
Fresh mutton!

276
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,880
Sesame seed cakes!

277
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,840
Hot sesame seed cakes!

278
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,440
All fresh out of the oven!

279
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,720
-Sesame seed cakes!
-Sir, how much for the cakes?

280
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,080
Two wen each.

281
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,880
-I'll take two.
-All right.

282
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,560
-Here are your cakes.
-Thank you.

283
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,120
Here you are, miss.

284
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,040
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

285
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,120
-All right.
-Here.

286
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,000
All right. Come again.

287
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,480
Come on.

288
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,240
The dishes are ready.

289
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,480
Coming!

290
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,720
This courtyard hasn't been this lively
in a long time. Thank you.

291
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,880
Not true.

292
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,560
When he was injured here last time,

293
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,200
the place was crawling
with Imperial Guards. It was…

294
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,560
Now,

295
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,040
Bai Wan is leaving tomorrow.

296
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,440
Let's have a proper gathering tonight
before she leaves.

297
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,560
Cheers.

298
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,400
Things had just started
getting better for me…

299
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,720
Drink your wine. Why so much nonsense?

300
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,960
Complete your missions,

301
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,440
and your good days will come.

302
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:03,960
Eat.

303
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,360
I'm relieved to hear you say that.

304
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,840
In your letters,
you always wrote that you were alone.

305
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,120
Now you have friends around you.

306
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,840
I'll see you off tomorrow.

307
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,040
So will I. I…

308
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,800
I'm at your command.

309
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,320
I'm glad you'll see me off.

310
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,880
But I still feel reluctant to leave
and somewhat regretful.

311
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,120
Nanwei Trough isn't far.

312
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,760
It's not like you can't come back.

313
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,640
My regret

314
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,160
is that I didn't find my family
in Chang'an.

315
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,800
But I've come to understand now

316
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,200
that in a city this vast,

317
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,480
I may never find him

318
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,520
in this lifetime.

319
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,360
I've been carrying a secret

320
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,400
that only my parents and sister know.

321
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,000
I was not born to my parents.

322
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,560
They took me in.

323
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,080
When I was very young,

324
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,960
in a bitter winter,

325
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,160
a man brought me to the reed marsh.

326
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,440
I can no longer remember his face,
his age,

327
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,200
or whether he was my father,

328
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,000
uncle,

329
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,800
or brother.

330
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,040
I only remember

331
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,360
that he told me
he was going to get a bowl of hot soup,

332
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,680
so we

333
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,040
wouldn't starve to death.

334
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,120
It was so cold

335
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,920
and so late.

336
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,080
I waited a long time.

337
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,280
Brother, I'm so hungry.

338
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,880
Come on.

339
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,280
Hold on a little longer.

340
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,720
We're almost there.

341
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,480
Then I will find you something to eat,

342
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,560
all right?

343
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,520
Sister. Hey.

344
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,520
Listen.

345
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,920
Stay here and wait for me.

346
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I'll go look for some hot soup
and something to eat.

347
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,520
Once you're full, you won't feel cold,

348
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,440
YOUNG BAI WAN

349
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,800
and we can keep going.

350
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,280
If someone comes, hide in the reeds.

351
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,640
Don't make a sound,

352
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,360
and don't run away.

353
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,960
I'll be back soon.

354
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,800
Do you understand?

355
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,880
Wrap yourself well. Now get inside.

356
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,960
I saw a light in the distance.

357
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,520
It was so far away,

358
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,360
yet somehow I felt

359
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,120
it could warm me.

360
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,320
So I walked toward the house

361
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,800
where that light was shining.

362
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,840
That is my earliest memory.

363
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,800
From then on,

364
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,920
I became the younger daughter
of that family.

365
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,320
They told me the truth about my origins,

366
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,840
yet still treated me as their own.

367
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,080
My sister

368
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,360
treated me with great kindness.

369
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,400
But I know

370
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,960
and remember

371
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,160
that I was the one who left him behind.

372
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,160
I chose to leave.

373
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,960
And the price was

374
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,160
losing my only family member,

375
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,200
forgetting my origins,

376
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,920
my surname,

377
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,240
and my given name,

378
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,320
and never knowing

379
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,080
whether the family who lost their daughter

380
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,320
would go on

381
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,760
to live a good life.

382
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,400
That is my regret.

383
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,600
My life began with a wrong parting.

384
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,840
Life

385
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,240
is not built only on mistakes.

386
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,440
Sometimes just staying alive

387
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,400
is a kind of fortune.

388
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,840
I'm fine. Years have passed.

389
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,720
When I was unconscious,

390
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,040
I vaguely heard

391
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,520
that you've carried this charm

392
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,160
for as long as you can remember.

393
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,000
Perhaps

394
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,760
it is your only link
to your original family.

395
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,600
You are about to travel far.

396
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,120
Take it back.

397
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,440
Keep it with you,

398
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,040
as if your family is still by your side.

399
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,600
Why do you all look so downcast?

400
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,600
Come on.

401
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,120
Raise your cups.

402
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,760
Bai Wan leaves tomorrow.

403
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,960
May she go safely and fare well,

404
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,760
and may everything go her way.

405
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,240
Sister! Sister!

406
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,000
Look what I brought…

407
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,920
Sister?

408
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,960
Sister!

409
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,320
Sister!

410
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,480
Sister!

411
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,880
You must be starving. Eat this first.

412
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,040
I'll heat a bowl of noodle soup for you.

413
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,400
Here.

414
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,200
-Eat.
-Let's what your hands first.

415
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,280
Stay with us.

416
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,280
-We'll look for your family.
-Your hands are ice cold.

417
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,440
-If we can't find them,
-Here.

418
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,840
-then you'll be our child.
-Wash your hands.

419
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,800
-Try one.
-Here.

420
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,240
Slow down.

421
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,560
-Have another bite.
-Your face is burning red.

422
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,640
Slow down…

423
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,960
Don't choke.

424
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,160
Huai'an,

425
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,360
I'm an outsider,
and even I can't stand it.

426
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,560
Are you really not going
to tell Bai Wan you're her brother?

427
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,960
Turns out she's been carrying
this regret all this time.

428
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,840
Why don't you just tell her

429
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,720
you've been guarding her
in secret all these years?

430
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,160
Let's go.

431
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,639
My sister is returning.

432
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,400
Eliminate the remnant.

433
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,840
This one. Into the water?

434
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,480
Into the earth.

435
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,160
How is your mood today?

436
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:18,240
Do I get cooked food or raw?

437
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,320
Back then,

438
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,640
you wouldn't even spare a little girl.

439
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,440
These years underground
are the punishment her brother gave you.

440
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,520
It ends today.

441
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,320
It's been seven years.

442
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,440
I can finally die.

443
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,920
Your family gave me so much care
all those years.

444
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,560
Now at last I've repaid the debt.

445
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,000
Aside from painting,

446
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,400
what else do you do?

447
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,880
I like the hustle and bustle
of the marketplace.

448
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,280
Watching people buy vegetables,

449
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,240
buy meat,

450
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,040
and choose clothes

451
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,640
is interesting enough to me.

452
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,720
Sometimes, I run into an old man
playing the flute on the street.

453
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,200
When I do,

454
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,840
I sit beside him

455
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,960
and listen from dusk until night falls.

456
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,400
Bai Wan,

457
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,920
write to me once you get home.

458
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,400
Xie Huai'an is unbelievable.

459
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,920
I can put up with his odd temper,
but how could he not come to see her off?

460
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,320
Huai'an doesn't like
saying goodbye in person.

461
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,720
But don't worry.
He'll always keep you in his thoughts.

462
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,520
You don't need to comfort me.

463
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,760
I know what he's like.

464
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,600
He struggles with parting too.

465
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,480
All right then, I'm going.

466
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,720
Take care of yourself.

467
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,520
TASK COMPLETE. ALL IS WELL.
