1
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,240
IMPERIAL PHYSICIAN'S HALL

2
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,600
Xiaoqing,

3
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,680
you're awake.

4
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,640
You were banging around outside.

5
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,520
How could I possibly sleep?

6
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,800
This reminds me of when we were kids.

7
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,680
I wanted to sleep,

8
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,000
but you were outside beating a drum,

9
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,000
telling Master
you were training your arms.

10
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,840
Xiaoqing,

11
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,160
this time,
I didn't wake you up on purpose.

12
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,640
Xiaoqing,

13
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,280
let's leave.

14
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,360
Where to?

15
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,400
I don't know.

16
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,240
But if we stay here,

17
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,040
we'll only become hostages,

18
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,480
and Huai'an and the pageboy
will end up doing things

19
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,920
they don't want to do
just to keep us safe.

20
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,480
With the skills I have,

21
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,320
I can't drag them down, right?

22
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,800
So I want to take you and break out.

23
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,840
Either we die and be done with it,

24
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,360
or we fight our way out.

25
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,200
Sure.

26
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,920
Sounds heroic.

27
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,720
All right.

28
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,040
BATTLE AT CANGSHUI RIVER,
CASUALTIES LIKELY

29
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,400
FRESH HARVEST RICE, GRAIN

30
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,440
Play the prey first.

31
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,600
Then kill the hunter.

32
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,520
Don't.

33
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,000
You won't be able to kill him.

34
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,440
I came to Cangshui River

35
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,520
for this very moment.

36
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,240
Protect His Majesty.

37
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,920
Take him back.

38
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,440
Your Majesty.

39
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,760
You dare to come kill me?

40
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,280
Didn't you say you would
save the greatest advantage for yourself?

41
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,360
Why did you come to Cangshui River?

42
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,800
Once Xiao Wuyang is dead,

43
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,120
the outcome will be set.

44
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,080
Why wouldn't I come?

45
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,440
Killing you will bring peace to the realm.

46
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,360
Why would I not dare to kill you?

47
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,840
Your Majesty.

48
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,680
Kill him.

49
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,680
Understood.

50
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,000
Your Majesty.

51
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,880
You're gravely wounded.

52
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,919
It's nothing. I won't die yet.

53
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,600
Too bad I couldn't cut down Xiao Wuyang.

54
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,159
He is a terrifying opponent.

55
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,000
Xie Huai'an must have
seen through your plan

56
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,280
and warned Xiao Wuyang in advance.

57
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,720
This round is the heavenly calamity
foretold in the divinations.

58
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,400
He could only guess one part of it.

59
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,760
How are things on the other side?

60
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,960
Your Majesty,

61
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,800
you gave me four liang of gold.

62
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,040
Running errands for you cost one.

63
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,200
Killing those Tiemo lackeys
just now cost two.

64
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,240
There's still one liang left.

65
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,400
I can do one more thing for you.

66
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,880
All right.

67
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,000
Go watch over the salt shop's owner.

68
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,880
He and I go way back.

69
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,280
-Now?
-Yes, now.

70
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,680
Keep him safe,

71
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,520
so I'll have no more worries.

72
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,640
Understand?

73
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,600
This guy looks unfamiliar.

74
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,400
Don't worry.

75
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,040
He can't kill me.

76
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,640
Go on.

77
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,440
Fang Genghui… With his swordplay,

78
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,640
would he be able to wound me?

79
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,800
Your Majesty,
you are the one who can turn the tide.

80
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,440
Fang Genghui is nowhere near you.

81
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,040
If he can't harm me,

82
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,080
then he can't harm Xiao Wuyang either.

83
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,920
But that's enough.

84
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,640
It's about time.

85
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,680
Come on, let's finish this.

86
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,920
What's wrong?

87
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,000
Why?

88
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,560
Must you really kill them?

89
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,240
Read the military report

90
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,920
sent to Chang'an yourself.

91
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,080
Compared to what's written there,

92
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,920
a few dead couriers

93
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,600
are nothing.

94
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,480
GUODONG, LEFT GENERAL OF THE BAIWENHU ARMY

95
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,920
On the 11th day of the second month,

96
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,040
Tiemo gathered a force of over 200,000.

97
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,400
They crossed the border in full force.

98
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,760
The Baiwenhu Army retreated 70 li…

99
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,800
-Charge!
-…in one day.

100
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,600
On the 14th,

101
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,400
Tiemo forces broke through Shifu Pass.

102
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,160
There was no natural defense
in North Office.

103
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,280
NORTH OFFICE

104
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,680
On the 15th,

105
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,240
the North Office fell.

106
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,120
Tiemo's vanguard
was just 1,300 li from Chang'an.

107
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,360
We have waited decades

108
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,560
for this battle.

109
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,760
In the last two generations of Tiemo,

110
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,960
every man as tall
as a horsewhip is a warrior.

111
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,440
With Gu Yu dead, the Baiwenhu Army

112
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,480
lost its commander and its morale.

113
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,240
No one can stop
my warhorses from charging south.

114
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,080
Once past the North Office,

115
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,080
it is the territory
of the regional commanders.

116
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,120
These men long for the empire's collapse

117
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,720
so they can crown themselves kings.

118
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,360
None of them

119
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,520
will send troops to aid Chang'an.

120
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,040
Your nation is destined
to drown in bloodshed.

121
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You keep showing me these reports

122
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,400
and speaking of your great ambitions.

123
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,960
What are you trying to do?

124
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,040
My 200,000 Tiemo warriors may not be able
to trample every corner of your land.

125
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,040
I need you

126
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,000
to be my puppet emperor.

127
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,600
You will be cursed by the people,

128
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,480
but you will at least be able
to keep part of the realm.

129
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,680
When the treaty is signed
between our two nations,

130
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,200
I will leave you half of Chang'an.

131
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,280
My empire is vast,
and you offer me half of Chang'an?

132
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,920
What kind of treaty is this?

133
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,880
You're forcing me
to betray my own country!

134
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,880
Very well.

135
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,280
Either you cooperate,

136
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,760
or I take your land by force.

137
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,600
Go ahead and choose.

138
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,480
Why me?

139
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,480
Because you're not like
your brother Xiao Wuyang.

140
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,200
If it were him, he would drag me down

141
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,000
and perish with me.

142
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,560
So I can only choose you.

143
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,280
Aren't you afraid I'll do the same?

144
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,080
Then I will enthrone a fake emperor
like Yan Fengshan did.

145
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,560
It will make no difference to me.

146
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,520
But you,

147
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,760
born into the imperial clan,

148
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,080
will become a disgrace who never
shouldered the burden of the realm!

149
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,240
An emperor

150
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,160
is fated to loneliness.

151
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,000
Some may understand
that you had no choice,

152
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,079
but in this world,

153
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,800
there are too few wise enough to see it.

154
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,320
CHANGLE OUTPOST

155
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,440
If

156
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,560
I were to agree to your proposal,

157
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,840
what would happen to my brother?

158
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,440
Xiao Wuyang is not easy to kill,

159
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,200
but I have devised a plan,

160
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,080
and you will be my final killing move.

161
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,440
The two of you are brothers by blood.

162
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,160
And when he was gravely injured,
you took care of him.

163
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,040
In this world,

164
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,280
you are the only one

165
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,360
he lets his guard down around.

166
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,040
Very well.

167
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,200
I will be

168
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,880
your puppet emperor.

169
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,960
I did it for Chang'an,

170
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,200
for the realm!

171
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,560
Look at you.

172
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,120
You accomplished something

173
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,360
none of them ever could.

174
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,280
Remember this:

175
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,120
you have grown up.

176
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,240
From today on,

177
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,200
hold your head high.

178
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,400
Remember your own words.

179
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,480
You did it for Chang'an

180
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,520
and for the realm.

181
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,040
I am giving back

182
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,400
to you

183
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,280
what was meant to be yours.

184
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,160
Such lengths I went to

185
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,040
just to kill you.

186
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,440
Indeed.

187
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,840
Such trickery.

188
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,080
Not kingly at all.

189
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,080
Fifteen years ago,

190
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,800
when Yan Fengshan killed Liu Ziwen,

191
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,640
he already knew my identity.

192
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,040
He secretly mobilized the troops

193
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,040
and sealed off the northern front.

194
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,480
My years of effort hiding and planning

195
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,000
went to waste just like that.

196
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,680
So

197
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,880
I traveled alone
toward the northern lands of Tiemo.

198
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,880
That journey home

199
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,200
felt

200
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,480
like a long night
that would never see dawn.

201
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,640
But when I stood again on Tiemo soil,

202
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,080
the people in the ritual hall

203
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,800
came out of Mount Shiluoman

204
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,440
and placed the golden crown

205
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,960
of the Tiemo King on my head.

206
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,640
They believed I could carry Tiemo's hopes

207
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,640
and lead them out of the bitter cold.

208
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,760
So I returned to Chang'an,

209
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,720
locking myself willingly in Yulong Ridge.

210
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,000
That was the beginning
of my path of trickery.

211
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,720
Xiao Wuyang,

212
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,680
you were born into royalty,

213
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,360
while I was born a slave.

214
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,240
We were never the same.

215
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,720
But today,

216
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,120
we are both gravely wounded

217
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,000
and bearing the same solitude

218
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,160
for the realm.

219
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,000
Yes,

220
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,400
Chang'an

221
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,520
is a city many yearn for.

222
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,600
How beautiful it is.

223
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,080
Take one last look at it.

224
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,680
Go on, look.

225
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,840
You can't kill him!

226
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,360
What did you promise me?

227
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,640
You cannot kill him!

228
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,480
I promised you.

229
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,440
As long as he lives,

230
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,840
you will willingly be my puppet.

231
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,840
Isn't that right?

232
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,280
Take him away.

233
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,160
Are you going to make me

234
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,720
live and eat with you

235
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,080
or lock me up the way

236
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,280
you are locking my brother up?

237
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,920
If neither,

238
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,360
then leave me alone for a while.

239
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,000
Your Tiemo shadow guards
are everywhere already.

240
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,720
I cannot escape.

241
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,680
Let him be.

242
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,520
Go.

243
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,440
I will not see you again.

244
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,240
Sir,

245
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,760
I had no choice.

246
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,760
Right. Right.

247
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,000
You had your reasons.

248
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,400
But I am just a common man.

249
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,960
I cannot understand!

250
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,520
I cannot understand

251
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,480
what reason

252
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,920
could make you

253
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,920
stab your own brother!

254
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,000
I cannot understand

255
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,800
why you would side

256
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,680
with the Tiemo people!

257
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,880
I…

258
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,040
I don't need you
to look after me in old age.

259
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,120
You were never my son.

260
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,680
You killed him.

261
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,320
You killed my son.

262
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,760
You killed my son!

263
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,200
Oh, Mo!

264
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,920
He died at the hands of someone like you.

265
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,280
My poor boy!

266
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,360
Get lost.

267
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,120
I'm sorry.

268
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,400
I'm sorry.

269
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,800
I'm sorry!

270
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,200
-Hurry.
-Coming.

271
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,360
Remember your own words.

272
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,440
You did it for Chang'an

273
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,320
and for the realm.

274
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,920
I am giving back

275
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,120
to you

276
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,960
what was meant to be yours.

277
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,480
This battle

278
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,600
has already exposed us.

279
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,960
Should we leave the people
in Cangshui River alive?

280
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,239
There are thousands in Cangshui River

281
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,600
and hundreds of thousands in Chang'an.

282
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,159
You cannot kill them all.

283
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,199
The common folk are livestock.

284
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,840
Hold your blade firmly,
and they will obey you.

285
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,639
Understood.

286
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,560
Any news of Xie Huai'an?

287
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,120
Zhu Zhilong said he held

288
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,880
the greatest authority in Cangshui River,

289
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,159
and that Xie Huai'an's fate
would be decided here.

290
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,639
He was the first
to enter Chang'an with me.

291
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,239
He hid his identity for years,

292
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,560
unafraid of death.

293
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,720
I have never seen him this unsettled.

294
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,760
He fears Your Majesty.

295
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,320
You ordered him to kill Xie Huai'an,
but he failed.

296
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,720
He does not fear me.

297
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,560
He fears Xie Huai'an.

298
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,240
Just now, that boy…

299
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,080
Killing you will bring peace to the realm.

300
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,720
Why would I not dare to kill you?

301
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,240
He was one strike away

302
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,040
from killing me.

303
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,000
We will escort Your Majesty
back to Chang'an.

304
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,400
Leave the matters in Cangshui River
to Zhu Zhilong.

305
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,480
Very well.

306
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,080
I was one strike from killing him.

307
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,640
Then you showed up.

308
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,480
You want Xiao Wuyang alive.

309
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,600
I want the King alive.

310
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,520
You and I are the same.

311
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,560
What about your disciples?

312
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,680
If your king lives,

313
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,800
your disciples will die.

314
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,040
Do you truly feel nothing for them?

315
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,440
I arrived late

316
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,800
because I was gathering men
to go to the clinic.

317
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,320
The King and you have an agreement.

318
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,760
But you and I do not.

319
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,680
How ruthless.

320
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,560
Do you not fear retribution?

321
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,480
No.

322
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,440
I have nothing left to lose.

323
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,000
Do you care about the past?

324
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,680
No.

325
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,640
Everything I have done in this life

326
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,600
is for Tiemo's future.

327
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,760
White Hair,

328
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,360
we have enough men in Chang'an

329
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,440
and in Cangshui River.

330
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,040
You are destined

331
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,040
to lose this battle.

332
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,400
We searched the entire shoal.

333
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,320
No trace of him.

334
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,320
No need to keep searching.

335
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,720
But… we made a promise to the King.

336
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,080
I thought of someone.

337
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,560
Like me,

338
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,360
he now has no family left.

339
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,720
Xie Huai'an owes him,

340
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,040
and yet that man

341
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,840
still helps him without regard
for his own life.

342
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,160
In all of Cangshui River,

343
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,240
if Xie Huai'an still cares
about anyone's life,

344
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,520
it must be his.

345
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,600
You finally came.

346
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,680
Yes, Master.

347
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,480
I came to see you.
