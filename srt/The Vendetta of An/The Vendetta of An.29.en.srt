00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,370
Your Majesty,

2
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,800
the memorials from the court

3
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,620
have all been submitted.

4
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,410
I selected a few important ones

5
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,050
to read to you.

6
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:40,730
The first

7
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,580
is from Scholar Lu Zhi of the Imperial Academy.

8
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,130
"Balance taxes to ease the people's burdens..."

9
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,860
I told you,

10
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,690
if it isn't military,

11
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,860
do not bring it to me.

12
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,330
The Tiemo people have withdrawn.

13
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,690
The Baiwenhu Army has resecured the northern front.

14
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,410
And the regional commanders have returned to allegiance.

15
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:00,980
For now,

16
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,690
there are no war reports.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,210
Now

18
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,260
that peace has returned,

19
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,380
you

20
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,620
may sit here.

21
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,260
No.

22
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,330
We've walked enough wrong paths.

23
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,380
Whether in peace or in chaos,

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,070
Chang'an needs a ruler

25
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,620
of unyielding strength.

26
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,660
Besides,

27
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,820
you are the only rightful ruler left of the Xiao imperial line.

28
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,900
Xiao Wenjing is dead.

29
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,060
I am Zhang Mo,

30
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,690
once the pageboy of Mr. Xie Huai'an,

31
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,260
now

32
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,570
the Director of the Royal Archives at Your Majesty's side.

33

White Hair

34
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,570
truly changed you.

35
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,260
Do you recognize this?

36
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,130
He used to keep it for me.

37
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,150
Now I give it to you.

38
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,170
You were his pageboy.

39
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,410
Keep it well.

40
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:24,900
[Ding Er]

41
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,380
Where is he?

42
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,130
Why isn't he here yet?

43
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,170
Xiaoqing.

44
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,940
What symptoms did you say I had?

45
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,890
I took your pulse.

46
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,410
It was weak, floating,

47
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,730
and unsteady.

48
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,060
You must be suffering from lovesickness.

49
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,730
What?

50
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,980
Lovesickness?

51
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,660
Don't try to fool me.

52
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:07,850
I know

53
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,660
many fine physicians out there.

54
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,220
None ever said that.

55
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,060
Do you even know what you're doing?

56
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,450
Are you some kind of charlatan?

57
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,460
I, your senior sister,

58
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,340
am finally following in Master's footsteps

59
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,540
and ready to walk the healer's path.

60
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,220
Can't you show me a little support?

61
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,540
Of course, Xiaoqing.

62
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:30,700
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,460
Xiaoqing,

64
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,250
why don't you

65
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,100
take my pulse again?

66
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,540
Be more careful this time.

67
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:39,850
Forget it.

68
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,990
Your illness has taken deep root.

69
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,980
I can't cure it.

70
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,340
You should cure your lovesickness by traveling.

00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:14,600
[Taiyiji Clinic]

72
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,220
What are you looking for?

73
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,130
Didn't he say he'd come

74
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,490
and see me off at noon?

75
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,140
Where is that Nasty One?

76
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,020
He's a busy man now.

77
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,140
He has probably forgotten you already.

78
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,460
Once I leave,

79
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,100
he won't see me for months.

80
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,730
He'll regret it then.

81
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,660
You're just leaving to find Zhaolu.

82
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,780
It's not like you won't return.

83
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,340
Why linger here like it's

84
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,370
some sorrowful parting?

85
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,540
Go on.

86
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,170
Stop waiting for the Nasty One.

87
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:50,810
Let's...

88
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,340
let's wait a bit longer.

89
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,250
Nasty One?

90
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:11,930
What?

91
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,610
Missing me already?

92
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:16,560
You...

93
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,810
You two teamed up to fool me, didn't you?

94
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,140
I'll tan your hide!

95
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,170
Get down here!

96
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,930
What did you say?

97
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,020
You're not

98
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,580
as carefree as you used to be.

99
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,610

you're like him,

101

brooding all day.

102
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,610
And you're not the fool you used to be.

103
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,410
Sometimes you're like him too,

104

Huai'an...

106
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,170
He came with nothing and left without a trace.

107
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,660
We searched his whole place,

108
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,170
and not a single thing was his.

109
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,140
He left alone just like that.

110
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,700
How heartless.

111
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,930
We are what he left behind.

112
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:15,540
That's enough.

113
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,140
Why does that sound so strange?

114
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,700
As long as we're alive,

115
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,370
then he's still here.

116
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,810
Take care.

117
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,220
Sir,

118
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,730
please hold on.

119
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:31,980
The other day,

120
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,410
a young man came by,

121
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,020
hair white as snow.

122
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,250
He gave me a bit of silver

123
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,930
but took only a bench.

124
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,220
I remember him

125
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,410
very clearly.

126
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,780
When I saw you two carrying him

127
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,370
through the streets,

128
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,580
I figured out

129
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,020
who he must be.

130
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,250
Wait a moment, sirs.

131
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,460
For someone like that,

00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,510
how could I take his silver

133
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,730
and not give wine?

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,570

Thank you, sir.

Think nothing of it.
