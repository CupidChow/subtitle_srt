1
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,560
EIGHT-DIRECTIONS GOODS SHOP

2
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,600
Alright.

3
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,080
EIGHT-DIRECTIONS GOODS SHOP

4
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,040
- Mr. Sun.
- Mr. Su.

5
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,040
It's only been a few days.
Here to collect debts again?

6
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,960
No.

7
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,120
I just wanted to ask about something.

8
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,720
What do young ladies
usually like to eat here?

9
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,880
The young ladies on these streets
all love my snow-pear tonic.

10
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,640
Snow-pear tonic?

11
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,200
Yes. That one.

12
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,800
Give me one to go.

13
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,080
All right, please wait a moment.

14
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,520
Go ahead and enjoy my snow-pear tonic.

15
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,680
I'll choose a good one.

16
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,880
- This one?
- This will do.

17
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,960
And these red beans.

18
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,480
I'll give you extra to take along.

19
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,920
Enjoy it.

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,600
You are welcome back anytime.

21
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,520
Here you go, Mr. Su.

22
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,840
Thank you, Mr. Sun.

23
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,360
No, Mr. Su.

24
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,920
- How could I take your money?
- Take it.

25
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,640
No.

26
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,280
Then, thank you, Mr. Su.

27
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,920
Lying low.

28
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,800
The wind will stop soon enough.

29
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,280
But look at you.

30
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,520
Doing all this makes it look as if

31
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,880
I were truly planning to flee.

32
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,800
Boss.

33
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,760
Who do you think you can fool?
You cannot fool me.

34
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,480
Did you not once say

35
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,600
that half of Chang'an belonged
to you, Boss?

36
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,640
But the one you serve

37
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,080
is Emperor Yan.

38
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,920
With such a powerful backer,
why would you need to lie low?

39
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,240
Then the one you offended

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,400
must be Emperor Yan.

41
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,520
You brat.

42
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,680
You are a little too clever.

43
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,000
So I guessed right, didn't I?

44
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,000
Then this really is fleeing.

45
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,560
So bringing all these things is right.

46
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,480
I should have brought even more.

47
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,440
Tell me,

48
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,880
what if we never return?

49
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,920
We would not worry about living.

50
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,560
Boss, your business
spans the entire realm.

51
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,920
Even if they liquidate
one shop after another,

52
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,120
they will not finish
in eight or ten years.

53
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,520
But Boss,

54
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,320
you still need someone at your side.

55
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,400
I must find the right person for you

56
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,520
and be sure they're worthy.

57
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,680
Why is that?

58
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,800
Boss, do you not know yourself?

59
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,920
You are not an easy master to serve.

60
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,320
Is that not why I have you?

61
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,160
Losing a bit of business is nothing.

62
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,800
Do not worry.
I will still pay you double wages.

63
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,280
This is not about wages.

64
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,480
If that day truly comes,

65
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,640
once I settle you properly,

66
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,240
I will still return to Chang'an.

67
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,800
For that girl at the clinic?

68
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,480
No.

69
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,920
Boss, you have forgotten, have you not?

70
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,840
I remember.
Your revenge has not been taken yet.

71
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,800
Yes.

72
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,960
With blood unavenged,

73
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,960
I am unworthy as a son.

74
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,080
His story is the same as yours.

75
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,160
He carries a hatred as deep as the sea.

76
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,720
That child came from Pingfang Township,

77
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,160
a run-down village outside Chang'an.

78
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,960
When he was 11 years old,

79
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,920
he saw with his own eyes

80
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,920
his father trampled to death
by a young master riding back to Chang'an.

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,800
From then on,
he swore to avenge that blood debt.

82
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,560
He waited five years
before coming to Chang'an,

83
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,320
bringing all his belongings.

84
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,000
A total of 17 <i>wen</i>
was only enough to buy one knife.

85
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,720
Why wait?

86
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,320
He waited until his mother passed away.

87
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,240
Because if he died first,
he would fail in his filial duty

88
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,920
and she would grieve.

89
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,280
When he found the young master,

90
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,440
the young master's family
had already fallen,

91
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,800
leaving only him and his mother

92
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,360
living in a weed-choked courtyard.

93
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,320
When the boy surnamed Su saw this,

94
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,120
he did not strike.

95
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,440
He began to wait again.

96
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,720
Later he met Yang Chuhao.

97
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,760
Yang Chuhao learned his story
and asked him

98
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,480
whether he spared him out of softness.

99
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,240
He said no.

100
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,880
No matter how miserable
a foe becomes, he is still a foe.

101
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,960
And when it comes to vengeance,
he will show no mercy.

102
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,800
But he had to wait a little longer.

103
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,200
He would only act
after the young master's mother died.

104
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,480
Only then would he strike.

105
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,760
Because if the young master died,

106
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,920
there would be no one left
to care for his mother.

107
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,680
Later on, Yang Chuhao took him in.

108
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,240
That child was truly clever,
one in a thousand.

109
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,920
And meticulous.

110
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,640
Naturally he became
Yang Chuhao's confidant.

111
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,440
Yang, as I see it,

112
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,600
raised him like a son.

113
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,320
Boss, how could you do work like this?

114
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,600
Let me handle it.

115
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,720
Kid, it's not that bad. I can do it.

116
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,680
It is that bad.

117
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,240
I have to do everything I can

118
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,600
to be worthy of the wages Boss gives me.

119
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,720
You.

120
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,520
What if one day I really run away,

121
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,440
and you're not by my side?

122
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,680
What am I to do then?

123
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,840
This story

124
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,000
is fake.

125
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,600
Only two people can tell

126
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,960
that this story is fake.

127
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,160
You and me.

128
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,400
Yang

129
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,120
doesn't know.

130
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,800
<i>What caught my eye was not his cleverness,</i>

131
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,840
<i>but how well he hid himself.</i>

132
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,440
<i>He lived as an obedient servant,</i>

133
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,760
<i>and might have lived that way forever,</i>

134
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,520
<i>earning himself a reputation</i>
<i>as a kind man.</i>

135
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,320
<i>That would've been no ill fate.</i>

136
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,640
<i>But when the chance comes,</i>

137
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,400
<i>he will remember that he is no good man,</i>

138
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,040
<i>but a flower grown from poisoned soil.</i>

139
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,160
How did you know
Su Changlin's story was fake?

140
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,600
People who have crawled out of hell

141
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,840
are easily content

142
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,280
with ordinary things.

143
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,960
But when something seems too good,

144
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,720
they usually don't believe it.

145
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,520
I spoke with Su Changlin.

146
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,560
He could become an excellent Huben member.

147
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,440
But before that day comes,

148
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,840
he needs a merit to his name.

149
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,320
At this very moment, Yang Chuhao's life

150
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,360
has already become that merit.

151
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,400
Yang is your father's old friend,

152
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,800
and my friend.

153
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,000
I do not rejoice in his death,

154
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,600
not in the least.

155
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,720
But he must die.

156
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,400
Sure enough, in this world,

157
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,040
anything that seems too good

158
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,520
is rarely worth trusting.

159
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,720
Tell me honestly,
do you really have to go?

160
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,000
The moment the siege
on Yan Fengshan failed,

161
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,120
I knew the Huben in Chang'an

162
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,800
had not been wiped out completely.

163
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,200
If you ask whether there is anyone

164
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,200
in this dynasty worth trusting,
there must be.

165
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,680
But I do not dare to gamble.

166
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,680
No matter whom I entrust with command,
I cannot rest easy.

167
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,360
I must go north myself,

168
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,400
bring back the Baiwenhu,

169
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,600
and retake Chang'an.

170
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,800
The journey is long,

171
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,080
and you have only a few men.

172
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,240
Be careful along the way.

173
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,400
Do not worry.

174
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,000
This time I will not let the general
come to any harm.

175
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,280
After nightfall,
leave through Jinguang Gate.

176
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,040
Master has arranged someone
to meet you there.

177
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,440
My thanks for your help.

178
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,360
Huai'an risked his life to enter the game

179
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,160
to buy my return from the palace

180
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,160
and to make Wuyin Chong
agree to his terms.

181
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,280
I do not know

182
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,120
whether he ever said

183
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,000
what one must do
to leave Yan Fengshan's side.

184
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,520
The letter he left behind

185
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,080
did not mention it either.

186
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,480
That courtyard seems ordinary,

187
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,680
but it is full of hidden traps.

188
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,680
There must be secret sentries all around.

189
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,960
With the forces we can muster now,

190
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,360
breaking in would be extremely difficult.

191
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,760
You must not attack by force.

192
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,560
Even if you break through
the outer defenses,

193
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,080
Yan Fengshan is still inside.

194
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,480
In today's Chang'an,

195
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,280
there is no longer anyone
who can stand against him.

196
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,520
There is no need to worry too much.

197
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,240
By now you surely know Xie Huai'an.

198
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,200
He must have prepared
a formidable backup plan.

199
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,640
Do not worry.

200
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,360
Indeed.

201
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,760
I promised him that I would not die.

202
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,080
Then he will not die either.

203
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,840
Everyone,

204
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,760
I must trouble you

205
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,120
with everything in Chang'an.

206
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,640
So many people have died.

207
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,120
We have to burn some money
to send down to them.

208
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,800
Burn some for Yang Chuhao as well.

209
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,760
After all, he is your friend.

210
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,760
Not only Yang Chuhao.

211
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,960
Tonight is also
Wang Pu's first seven days.

212
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,000
I sent Zhiying to burn paper at his grave.

213
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,920
The child you raised for 25 years

214
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,600
was your shackle.

215
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,760
If not for him,

216
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,120
you would have lost control
of your urge to kill

217
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,160
and turned into a madman long ago.

218
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,800
It does not sit well with you, does it?

219
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,280
Bai Wan's death
must have grieved you deeply.

220
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,440
She was the only family you had left.

221
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,920
You hid her away and guarded her.

222
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,200
In the end she was stabbed to death.

223
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,680
She is buried right here.

224
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,720
Of course I know that.

225
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,120
From the moment
we moved to this courtyard,

226
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,960
no one has dared set foot
on this patch of ground.

227
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,320
You really are so tender-hearted.

228
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,600
When she turned one,
I carved her amulet myself.

229
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,880
Naturally, I felt sorry for her.

230
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,280
But I still had to kill her.

231
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,920
Killing her and breaking you

232
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,880
were the only way I could win.

233
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,760
And you really did it.

234
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,520
I have always worked with great care,

235
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,920
spending a great deal of time
on my layouts,

236
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,960
thinking through every detail.

237
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,280
Yet in the end,

238
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,680
I was still one move short,

239
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,040
and all my last kin died.

240
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,040
She died.

241
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,040
That was when I became a madman.

242
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,920
Do you know that?

243
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,800
I can see her.

244
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,400
At first I only saw her once in a while.

245
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,760
Slowly,

246
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,480
she began to appear more often.

247
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,720
Later,

248
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,400
whenever I thought of her,

249
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,240
she would appear by my side.

250
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,680
White Hair.

251
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,720
What is it?

252
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,480
Very mad, am I?

253
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,880
But if you cast reality aside…

254
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,280
and imagine wildly

255
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,040
that the dead could be brought back
to your side.

256
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,560
Do you not find that amusing?

257
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,320
Can you not see Wang Pu?

258
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,720
So it is not you who is mad,

259
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,240
it is me who is mad.

260
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,840
It is not you who is mad,

261
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,560
it is me who is mad.

262
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,520
This is your junior sister's clinic.

263
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,880
You are not even helping.

264
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,160
Do your work. Stop talking nonsense.

265
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,600
My eyelid has been twitching
for the past two days.

266
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,600
I wonder how matters stand with Huai'an.

267
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:32,520
‪BLESSINGS ABOUND, MISFORTUNE FADES

268
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,960
Do not move.

269
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,200
Careful, there may be hidden weapons.

270
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,800
Xiaoqing, this is for you.

271
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,880
Then I will take it back to my room first,

272
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,200
so you two won't steal
my late-night snack.

273
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,440
Xiaoqing has never been good at the arts,

274
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,400
but she is a glutton.

275
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,600
May I ask you, what does she like to eat?

276
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,040
She does like a few sweet treats.

277
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,280
What are you thinking about?

278
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,960
Someone fancies your junior sister,
and you're displeased?

279
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,040
This dessert was given
by that servant beside Yang Chuhao.

280
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,600
He likes Xiaoqing.

281
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,680
Huai'an and I both know.

282
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,800
So?

283
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,240
He is the closest person to Yang Chuhao,

284
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,480
like his adopted son.

285
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,720
Huai'an had me investigate him.

286
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,080
So what exactly are you trying to say?

287
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,920
What I am trying to say is

288
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,040
Yang Chuhao is currently fleeing
for his life,

289
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,920
so there is no reason
he would not take him along.

290
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,520
At a time like this,
for him to suddenly appear in Chang'an

291
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,680
is very strange.

292
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,960
I understand.

293
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,040
That guy might actually be a traitor.

294
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,520
Master has not sent word yet.

295
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,440
We do not know whether Yang Chuhao

296
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,080
has entered Cangshui River.

297
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,840
If he has not entered yet,

298
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,000
then that guy is certainly suspect.

299
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,560
While he has not gone far,

300
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,760
I will follow him.

301
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,280
This is Chang'an City.
Stop wandering around.

302
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,280
Take good care of your face.

303
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,760
I am going.

304
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,000
Gu Yu has been rescued.

305
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,600
Wuyin Chong has left.

306
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,880
You entered the game in person
and won half a move.

307
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,760
But what comes next?

308
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,040
You are not someone who leaves no way out.

309
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,040
I want to know

310
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,320
what method you have

311
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,600
to walk out of this courtyard.

312
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,600
I cannot get out,

313
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,280
and you will not kill me,

314
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,840
will you?

315
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,840
Not right now.

316
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,080
But someday.

317
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,880
Then there is still time.

318
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,000
You are waiting for Xiao Wuyang.

319
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,520
Not only him.

320
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,840
I arranged for 400 men
and still failed to kill him.

321
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,800
White Hair,

322
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,320
you really are a bit mad.

323
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,160
Every moment you are trapped here,

324
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,840
anything that happens outside,
you cannot respond to.

325
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,480
You know that, don't you?

326
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,080
Come in.

327
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,960
Greetings, General Fengshan,

328
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,480
Mr. Huai'an.

329
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,960
Have you decided to join the Huben Army?

330
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,920
Where is your merit?

331
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,760
Yang Chuhao is already dead.

332
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,520
That is my merit.

333
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,040
These injuries

334
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,800
came from a little trouble

335
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,600
on the way just now.

336
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,360
Is he dead?

337
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,480
Almost.

338
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,800
Before dawn,

339
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,840
he should die in the streets of Chang'an.

340
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,600
It was Ye Zheng's sword.

341
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,440
I have trained with the blade
for ten years.

342
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,400
This is the first time
I've faced such a trying foe.

343
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,200
Ye Zheng is truly a worthy opponent.

344
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,920
It is a pity

345
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,920
he is too ruled by his emotions.

346
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,880
No matter what,

347
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,120
my feelings for Xiaoqing are real.

348
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,880
I told you this is the risk
you have to take.

349
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,040
Trapped here,

350
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,120
you cannot deal with anything outside.

351
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,360
This courtyard

352
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,600
is truly lovely.

353
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,880
Tonight

354
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,360
is the end.

355
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,560
Go ahead.

356
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,400
Sir, Yulong Ridge lies ahead.

357
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,840
In these past decades,

358
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,640
the wisest,

359
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,800
the strongest,

360
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,160
and the most cunning

361
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,200
have all gathered in Chang'an.

362
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,400
Tell me.

363
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,760
Is it time?

364
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,160
It is snowing
even after the Spring Equinox.

365
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,000
This is not a peaceful year.

366
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,640
When your father died,
it was also a snowy night.

367
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,920
Your father, covered in wounds,
was brought before me.

368
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,120
And the one who delivered
the final blow was not Liu Ziyan.

369
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,280
It was me.

370
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,200
I even gathered his remains

371
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,680
and built a grave for him.

372
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,800
Did you find that grave?

373
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,120
Did you ever weep before it?

374
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,120
LIU ZIWEN

375
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,440
Accept your fate, White Hair.

376
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,800
Stop struggling.

377
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,440
Accept such a fate?

378
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,600
Tell me.

379
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,280
How does one accept fate?

380
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,200
One kowtow at a time.

381
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,520
That is how the word fate is written.

382
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,440
I'll kill him for you.

383
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,720
Ever since you rescued
Gu Yu from Chang'an,

384
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,160
the four regional commanders
have all pressed me for battle orders.

385
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,600
They refuse to see Gu Yu return
with the northern Baiwenhu Army

386
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,600
and join forces with Xiao Wuyang's army.

387
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,640
Many people are destined to die tonight.

388
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,440
Go.

389
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,360
I permit you to die where you grew up.

390
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,160
My men outside will see you off
on your final road.

391
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,960
You are tired.

392
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,200
I will stir the charcoal and leave.

393
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,520
Cease this pretense of serving me.

394
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,360
Come back tomorrow.

395
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,040
Tell me what you want.

396
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,320
I had wanted to kill Xie Huai'an myself.

397
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,880
Killing a man like him

398
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,280
felt like an accomplishment.

399
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:19,199
But now it seems that if he were to die
under the blades of the Huben,

400
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,320
as the tales say his father did,

401
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,360
it'd be far more interesting.

402
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,760
<i>When I was seven,</i>
<i>I learned to make dumplings.</i>

403
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,720
And I even wrapped

404
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,520
a copper coin inside,

405
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,200
hoping you would be the one to eat it.

406
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,800
Hoping you would live a thousand years,

407
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,680
safe and at peace.

408
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,800
Does that Xie Huai'an have a weakness?

409
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,680
He does.

410
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,840
He wants too badly to kill someone.

411
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,720
That is right.

412
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,640
You guessed correctly.

413
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,760
He wants to kill me.

414
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,120
One who keeps thinking only
of killing you,

415
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,600
does that count as remarkable?

416
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,840
Killing intent is instinct.

417
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,840
If one is too driven by instinct,

418
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,480
it is easy to lose oneself.

419
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,320
On the contrary,

420
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,520
to be able to put down the desire
to kill someone

421
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,640
is what makes one extraordinary.

422
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,360
General.

423
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,240
I heard the elder Huben say

424
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,720
that when you were young,

425
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,360
you were also steeped in bloodshed.

426
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,120
<i>Later,</i>

427
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,440
<i>you appeared.</i>

428
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,520
<i>Me?</i>

429
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,000
<i>The number of people</i>
<i>who kill for me keeps growing</i>

430
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,320
<i>and I am getting older.</i>

431
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,440
<i>I no longer need to swing every blade</i>
<i>with my life on the line.</i>

432
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,520
<i>Perhaps for this very reason,</i>

433
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,840
<i>my killing intent slowly faded.</i>

434
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,520
General.

435
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,560
I am returning to Chang'an.

436
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,280
I am the one who kills for the general.

437
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,320
On this trip back,

438
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,760
I will kill Xie Huai'an.

439
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,640
As long as you return safely.

440
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:30,560
THE FESTIVAL APPROACHES SPRING,
AND THE NEW YEAR IS BLESSED
