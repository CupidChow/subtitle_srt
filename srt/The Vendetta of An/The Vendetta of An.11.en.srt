1
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,600
All four regional military commanders
enter the Capital tomorrow.

2
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,200
Once they enter the Capital,

3
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,120
they must surely know
that they face the danger

4
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,639
of losing military authority.

5
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,000
They won't submit easily.

6
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,320
Let's take a guess

7
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,920
at the kinds of plots
they'll come up with.

8
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,760
How much can we guess?

9
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,200
Where's Gu Yu?

10
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,360
Can he make it in time?

11
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,320
Xie Huai'an is already
preparing a rescue plan.

12
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,880
He's out of our control.

13
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,360
We can't predict his moves.

14
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,760
Back in the day,

15
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,080
we were able to anticipate many things.

16
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,040
Same for this military campaign
against Chang'an.

17
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,280
We also knew that the useless soldiers

18
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,520
under my brother's command

19
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,920
were unable to hold the city gates.

20
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,400
Now that we've won ourselves an empire,

21
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,240
it feels the further we go,

22
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,560
the more uncertainties we'll face.

23
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,800
Perhaps, as the saying goes,

24
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,360
"It's easier to seize power

25
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,800
than to hold onto it."

26
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,840
How's the situation outside?

27
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,680
The four commanders have arrived,
moving discreetly.

28
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,040
Luckily, Xiaoqing was able to find out.

29
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,200
Do you truly think

30
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,160
Gao Yan, Xiao Wuyang, and the rest
plan to strike the commanders?

31
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,200
They will, if we fail to rescue Gu Yu

32
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,440
in time.

33
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,000
Instead of letting the commanders
align themselves with the Huben Army,

34
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,960
we should kill them first.

35
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,640
With Chancellor Gao's capabilities,

36
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,480
he would pacify the four towns

37
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,240
while cutting down the commanders.

38
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,880
Perhaps he has already dispatched his men.

39
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,640
Now that Gu Yu is captured,

40
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,040
undercurrents are stirring once more
under the city of Chang'an.

41
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,280
As for Gu Yu,

42
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,480
I've already found him.

43
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,000
You found him?

44
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,720
We should act, then.

45
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,360
A war will start in the city, you know?

46
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,720
Let's wait a little longer.

47
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,600
I have something else in mind.

48
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,200
Hand this to Chancellor Gao.

49
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,800
He'll hold his position
once he reads this.

50
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,000
-Can I read this?
-Of course.

51
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,680
I'm just worried
that you cannot understand it.

52
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,600
I won't read it, then.

53
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,160
Tell the pageboy to keep a close eye
on Wang Xing.

54
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,880
Is he doing things properly?

55
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,960
It's a long story.

56
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,480
But I'll summarize it.

57
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,920
He has already done Wang Xing in.

58
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,400
But it wasn't not his fault.

59
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,440
Anyway, you should stop worrying.

60
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,640
Finish your task inside.
We'll talk once you're out.

61
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,840
All right.

62
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,240
Make way!

63
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,120
Watch where you're going!

64
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,440
Mother, we have a customer.

65
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,080
A customer?

66
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,800
-If so, get him some food later, okay?
-Miss. Get me two buns.

67
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,240
Coming right up.

68
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,400
It's hot. Be careful.

69
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,920
Eat up. My mother's buns are delicious.

70
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,840
What about your father?

71
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,760
I don't remember who my father is.

72
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,560
Mother said it's been three years
since he last returned.

73
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,680
My wife

74
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:32,080
often wears a purple dress,
faded from all the washing.

75
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,040
You'll know when you see her.

76
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,840
LIU'S BAMBOO SHOP

77
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,080
‎Come on.

78
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,800
I'll make you something nice
when we're back.

79
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,520
-Mother, are you tired?
-Not at all.

80
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,800
Young lady.

81
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,280
Young lady.

82
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,640
Young lady.

83
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,880
Young lady.

84
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,960
Young lady.

85
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,760
Young lady, open up.

86
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,320
Stop hiding.

87
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,560
I just want to help you guys out.

88
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,080
It's already been two months.

89
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,960
Why are you still avoiding me?

90
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,720
I know

91
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,080
that your shop is right here.

92
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,520
Your daughter is still very young.

93
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,120
And you're alone.

94
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,560
You have only two eyes.

95
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,320
You won't be able
to watch her every moment.

96
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,520
Mother. I'm scared.

97
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,800
I'm here for you.

98
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,000
Young lady!

99
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,080
Young lady, open the door!

100
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,320
Mother. Let's call Father back.

101
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,040
-Let's call Father back.
-Okay.

102
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,680
I'll write to your father now.

103
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,320
I'll ask him to return at once, all right?

104
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,240
Stop crying.

105
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,000
Mister. I want a bowl of noodles.

106
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,000
Give me extra vegetables.

107
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
‎Please cut some raddish for me.

108
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,040
-I'll come back for it later.
-Okay.

109
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,240
Say, you still have a habit of being late
even after all these years, huh?

110
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,400
Lamb won't be as tasty

111
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,360
if you cook it for too long.

112
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,320
Are we here just to eat lamb?

113
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,480
Didn't we return to Chang'an
to devour other people?

114
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,240
Not necessarily.

115
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,840
If we do a bad job,
we'll be devoured instead.

116
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,400
Can you guys talk about something
that won't spoil my appetite?

117
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,280
If I'm not mistaken,

118
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,280
when we followed the founding emperor
into Chang'an,

119
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,960
we had our first meal here.

120
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,400
No wonder you settled here
after searching everywhere.

121
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,320
Thirty years ago, after that meal,
we followed the founding emperor

122
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,760
into the palace.

123
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,000
He conquered the empire

124
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,520
while we seized the military seals.

125
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,480
I told you already.

126
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,680
This is a lucky spot.

127
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,160
But 30 years passed
in the blink of an eye.

128
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,360
The founding emperor is long gone.

129
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,360
And now, his son
wants to take back our military seals.

130
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,280
If we agree to it,

131
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,600
it'll mean

132
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,240
that our lifetime will be in vain.

133
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,080
Is there really no room for maneuver
in this matter?

134
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,640
Our lives may not be in vain after all.

135
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,160
If that does happen,
at least I still own this alley.

136
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,160
A few years ago,
I spent some money and bought this alley.

137
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,360
The lamb we're having
is served by my shop.

138
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,880
You're something else indeed.

139
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,920
-You're a cunning old fox.
-You are hogging all the food.

140
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,680
-Have all of their men arrived?
-They have.

141
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,320
What about our men?

142
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,480
Our men have arrived as well.

143
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,160
Chancellor, we await your command.

144
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,400
On the night of murder,
one should savor tea to the fullest.

145
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,680
ABUNDANT FORTUNE

146
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,400
You're not acting yourself today.

147
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,200
You see, it's a long story.

148
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,680
Consider this my penance.

149
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,280
Your expression, tone,
and the way you act…

150
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,520
You look more like a hired blade.

151
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,760
Those who don't know might think
that you're one of my peers.

152
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,280
So, why are we meeting here?

153
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,400
Now, I just want to go home
and have a bowl of hot porridge.

154
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,080
Forget about the porridge.

155
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,360
Let's have some hot tea.

156
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,680
Tonight, Chancellor Gao
will make his move here.

157
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,120
He means to kill the four commanders.

158
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,880
What?

159
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,120
Don't act so surprised.

160
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,040
Our current mission
is to prevent that from happening.

161
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,600
Chancellor Gao
is having tea in that tea house now.

162
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,880
The commanders

163
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,280
are having lamb hotpot in that very alley.

164
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,880
And us? Must we just

165
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,880
stand here like fools?

166
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,320
Take this to Chancellor Gao.

167
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,880
Huai'an said Chancellor Gao
would stop his operation immediately

168
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,840
after seeing this.

169
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,680
Why not go yourself?

170
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,680
Chancellor Gao has set a trap inside.

171
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,640
I'm sure there are many assassins
lying in wait.

172
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,960
I have to locate the assassins first.

173
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,160
What if something goes wrong?

174
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,040
Can you fend them off?

175
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,080
You're right.

176
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,920
-Can you understand it?
-Of course.

177
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,840
This is a huge deal.

178
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,320
Chancellor Gao will stop at once
if he hears this.

179
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,480
Keep this safe.

180
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,680
Huai'an said His Majesty

181
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,080
gave him the Marquis of Wuyang's
official seal himself.

182
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,040
With it, one can move freely
throughout Chang'an.

183
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,320
That's Chancellor Gao's messenger.

184
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,040
They'll commence the operation soon.
I have to stop them.

185
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,440
Don't mess this up.

186
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,840
Hey!

187
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,760
I…

188
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,640
The tea house?

189
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,360
Where is it?

190
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,280
HALL OF TALENT

191
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,080
According to Chancellor Gao,
tonight is the night…

192
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,080
Who are you?

193
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,600
According to Chancellor Gao, all of you

194
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,840
have to remain here tonight.

195
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,680
That darned Ye Zheng.

196
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,560
He only gave me a direction.

197
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,520
He didn't give me
the tea house's exact location.

198
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,440
I…

199
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,560
-Who's there?
-Who's there?

200
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,720
I wish you all prosperity.

201
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,240
LONGSHENG INN

202
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,000
Who's there?

203
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,160
I bear the Marquis of Wuyang's seal.

204
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,120
I must see the chancellor.

205
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,119
Chancellor, someone came with the seal
His Majesty had given.

206
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,720
-He says it's urgent…
-Get out of the way.

207
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,040
I came to tell you
not to kill the commanders.

208
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,359
But now I must tell you

209
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,800
they mean to kill you.

210
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,720
Therefore, you have to escape.

211
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,720
In just one night,

212
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,599
you managed to uncover two deadly plots.

213
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,320
Who are you?

214
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,800
I'm Mr. Xie Huai'an's pageboy.

215
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,000
This seal is the proof.

216
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,120
Xie Huai'an is remarkably intelligent.

217
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,600
It seems the pageboy he has chosen

218
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,120
is pretty intelligent as well.

219
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,720
How did you find out
that they were after my life?

220
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,840
Their hitmen
are waiting at the tavern right next door.

221
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,560
All of them carried military blades.
I could tell at first glance.

222
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,360
LONGSHENG INN

223
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,920
I suppose it's time.

224
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,400
They should be acting as we speak.

225
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,320
You guys don't need to be that nervous.

226
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,320
After all, our target is Gao Yan.

227
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,920
How can you sit here drinking tea?

228
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,160
Hurry and escape!

229
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,840
Wait. Did you know about this long ago?

230
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,360
You're cunning, aren't you?

231
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,800
You held back.

232
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,960
Let them make the first move.

233
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,120
Now you have grounds to act in the open.

234
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,040
Am I right?

235
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,760
You are indeed intelligent.

236
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,440
But…

237
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,200
But my men

238
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,120
have subdued all of your men.

239
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,800
If so,

240
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,800
does that mean your plan won't succeed?

241
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,680
No matter what,
the commanders' hitmen will arrive soon.

242
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,120
We'd better make a run for it.

243
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,640
I'm not leaving.

244
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,000
If I leave, it means I yield.

245
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,600
Old people like us hate losing, you know?

246
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,760
What are you saying?
What exactly do you want?

247
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,720
You won't get to leave
when they arrive, you know?

248
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,160
Your men

249
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,760
have subdued my men,
causing my plan to be thwarted.

250
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,360
And now, I'm in danger because of you.

251
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,040
You should be the one
coming up with a solution for me.

252
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,920
Do you want me to find you a way out?

253
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,720
Are you sure about that?

254
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,120
Help!

255
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,960
Someone's trying to kill
the regional military commanders!

256
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,920
Help!

257
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,960
Someone's trying to kill
the regional military commanders!

258
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,680
Help!

259
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,720
Regional military commanders, run away!

260
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,600
Someone's after your lives!

261
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,400
Run away!

262
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,160
Someone's trying to
kill the regional military commanders!

263
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Regional military commanders, run away!

264
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,920
-Someone's after your lives!
-What is he up to?

265
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,920
Someone's trying to kill
the regional military commanders!

266
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Regional military commanders, run away!

267
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,720
Did you give them the wrong order?

268
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,760
Do I look that foolish to you?

269
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,120
This seems like…

270
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,840
It's a trap laid by Gao Yan.

271
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,840
He's trying to kill us.

272
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,280
This is what we call a feint attack.

273
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,360
I assume the hitmen have rushed back
to rescue their commanders.

274
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,840
Chancellor,

275
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,960
we've already dealt
with the hitmen outside.

276
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,840
What about the four main targets?

277
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,080
Don't worry.

278
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,600
Our men are keeping an eye on them.

279
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,520
-Time to get to work.
-No, you mustn't!

280
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,480
Yan Fengshan is returning to the Capital.

281
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,600
I assume to bargain with the commanders.

282
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,960
If you kill them now,

283
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,080
we'll have no bait to lure
Yan Fengshan back.

284
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,360
This is my proof.

285
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,200
My master, Xie Huai'an,

286
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,120
is already coming up
with a way to deal with Yan Fengshan.

287
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,960
Your Majesty,

288
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,720
you should be the one

289
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,760
who makes the call.

290
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,120
‎EXQUISITE DELICACIES

291
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,680
I suppose a young man like you
is still filled with fear

292
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,120
when you see the ruler of the land.

293
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,400
Raise your head.

294
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,040
Nothing is more important

295
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,680
than killing Yan Fengshan.

296
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,440
Understood?

297
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,720
Do you understand?

298
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,320
I… I'm done here.

299
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,120
I'll make a move.

300
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,120
After all these years,

301
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,680
to think that you're the first person

302
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,440
to come within five steps of my reach

303
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,040
with a weapon on you.

304
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,520
It seems we're too careless.

305
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,080
Indeed.

306
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,320
Even the best plans have flaws.

307
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,000
Go!

308
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,640
What's the situation?

309
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,920
Every man we sent after Chancellor Gao
is dead.

310
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,360
However,

311
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,320
his men posted outside have pulled back.

312
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,960
It is finally over.

313
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,360
That was a close shave.

314
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,400
If that person hadn't shouted for help,

315
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,320
we'd have thought
everything was under control.

316
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,680
We almost fell for his trap.

317
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,120
If I must say,

318
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,120
we're not really good at coming up
with schemes either.

319
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,000
Am I right, Wang Pu?

320
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,920
If they dare move against you,

321
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,800
they'll dare move against me.

322
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,320
The four of them would never
dare such boldness on their own.

323
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,120
Indeed.

324
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
In my opinion,

325
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,360
it'll be better to kill them

326
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,120
than to let them ally themselves
with the Huben Army.

327
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,040
Now, it seems like

328
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,280
the covenant between them
has long been established.

329
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,360
Right now, only two things

330
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,720
can change the current situation.

331
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,440
Either Gu Yu staying alive or

332
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,480
Yan Fengshan dying.

333
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,920
We should leave both tasks

334
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,800
to White Hair.

335
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,440
General Gao, you have great foresight.

336
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,880
I would've bought this alley as well

337
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,520
if I were as rich as you all.

338
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,440
You're young and talented.

339
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,200
You might end up
owning half of the city in the future.

340
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,720
You're still in the mood to eat?

341
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,000
Now, we've already fallen out
with Xiao Wuyang.

342
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,360
I'll see what else you've got planned.

343
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,440
I've nothing else planned.

344
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,760
But, you don't need to panic.

345
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,840
Up next,

346
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,880
General Fengshan will soon
join the fray himself.

347
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,880
Please look forward

348
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,840
to it.

349
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,240
Thank you.

350
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,000
You accepted Gu Yu's recommendation
to go to the Capital back then.

351
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,440
According to the plan,

352
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,200
I assume you'll be sparing Xiao Wenjing.

353
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,120
Indeed.

354
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,360
Why is that?

355
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,480
It's because of a misunderstanding.

356
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,200
A misunderstanding?

357
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,560
The current emperor
is weak and incompetent.

358
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,880
He might as well
not have taken the throne.

359
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,280
He should

360
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,920
become a scholar instead.

361
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,120
That's right!

362
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,880
He doesn't even have the freedom
to choose.

363
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,480
If he had the freedom to choose,

364
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,640
perhaps he wouldn't have wanted
to be the emperor.

365
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,280
What a poor soul.

366
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,600
What a poor soul!

367
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,760
To the poor soul called the emperor.

368
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,640
Come!

369
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,080
To the poor soul called the emperor!

370
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,080
To him!

371
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,120
What are you doing?

372
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,320
What are you doing?

373
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,560
Yan Fengshan,

374
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,560
didn't you say
that I could enjoy myself outside

375
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,120
for two hours each month?

376
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,680
Has it even been two hours?

377
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,600
I want to drink more!

378
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,000
I haven't had my fill yet.

379
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,400
I don't want to go back!

380
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,320
I won't go back!

381
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,080
I want to keep drinking!

382
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,440
I want to keep drinking!

383
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,000
I want to keep drinking!

384
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,200
I don't want to go back!

385
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,120
Only then did I find out

386
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,080
that he was suppressed by
Yan Fengshan all along.

387
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,680
Although he was the emperor,

388
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,880
in reality, he was just a bird
living in a cage.

389
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,840
After that,

390
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,600
I went through many of his manuscripts.

391
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,320
These four lines
left a deep impression on me.

392
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,600
"For those who would be ministers,

393
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,680
discern right from wrong,
heed not gain or loss."

394
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,080
"For those who would be soldiers,
hold realm and kin above all,

395
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,320
count not life or death."

396
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,680
"For those who would be sovereign,

397
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,680
hear the people's woes,
seek not glory nor splendor."

398
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,120
"And for those
who would be common folk,

399
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,400
keep to their fields and livelihood,

400
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,320
fret not over prices."

401
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,120
Especially the last part.

402
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,160
Although his writing wasn't refined,

403
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,320
from it, I could tell
that he cared for his people.

404
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,200
He wrote those
when he was the crown prince.

405
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,000
He wrote them
with an innocent heart back then.

406
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,040
What a shame.

407
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,000
He proved to be too soft
after ascending the throne.

408
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,800
He was suppressed by Yan Fengshan
for many years.

409
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,360
He was unable to establish a peaceful era.

410
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,520
Times have changed indeed.

411
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,360
Now,

412
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,000
there probably isn't anyone
who wants him to remain emperor.

413
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,880
I'm the only stubborn one
who won't change.

414
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,680
Huai'an.

415
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,200
I've prepared a letter.

416
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,280
If anything happens to me,

417
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,200
please deliver this

418
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,240
to him.

419
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,240
All right.

420
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,760
Do you know where he is?

421
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,320
I do not.

422
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,240
But I'm sure he's also staring
at the same moon as we are.

423
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,160
Hey.

424
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,200
What exactly have you
experienced out there?

425
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,480
It's as if you're a different man now.

426
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,720
You didn't bungle anything either.

427
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,240
Nasty One.

428
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,120
What's the matter?

429
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,160
What's on your mind?

430
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,880
I met my elder brother.

431
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,000
Who's your elder brother?

432
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,160
You mean Xiao Wuyang?

433
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,960
And, you actually left in one piece?

434
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,320
He didn't intend to kill me.

435
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,800
He couldn't even recognize me.

436
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,320
But what's even stranger

437
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,360
is that I didn't feel like
killing him either.

438
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,720
Logically speaking,

439
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,400
he took my empire from me.

440
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,280
Thanks to him, I ended up like this
and became a pageboy.

441
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,520
From a life of luxury
to chopping wood and cooking meals…

442
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,280
I was once above everyone else.

443
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,200
And now, I'm not.

444
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,640
I should've hated him for it.

445
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,720
But when I met him,

446
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,960
I only realized

447
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,920
that I hated the bully at Wazi Alley

448
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,920
much more than him.

449
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,760
Perhaps

450
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,840
I don't love the empire
as much as I thought.

451
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,520
Even so,

452
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,920
there's nothing wrong with it.

453
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,960
But you see,

454
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,880
it's not as if any beauties here
could lead me astray.

455
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,440
Why are you staring at me like that?

456
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,320
The person beside me
is either you or Huai'an.

457
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,840
Zhaolu isn't around either.

458
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,680
Stop acting like that.

459
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,960
I'm not used to you being this down.

460
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,960
I prefer you when you're a nasty brat.

461
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,480
Thanks for that.

462
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,880
That's more like it.

463
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,800
Did everything go smoothly last night?

464
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,800
Were you hurt?

465
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,520
I wasn't hurt.

466
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,400
I claim no credit.

467
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,360
Last night's success

468
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,320
was all thanks to
Nasty One's quick thinking.

469
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,080
He's both observant and witty.

470
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:30,960
No wonder they admire him.

471
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:33,600
People admire him?

472
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,360
What a joke.

473
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,000
But speaking of which,

474
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,840
he can be quite amusing

475
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,440
at times.

476
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,440
Huai'an.

477
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,480
Speaking of which,

478
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,040
what do you plan to do

479
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,920
once everything is over?

480
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,320
What do you mean?
What are you trying to get at?

481
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,960
Once everything is over,

482
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,720
you should reunite with Bai Wan.

483
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,560
You'll soften up a bit

484
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,840
with loved ones by your side.

485
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,120
Mr. Wang Pu, what brings you here?

486
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,160
Mr. Wang, let me do the dirty chores.

487
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,400
Do not soil your hands.

488
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,360
It's fine.

489
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,240
You did a great job at categorizing them.

490
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,280
From east to west, from south to north,

491
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,720
every alley and every household
you collected from,

492
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,160
you marked.

493
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,200
Why did you do it?

494
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,040
Mr. Wang, please spare me. I can explain.

495
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,080
I can explain.

496
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,560
Explain yourself, then.

497
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,240
Mr. Wang,

498
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,800
I did the same job for seven years

499
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,720
prior to joining Hidden Soldier Alley.

500
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,280
I was already used to categorizing items.

501
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,880
And, I'm quick to snatch up bargains.

502
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,000
There's always a bargain

503
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,480
in the places I know.

504
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,400
Mr. Wang, look.

505
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,440
This is a tattered fabric
from a fabric shop.

506
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,680
This kind of fabric

507
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,400
is good enough
for someone like me to wear.

508
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,720
And, as for the damp herbs collected
from the pharmacies,

509
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,440
I dried them after collecting them.

510
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,560
I can now resell them.

511
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,080
As for the wealthy families
living in the alley…

512
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,080
Understood.

513
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,840
You're smart.

514
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,400
Later, I'll assign other tasks to you.

515
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,960
-But,
-Mr. Wang,

516
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,720
right now, I…

517
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,800
You'll earn far more
than scavenging trash.

518
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,680
Thank you, Mr. Wang. Thank you, Mr. Wang.

519
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,600
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

520
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,720
Mr. Wang,

521
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,680
may I know why you came to
such a place personally?

522
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,400
I'm looking for someone.

523
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,680
I don't understand.

524
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,920
Lately, quite a few outsiders have been
sneaking into Hidden Soldier Alley.

525
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,440
I have to locate them.

526
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,600
No matter how well they hide,

527
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,440
they'll surely leave behind some tracks

528
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,080
as long as they live here.

529
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,360
And trash is where traces
are most easily left behind.

530
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,520
Why else do you suppose

531
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,640
I was able to find
the Baiwenhu soldier among our ranks?

532
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,600
I've visited this place several times.

533
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,120
I suppose I have to thank you

534
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,360
for the excellent categorization.

535
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,960
Since they intend to rescue Gu Yu,

536
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,760
I'm sure they won't come alone.

537
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,560
I found it.

538
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,400
Mr. Wang, what is this?

539
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,280
The Baiwenhu Army stayed
on the frontier year-round.

540
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,840
And, the northern regions
are bitterly cold.

541
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,040
Therefore,

542
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,920
the Gu family hired a famous physician

543
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,520
to develop a medicinal plaster

544
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,040
that could relieve knee pain.

545
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,600
I think I found their den.

546
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,760
West Third Alley,

547
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,600
Unit 8.

548
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,680
Wang Pu found your tracks.

549
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,040
This trash wasn't here before.

550
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,320
You're right. Someone tampered with it.

551
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,400
Thank you for the reminder.

552
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,040
Otherwise, I'd still be in the dark.

553
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,040
But speaking of which,

554
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:31,880
how did you find out?

555
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,920
It's because you told me

556
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,200
Wang Pu killed a Baiwenhu soldier.

557
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,200
The Baiwenhu Army
has gone through countless battles.

558
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,080
Generally, they don't give away any clues.

559
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,560
But Wang Pu is the top strategist
under Yan Fengshan.

560
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,480
Therefore, he's more meticulous
than others.

561
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,840
Since we can

562
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,800
use trash to investigate
Hidden Soldier Alley,

563
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,160
of course they can
use the same way to locate

564
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,120
the Baiwenhu Army.

565
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,280
How many of them remain hidden here?

566
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,400
I've already transferred
the rest of them away.

567
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,720
According to the information you gave me,

568
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,800
several residences to the west
are already vacant.

569
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,960
This is the complete map
of the Hidden Soldier Alley base.

570
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,920
We've marked everything we found out

571
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,520
on this map.

572
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,680
The key to the operation
lies at Zuihua Tower.

573
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,680
ZUIHUA TOWER

574
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,960
The shops on both sides

575
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,680
of the street,
and the Huben soldiers as well,

576
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,760
were all posted here
to keep watch and lie in ambush.

577
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,600
Where are the goods?

578
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,080
They are ready.
We're merely biding our time.

579
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,400
The sun will set soon.

580
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,320
It's time to act.

581
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,440
Act according to the plan.

582
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,400
At the very end,

583
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,640
we will evacuate the general
from the designated location.

584
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,200
The Huben Army will chase us hard.

585
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,600
You must be careful.

586
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,920
Don't worry.

587
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,360
My friend and I will make it in time.

588
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,760
This time, the Baiwenhu Army owes you one.

589
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,680
Has it begun?

590
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,440
It has.

591
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:25,800
Wang Pu,

592
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,200
the top strategist under Yan Fengshan.

593
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,440
How long do you think

594
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,600
it'll take for him to notice
that you've rescued Gu Yu?
