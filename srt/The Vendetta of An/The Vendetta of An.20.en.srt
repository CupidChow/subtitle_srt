1
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,480
My children,

2
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,640
it's been 30 years.

3
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,080
We are at the final turning point.

4
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,600
It will all be settled soon.

5
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,920
Wang Pu.

6
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,040
GRAVE OF WANG PU, DECEASED SON

7
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,600
He hasn't been dead long.

8
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,240
I can preserve the body.

9
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,280
But can you wait?

10
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,160
Growing a face takes 100 days.

11
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,400
I cannot wait.

12
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,520
Seven days at most.

13
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,800
And you tell me now?

14
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,800
Did you bring me here
just to waste my time?

15
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,520
The aim of growing a face

16
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,120
is to protect the puppet.

17
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,680
Since he's already dead,

18
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,920
Mr. Long,

19
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,640
just cut his face off for me.

20
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,440
Sometimes I wonder,

21
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,200
between you and Yan Fengshan,

22
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,920
who is the more terrifying one.

23
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,440
Before entering the palace,

24
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,920
Gu Yu left me a 100-man unit.

25
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,920
But Yan Fengshan's residence
is crawling with shadow guards.

26
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,240
According to the plan,

27
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,160
we must slip in without a sound

28
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,280
and place the puppet inside.

29
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,760
For that, 100 men are far from enough.

30
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,680
I understand.

31
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,440
I will help.

32
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,680
Once you kill Yan Fengshan,

33
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,280
start living like a human again.

34
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,800
Desperate imagination

35
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,000
can bring the dead back to your side.

36
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,480
Don't you find that interesting?

37
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,840
Can't you see Wang Pu now?

38
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,640
A brilliant stratagem

39
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,000
indeed.

40
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,920
In the past 15 years,

41
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,400
I've run through countless possibilities.

42
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,560
Your order has reached
the forces outside the city.

43
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,000
My message has been sent as well.

44
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,000
The regional commanders
are waiting for the result.

45
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,560
Those old, calculating fence-sitters

46
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,600
will not act

47
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,360
until they see your head

48
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,800
or my corpse.

49
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,920
Impressive, White Hair.

50
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,400
You have long surpassed

51
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,720
your father.

52
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,680
Indeed.

53
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,000
The night my family was slaughtered,

54
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,640
I learned never to show mercy to an enemy.

55
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,200
The night before you killed him,

56
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,280
he intended to strike first.

57
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,640
He kept

58
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,360
repeating your name at home.

59
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,840
Yes, you rose in power,

60
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,840
but you were his first disciple.

61
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,640
He still believed

62
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,200
his own disciple

63
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,240
would not be so ruthless

64
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,480
as to deal him such a cruel blow.

65
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,360
After tonight,

66
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,560
there will be no more Yan Fengshan.

67
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,520
When tomorrow comes,

68
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,680
what will you live for?

69
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,400
What will I live for?

70
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,760
When I escaped back then,

71
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,520
I hid in the city for a long time.

72
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,520
Every day, I watched people
walking through the streets,

73
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,919
busy, rushing.

74
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,840
And I wondered:

75
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,400
"Why do they hurry?"

76
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,240
"How is it they all
have homes to return to?"

77
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,320
That was when I understood

78
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,400
there would be nothing left

79
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,000
for me to hope for.

80
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,240
Then tomorrow,

81
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,800
walk around Chang'an.

82
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,320
Sometimes,

83
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,840
the city has beautiful sights.

84
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,880
All right.

85
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,880
Finish it, White Hair.

86
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,600
No.

87
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,840
You must die slowly.

88
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,720
That hurts more.

89
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,160
Farewell,

90
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,560
General Fengshan.

91
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,240
General Fengshan ordered

92
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,840
that we slaughter Xiao Wuyang's army.

93
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,080
Good.

94
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,560
After surrounding them for so long,
we can finally finish them off.

95
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,880
I received word.

96
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,720
A young man named Xie Huai'an
says he is one step away

97
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,560
from killing Yan Fengshan.

98
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,560
He wants us to wait two more hours.

99
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,840
What we are doing
will either crown a new emperor

100
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,600
or mark ourselves as traitors.

101
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,040
Two hours

102
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,280
is worth waiting.

103
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,960
Gentlemen,

104
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,680
time to decide.

105
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,600
Without Yan Fengshan,
you lack the strength

106
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,360
to seize Chang'an on your own.

107
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,360
His Majesty is still alive,
and so is Gu Yu.

108
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,680
Think carefully before choosing your side.

109
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,080
You all earned great merit
under the founding emperor.

110
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,920
Why not leave a good name
for your descendants?

111
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,840
His Majesty has granted me full authority.

112
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,080
I can promise you this:

113
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,640
if the four of you lay down your weapons,

114
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,040
the siege will be wiped clean,

115
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,880
and the matter of military command
can be renegotiated.

116
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,440
Yan Fengshan is dead.

117
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,640
Huben shadow guards,

118
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,560
whether fleeing or hiding,

119
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,880
surrender, and live!

120
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,960
Yan Fengshan is dead.

121
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,880
Huben shadow guards,

122
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,800
whether fleeing or hiding,

123
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,720
surrender, and live!

124
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,640
Yan Fengshan is dead.

125
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,560
Huben shadow guards,

126
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,520
whether fleeing or hiding,

127
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,520
surrender, and live!

128
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,920
Yan Fengshan is dead.

129
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,880
Huben shadow guards,

130
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,960
whether fleeing or hiding,

131
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,560
surrender, and live!

132
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,000
Yan Fengshan is dead.

133
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,920
Huben shadow guards,

134
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,880
whether fleeing or hiding,

135
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,200
surrender, and live!

136
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,160
Yan Fengshan is dead.

137
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,120
Huben shadow guards,

138
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,120
whether fleeing or hiding,

139
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,600
surrender, and live!

140
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:23,440
IMPERIAL PHYSICIAN'S HALL

141
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,320
Stop worrying so much.

142
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,880
What if your senior brother guessed wrong?

143
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,800
Besides,

144
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,600
if that boy meant you harm,
he'd have poisoned the snow-pear tonic.

145
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,240
You finished it, and nothing…

146
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,320
Mr. Xie Huai'an sent us to inform you

147
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,760
that Yan Fengshan is dead.

148
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,160
He's dead?

149
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,600
Are you sure?

150
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,640
Are you sure the body wasn't switched?

151
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,320
What about

152
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,360
Xie Huai'an?

153
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,920
Where is he?

154
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,280
Did he personally confirm the body?

155
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,200
Just a while ago,

156
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,520
Mr. Xie took Yan Fengshan's head
out of the city to end the battle.

157
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,000
Didn't you hear that?

158
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,600
Yan Fengshan is dead!

159
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,160
I want to walk alone for a while.

160
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,680
Mr. Xie also instructed us
to inform you of another matter.

161
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,400
It concerns Ye Zheng.

162
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,560
Greetings, Mr. Xie.

163
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,120
The armies of the four regional commanders
have begun to withdraw.

164
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,240
Inside the city,

165
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,720
Gu Yu placed a 100-man Baiwenhu unit
at my disposal.

166
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,800
I've sent people into the palace
to clear out the Huben forces.

167
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,000
His Majesty is safe.

168
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,560
There is no need for worry.

169
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,800
Where is His Majesty now?

170
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,680
Please wait a few more days.

171
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,120
His Majesty

172
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,320
will return.

173
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,600
Your Majesty,

174
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,160
are these candles for him?

175
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,200
Many have already lit candles
for General Fengshan.

176
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,120
I lit these for myself.

177
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,760
It is said that after death,

178
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,400
these lights help guide the soul

179
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,520
so it does not lose its way.

180
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,760
I was taken out of the mountains
by Huben members

181
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,880
and raised by them.

182
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,000
I always knew they weren't my real family.

183
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,320
But without them,

184
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,640
I would've been eaten by beasts
in the mountains long ago.

185
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,440
No one in this world cares about me.

186
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,480
After I die,

187
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,240
no one will light a candle for me.

188
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,520
I am ready.

189
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,920
I know everything

190
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,160
you just said.

191
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,200
I also know you were involved
in my sister's death.

192
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,880
The Huben Army saved you,

193
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,360
but they also used you as a pawn.

194
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,080
They dragged you into their game

195
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,520
in that murder plot.

196
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,400
Then,

197
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,880
they made you stand before the world

198
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,600
as a fake emperor.

199
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,600
If it were me,

200
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,880
I would never let a child

201
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,960
bear that kind of guilt.

202
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,560
You have repaid

203
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,880
the Huben Army's kindness.

204
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,040
You don't need to die here.

205
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,320
But before the true emperor returns,

206
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,800
you must remain on the throne

207
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,280
to keep the realm steady.

208
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,640
When all of this is over,

209
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,680
I will find you a way to live.

210
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,880
Perhaps

211
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,480
I will find you a place
where no one knows you

212
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,360
so you can live out your days in peace.

213
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,120
I, Xie Huai'an,

214
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,200
offer my respects to Your Majesty.

215
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,240
I am sorry.

216
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,360
I was wrong.

217
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,760
I am sorry.

218
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,400
I was wrong.

219
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,400
I am sorry.

220
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,160
I was wrong.

221
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,080
I am sorry.

222
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,880
I was wrong.

223
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,000
TAIQING PALACE

224
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,880
HOLD THE UNCARVED, KEEP THE TRUE

225
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,880
This painting of you

226
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,840
represents my wish for you.

227
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,640
I hope you can tend flowers,

228
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,000
keep a cat,

229
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,120
nap on the porch,

230
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,920
and live a peaceful life.

231
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,080
Keep it with you,

232
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,520
as if your family is still by your side.

233
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,840
You must keep living.

234
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,600
Your Majesty, all has been done
according to your instructions.

235
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,040
Yan Fengshan is dead.

236
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,280
The Huben Army has scattered.

237
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,120
I knew we would soon see Your Majesty.

238
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,800
You were playing
"Saying Goodbye," weren't you?

239
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,520
It is somewhat fitting for tonight.

240
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,840
That tune is nothing more
than feigned sorrow.

241
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,520
The people here live in comfort.

242
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,400
They have never tasted true hardship.

243
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,000
Then play the "White Bone Ballad" instead.

244
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,520
Let Chang'an be filled
with the sorrow of us Tiemo people.

245
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

246
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,320
KING OF TIEMO

247
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,280
I have been looking for you.

248
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,520
Had I known you were of Tiemo,

249
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,960
I would've given you some Bitter-After

250
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,160
when I bought it.

251
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,080
Chewing Bitter-After would draw suspicion.

252
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,800
I was trained as a shadow guard too.

253
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,760
Not a single Tiemo habit
could remain with me.

254
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,920
The King wants to see you.

255
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,200
White Hair,

256
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,480
come with me.

257
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,520
Were you involved

258
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,240
in my father's death?

259
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,920
Your father showed me kindness.

260
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,680
I was not in Chang'an then.

261
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,400
But Tiemo was involved.

262
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,440
To Tiemo, Liu Ziwen

263
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,920
was someone who had to die.

264
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,920
If you wish to know
how deeply we were involved,

265
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,880
ask the King

266
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,720
when you meet him.

267
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,040
The Tiemo people killed my father,

268
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,880
let Yan Fengshan rise,

269
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,120
and waited for him and Xiao Wuyang
to tear each other apart.

270
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,240
You cleared the Huben guards
outside Yan Fengshan's residence for me.

271
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,440
And you sent me a puppet
that looked just like Wang Pu.

272
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,200
Now that Yan Fengshan is dead

273
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,200
and the regional commanders
have withdrawn,

274
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,720
Chang'an

275
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,680
is at its weakest.

276
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,440
A well-laid plan indeed.

277
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,320
About 40 years ago,

278
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,520
there was a battle north of Chen Valley.

279
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,600
There was no righteous or evil side.

280
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,280
We wanted that piece of land,

281
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,240
so war broke out.

282
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,840
Back then, I was just a commoner,

283
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,120
and I was ordered to evacuate.

284
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,560
I stood by the river

285
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,560
and watched others wade across,

286
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,120
unable to bring myself to leave.

287
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,400
I was worried

288
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,600
that my sheep might not survive,

289
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:10,760
that the hawk I caught might fly away,

290
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:16,000
and that my house
might be burned to the ground.

291
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,600
Someone crossing the river asked me,

292
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,000
"Why aren't you worried
about your family?"

293
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,360
Yes.

294
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,400
My family should have been
my greatest concern.

295
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,920
But…

296
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,080
they were already gone.

297
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,480
And they did not die in war.

298
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,400
Tiemo's winters are bitter cold.

299
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,040
Children born in winter rarely live

300
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,360
to see the snow melt.

301
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,000
My children

302
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,000
were born in winter.

303
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,680
We want our children to grow up safely.

304
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:11,280
We want the sick
to have herbs for treatment.

305
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,920
We want our cattle and sheep
to have steady grazing grounds.

306
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,680
We want people to stop killing each other
over a scrap of dry food.

307
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,920
But

308
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,040
Tiemo's land is far too barren.

309
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,400
So

310
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,720
we had to take your land,

311
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,840
no matter the cost,

312
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,840
even if it meant
lying in wait for 30 years

313
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,640
for the faintest chance.

314
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,440
Our land also has young children

315
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,880
and sick people.

316
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,600
If we give all our land to Tiemo,

317
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,480
how are we supposed to live?

318
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,040
How are we supposed to live?

319
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,200
You are right.

320
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:07,960
But

321
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,440
what does that have to do with me?

322
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,120
It has nothing to do with you.

323
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,360
Now that Yan Fengshan is dead,

324
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,400
I am no longer of use to you.

325
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,560
Mr. Long,

326
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,160
you have no reason to take me

327
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,240
to your king.

328
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,120
Xiao Wuyang is missing, isn't he?

329
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,080
When I went to see him,

330
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,960
he had already awakened,

331
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,280
but he told me not to say anything.

332
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,440
I did not understand then.

333
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,880
Now I do.

334
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,080
You were controlling
the pace of his recovery

335
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,760
just to delay

336
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,920
when he would wake.

337
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,880
You are White Hair.

338
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,120
I cannot hide anything from you.

339
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,280
Your ambush failed

340
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,080
because your target was Xiao Wuyang,
the King of Death.

341
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,920
You never stood a chance.

342
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,360
With you in our hands,

343
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:33,199
he will show himself sooner or later.

344
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,320
Let's search over there.

345
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,840
Come on.

346
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,920
Tiemo's winters are freezing cold.

347
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,280
Wolves come to steal livestock,

348
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,120
and herders must shoot them down.

349
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,600
Forced to walk
into the boundless snowfields,

350
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:30,560
some never make it back.

351
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,960
The next year,

352
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,440
when winter ends and the snow melts,

353
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,640
a mother who has lost her child

354
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,000
finds a pile of white bones on the ground.

355
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,720
Those bones belong
to the wolves and her son.

356
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,640
She makes a flute
out of the wolves' bones,

357
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,400
and its mournful sound

358
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,560
echoes across Tiemo's land.

359
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,160
That is the "White Bone Ballad."

360
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,760
General Gu,

361
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,440
you may have heard the story,

362
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,520
but what you don't know

363
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,320
is that Tiemo shadow guards
entered Chang'an

364
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,080
20 years ago.

365
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:24,120
They've long blended into the city,

366
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,920
living as ordinary people.

367
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,360
They learned Chang'an's culture,

368
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,240
weaving, and tailoring,

369
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,360
their skill no worse than the locals'.

370
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,120
Some even married people of Chang'an

371
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,480
and had children,

372
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,440
enjoying an ordinary, peaceful life.

373
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,440
But we had an agreement:

374
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:49,000
when the "White Bone Ballad"
echoes over Chang'an,

375
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,600
that will be the moment
they return to their true nature.

376
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,600
Young man,

377
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,280
it really is you.

378
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,560
Why are you out in such a panic
in the middle of the night?

379
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,520
Did you provoke
someone you shouldn't have,

380
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,560
and now they're after you?

381
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,280
The city is in chaos.

382
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,520
It's dangerous at night.

383
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,320
Why don't you come inside
and sit for a bit?

384
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:45,040
INCENSES AND CANDLES

385
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,040
Young man, your hair…

386
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:07,080
Both times we met,
you looked completely lost.

387
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,280
What happened tonight?

388
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,520
A thief broke into my home.

389
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,520
I came out to report it.

390
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,280
Chang'an grows more unsafe by the day.

391
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,160
Ill fortune clings to you.

392
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,240
Wash your face first. Here.

393
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,880
-Go on. Here.
-Thank you.

394
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,360
Think nothing of it.

395
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,280
I feel for those who suffer.

396
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,240
Everyone in this world suffers.

397
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,440
Everyone suffers.

398
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,000
General Gu, do you know?

399
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,120
The wolves prey on our livestock,

400
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,920
yet we Tiemo people
still take the wolf as our totem,

401
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,080
because the wolves taught us
how to plunder.

402
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,280
We Tiemo people

403
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:35,280
don't deserve to live forever
on cold, barren land.

404
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,520
So we must ride out and plunder.

405
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,880
We must seize fertile ground.

406
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,200
Not a patch of Chang'an's land

407
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,720
will you ever take.

408
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,200
Not a single resident of Chang'an

409
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,000
will submit to you.

410
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,520
Hasn't your army
already been cut down by mine?

411
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,760
Aren't you already my spoils of war?

412
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,440
Chang'an is about to fall.

413
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,480
What else do you have to say?

414
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,480
Rest assured.

415
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,200
Chang'an will not fall.

416
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,680
Right now, I pity only my warhorse.

417
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,080
It carried me out of the city to fight

418
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,800
and carried me back to die.

419
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,240
You're bleeding out,

420
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,440
yet you still had that move hidden?

421
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,240
A pity

422
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,520
I'm a cripple.

423
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,520
You're from Tiemo.

424
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,520
Tell me

425
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,000
where your master is.

426
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,600
Fortunately,
there are still those in Chang'an

427
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,600
you cannot defeat.
