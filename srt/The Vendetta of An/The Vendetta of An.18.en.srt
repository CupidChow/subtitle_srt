1
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,360
Chancellor Gao,

2
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,240
I am deeply grateful for your help

3
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,440
these past days.

4
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,200
No need to thank me.

5
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,000
If anything,

6
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,480
I am the one who owes you.

7
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,400
I was too wary of you back then.

8
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,760
You are His Majesty's strategist.

9
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,760
You shoulder the fate of the realm.

10
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,520
It was right for you

11
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,160
to be cautious of me.

12
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,720
Hearing you say so

13
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,200
and thinking

14
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,360
of the steamed buns
I've been sending you this past month,

15
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,240
I can finally feel at ease.

16
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,600
It's been over a month.

17
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,400
Is your hand healed?

18
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,720
Yes.

19
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,440
And your legs?

20
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,560
Probably

21
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,480
about the same as yours.

22
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,600
It is already the Zi hour.

23
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,680
Time is running short.

24
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,480
But at least

25
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,920
it is a gentle night.

26
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,040
What is this?

27
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,960
It reads like a farewell letter.

28
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,040
And he tells us not to worry?

29
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,320
Stop worrying.

30
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,680
Huai'an will be fine.

31
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,240
Sir.

32
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:10,880
CANGYUE TOWER

33
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,760
Mr. Wuyin.

34
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,760
Please rest here.

35
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,480
At dawn, General Fengshan will await you
at Taiqing Hall.

36
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,840
Sir,

37
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,040
don't be uneasy about tonight.

38
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,640
I will stand guard.

39
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,760
I'm not uneasy.

40
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,920
I'm simply wondering

41
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,320
why a prosperous city like Chang'an

42
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,120
produces such folk.

43
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,640
A slave girl who could play the guqin
turned out

44
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,720
to be an assassin.

45
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,000
A peddler who appeared
to be from Tiemo turned out

46
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,000
to be the mastermind.

47
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,160
And then there's Yan Fengshan.

48
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,960
He wants to borrow my troops
to attack his own city.

49
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,680
Dealing with these people

50
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,040
is exhausting.

51
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,600
That's enough for today.

52
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,880
You should rest early as well.

53
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,640
Yes, sir.

54
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,320
As long as you keep quiet,

55
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,120
you will be fine.

56
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,120
We go way back.

57
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,560
I have something to discuss with you.

58
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,640
Don't breathe into my palm.

59
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,880
Two men alone in the dark

60
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,280
at this hour

61
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,280
is strange enough as it is.

62
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,120
Stop laughing.

63
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,440
I'm going to move my hand away.

64
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,960
As long as you don't shout,

65
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,840
my axe

66
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,840
will stay where it is.

67
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,960
Come on.

68
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,880
At least let me light a candle

69
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,240
so I can see
which old acquaintance you are.

70
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,800
We're two grown men alone in the dark.

71
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,720
It's strange enough.

72
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,280
Don't mimic me.

73
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,080
Fine.

74
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,000
- I don't recognize you.
- Hold on.

75
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,080
I'm not some maiden. Why the rush?

76
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,080
Your tone sounds familiar.

77
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,360
Why can't I place it?

78
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,840
Be patient.

79
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,520
You'll know soon enough.

80
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,080
This grows stranger by the moment.

81
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,760
I still don't recognize you.

82
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,160
Wuyin Chong,

83
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,440
you came to Chang'an as a secret envoy

84
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,680
and the Tiemo prince,

85
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,640
so I shall meet you
as the Emperor of Chang'an.

86
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,680
I just want you to know

87
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,800
that I am still alive.

88
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,760
The Xiao imperial line
still has a survivor.

89
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,280
Whatever you discussed
with that traitor Yan Fengshan

90
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,320
won't count.

91
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,680
We do go way back.

92
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,720
The whole world believes you died
in the palace fire.

93
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,040
Who would have thought?

94
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,360
The look in your eyes,

95
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,160
the way you speak,

96
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,960
and even the way you do things
have all changed.

97
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,160
But you are the Emperor of Chang'an.

98
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,200
Why hide your own face?

99
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,360
Why do you think?

100
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,280
To protect myself, of course,

101
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,840
while I deal with Yan Fengshan.

102
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,440
Just as you said,

103
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,400
you are now nothing more
than a fugitive trying to stay alive.

104
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,840
What right have you to supplant
Yan Fengshan and make a pact with me?

105
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,520
You call yourself an emperor,
but do you have any force to command?

106
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,200
Xie Huai'an truly is
the smartest man in the world.

107
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,920
He even guessed every sentence

108
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,240
and every word

109
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,240
you were going to say.

110
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,880
It's the Chou hour.

111
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,200
Come with me.

112
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,320
I'll show you

113
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
the force I command.

114
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,760
Please enjoy, sirs.

115
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,320
Why are you staring at me?

116
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,520
Your force isn't here yet anyway.

117
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,160
Who says?

118
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,120
Listen.

119
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,160
That is just one of my guards.

120
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,200
He is there

121
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,480
to keep you from trying anything.

122
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,040
Listen more closely.

123
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,560
Rumor holds that Chang'an
fell into chaos last month.

124
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,440
Xiao Wuyang and Gu Yu vanished,

125
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,600
their fate unknown.

126
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,240
The great strategist Gao Yan
had his legs broken.

127
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,800
<i>He now moves on a cart</i>

128
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,640
<i>and is kept in the palace</i>
<i>as a lantern keeper,</i>

129
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,400
<i>only allowed out at the Chou hour</i>
<i>to deliver memorials to Yan Fengshan.</i>

130
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,720
That Xie Huai'an you mentioned

131
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,360
managed to get Gao Yan out.

132
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,320
A remarkable feat.

133
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,320
I am that force.

134
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,480
The Xiao imperial line
still has a survivor,

135
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,000
and Gu Yu of the Baiwenhu Army
still lives.

136
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,720
Chang'an

137
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,160
is not yet ruled by Yan Fengshan.

138
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,720
Whatever pact you plan to make
with him tomorrow

139
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,200
will not stand.

140
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,000
Chang'an

141
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,040
will change hands again,

142
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,760
and the fight will be
against Yan Fengshan.

143
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,200
If you make a pact with him,

144
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,360
the north will also change hands,

145
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,640
and the fight will be against you.

146
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,760
General Gu,

147
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,400
my people and yours have fought for years.

148
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,440
We have never feared you.

149
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
His Majesty,

150
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,520
I,

151
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,400
and the entire city of Chang'an

152
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,800
have been pressed to this state
by Yan Fengshan,

153
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,360
but we have not been defeated.

154
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,800
You are not without fear.

155
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,600
You fear the one

156
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,480
who has been planning all of this for us.

157
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,280
Xie Huai'an is the son of Liu Ziwen.

158
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,160
He's the one who gave you a new face

159
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,480
and the one who helped you survive.

160
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,200
Am I right?

161
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,800
Yes.

162
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,560
The last two generations of the Liu family

163
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,359
produced extraordinary men in succession.

164
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,119
They have used up
decades of Chang'an's fortune.

165
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,360
I understand now.

166
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,600
This night shall be
the most unforgettable of my life.

167
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,640
Tonight makes me

168
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,480
fall in love with Chang'an anew.

169
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,600
Your Majesty, it has been a long time.

170
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,440
We actually met before.

171
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,720
You simply didn't know it was me.

172
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,880
Keeping you hidden at his side

173
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,280
was indeed the best strategy.

174
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,680
But according to the plan,

175
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,080
he should already be
in Yan Fengshan's hands now.

176
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,880
On the road toward killing Yan Fengshan,

177
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,080
all of us must pay a price.

178
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,440
May I have that flask of wine?

179
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,400
Is it for Chancellor Gao?

180
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,520
This painting of you

181
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,760
bears my wish for you.

182
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,800
I hope you can tend flowers,

183
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,800
keep a cat,

184
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,560
nap on the porch,

185
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,840
<i>and live in peace,</i>

186
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,000
<i>even for just one day.</i>

187
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,240
You're awake.

188
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,560
The General has gone to the palace
to meet Wuyin Chong.

189
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,120
He instructed me to treat you as a guest.

190
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,280
I brought you a basin of water

191
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,000
to wipe the blood off.

192
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,280
You knew she lay buried here?

193
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,520
Yes.

194
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,440
And you still chose
to stay in this residence?

195
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,640
Yes.

196
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,400
Were you involved

197
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,800
in her death as well?

198
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,040
- Take care.
- Goodbye.

199
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,520
Yes.

200
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,120
Then you too, must die.

201
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,960
FOR LIU ZIWEN ONLY

202
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:43,600
This is my plan.

203
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,360
It…

204
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,040
it is far too risky.

205
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,880
Back then,

206
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,520
you did not help my father
get rid of Yan Fengshan.

207
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,080
I will not question

208
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,880
your reasons.

209
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,520
It is

210
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,880
only natural for people

211
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,720
to put themselves first.

212
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,200
I am using your guilt

213
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,040
toward the Liu family

214
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,520
to force your hand.

215
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,960
I am the one going too far.

216
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,400
Mr. Yang.

217
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,720
<i>We act at the Chou hour.</i>

218
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,960
<i>By the Yin hour,</i>

219
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,640
<i>Yan Fengshan will have received the news</i>

220
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,680
<i>and realized you were involved.</i>

221
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,080
<i>You must depart at once.</i>

222
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,320
<i>Zhu Zhilong will be waiting for you</i>

223
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,240
<i>at the Yuelao Temple</i>
<i>50</i> li <i>west of the city.</i>

224
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,880
<i>After this,</i>

225
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,040
<i>your business in Chang'an and elsewhere</i>

226
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,240
<i>will certainly be affected.</i>

227
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,840
<i>If I prevail in the following days,</i>

228
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,960
<i>I shall repay</i>

229
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,600
<i>every loss you suffer.</i>

230
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,320
Boss.

231
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,640
Boss, what's going on?

232
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,160
Is the court cleaning house?

233
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,480
The books we cannot let anyone see
are over there.

234
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,680
I'll get them.

235
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,160
Boss,

236
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,240
what is wrong with you?

237
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,800
General Fengshan,

238
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,960
my master says

239
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,800
the agreement you and he
were about to reach

240
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,400
does not align with Tiemo's interests,
so it will be set aside for now.

241
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:44,520
But the army we sent
to hold back the Baiwenhu Army

242
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,560
will not retreat.

243
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,440
Everything will remain as it is.

244
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,480
General, you may rest assured.

245
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,360
I see.

246
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,800
The struggle for Chang'an is not yet over.

247
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,560
My master hopes you will soon become

248
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,600
the one who rules Chang'an.

249
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,960
Old friend,

250
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,680
do not worry about the outcome anymore.

251
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,520
Rest in peace.

252
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,480
General Fengshan.

253
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,760
This life-and-death plan of Gao Yan's

254
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,680
was executed flawlessly
with the people outside.

255
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,520
You were the one handling

256
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,440
all the message delivery, weren't you?

257
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,480
So Gu Yu had been hiding here

258
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,800
for over a month?

259
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,000
No wonder even after
searching all of Chang'an,

260
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,080
we never found a trace.

261
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,680
Gao Yan and Gu Yu actually joined hands.

262
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,240
I accept my loss

263
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,080
in this round.

264
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,120
Cease this pretense.

265
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,720
A man who has served three emperors

266
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,560
has eyes sharper than a blade.

267
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,440
You know perfectly well
if I intend to kill you.

268
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,800
Your eyes are sharp too, General.

269
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,000
All I did was sigh once
while wiping the floor,

270
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,120
and you noticed immediately.

271
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,960
When you were setting this up,

272
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,080
White Hair had already fallen
into my hands.

273
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,800
Otherwise,

274
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,720
I truly would have killed you.

275
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,040
I helped you get into the palace

276
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,160
so you could live out your years in peace.

277
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,520
This is a good place to grow old quietly.

278
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,760
Stay here and behave yourself.

279
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,600
- Sir.
- Come in.

280
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,840
I have conveyed your message
to Yan Fengshan.

281
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,159
But Yan Fengshan has always
been scheming and calculating.

282
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,120
Given the situation,

283
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,159
we should return to Tiemo
as soon as possible.

284
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,120
I understand what you mean,

285
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,280
but Yan Fengshan would not
dare move against us.

286
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,360
Even so, it is time to head back.

287
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:43,320
FUZE INN

288
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,960
This is a rare treat in Chang'an.

289
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,160
Want one?

290
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,360
Sure.

291
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,840
This end

292
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,560
is most bitter.

293
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,960
You shouldn't

294
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,040
chew too much of it,

295
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,640
or all you'll taste

296
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,280
is bitterness.

297
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,920
Of course I know that.

298
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,200
Twenty-five years ago,
I infiltrated Tiemo as a scout.

299
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,520
I barely had any money.

300
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,120
It was freezing there,

301
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,000
and chewing this was how I kept warm
and stayed awake.

302
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,160
It used to be cheaper than horse fodder.

303
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,200
But now the price has gone up.

304
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,120
A small bundle

305
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,120
costs two <i>liang.</i>

306
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,320
At your request,
the Tiemo forces have held

307
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,840
the Baiwenhu Army in a standoff.

308
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,000
They stand so close
their horses are near nose to nose.

309
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,920
With things so tense,

310
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,240
few merchants dare travel back and forth.

311
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,640
The supply is unstable,

312
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,560
and naturally,

313
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,520
the price rises.

314
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,560
Last night, you staged quite a show.

315
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,000
You did far more
than persuade Wuyin Chong.

316
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,800
The sharp merchants will soon realize

317
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,200
the Tiemo forces will not march south.

318
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,440
When that happens,

319
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,520
the price will naturally fall again.

320
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,920
The whole game has been thrown into chaos,

321
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,800
yet you seem remarkably calm.

322
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,080
Victory and defeat
are commonplace in warfare.

323
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,440
One who cares too much
about gains and losses

324
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,720
cannot be a true commander.

325
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,880
Speaking of which,
you cling to gains and losses quite a bit.

326
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,720
You buried Wei Qianting,

327
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,200
sent Pu Nichuan to his death,

328
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,840
and killed Liu Ziyan with your own hands.

329
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,440
Qingyi has vanished,

330
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,600
and even Wang Pu
was outwitted and killed by you.

331
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,360
All I have left beside me is Zhiying.

332
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,440
Do you intend to kill her too?

333
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,640
Of course.

334
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,840
I care deeply

335
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,040
about settling scores.

336
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,120
On the road of revenge,

337
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,360
I cannot allow even one enemy
to meet a good end.

338
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,880
And forget not,

339
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,960
you're one of them too.

340
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,280
Then

341
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,000
why didn't you kill Yang Chuhao?

342
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,960
He stood by and did nothing.

343
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,000
That is not a capital crime.

344
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,680
I still

345
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,280
have my principles.

346
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,120
Back then, he stood by and did nothing.

347
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,080
Last night, he chose to help you.

348
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,720
I have my principles too.

349
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,240
He will know no peaceful end.

350
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,480
Too bad you won't find him.

351
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,000
Speaking of which,

352
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,120
there is a young man surnamed Su
working under Yang Chuhao.

353
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,480
Do you remember him?

354
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,040
We crossed paths once.

355
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,720
I looked into him.
He is not a Huben member.

356
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,480
Of all involved in Yang's affairs,

357
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,040
Yang himself is the only Huben member.

358
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,800
That boy truly is not.

359
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,680
Anyone who can catch your eye

360
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,560
must have some wits.

361
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,200
To work for Yang Chuhao

362
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,800
and even handle something
as important as the accounts,

363
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,880
wits alone aren't enough.

364
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,320
He must also have a story behind him.

365
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,040
‪He's like you.
