1
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,440
The Huben Army's ambush

2
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,400
caused Chang'an to fall.

3
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,400
The Emperor, Xiao Wuyang, was attacked

4
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,240
and went missing.

5
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,400
Yan Fengshan rules Chang'an once again.

6
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,600
Master, is this the only way
out of the city?

7
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,320
Yes.

8
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,720
A few thousand people were mobilized
from Hidden Soldier Alley.

9
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,000
They mainly handle court secrets
and the city gates.

10
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,000
The canal is remote
so there is still a chance.

11
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,680
People say that Your Majesty

12
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,120
is kind in heart yet lacking in talent.

13
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,400
You ascended the throne
only to govern in mediocrity.

14
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,040
You brought war back upon the land
and left the common people in misery.

15
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,120
They also added that, in the end,
you had let your ancestors down

16
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,120
and perished in disgrace.

17
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,080
But I beg to differ.

18
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,920
I have heard that
under Your Majesty's leadership,

19
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,400
you granted the people time to recover

20
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,360
and returned the troops to their barracks.

21
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,560
You reshaped customs

22
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,560
and brought prosperity to all.

23
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,360
The elderly had someone to rely on

24
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,800
and the children had someone
to raise them.

25
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,800
Though your reign

26
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,400
lacked both the fierce valor
of your late father

27
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,320
and the martial might
of the Marquis of Northguard,

28
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,160
you held compassion for the common folk,

29
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,360
and cared for the livelihood of the poor.

30
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,640
With such devotion to the state
and its people,

31
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,160
you are not at fault.

32
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,160
They called you a scoundrel

33
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,560
whose disorderly governance

34
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,720
caused the northern army to rise
and seize the throne by force.

35
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,600
The court cowered in trepidation
and the martial world grew disheartened.

36
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,400
Fear stirred resentment

37
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,240
and bitterness took root
against Your Majesty.

38
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,800
While Your Majesty
might have lost your throne

39
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,440
and is wandering the world aimlessly,

40
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,720
your devotion shouldn't be confined
only to the palace walls.

41
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,120
Even far from the center of power,

42
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,680
you may still accomplish much.

43
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,600
In this life,

44
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,880
I fear I will have no chance
to see Your Majesty again.

45
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,040
I pray only that Your Majesty

46
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,400
does not forget your first intent…

47
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,320
FROM HAN ZILING

48
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,760
…for one day it will be heard
somewhere in the world.

49
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,440
So your name was Han Ziling.

50
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,480
For some reason,

51
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,840
the gates of the Imperial Jail are open.

52
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,800
I guess

53
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,200
White Hair has fulfilled his promise.

54
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,600
You've been sitting for a few decades.

55
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,080
You can finally stand up now.

56
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,280
I no longer have the right to sit.

57
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,040
To save you,

58
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,880
I hid the fact

59
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,480
that White Hair
was in Hidden Soldier Alley.

60
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,800
This is unfair

61
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,880
to the Huben Army.

62
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,120
To protect myself,

63
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,000
I even gave away
the Huben Army's gold coin.

64
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,280
This is also a form of betrayal.

65
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,920
Mother,

66
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,280
like mother, like son indeed.

67
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,680
Right now,

68
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,000
the Huben Army

69
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,280
no longer has anything to do with me.

70
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,400
I think

71
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,400
I should leave.

72
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,080
I should have

73
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,600
left sooner.

74
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,960
ONE MONTH LATER

75
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,960
Hot lamb soup!

76
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,480
-Come inside.
-Come in.

77
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,440
-Yes.
-Two?

78
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,080
-Sir, sit down.
-It's fresh.

79
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,800
-More vegetables.
-It's delicious.

80
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,400
-Sure.
-It's so fresh.

81
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,160
Give me some.

82
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,560
Here.

83
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,880
Sure. Let me pack it for you.

84
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,840
-Who are you?
-It's me.

85
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,800
Don't you remember me?

86
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,880
‎HOUSE SAUCES

87
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,800
Little runt, right?

88
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,000
You are a little runt.

89
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,360
Indeed.

90
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,040
I don't know who my parents are.

91
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,320
Perhaps I'm someone no one wants.

92
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,880
Come and have a look.

93
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,800
I was just kidding.

94
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,520
Give me two jin of pork shoulder.

95
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,840
My mother's making
stuffed flatbread tonight.

96
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,840
Oh, it's you.

97
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,000
Why not get some?

98
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,200
I'm sorry. I can't help you this time.

99
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,160
Why?

100
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,600
Didn't you go to the butcher's shop
to chop some meat for me last time?

101
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,880
That was the last time.
This time, it's different.

102
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,640
How so?

103
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,720
I'm different.

104
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,080
You still look the same.

105
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,880
Did you commit a crime?

106
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,000
A huge crime.

107
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,720
Then, can you still go home and eat?

108
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,080
I guess.

109
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,600
However, I'm different.

110
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,160
I have to earn

111
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,040
my own meal.

112
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,680
That is why it's so meaningful.

113
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,400
General, dinner is ready.

114
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,960
Let's wait for Wang Pu.

115
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,680
He has gone to the market.

116
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,960
He'll be slow with shackles on his feet.

117
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,200
You may go back first.

118
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,480
One more thing.

119
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,680
Secret envoys of Tiemo have departed.

120
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,840
Yang Chuhao
is in charge of taking care of them.

121
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,080
The Tiemo people are coming.

122
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,240
White Hair should also be appearing soon.

123
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,800
He won't let go of this opportunity.

124
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,360
Tell Yang Chuhao's men
to keep a close eye on it.

125
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,760
Yes.

126
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,960
Why hasn't Wang Pu come back?

127
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,760
I'll go and pick him up from the market.

128
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,600
You spoil him, General.

129
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,520
I captured Chang'an

130
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,400
but I didn't sit on the throne
at Taiqing Hall.

131
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,640
I moved to the market instead.

132
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,400
But eating alone makes me feel lonely.

133
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,720
I'm closing up.

134
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,680
-The radish is nice.
-Do you have something larger?

135
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,720
-They are different.
-That's great.

136
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,120
Very good.

137
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,800
-I'll take two.
-Sure.

138
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,720
Give me a discount.

139
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,600
I want more.

140
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,520
-General.
-General.

141
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,240
-General.
-General.

142
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,720
Keep drinking.

143
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,120
All of you may leave.

144
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,040
I have something to say to Mr. Wang Pu.

145
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,040
-Yes.
-Yes.

146
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,520
When you're upset,

147
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,840
drinking makes you inebriated faster.

148
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,320
I dare not act recklessly before you.

149
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,480
You've acted recklessly many times.

150
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,400
Zhiying cooks for us every day.

151
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,000
She never complains,

152
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,480
yet you will not accept her kindness.

153
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,360
I'm not refusing her kindness.

154
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,200
I feel too guilty to eat.

155
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,360
Do you feel no guilt

156
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,120
eating meat and drinking wine
in this eatery, then?

157
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,080
Back in Hidden Soldier Alley,
I gave him plenty of favors.

158
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,480
Of course, I don't feel guilty.

159
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,000
On the contrary,

160
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,640
I failed to solve your problem

161
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,080
and nearly cost you your life.

162
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,880
I feel guilty.

163
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,760
You won't win against White Hair.

164
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,240
I might not even be able to do it either.

165
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,040
Zhiying said I spoiled you.

166
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,120
I don't treat you
like a general treats his subordinates.

167
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,200
However, you served me
since you were young.

168
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,480
I've never regarded you as my subordinate.

169
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,880
If a subordinate makes a mistake

170
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,360
and I kill him,

171
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,720
many more people are available
to obey my command.

172
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,360
When you make a mistake

173
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,600
and don't come home to eat,

174
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,600
I come out to find you.

175
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,640
I endure the night breeze,

176
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,080
as though looking for my own child.

177
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,000
It's time to go back.

178
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,960
-You're paying for real?
-Of course.

179
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,360
I won't kill you
just because you charged me.

180
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,000
Look.

181
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,880
The reward is quite high.

182
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,200
I know, right?

183
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,640
Have you seen this man?

184
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,280
If I'd seen him, I would've…

185
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,600
Let's go.

186
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,560
WARRANT

187
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,800
It does not resemble him.

188
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,240
Master, I'm back.

189
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,840
It's time to go back.

190
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,320
It's going to rain soon.

191
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,320
We're going back when I just arrived?

192
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,720
Let's rest for a while longer.

193
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,120
The air is good here,

194
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,200
unlike the gloomy
and depressing Cangshui River.

195
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,480
It's stuffy there.

196
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,000
Master,

197
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,000
what is the tale behind Cangshui River?

198
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,480
I've been keeping watch from inside
for a few days.

199
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,640
And I noticed some suspicious people.

200
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,560
You are always keeping an eye on others.

201
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,800
They will think
you are the suspicious one too.

202
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,600
I have to do that.

203
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,000
You know who I'm protecting.

204
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,160
Huai'an's father, Liu Ziwen,

205
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,760
is a rare talent.

206
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,320
He spent his whole life

207
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,480
protecting Chang'an.

208
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,240
Hidden Soldier Alley
is the last line of defense.

209
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,520
When it fails and Chang'an falls,

210
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,720
the people and the government

211
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,760
have to move to Cangshui River.

212
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,320
Unfortunately,
before Cangshui River was built,

213
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,200
he was killed.

214
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,320
Does Yan Fengshan know about this place?

215
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,720
Or is there anyone in the Huben Army
who knows about this?

216
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,400
I am the manager of Cangshui River.

217
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,960
Do you think I'm foolish enough

218
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,000
to let Yan Fengshan
and the others know about it?

219
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,840
I know you are the manager.

220
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,440
Aren't we just having a friendly chat?

221
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,280
Moreover,

222
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,880
looking at you now,
you are just a boatman at most.

223
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,080
I manage everything from this boat.

224
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,240
You can only reach Cangshui River

225
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,960
on this boat using this river.

226
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,079
Cangshui River only houses refugees now.

227
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,680
All of them have their lips sealed.

228
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,119
No need to be wary of them.

229
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,160
All right.

230
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,560
With you as the manager,

231
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,640
I'm relieved.

232
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,560
I'm leaving.

233
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,120
Take care. Go on.

234
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,280
Just leave it here.

235
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,280
Yes.

236
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,520
-Give it to me.
-No.

237
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,680
-Your salary.
-It's my turn.

238
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,080
-Pile them up.
-Just hold it.

239
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,160
-How many doses of this?
-Weigh your herbs first.

240
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,480
Slow down.

241
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,520
Sir!

242
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,040
I'm done moving the goods.

243
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,520
You've worked hard.

244
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,320
Young men are indeed strong.

245
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,800
With you around,

246
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,640
I can take it easy.

247
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,520
Sir,

248
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,680
have you noticed

249
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,720
someone looking at the shop all the time?

250
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,880
They are just staring
from right outside the shop.

251
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,560
Although they don't stand there for long,

252
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,440
do you think

253
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,560
there's something in this shop
that attracts attention?

254
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,760
Young man,

255
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,360
how long have you been working here?

256
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,920
I've been here for quite some time.

257
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,680
I was working in other shops

258
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,200
and you were hiring.

259
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,080
I came here because you paid more.

260
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,320
You are lying.

261
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,360
I…

262
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,520
I'm not lying.

263
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,680
It's all right.

264
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,720
Everyone who comes here
is a person in misfortune.

265
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,720
Everyone has it tough.

266
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,960
It's normal to keep everything
to yourself.

267
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:03,000
I'm sure that you just arrived
at Cangshui River.

268
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,160
Why don't you tell me

269
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,200
what time it is now?

270
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,000
They are here

271
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,040
to look at this.

272
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,920
Okay.

273
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,440
Along the streets,

274
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,400
there are many of these.

275
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,520
I wonder which smart guy invented this.

276
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,200
Anyway, when I acquired this shop,

277
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,120
it was already here.

278
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,680
That's right.

279
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,880
From tomorrow onward,

280
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,880
you must scoop up the salt that leaks out

281
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,360
and pour it back in.

282
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,680
But I still need to move the goods.

283
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,560
Not anymore. Just watch the shop for me.

284
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,280
Really?

285
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,480
Tomorrow.

286
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,880
Sure!

287
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,040
My back is sore
from moving the goods every day.

288
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,320
My shoulders are sore.

289
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,600
You seem too delicate.

290
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,840
You must once have been of noble birth.

291
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,800
But I don't have a noble's fate.

292
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,000
I was just a pageboy.

293
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,760
A pageboy?

294
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,440
I'll get it again when I finish it.

295
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,400
Take a look.

296
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,200
Here you go.

297
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,320
Look at my chicken.

298
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,720
-How many doses…
-Give me a discount…

299
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,320
-…a day?
-…sir.

300
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,160
Weigh your medicine first.

301
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,280
This is far too dear.

302
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,720
You're back?

303
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,240
How's your brother?

304
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,240
Just like that.

305
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,760
I worked many jobs

306
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,240
and I still can't make a lot of money.

307
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,600
This is tough.

308
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,560
A few days in and you're already
complaining.

309
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,800
Listen.

310
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,080
This is life.

311
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,480
Life?

312
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,480
Life also demands…

313
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,760
That's right. Starting tomorrow,

314
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,200
I'll be taking care of the salt shop.

315
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,560
Someone needs to move the goods.

316
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,480
If you go there,

317
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,400
we'll have two people

318
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,080
working two jobs and earning two salaries.

319
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,080
Good idea.

320
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,960
Working two jobs and earning two salaries.

321
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,480
We may even afford wine.

322
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,560
As expected of you.

323
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,920
No, thanks.

324
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,200
Who was the one who said

325
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,440
this was life just now?

326
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,080
I said that was your life.

327
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,920
I don't like your job

328
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,240
and you can't do my job.

329
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,760
I wonder how Huai'an is doing now.

330
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,280
XUANDU TEMPLE

331
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,400
If you hadn't been transferred
out of Chang'an,

332
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,320
we wouldn't have this opportunity
to have tea so casually.

333
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,120
Yet coming here

334
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,520
only fills me with disappointment.

335
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,520
You've been in Chang'an for so many years.

336
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,920
Don't you have any other ways?

337
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,560
Ways?

338
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,200
After Yan Fengshan captured Chang'an,

339
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,440
the whole situation changed.

340
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,320
What ways do I have?

341
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,320
‎AWAKEN TO THE TRUE WAY

342
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,360
But I heard nothing has changed
in the imperial court.

343
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,480
General Fengshan
doesn't even enter Taiqing Hall.

344
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,520
He even brought someone
from the Xiao imperial family

345
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,600
to be the Emperor

346
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,560
to preserve the legitimacy
of the Xiao dynasty.

347
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,600
Do you really think that the young emperor

348
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,720
is from the Xiao family?

349
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,040
Whether I believe in it or not
isn't important.

350
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,560
The important thing

351
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,480
is when you can be transferred
back to Chang'an.

352
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,600
I'll be honest with you.

353
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,200
On the surface,

354
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,520
I was only an Imperial Guard.

355
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,640
In truth,

356
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,680
I was actually serving Chancellor Gao.

357
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,400
Now, Chancellor Gao
is doing worse than I am.

358
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,520
What makes you think
I can make a comeback again?

359
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,560
Nothing is absolute in life.

360
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,520
It's full of ups and downs.

361
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,080
Don't dwell on it.

362
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,680
When your next wave of fortune comes,

363
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,840
you might even go to further heights.

364
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,400
If your temple had more devotees,

365
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,440
I might believe you a little more.

366
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,720
Look at it now.

367
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,400
It sees more flies than devotees.

368
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,600
It's not a popular area.

369
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,760
It's not a popular area.

370
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,760
Enough.

371
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,120
Just stay here.

372
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,200
When I come here tomorrow,

373
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,120
I'll get another cup of tea.

374
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,240
-Take care.
-Farewell.

375
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,400
XUANDU TEMPLE

376
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,400
LIVE BY NATURE'S WAY

377
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,000
Zeng, the wind rises.

378
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,160
Remember to sleep with an extra blanket.

379
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,200
Yes.

380
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,760
It's getting windy.

381
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,880
No need to worry about me.

382
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,480
I can protect myself.

383
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,400
Thank you for guarding the temple.

384
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,040
I was able to go home for a few nights.

385
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,680
If you need anything, just tell me.

386
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,200
Don't stand on ceremony.

387
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,040
Thank you for taking me in.

388
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,600
You will be blessed for your kindness.

389
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:12,080
XUANDU TEMPLE

390
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,640
You're here.

391
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,280
It has been a long time.

392
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,240
However, this move is too dangerous.

393
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,120
Last time,

394
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,160
we lost badly.

395
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,560
A visitor this late at night?

396
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,240
An acquaintance came to visit.

397
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,040
We exchanged a few words.

398
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,360
I see.

399
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,720
I've returned to retrieve some lamp oil.

400
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,920
Has your friend left?

401
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,440
He has.

402
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,920
He left in a hurry.

403
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,120
You look very tired.

404
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,080
You must rest more.

405
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,440
Sure.

406
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,120
Give me more time.

407
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,360
I will soon give you an explanation.

408
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,040
Liu Zhi,

409
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,600
I don't need an explanation.

410
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,880
I just want you

411
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,400
to live on.

412
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,800
Live on?

413
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,920
What meaning is there in living?

414
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,920
CHANGLE OUTPOST

415
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,360
Sir,

416
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,640
instead of sleeping at night,
you stare at this warrant.

417
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,760
WARRANT

418
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,040
Do you know him?

419
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,520
Your opportunity to return to Chang'an
is here.

420
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,440
It's the middle of the night.

421
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,160
Don't try to fool me.

422
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,560
Last month, gave someone shelter.

423
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,600
He said his name was Zeng.

424
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,240
He came to Chang'an to do business

425
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,600
and all his money was scammed.

426
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,960
He asked for a place to stay.

427
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,400
I told him to work at the temple
as a night guard

428
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,280
so that I can sneak out

429
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,560
at night to gamble.

430
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,760
Sir,

431
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,000
do you know how much you have lost?

432
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,680
Why persist in gambling?

433
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,320
But now,

434
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,000
I think he looks like this person.

435
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,280
Last month?

436
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,160
Why didn't you say it sooner?

437
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,000
Is your vision so bad
that you only noticed yesterday?

438
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,600
Of course not.

439
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,640
I recognized him long ago

440
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,760
but I also heard about what he did
in Chang'an back then.

441
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,840
He is the man chosen by Xiao Wuyang.

442
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,640
I need to determine
what the right thing to do is.

443
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,880
In the future,

444
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,160
if Xiao Wuyang rises again,

445
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,760
then I shouldn't
offend this person as well.

446
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,160
How unexpected.

447
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,480
You are more shrewd than I expected.

448
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:26,640
Today, he looked all dazed

449
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,320
like he was talking to ghosts.

450
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,480
He has no future left.

451
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,520
It's better to turn him in

452
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,040
and make us both rich.

453
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,360
We'll get 1,000 liang of silver.

454
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,680
You can take the credit.

455
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,600
But I have been unlucky recently.

456
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,080
Your bad luck must've rubbed off on me.

457
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,360
I even owe a lot of debt.

458
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,000
I just need a way back to the Capital.

459
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,760
You can

460
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,360
take all the reward.

461
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:13,560
WARRANT

462
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,199
Hot lamb soup!

463
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,679
Move.

464
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,159
Let's go.

465
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,199
-Yes.
-Give me two.

466
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,840
-Sir, take a seat.
-Fresh from the pot.

467
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,280
Vegetables! Come and take a look!

468
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,239
Fresh lamb meat!

469
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,400
Sir, two bowls of mutton.

470
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,639
Sure.

471
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,120
Sir, enjoy.

472
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,000
RICE BALLS, SWEETS, HOUSE SAUCES

473
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,520
-Come and take a look.
-Mom, I want to drink the soup.

474
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,760
Pick it up, quick.

475
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,239
Come and take a look!

476
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,360
Buns!

477
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,240
-Meat buns!
-They are fresh.

478
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,320
They are delicious!

479
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,600
Miss, come.

480
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,360
-How about two?
-Come out and eat some meat.

481
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,560
You've trailed me all morning.

482
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,400
Nothing can be hidden

483
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,640
from you, Mr. Wang.

484
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,800
Let's talk while we eat.

485
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,160
Then I shall help myself.

486
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,360
In the past,
I was an Imperial Guard on the surface

487
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,960
but I was actually serving the chancellor.

488
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,320
Chancellor Gao?

489
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,920
How are his legs?

490
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,240
Worse than yours by far.

491
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,760
Continue.

492
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,920
Xie Huai'an was stabbed previously.

493
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,240
Chancellor Gao ordered me
to protect Xie Huai'an,

494
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,920
Ye Zheng, and Zhang Mo.

495
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,960
I was with them for a few years.

496
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,120
Other people don't recognize them

497
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,920
but I do.

498
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,000
Who did you find?

499
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,040
The Taoist temple outside the city.

500
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,040
Xie Huai'an.

501
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,040
I speak truth.

502
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,800
If I lie to you,

503
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,760
I don't think it'll be difficult
for you to kill me, Mr. Wang.

504
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,280
However, your former master,
Chancellor Gao,

505
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,680
is very protective of Xie Huai'an.

506
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,880
When the ship sinks, everyone jumps.

507
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,920
In recent times,

508
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,920
one's wealth is more important
than one's reputation.

509
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,120
Being loyal is not as practical

510
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,760
as having some lamb meat to eat.

511
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,440
Sir.

512
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,960
Coming.

513
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,800
That's too much.

514
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,120
Buy a knife with the extra change.

515
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,320
Let's go.

516
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,120
Stop.

517
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,960
Mr. Wang Pu.

518
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,000
What's wrong?

519
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,160
The weather is changing.

520
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,880
XUANDU TEMPLE

521
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,480
THE WAY LIVES ON

522
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,000
Just one person?

523
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,000
Shut up.

524
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,640
Do you know who he is?

525
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,480
Mr. Wang Pu

526
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,400
is the most capable person
under General Fengshan.

527
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,960
Apologies for not recognizing you.

528
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,320
Forgive me.

529
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,560
That's enough. Where is he?

530
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,480
He's in the hall at the back.
He said his name was Zeng.

531
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,200
He has been staying here
for about a month.

532
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,760
Don't follow me.

533
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,600
I'll go inside alone.

534
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,840
AWAKENING AND RETURNING TO PURITY

535
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,840
You're here?

536
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,400
Yes.

537
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,280
I'm cooking dumplings.

538
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,400
I made some for you too.

539
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,280
Sure. I'll dine with you.

540
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,320
I know you want to earn merit

541
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,840
and regain your dignity
in front of Yan Fengshan.

542
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,240
Thus,

543
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,680
I asked Commander Wang to lure you here.

544
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,400
He serves me.

545
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,440
I know that.

546
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,240
He plays his part quite well.

547
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,440
Right.

548
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,160
I can't hide it from you for too long.

549
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,880
You're here.

550
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,240
It has been a while.

551
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,920
I've been waiting for you to summon me.

552
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Another move has to be made

553
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,120
to hit back against Yan Fengshan.

554
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,000
I will never forget
what the chancellor did for me.

555
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,360
As long as I can avenge the chancellor

556
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,280
and kill the Huben Army,

557
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,640
I will do your bidding.

558
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,960
I'm a criminal.

559
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,400
The general had a few men around me

560
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,480
to prevent me from escaping.

561
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,600
But after Commander Wang appeared

562
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,280
and I left the city with him,

563
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,880
they stopped appearing.

564
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,840
That means your men in the city

565
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,120
removed those sentries.

566
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,520
You are indeed the smartest tactician

567
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:25,960
under Yan Fengshan.

568
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,960
The dumplings will be done soon.

569
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,280
Have patience.

570
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,240
Stop flattering me.

571
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,920
I was completely outwitted by you

572
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,560
at Hidden Soldier Alley.

573
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,160
Then you know

574
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,040
full well

575
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,080
I stand as your opponent.

576
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,800
You also know that this is a trap.

577
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,680
Why come here at all?

578
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,240
Why not?

579
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,920
When I found out
you were keeping an eye on me,

580
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,040
I couldn't wait to stand before you

581
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,480
and see what tricks you had prepared.
