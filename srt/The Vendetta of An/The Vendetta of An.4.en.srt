1
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,520
Gates of hell, open!

2
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,480
Thank you so much, priest.

3
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,280
The pits of hell have broken open,
yet the High Heavens show mercy.

4
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,760
The dead have crossed the dark ford

5
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,560
and escaped
the suffering of reincarnation.

6
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,440
I'll take my leave.

7
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,160
Tomorrow is the funeral.

8
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,600
Have my son's comrades and friends
been informed?

9
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,640
Everyone has been notified.

10
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,120
Don't worry, Uncle.

11
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,560
It's such a pity he passed like this.

12
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,800
We should let all his friends
come and send him off.

13
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,960
When a man dies,

14
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,360
how many come to see him off

15
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,000
depends on whether it rains that day,

16
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,080
doesn't it?

17
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,320
WINE SHOP

18
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,320
Show your travel pass.

19
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,480
Here you go, sir.

20
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,600
Stop.

21
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,960
Do you have a travel pass?

22
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,800
I…

23
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,240
I lost it.

24
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,760
So you don't have one.

25
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,160
No pass, no leaving the city.

26
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,040
Right, what's your name?

27
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,240
I'm talking to you.

28
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,360
I…

29
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,960
I'm Zhang Mo.

30
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,360
Where are you from?

31
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,320
Huzhou.

32
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,440
Huzhou Rear Command Office

33
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,600
should be around Little Yamen Street.

34
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,840
Hurry and get a replacement.

35
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,280
Don't delay your trip.
You'll only make your family worry.

36
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,920
-Roasted goose on sale!.
-Okay.

37
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,560
Charms for sale!

38
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,680
Smells wonderful.

39
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,240
‎FUZE INN

40
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,400
-Stop running.
-Here, take this over to the gentleman.

41
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,720
Wait for me.

42
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,120
Watch where you're going.

43
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,840
Where's the dog?

44
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,960
Someone's watching him. He'll be fine.

45
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,560
About Mo…

46
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,840
I've sent a letter to Huzhou.

47
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,040
His wife and children
will be taken care of.

48
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,360
Don't worry.

49
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,320
No.

50
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,240
Just tell them
his business in Chang'an is doing well,

51
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,400
and he needs to stay longer.

52
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,320
He's doing it for the sake of the family.

53
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,600
Are you worried

54
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,320
his family will be upset?

55
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,160
Nothing that happened here

56
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,120
can be leaked.

57
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,760
You just won't admit it.

58
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,880
THE UNDERTAKER

59
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,960
Look at him.

60
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,840
Why is he out dressed like this?

61
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,160
It's broad daylight. What an eyesore.

62
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,160
JINHUA TAVERN

63
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,640
There's something you can't see or touch,

64
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,320
but it exists between us.

65
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,880
Guess what it is?

66
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,680
There's something you can't see or touch,

67
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,800
but it exists between us.

68
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,560
Guess what it is?

69
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,040
-Come on.
-Let's drink.

70
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,040
SPRING ALE

71
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,240
What bad luck.

72
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,760
A pot of liquor, please.

73
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,440
How many times have I told you?

74
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,680
Don't wear funeral robes in here.

75
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,120
You earn me a pot of liquor

76
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,720
and cost me half a day's business.

77
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,120
Don't be so superstitious.

78
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,200
Who hasn't had a funeral in the family?

79
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,800
Right here,

80
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,080
from Caomen Street to Pingkang Ward.

81
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,080
I've sent off

82
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,200
many people who lived there.

83
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,920
What's wrong with this fellow?

84
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,480
Who knows,

85
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,640
I might be working for you tomorrow.

86
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,560
Bah.

87
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,560
-Touch wood.
-What nonsense are you spouting?

88
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,360
-Don't go.
-What bad luck!

89
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,600
Let's drink somewhere else.

90
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,040
You serve him then.

91
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,440
There's something you can't see or touch,

92
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,280
but it exists between us.

93
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,120
Guess what it is?

94
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,680
Hatred. Finish the liquor and get out.

95
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,000
Don't, Jinhua.

96
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,520
I come here every day.

97
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,040
Can't you show me a kinder face?

98
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,960
Just smile at me once.

99
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,920
Hua!

100
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,800
There's something you can't see or touch,

101
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,480
but it exists between us.

102
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,800
Guess what it is?

103
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,000
Karmic debt, I suppose.

104
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,280
It is.

105
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,280
Before we return to the Capital,

106
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,960
the blades and men you asked for

107
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,240
are ready.

108
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,240
We await your command.

109
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,200
Liu Ziyan has appeared.

110
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,560
Finally showed himself.

111
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,880
Is he alive or dead?

112
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,920
Dead.

113
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,360
We don't take the living.

114
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,840
You're cruel.

115
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,680
He was your uncle.

116
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,720
A diviner read my fortune.

117
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,120
He said

118
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,600
that after I turned 12,

119
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,640
I'd cut ties with all my kin.

120
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,560
That's easy then.

121
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,840
There's no one I can't send off.

122
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,760
He's Huben's top killer.

123
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,000
Don't get careless.

124
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,240
Huben's top fool.

125
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,040
Say something light. And smile for once.

126
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,040
Don't always keep your face so tense.

127
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,400
You look more like an undertaker

128
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,560
than I do.

129
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,560
Tonight,

130
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,040
do a ritual for me.

131
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,760
You know where to find me.

132
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,080
Is this part of the plan?

133
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,400
No, it's not.

134
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,760
INCENSES AND CANDLES

135
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,680
Lots of deaths this month.
Business is good.

136
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,720
Look. We made quite a lot.

137
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,080
Put these gold ingots

138
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,440
outside each of our buddies' doors.

139
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,760
It was a promise I made to them.

140
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,280
I believe they haven't forgotten.

141
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,840
Also,

142
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,240
divide the earnings
from these past few years

143
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,880
among their families.

144
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,960
Sir.

145
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,120
It's nothing.

146
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,360
We make our living off the dead.

147
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,680
So every once in a while,

148
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,800
we have to spend it all.

149
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,160
Otherwise,

150
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,920
bad luck will come for us.

151
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,640
Get it done tonight.

152
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,920
Don't forget.

153
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,800
THE UNDERTAKER

154
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,280
PU NICHUAN

155
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,400
General Fengshan said

156
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,280
you were once taken captive.

157
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,640
He asked me to leave you here in Tiemo.

158
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,960
It's a troubled time.

159
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,600
Everyone is displaced and suffering.

160
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,480
You go first.

161
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,680
Wait for me down there.

162
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,320
Huben's top fool.

163
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,920
When it comes to gathering intel
and tracking people down,

164
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:48,720
I suppose my men are better than yours,

165
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,480
who only know how to swing their swords.

166
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,520
If I were you,

167
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,680
with a voice that hoarse,

168
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,560
I'd talk less nonsense.

169
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,040
My men say

170
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,960
there's a physician in Tangshui Alley

171
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,800
who fled with his whole family
a few days ago.

172
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,320
Word has it he treated a great swordsman.

173
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,120
Someone with decent skills

174
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,560
managed to abduct the deposed emperor
at a critical moment.

175
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,960
Apparently, someone orchestrated it.

176
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,800
Have you found the person behind it?

177
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,760
The mastermind
is clever and deeply hidden.

178
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,600
I'm ashamed to say

179
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,680
I haven't found them yet.

180
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,520
Ziyan,

181
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,760
I came all the way to bring you this news,

182
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,000
yet you won't even offer me a cup of tea.

183
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,319
But there's one thing
you might find interesting.

184
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:11,720
Go on.

185
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,920
Your old residence hasn't been sold yet.

186
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,599
The deed

187
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,440
is in the hands of a merchant
named Yang Chuhao.

188
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,440
He claims to be a merchant,

189
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,360
but in truth,
he secretly handles asset sales

190
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,560
for the royals.

191
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,240
Too many people died in that house.

192
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,880
It's been abandoned for years.

193
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,560
If you don't mind,

194
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,640
you can move back in.

195
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,680
Has this blade killed before?

196
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,400
Sir,

197
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,000
you must have been
a great help to this household.

198
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,280
On your 10th birthday,

199
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,400
I prepared a pair of shoes,

200
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,160
wishing you a smooth road ahead.

201
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,280
MEMORIAL TABLET OF LATE BROTHER, ZHANG MO

202
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,760
You're not a sentimental person.

203
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,840
A pageboy dies,

204
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,560
and you'd hold a ritual for him?

205
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,000
On this path,

206
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,960
I've had no pity
for the many who lost their lives.

207
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,360
But Mo was innocent.

208
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,520
One innocent death is one too many.

209
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,360
Sounds like

210
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,680
I'm not innocent.

211
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,600
You're not.

212
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,680
But you may not die.

213
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,320
Maybe just get badly injured.

214
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,600
Anyway, don't worry.

215
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,640
I have good physicians.

216
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,840
Then I should thank you. How considerate.

217
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,200
Do you have time?

218
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,160
Yes.

219
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,960
Let's find somewhere nice
and have a drink.

220
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,960
Madam, a pot of liquor, please.

221
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,760
Alright.

222
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,200
I haven't seen you in a while.

223
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,240
-Tonight we drink our fill.
-We will indeed.

224
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,360
With your stomach for wine?

225
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,920
-Enjoy your drink.
-Come on.

226
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,960
Enjoy.

227
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,200
Fill it up.

228
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,560
Speaking of which,

229
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,160
what do you care about most in this life?

230
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,480
Getting justice for the dead.

231
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,200
That's it?

232
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,640
Besides that,

233
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,840
is there anything else

234
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,840
that matters to you?

235
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,720
I will kill my enemy

236
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,960
with my own hands.

237
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,360
Isn't that still revenge?

238
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,760
Is that all you ever think about?

239
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,480
You see,

240
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,040
life can be beautiful.

241
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,760
A lantern swaying in the wind.

242
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,560
A carriage passing by.

243
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,120
The scent of liquor drifting over.

244
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,880
And the tavern owner, right?

245
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,920
She's nice,

246
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,200
but not to you.

247
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,640
Maybe she just doesn't understand you.

248
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,560
You seem to know quite a lot.

249
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,600
Isn't your head full of revenge?

250
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,560
I don't understand,

251
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,120
but I have my own attachments too.

252
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,080
Thanks.

253
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,560
Attachments.

254
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,840
Attachments.

255
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,440
Nothing weighs heavier.

256
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,400
You can't cut them off.

257
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,680
That's why
I come here every day for liquor.

258
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,600
But I haven't once seen her smile.

259
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,920
Wait here.

260
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,080
Madam, a plate of meat, please.

261
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,360
Coming.

262
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,640
Here you go.

263
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,880
Madam.

264
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,960
What did you say to her?
What did you say to her?

265
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,440
She smiled at me, you know?

266
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,240
Tell me.

267
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,000
Once tonight's task is done,

268
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,240
I'll tell you.

269
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,280
Tell me now.

270
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,440
ALL-GOODS SHOP

271
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,040
Tonight, you'll attack Liu Ziyan's men

272
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,600
and leave clues

273
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,640
to make them follow you.

274
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:40,960
Sir.

275
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,880
This isn't human blood.

276
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,240
He wants us to find him.

277
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,560
Go inform Mr. Liu.

278
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,480
Sir, we've tracked him.

279
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,880
You didn't track him.

280
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,880
They've been ready for us.

281
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:44,960
Let's go.

282
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,960
I'd like to see for myself

283
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,360
whether he's a man or a ghost.

284
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,160
An old acquaintance of mine will meet you.

285
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,800
Tonight's plan

286
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,080
is to bring them together

287
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,480
and settle the old debt.

288
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,800
CLOTH, SWEETS

289
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,480
They are also Huben guards!

290
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,240
Where's the dog?

291
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,080
From his position,

292
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,480
he sees more clearly than we do.

293
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,560
Get up.

294
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,800
I'm taking you somewhere.

295
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,080
Ye Zheng.

296
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,920
I… I'll go back with you.

297
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,680
Quick to reincarnate, are you?

298
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,480
Chuan.

299
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,920
I did not merely survive.

300
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,520
I've come to take your life.

301
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,400
Huben's top fool, Liu Ziyan.

302
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,920
You finally got what's coming to you.

303
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,600
I crawled back from hell

304
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,400
for this moment.

305
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,920
You already escaped.

306
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,920
Why come back to this troubled world

307
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,960
and throw yourself into this mess again?

308
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:21,480
So it was you, you rascal.

309
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,000
See?

310
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,360
This is what happens
when you go against me.

311
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,560
From now on,

312
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,040
I'm willing to

313
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,400
be a slave, a dog.

314
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,600
You didn't drink the liquor I gave you.

315
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,760
After all,

316
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,760
you were involved in my father's murder.

317
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,000
Yet you saved my life.

318
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,240
I can't repay you

319
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,800
in this lifetime.

320
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,640
I'll repay that in the next.

321
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,800
We're even.

322
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,680
But the promise I made to you,

323
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,640
I never fulfilled.

324
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,480
All my life,

325
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,480
I've been caught in hatred.

326
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,760
And now that I'm old…

327
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,240
Don't repeat my mistakes.

328
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,080
There really are

329
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,800
many beautiful things

330
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,000
in this world.

331
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,040
Lanterns swaying in the wind,

332
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,880
carriages passing by,

333
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,240
and the scent of liquor

334
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,840
from a small tavern.

335
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,560
Enough talking.

336
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,840
You haven't told me

337
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,760
what you said

338
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,800
to the tavern owner.

339
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:00,120
She actually smiled at me.

340
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,920
Tell me.

341
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,320
I told her

342
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,120
there's something

343
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,760
you can't see or touch,

344
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,840
but it exists between you and her.

345
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,160
It's fate.

346
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,320
Her smile

347
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,440
was so beautiful.

348
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,240
Her smile

349
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,480
was

350
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,680
so beautiful.
