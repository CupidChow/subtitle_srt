00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,360
WUYIN CHONG, SECRET ENVOY OF TIEMO

2
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,320
This must be Chen Valley.

3
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,120
Yes.

4
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,479
Do you know Chen Valley has another name?

5
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,960
Mingshanzi Gorge.

6
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,880
It is what we, the Tiemo people, call it.

7
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,520
That's right.

8
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,040
This piece of land,

9
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,440
170 <i>li</i> south of Mingshanzi,

10
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,120
used to be ours.

11
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,680
If Yan Fengshan is willing
to give us this piece of land,

12
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,960
I'm willing to muster my troops

13
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,440
and crush the Baiwenhu Army.

14
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,680
When the time comes,

15
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,200
I hope you can grant me a small residence.

16
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,680
My ancestors were from Chang'an.

17
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,800
They lived in a small village just ahead.

18
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,160
Later, they moved north to this place

19
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,000
and lived here for 70 years.

20
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,840
The hill behind the village

21
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,840
is where my wife's grave lies.

22
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,920
Do you ask only for a small residence?

23
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,960
Nothing else?

24
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,320
It's best on a hill that faces the sun.

25
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,360
Why?

26
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,560
A hill that faces the sun

27
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,280
is full of white camellias.

28
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,480
It was also

29
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,520
my wife's favorite flower.

30
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,520
Genghui, you are a man with many stories.

31
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,040
If you hadn't accompanied me on this trip,

32
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,240
I'd have been bored.

33
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,200
To accommodate your request,

34
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,600
the person welcoming you

35
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,040
has arranged a musician for you.

36
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,800
Having music to accompany you

37
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,000
is better than having me,

38
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,240
a middle-aged man, with sad stories.

39
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,680
Stop!

40
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,560
Mr. Wuyin,

41
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,760
why are we stopping here?

42
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,960
Twenty-five years ago,

43
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,920
a man wielding a knife
walked out of this granary.

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,480
He was a prisoner of war of Tiemo

45
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,800
but he is now ruling Chang'an.

46
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,720
There are ups and downs in life.

47
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,280
It's really unpredictable.

48
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,720
It's almost a historical site
by this point.

49
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,840
Since we're passing by,

50
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,160
let's just take a look.

51
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,520
Legend has it

52
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,760
that General Fengshan can strike fear
into both gods and ghosts.

53
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,720
I want to meet

54
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,320
a man like him too.

55
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,960
Greetings, Mr. Wuyin.

56
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,920
Since you are here,

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,200
I will bring the musician here as well.

58
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,720
This way, please.

59
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,600
GU

60
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,880
Mr. Wuyin, your reception
and trip to Chang'an

61
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,400
are all attended by my master,

62
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,160
Yang Chuhao.

63
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,880
He knows you like guqin music,

64
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,560
so my master went through 700 musicians

65
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,200
and finally sent her here.

66
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,680
She is but a bondservant.

67
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,920
I hear Yang Chuhao is rich.

68
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,960
His wealth could rival half of Chang'an.

69
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,800
Is someone like him

70
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,160
part of the Huben Army too?

71
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,560
Yes. The Huben Army is everywhere.

72
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,960
That is why we can
gain control of Chang'an.

73
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,880
Your guqin skills are the best
among 700 people.

74
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,320
Play a song for me, then.

75
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,720
Yes.

76
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,480
Why did you play this song?

77
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,560
It's full of killing intent.

78
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,280
There's blood on the walls.

79
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,160
It's obvious that many people died here.

80
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,520
If you want me
to play a decadent song for you,

81
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,520
I can't do it.

82
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,520
Since you've met me today,

83
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,200
you will no longer be a slave.

84
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,240
To make a girl
of such guqin skill a slave,

85
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,640
Yang Chuhao does know
how to appreciate talents.

86
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,080
That's…

87
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,440
Come with me.

88
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,720
Once we're in Chang'an,
I'll help you teach him a lesson.

89
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,320
Thank you, sir.

90
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,200
Thank you.

91
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,320
Thank you, Eunuch.

92
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,320
You are the only one

93
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,080
who will send food to me.

94
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,880
I only stole two buns.

95
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,880
Next time,

96
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,800
I shall bring you Golden Milk Pastry.

97
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,200
Yan Fengshan doesn't live in the palace

98
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,040
and the young emperor doesn't eat much.

99
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,080
The cooks in the imperial kitchen
have nothing to do.

100
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,840
They cook their own food

101
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,400
and have many delicacies.

102
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,720
It's all right.

103
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,880
Buns are filling.

104
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,040
It'll be Chou hour soon.

105
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,760
I have to collect the memorials

106
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,680
and send them to Emperor Yan.

107
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,040
Yan Fengshan is truly…

108
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,680
a formidable commander.

109
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,520
When you deliver memorials
to him every day,

110
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,720
Chancellor, you still
get to leave the palace.

111
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,240
Unlike us, the eunuchs,

112
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,520
we are trapped in these palace walls

113
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,600
and grow old inside the palace.

114
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,800
I'M STILL ALIVE.

115
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,200
I'M STILL ALIVE.

116
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,320
Tofu!

117
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,480
Tofu!

118
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,880
Miss, come buy a piece of tofu.

119
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,600
WONTON SHOP

120
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,200
Sha! Get me a bowl of wontons

121
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,200
and another sugary pastry.

122
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,640
You have a good appetite today, Boss.

123
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,600
Good appetite? Nonsense.

124
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,680
YANG CHUHAO

125
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,920
I'm troubled.

126
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,400
No matter what, I still have to eat

127
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,880
so that I have the energy
to continue sulking.

128
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,720
You…

129
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,120
White Hair.

130
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,920
Mr. Yang.

131
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,560
We've not seen each other for 15 years

132
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,240
yet you still recognize me.

133
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,880
I will never forget

134
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,960
that gaze of yours.

135
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,600
Sha.

136
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,000
Did you kill him?

137
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,360
Even as a white-haired ghost,

138
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,440
I'm not here just to kill.

139
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,920
Come.

140
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,760
People may see us.

141
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,520
Let's talk inside.

142
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,480
Boss, what's wrong?

143
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,040
Sha,

144
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,120
go out.

145
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,440
You won't be doing any business today.

146
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,520
- I'm still cooking…
- Hurry.

147
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,640
All right. It's your business anyway.

148
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,359
I've completed what was mentioned

149
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,640
in your letter previously.

150
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,040
That girl

151
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:28,119
has blended with the Tiemo envoys.

152
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,320
I thought I had already paid
all my debts to your family.

153
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,880
I didn't expect

154
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,160
you to come here

155
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,280
and collect the debt in person.

156
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,720
After my family was annihilated,

157
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,760
Yan Fengshan tried to wipe out
the remnants of my family.

158
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,320
At least 3,000 people

159
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,840
died in Chang'an.

160
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,280
Countless families were broken apart.

161
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,400
Mr. Yang,

162
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,880
you survived

163
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,880
and have done exceptionally well.

164
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,640
You even became Yan Fengshan's moneybag.

165
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,320
As an esteemed guest of General Fengshan,

166
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,760
do you think you've cleared your debt

167
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,000
compared to those who died?

168
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,440
I still need to live

169
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,720
and I still need to do business.

170
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:55,200
Do you want me to live my whole life

171
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,840
indebted to your family?

172
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,920
It's not a debt.

173
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,920
There are too many secrets

174
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,800
in the 30 letters
you and my father sent each other

175
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,640
for ten years.

176
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,120
Hidden Soldier Alley, Cangshui River,

177
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,160
and the blueprints you and my father
designed for the imperial dynasty.

178
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,960
Even Yan Fengshan
might not know about that.

179
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,360
TO LIU ZIWEN

180
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,320
This is evidence

181
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,200
of you being a part
of my family's faction.

182
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,280
Mr. Yang,

183
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,600
this is just one of the letters.

184
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,000
You…

185
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,040
Yes.

186
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,080
I am a close friend of your father's.

187
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,600
That's true.

188
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,680
But I've done a lot for the Huben Army too

189
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,760
by running a business for them.

190
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,880
All my money is earned with hard work.

191
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,120
If I want you to go down with me

192
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,320
and tell Yan Fengshan the truth,

193
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,080
who do you think will die first

194
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,000
between the two of us?

195
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,600
Try it.

196
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,040
They've pursued me for more than a decade.

197
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,440
I was stabbed and beaten.

198
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,400
Even my last family member is dead.

199
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,800
Do you think I'd be afraid?

200
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,280
Yang Chuhao, you have a family
and a huge business.

201
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,240
Can you afford to lose?

202
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,480
Do you dare to lose?

203
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,960
Speak.

204
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,480
Tell me.

205
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,200
What else do you want me to do?

206
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,160
The Tiemo envoys
will enter the Capital in secret.

207
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,680
Three days later,

208
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,720
they will enter Jinguang Gate at night

209
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,000
and meet Yan Fengshan
at the courtyard of Yankang Ward.

210
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,480
Purchase Huaiyuan Ward

211
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,280
and the street
right next to Chonghua Ward.

212
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,680
I have something to do over there.

213
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,560
Remember.

214
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,520
The most important thing is
that no one can be around there.

215
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,720
When I'm done, what's next?

216
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,840
You'll give me
something else to do, right?

217
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,640
I serve Yan Fengshan.

218
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,520
Each favor

219
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,200
I grant you may cost me my life.

220
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,960
Will it ever end?

221
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,400
Sha has run this eatery for 20 years.

222
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,040
On the surface,

223
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,720
it's just a place to eat wontons.

224
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,400
In truth,

225
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,840
this was where my father
used to meet you in secret.

226
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,960
Sha was also a part
of my family's faction.

227
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,360
Mr. Yang,

228
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,600
you have always protected him.

229
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,960
I see you are still someone
who cherishes old ties.

230
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,840
I don't want those

231
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,960
who cherish old ties to die.

232
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,040
I'll count on you

233
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,040
for what comes next, Mr. Yang.

234
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,640
Thank you, sir.

235
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,160
- Take care.
- Sure.

236
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,280
Mr. Zhou!

237
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,480
NOODLE BOWLS

238
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,760
Su, give my warm regards to your boss.

239
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,240
You've worked hard, Mr. Zhou.
The boss is doing well.

240
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,120
He asked you to take care.

241
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,680
You can only make money for him
when you are healthy.

242
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,960
Help me thank him.

243
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,560
Mr. Qi.

244
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,440
- See you again next month.
- Sure.

245
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,680
It's all thanks to you.

246
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,200
Mr. Song! I'm here again!

247
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,480
- I've prepared everything for you.
- Sure.

248
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,840
- No problem.
- All right.

249
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,760
I'm leaving.

250
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,520
- Here you go.
- Have you been waiting for me?

251
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,400
- I hope you're not paying less this month.
- Not at all.

252
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,960
See you next month.

253
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,480
- Thank you, sir.
- Take care.

254
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,320
TAIYIJI CLINIC

255
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,640
The sound of the abacus is nice.

256
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,560
It's comfortable listening to it.

257
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,840
It makes me sleepy.

258
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,840
Is that so?

259
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,240
How is it different from the usual kind?

260
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,920
There's a huge difference.

261
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,240
Normally, we need
to make the calculations.

262
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,080
I get headaches whenever I calculate.

263
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,680
You are right.

264
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,800
What are you doing?

265
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,880
You're back. I'm checking the ledger.

266
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,840
It's a bit of a mess,

267
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,040
so I'm sorting the accounts.

268
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:08,960
I'll be done soon.

269
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,240
Then, have you checked the inventory?

270
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,640
Have you swept the floor?

271
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,320
I checked the inventory

272
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,480
and I swept the shop.

273
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,040
I'm used to doing all this.

274
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,920
I even cleaned the corners. Don't worry.

275
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,520
Mr. Su, you are so nice.

276
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,320
You are so enthusiastic.

277
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,600
That's right.

278
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,440
I remember you are our creditor.

279
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,120
You two are letting our creditor
check stock and books.

280
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,120
Are you two out of your minds?

281
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,000
Why are you spacing out? Get him out!

282
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,320
Hurry up!

283
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,680
- Let's go.
- I'm not done with the accounts.

284
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,640
Go out quickly.

285
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,360
Miss Shen!

286
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,960
Listen to me!

287
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,600
You are really interesting.

288
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,360
People collect debts
by splashing red paint or releasing mice,

289
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,280
yet you come and work
at my shop every day.

290
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,120
You won't come and see me
even when I'm here,

291
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,480
and I have nothing to do there.

292
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,960
Forget about all that.

293
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,360
You were really daring today
and even touched my ledger.

294
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,600
What are you planning to do?

295
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,600
I was only trying to help you.

296
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,720
Last time, you said the ledger was a mess.

297
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,400
That was an excuse I used to not pay you.

298
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,560
Stop coming here to annoy me.

299
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,120
I'll pay you when I have the money.

300
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,440
If you clear your debt,

301
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,600
can I still come here?

302
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,880
BLESSINGS ABOUND

303
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,680
MISFORTUNE FADES

304
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,680
There's something

305
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,960
in your eyes.

306
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,200
Do you fancy something valuable
in my shop?

307
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,440
I…

308
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,280
Listen.

309
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,160
You will meet no good end

310
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,400
meddling with folk like me.

311
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,960
You should leave at once.

312
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,200
Farewell.

313
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,680
I…

314
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:01,280
TAIYIJI CLINIC

315
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,560
Miss Shen.

316
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,160
You're still here?

317
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,760
Huai'an.

318
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,880
Are you all right?

319
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,800
I'm fine.

320
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,400
Everyone is still alive.

321
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,880
Even the pageboy survived.

322
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,560
That's great.

323
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,880
That's great.

324
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,200
Boss!

325
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,040
I'm back!

326
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,680
These are the ledgers for this month.

327
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,040
- Good.
- I've collected them all.

328
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,600
Here you go.

329
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,600
The account for the silk shop is wrong.

330
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,600
Look.

331
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,640
Last month's remaining stock was 70 bolts.

332
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,440
This month, 130 bolts were brought in.

333
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,440
One hundred ten bolts were sold.
Twenty bolts are remaining.

334
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,720
The cumulative balance is 90 bolts.

335
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,680
However,

336
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,480
the number of bolts
doesn't match your money.

337
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,920
The account is right.

338
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,280
Boss,

339
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,400
you were trying to fool me.

340
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,560
If I didn't do that,

341
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,840
how would I know
if you were paying attention?

342
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,720
I'm devoted

343
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,080
to serving you.

344
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,160
You are lying.

345
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,600
I've been observing you
for quite some time.

346
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,640
Something in your eyes
tells me there's a problem.

347
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,880
Is it because of money?

348
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,960
No.

349
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,600
You pay me well.

350
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,440
Then, it must be because of a woman.

351
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,720
Which woman is it?

352
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,200
She runs the clinic on Xiaocaomen Street.

353
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,680
Xiaocao…

354
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:14,960
All right.

355
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,880
Take me there to take a look.

356
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,040
Let me see if she suits you.

357
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:18,960
Please don't do that.

358
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,080
- You'll be chased out.
- What?

359
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,800
She would chase even me out?

360
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,480
Half of the shops
on Xiaocaomen Street belong to me.

361
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,160
She doesn't care who you are.

362
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,280
She will chase anyone
she dislikes out of her shop.

363
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,400
A fiery lady.

364
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,080
All right. Starting next month,

365
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,440
I will increase your salary.

366
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,960
Let's save up a larger amount
for the betrothal gift.

367
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,880
What do you think?

368
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,240
We aren't that close yet.

369
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,920
I can also tell that something

370
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:17,880
is troubling you, Boss.

371
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,080
Is it related to money?

372
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,760
Do you think I have a problem
if it's related to money?

373
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,040
Then, it must be a woman.

374
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,040
Not a woman,

375
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,680
but a man.

376
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,160
A man?

377
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Boss.

378
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,040
Don't do this.

379
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,320
Nonsense! What were you thinking?

380
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,920
He's the son of a former friend.

381
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,240
He's here to collect a debt.

382
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,800
That's not a problem.

383
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,600
We have a lot of money in the treasury.

384
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,000
He's here to collect a debt of life.

385
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,679
Speaking of which,

386
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,040
that man just now looked honest.

387
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,600
We've not met for a few months

388
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:26,719
and you're acting like a matchmaker now?

389
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,159
If you have no feelings for him,

390
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:32,159
why did you keep testing him?

391
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,800
I don't know what you mean.

392
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,360
With your wealth,

393
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,440
you can even purchase
half of the street's shops.

394
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,920
Why borrow money from him then?

395
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,639
I think you are
purposely testing his patience.

396
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,560
Don't expose me.

397
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,920
How can I still show myself in the future?

398
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,400
Huai'an, what are your plans
after coming back?

399
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,840
Yan Fengshan is meeting the Tiemo people.

400
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,800
This is our best chance to strike back.

401
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,960
I saw this

402
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,480
at Hidden Soldier Alley.

403
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,120
It wasn't too long ago

404
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,360
when I entered Hidden Soldier Alley.

405
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,240
When one endures hardship,

406
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,760
life

407
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,240
becomes muddled.

408
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,240
Bai Wan wouldn't want
to see you like this.

409
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,920
Once you settle things in Chang'an,

410
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,920
go to a new place

411
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,320
and start all over again.

412
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,240
Have you found the people
I asked you to find?

413
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,640
I did. Apparently, they moved south.

414
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,800
However, there are many towns
south of Nanwei Trough.

415
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,000
I've sent men to look for them.

416
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,840
We'll know immediately
if there's any news.

417
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,920
All right.

418
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,280
They lost their daughter.

419
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,520
No matter what,

420
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,320
I must give them an explanation.

421
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,880
GLOWING MIST

422
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,160
Yang!

423
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,560
General, why are you here?

424
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,560
I bought two seabass at the market.

425
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,560
They are fresh.

426
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,960
Zhiying is busy today and can't cook

427
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,040
so I decided to come here
to make grilled fish.

428
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,600
Seabass is fatty this season.

429
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,720
Why not steam them?

430
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,600
You have high standards.

431
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,120
Let me taste it for you.

432
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:47,040
No wonder they say
you should steam seabass in spring.

433
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,080
It's a delicacy indeed.

434
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,440
Those who eat the back of the fish first

435
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,680
are poor people.

436
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,600
Were you poor when you were young?

437
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,000
To be honest,

438
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,920
I was born poor indeed.

439
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,920
Well, how else could I claim
that I started from scratch?

440
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,640
Here. Have this.

441
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,480
General, you take good care of me.

442
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,840
Speaking of which,

443
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,520
do you still remember White Hair?

444
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,840
Are you talking about the son
of the Liu family?

445
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,640
I've not heard this name in many years.

446
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,800
Right now, besides Xiao Wuyang

447
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,200
and the person from Yulong Ridge,

448
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,040
the only one who is worthy
to become my opponent

449
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,040
is White Hair.

450
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,160
General, you rate him so highly.

451
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,560
Is he causing you trouble?

452
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,240
In strategy, I may not match him.

453
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,560
I heard you had former ties
with the Liu family

454
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,560
so I didn't tell you

455
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,520
about some of his doings.

456
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,240
However, I need to give you a reminder.

457
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,200
We will be meeting the Tiemo people soon.

458
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,800
It is crucial and nothing can go wrong.

459
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,360
I think White Hair might appear.

460
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,360
I'm worried that he might pay you a visit.

461
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,920
I… General, this isn't necessary.

462
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,320
He is a vengeful person.

463
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,880
I think you won't be able
to escape from him.

464
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,960
Besides, you don't have
many guards in this residence.

465
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,240
The only person I know
is the kid who collects debts for you.

466
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,920
I don't think he's any help.

467
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,600
Take this.

468
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,080
If he comes to you,
you can use it to defend yourself.

469
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,440
I…

470
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,960
Thank you, General.

471
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,360
Then, I'll keep it for now.

472
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,040
However, I really don't think
it's necessary.

473
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,040
People our age

474
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,560
don't have many friends left.

475
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,840
I hope you can stay safe.

476
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,560
After hearing what you say,

477
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,200
I'll make sure to survive.

478
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,480
I still want

479
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,200
to eat fish and drink wine with you

480
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,840
after 20 years.

481
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,560
All right.

482
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,320
- Come on.
- Cheers.

483
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,320
ALL-GOODS SHOP

484
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,360
Sir. What do you want? Browse on your own.

485
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,960
Sure.

486
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,080
Sir,

487
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,360
there's a plant used for chewing

488
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,160
called Bitter-After.

489
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,040
I've searched many shops
but I couldn't find it.

490
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,520
I wonder if you have it here.

491
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,160
You're in luck today, sir. I have it here.

492
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,040
Sir, please take a look.

493
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,320
- This is it.
- There's no mistake about it.

494
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,480
Few in Chang'an bought it before.

495
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,200
It was too bitter.

496
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,800
Many people have been buying it recently.

497
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,360
You know your stuff.

498
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,360
Buy all of them
and I'll only charge two <i>liang</i> of silver.

499
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,480
I might not be a regular customer

500
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,200
but isn't this too expensive, sir?

501
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,840
Besides,

502
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,440
this can be found everywhere in Tiemo.

503
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,480
It should be cheaper
than the hay used to feed horses.

504
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,400
Sir, it's like this.

505
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,080
Bitter-After was dirt cheap at first,

506
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,440
but these are troubled times.

507
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:17,760
There might be a war with Tiemo tomorrow.

508
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,880
There's an unstable supply
so it is scarce.

509
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,480
Naturally, the price
has increased as well.

510
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,320
All right. Give me a bundle of it.

511
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,240
Got it.

512
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,960
Is this meant for family or friends?

513
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,600
No.

514
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,760
It is for an old acquaintance
I have been separated from for many years.
