00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,820
[Episode 25]

3
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,540
You're finally here.

4
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:36,630
Yes, Master.

5
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,500
I came to see you.

6
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,610
Where is Xie Huai'an?

7
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:14,690
We survived.

8
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,610
Huai'an is alive too.

9
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,150
He told us

10
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,380
you would appear here.

11
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,050
So we came.

12
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,770
Master is from Tiemo.

13
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,090
He wanted to kill Xiaoqing and me.

14
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,020
Go on.

15
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:43,930
Life or death,

16
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,610
end it cleanly.

17
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,530
Master.

18
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,610
Put away your weapon.

19
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,960
You raised us

20
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,180
for more than ten hard years.

21
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,420
Will you not even spare

22
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,940
a moment to look at us,

23
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,650
and hear a few words?

24
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,290
Thrust.

25
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:18,460
Block.

26
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:22,720
Like this?

27
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,440
Food's ready.

28
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,490
Come taste Chef Ye's cooking today.

29
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,040
If it's bad, it's free.

30
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,050
Hurry, come here.

31
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,730
Stop practicing.

32
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,320
I'm starving.

33
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,310
Your cooking is really good.

34
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,050
Master,

35
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:34,810
let us drink well tonight.

36
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:35,430
Good.

37
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,460
Xiaoqing.

38
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,020
Mind your manners.

39
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,490
Master hasn't taken the first bite.

40
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:45,980
Thank you, Master.

41
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:46,580
Master.

42
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,220
You spoil her.

43
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,540
Aren't you afraid no one will marry her?

44
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,050
Here.

45
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,700
Thank you, Master.

46
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,660
Here, Zheng.

47
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,350
Eat more.

48
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,700
Xiaoqing.

49
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,980
Let's toast Master together.

50
00:04:59,230 --> 00:04:59,580
All right.

51
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,290
We wish Master good health.

52
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,290
Good.

53
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,100
Master, a toast to you.

54
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:04,700
Good.

55
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,100
Things have come to this.

56
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,410
What more is there to say?

57
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,250
People of Chang'an.

58
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,900
People of Tiemo.

59
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,600
Is the difference so great?

60
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,700
Many years ago,

61
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,540
I once had a son and a daughter.

62
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,410
The winter in Tiemo was too harsh.

63
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,490
They did not survive.

64
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,100
Later,

65
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,980
war broke out again.

66
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,050
I fled in panic.

67
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,490
After that,

68
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,980
I received orders

69
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,900
to enter Chang'an

70
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,140
as a shadow guard.

71
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,610
I then served under General Liu Ziwen.

72
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,380
A few years passed.

73
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,170
In Basong Town,

74
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,580
I found you and Xiaoqing.

75
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,410
I raised you to adulthood.

76
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,980
Taught you martial arts and medicine.

77
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,220
I once believed

78
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,420
that I had another pair of children.

79
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:00,780
But...

80
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,720
But I cannot forget.

81
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,690
I cannot forget what I just said.

82
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,890
War came again.

83
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,540
I fled in haste.

84
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,060
During that evacuation,

85
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,610
I never had the chance

86
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,990
to bury my children.

87
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,700
If my homeland were still there,

88
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,610
if the house had not collapsed,

89
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,370
my son and daughter's remains

90
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,340
must still be there.

91
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,980
With such memories in my heart,

92
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,140
how could I care

93
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,860
about our past?

94
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:27,530
Master,

95
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,810
thank you for raising me.

96
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,030
We understand now.

97
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,330
We have no right to resent you.

98
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,220
None of us has the right to hate another.

99
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,610
If hatred must exist,

100
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,650
let it be toward the merciless heavens.

101
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,530
Children,

102
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,490
rise.

103
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,980
If you intend to stop me from killing Xie Huai'an,

104
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,340
then you must

105
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,610
take my blade.

106
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,770
Master.

107
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,250
Master!

108
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,460
You were the ones who brought the rice.

109
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,100
Right after I arrived at Cangshui River,

110
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,220
I saw Master slip out at night,

111
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,320
so I followed.

112
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,370
Only then did I learn

113
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,220
Master kept two memorial tablets inside a cave.

114
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,770
I did not know whose spirits you honored,

115
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,820
but we thought

116
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,460
they must be dear to you.

117
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,500
So Xiaoqing and I

118
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,980
would go there to pay respects from time to time.

119
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,450
Now we understand.

120
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,650
They were Master's children.

121
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,450
But Master,

122
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,050
we are your children too.

123
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,290
Master,

124
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,340
we are your children as well.

125
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,220
Master.

126
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,330
Master.

127
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,630
People of Chang'an.

128
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,290
People of Tiemo.

129
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,980
Is the difference truly so great?

130
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,250
But Master,

131
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,860
we are your children too.

132
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,060
Master.

133
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:19,020
We are your children too.

134
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,300
When Chang'an falls,

135
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,080
even in winter,

136
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,300
no Tiemo people will go hungry again.

137
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:14,180
If only you were born in such a time,

138
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,210
how wonderful it would be.

139
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,970
What should I do?

140
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,150
Children...

141
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,060
What should I do?

142
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,780
Your identity has been exposed.

143
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,240
As for your two disciples,

144
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,710
how do you plan to deal with them?

145
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,610
Your Majesty must know

146
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,210
why I followed you back then.

147
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,810
Of course I know.

148
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,730
Because your children

149
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,060
died in the winter of Tiemo.

150
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,530
Tiemo's winters are bitter cold.

151
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,540
So many children

152
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,220
never survive the harsh season.

153
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,690
I believe you will not betray us,

154
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,380
because your children

155
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,340
watch over you

156
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,090

Mr. Long.

176
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,370
My father once told me

177
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,740
that in a village at the foot of Wuxi Mountain,

178
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,980
before a house,

179
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,460
there stood a stone hut of pale ash wood.

180
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,570
There should be

181
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,850
two children's remains buried there.

182
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,650
Seven years ago,

183
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,740
I went to Wuxi Mountain

184
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,740
and saved Pu Nichuan.

185
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,980
I also visited that stone hut.

186
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,090
Rest easy.

187
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,300
Your children

188
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,980
have been laid to rest.

189
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,320
In every letter, you wrote about how you

190
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,060
endured hardship

191
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,610
and wandered from place to place.

192
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,540
Looking at you now,

193
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,620
you held up well.

194
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:22,980
White Hair,

195
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,330
your father and I

196
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,330
shared one wish.

197
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,810
We only hoped you could live safely,

198
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,500
long enough to grow old and gray again.

199
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:40,650
Child,

200
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,260
come back alive.

201
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,810
The King of Tiemo is gone.

202
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,260
He cares nothing for your life or death.

203
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:30,990
Let's go.

204
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,230
Take it slow.

205
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:37,530
Come on.

206
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,140
Let's go.

207
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,410
Xiaobing.

208
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,410
You don't want to leave, do you?

209
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,740
Even if I don't, I must.

210
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,850
I fear Tiemo's attack as well.

211
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:53,960
But I still gave

212
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,220
someone my word, and haven't fulfilled it.

213
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,090
Let's go.

214
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,330
Xiaobing.

215
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:31,980
What are you two doing?

216
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,060
Sir.

217
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,810
His Majesty ordered me to protect you.

218
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:36,940
If I give my word,

219
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:37,810
I will see it done.

220
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,300
My sister and I will escort you to Huzhou.

221
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,980
Look at these troubled times.

222
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,540
Why must you two take such risks?

223
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:49,780
War is coming anyway.

224
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,700
It's the same wherever we go.

225
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,330
Huzhou is farther away.

226
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,700
Perhaps the war won't reach there.

227
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:54,800
Sir.

228
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,890
Don't feel indebted.

229
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,410
No...

230
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,330
In times like these,

231
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,130
common folk should help each other.

232
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,410
Will this do?

233
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,980
It will.

234
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,060
Huzhou is far,

235
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,020
so maybe

236
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,610
we can avoid the war.

237
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,780
Food, clothes, and expenses on the road

238
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:14,960
will all be my responsibility.

239
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,410
Sir, don't stand on ceremony.

240
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:17,500
- No. - You may command me

241
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,410
along the road as you wish.

242
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,130
Serving tea, fetching water, massaging legs,

243
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:20,780
just call me.

244
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,090
Treat me as your own son.

245
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,570
Sir.

246
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:30,540
Are you alright?

247
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,410
I'm fine.

248
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:32,300
I'm fine,

249
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:32,890
child.

250
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,330
Xiaobing, Xiaoding.

251
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:36,020
Come.

252
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,700
Take me to Huzhou.

253
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,700
- Let's go. - Let's go.

254
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:44,250
Come, over here.

255
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,220
Come.

256
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:02,610
Come on.

257
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,850
Let's head off.

258
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:49,920
How?

259
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,280
Are you alright?

260
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,330
Sorry to keep you waiting.

261
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,090
Is the porridge ready?

262
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,650
Sorry to keep you waiting. It's ready.

263
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,670
The Emperor of the Xiao line

264
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,980
is now in the King of Tiemo's hands.

265
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,780
Chang'an is hanging

266
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,370
by a thread now.

267
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,260
Even on the brink, we still eat porridge.

268
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,500
The battle must have gone terribly.

269
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,650
It truly was a heavy defeat.

270
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,570
At least we still have porridge.

271
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,740
I thought

272
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,060
I would never see the Grand Preceptor again.

273
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,300
You will not see the Grand Preceptor.

274
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,330
What you see is Cen Pickles.

275
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:19,300
[Cen Weizong]

276
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,220
Ye Zheng.

277
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,130
Eat your porridge.

278
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,370
You remember me?

279
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,170
Child, have a bowl.

280
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:32,980
Warm yourself.

281
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,860
Old sir,

282
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,100
why is your courtyard

283
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,690
full of pickles?

284
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:58,140
Winters are long.

285
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,650
Fresh food won't last in the cellar.

286
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,830
Pickling them

287
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,970
brings out a richer taste.

288
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,860
I met your master when we were young.

289
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,890
After I retired from the world,

290
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,890
we lost touch.

291
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,910
I remember when he took you two in,

292
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:23,490
he said he might live in Chang'an forever.

293
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,290
I naively believed

294
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,650
he would forget the past.

295
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,560
He has now been laid to rest.

296
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,330
Remember his kindness.

297
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:41,870
That is enough.

298
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,420
With that in your hearts,

299
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,420
you will find peace.

300
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,460
Do not blame him.

301
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,070
You,

302
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,110
and Gu Yu,

303
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,290
both remarkable people.

304
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,790
Gu Yu survived thirty days on dry buns alone.

305
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,100
I think you outdo him.

306
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,020
You could last thirty days

307
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,410
without food or water.

308
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,520
This is Ronghua Alley?

309
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:57,380
Yes, and all the neighbors

310
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:01,140
around here are trustworthy.

311
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,580
For years,

312
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:04,820
I bribed them with pickles.

313
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:06,720
Staying here

314
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:09,140
will keep you safe for a few days.

315
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,860
You might not stay safe for long.

316
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,970
There is something

317
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,490
I wish to ask of you.

318
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,290
I know.

319
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,930
I return to the palace tonight for duty.

320
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:32,820
Chang'an is about to change.

321
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,650
Please find a way

322
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,490
for that person to survive.

323
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,650
That child is no concern of yours.

324
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,340
I will see to proper arrangements.

325
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,330
What you should consider

326
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,060
is a path of survival for yourself.

327
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,500
Ye Zheng told me

328
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:04,330
you struck a bargain with Yan Fengshan's men.

329
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,220
If you defeat the Tiemo forces,

330
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,700
they may take your head.

331
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:13,980
Yes.

332
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,500
If you defeat Tiemo,

333
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:20,500
you die.

334
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,500
If you drive them away,

335
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,170
you still die.

336
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,060
White Hair.

337
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:27,700
Have you ever wondered

338
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:29,570
what you have lived for

339
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,650
all your life?

340
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:37,410
If you can understand this,

341
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,610
then no matter whether there is

342
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,420
a way out of your dead end,

343
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:43,730
your life will not have been in vain.

344
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:48,980
My thanks, Grand Preceptor.

345
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,370
The sky has yet to brighten.

346
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,180
Will you not take a lantern?

347
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,980
No need.

348
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,250
I walk as dust upon the world,

349
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,680
and heaven and earth bear the light for me.

350
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,730
I faintly sensed

351
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,490
the Grand Preceptor was the one who saved me.

352
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:47,610
That night,

353
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:48,860
after Su Changlin wounded me,

354
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,020
then...

355
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,090
Yes.

356
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,090
It was him.

357
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,940
The Grand Preceptor saved me.

358
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,300
Huai'an,

359
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,850
he is someone we can trust, isn't he?

360
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,440
Fifteen years ago, on the night the Liu family was slaughtered,

361
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,420
he should have died there.

362
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,430
My father

363
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:49,420
hung a red ribbon on a tree,

364
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,770
warning him that the Huben Army had mutinied,

365
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,250
and thus he escaped death.

366
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,090
Yan Fengshan and the King of Tiemo

367
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,130
betrayed my father,

368
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,230
and betrayed the Grand Preceptor.

369
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,210
Those who share an enemy

370
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,530
can at least trust each other.

371
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,420
The army has pushed three hundred li

372
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:23,570
past the North Office.

373
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:26,560
Yet the four regional commanders who hold great legions

374
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,940
have made no move.

375
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,290
No rations prepared,

376
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,940
no troops mobilized,

377
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,440
as if they have chosen to sit and watch.

378
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,020
We have two hundred thousand soldiers,

379
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,690
hardly a lone force charging deep.

380
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,730
And with Xiao Wuyang

381
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,770
already in our hands.

382
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,210
Your Majesty,

383
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,460
we can take Chang'an now.

384
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,040
Hold on to it.

385
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:14,060
Thank you.

386
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,570
Urgent military report to the central court!

387
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,390
- How much for a flatbread? - Clear

388
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:18,150
- One wen each. - the way!

389
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,070
Urgent military report to the central court!

390
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,010
Clear the way!

391
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:21,850
Watch where you're going.

392
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:23,730
- Urgent military report to the central court! - Take care.

393
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:24,810
- Clear the way! - Lately,

394
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:25,800
news has been pouring in fast.

395
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,820
They say the Tiemo people

396
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,110
have reached the North Office.

397
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,220
And I heard at Changle Post outside the city,

398
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:31,920
everyone was killed.

399
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:33,610
Could be the Tiemo people

400
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:34,710
are already near Chang'an.

401
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,250
I also heard

402
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,290
there's a place outside the city called Cangshui River,

403
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:40,800
and I heard many

404
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,080
were killed there as well.

405
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,210
Truly too tragic.

406
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,860
These are troubled times indeed.

407
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,490
The war reports come faster each day.

408
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:13,880
Soon we will see the Tiemo horses at the gate.

409
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:17,010
Yet Xie Huai'an, who holds the command, is nowhere to be found.

410
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:19,220
Even His Majesty's fate is uncertain.

411
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,230
And so we wait here,

412
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,290
letting grain and fodder go to waste.

413
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,350
If you ask me,

414
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,230
we should march north

415
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:30,190
and fight the Tiemo head-on.

416
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:33,430
Did you read the report?

417
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:36,160
The Tiemo drove straight in.

418
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:38,140
The Baiwenhu Army fell quickly,

419
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,730
and none of the regional commanders moved.

420
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,410
If we rush out now

421
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:43,140
and fight,

422
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,810
what if we lose?

423
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,500
Then what of Chang'an?

424
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:54,690
I believe His Majesty still lives.

425
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,170
I believe in

426
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,500
Mr. Xie Huai'an as well, the one who holds the command.

427
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,730
He must have a plan.

428
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:03,650
Even Yan Fengshan, the man no blade could kill,

429
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,170
fell to him in the end.

430
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:09,170
Would the Tiemo be harder to fight than Yan Fengshan?

431
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,060
Maybe.

432
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,330
But panicking will not help us.

433
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:17,290
We wait.

434
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:43,940
Military grounds.

435
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,000
No unauthorized entry.

436
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,250
I request to see the generals.

437
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:11,620
The Wuyang Token belongs to Mr. Xie Huai'an.

438
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,770
Did he send you?

439
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,180
I...

440
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,060
No.

441
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,060
I come on behalf of the King of Tiemo.

442
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,640
Speak clearly.

443
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,580
Generals,

444
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,060
you have followed His Majesty for many years.

445
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,020
The scar on the arm

446
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,170
is real.

447
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:11,920
This...

448
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,900
I believe you

449
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,420
recognize it.

450
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,170
Where is His Majesty?

451
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:23,880
Tell me.

452
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,500
Where is His Majesty?

453
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,480
The King of Tiemo

454
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:06,370
sent me here

455
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,560
with a message.

456
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:12,290
Chang'an will fall.

457
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:16,090
The Wuyang Army must not storm the city.

458
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,420
If you refuse,

459
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,290
His Majesty dies.

460
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:24,650
What?

461
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:26,700
Impossible.

462
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,340
The Tiemo are still five hundred li away.

463
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,870
Their shadow guards are already inside the city.

464
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:37,900
They are using Huben tactics now.

465
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,250
The Wuyang Army must not attack.

466
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,020
If you do,

467
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:46,650
the Emperor will die.

468
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,250
When will the Tiemo strike?

469
00:40:59,070 --> 00:40:59,980
I fear

470
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,130
we are already too late.
