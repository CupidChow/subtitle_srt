1
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,320
CANGYUE TOWER

2
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,800
Who are you?

3
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,720
Strange.

4
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,320
Yan Fengshan shouldn't be here this early.

5
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,040
I'm a cripple.

6
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,520
Who do you think I am?

7
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,600
I, Gu Yu, request to see
the regional commanders

8
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,440
of Long'an, Beiting, Fanyang, and Zhenxi.

9
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,560
Yan Fengshan abducted me to win you over.

10
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,960
But as you can see now,

11
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,080
the Huben Army could not even
hold a cripple like me.

12
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,760
That alone proves
Yan Fengshan's strength is spent.

13
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,480
I came unarmed to see you.

14
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,880
I do not fear death.

15
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,360
I only fear becoming
the shame of Chang'an.

16
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,920
Before you all,

17
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,600
I will speak plainly.

18
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,960
I have handed the command
of the Baiwenhu Army to His Majesty.

19
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,960
If you refuse to surrender
your military seals,

20
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,600
that is rebellion.

21
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,800
You may kill me right here.

22
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,960
But whether I live or die today,

23
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,520
my troops

24
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,760
will march with His Majesty
to quell the rebellion.

25
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,400
The Tiemo people hate His Majesty and me

26
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:51,040
because when we join hands
on the battlefield,

27
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,680
we are not only strong but also ruthless.

28
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,520
Yan Fengshan had
the Baiwenhu Army ambushed.

29
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,080
Pangtou,

30
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,400
Qi,

31
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,520
Wei,

32
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,760
and Shan were all killed.

33
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,480
So, in return, I left him a mountain
of corpses in Hidden Soldier Alley.

34
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,800
If you choose treason,

35
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,800
I will make sure you watch
with your own eyes

36
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,480
as every grown man
in your households is killed,

37
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,440
every woman exiled,

38
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,520
and every part of your garrisons
reduced to wasteland.

39
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,080
I, Gu Yu,

40
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,680
always…

41
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,120
keep my word.

42
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,320
CANGYUE TOWER

43
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,080
For now, at least,
the imperial court has avoided disaster.

44
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,040
Next, everything rests
on whether Huai'an's trap

45
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,360
can have Yan Fengshan killed.

46
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,440
Mother, it's all set.

47
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,400
Once I'm done, put this one in too.

48
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,320
I searched everywhere for you.
I thought something had happened.

49
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,080
Those who should be dead are still alive.
I won't die yet.

50
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,720
How did it go?

51
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,720
Just as you ordered,

52
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,680
the Imperial Guards have shut
nine of the twelve gates.

53
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,360
Only the three western gates remain open.

54
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,840
They also pushed
the inspection posts five li outward.

55
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,240
The forged travel pass has surfaced.

56
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,240
After passing inspection,
he entered through Yanping Gate.

57
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,760
How about the deployment?

58
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,440
Six full battalions are in place.

59
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,159
Xiao Wuyang has set out as well,
carrying that sword of his.

60
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,440
The rain

61
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,160
sounds different from usual.

62
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,040
Huai'an, you must've been too tired.

63
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,920
Maybe.

64
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,440
I've waited too long for this moment.

65
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,160
Greetings, Your Majesty.

66
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,440
Five li outside the city, the one
carrying the travel pass you forged

67
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,480
was dressed in white, wearing a bamboo hat
with black gauze hanging from it.

68
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,840
It was confirmed.
That man was Yan Fengshan.

69
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,960
Our men kept a close watch on him.

70
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,640
There were seven people with him,

71
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,040
all keeping a careful distance.

72
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,560
Once he enters the city,
the signal flag goes up,

73
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,600
and we will strike on the spot.

74
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,480
But he is Yan Fengshan.
Will he really come?

75
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,960
He is Yan Fengshan.

76
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,240
Will he come?

77
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,280
FLATBREAD, SESAME SOUP

78
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,800
BARLEY PORRIDGE, NOODLE SOUP

79
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,080
MEAT PIES, PEPPER SOUP, FRIED BREAD

80
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,560
Your Majesty, General Gu,
Mr. Xie Huai'an, it's done.

81
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,400
Have you confirmed it was Yan Fengshan?

82
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,920
We are examining the body.

83
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,640
We found this on the horse.

84
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,680
LI'S TAVERN

85
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,600
Let me.

86
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,080
Give it to me.

87
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,560
She shed many tears.

88
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,880
General.

89
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,119
ROSTER OF TROOP ROTATIONS

90
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,400
LUO SHENG, ZHU SANCAI, YUCHI ZHONG

91
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,400
ZHANG BINGCHEN, XIAO ANFU, GAO CHANGFENG

92
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,160
Huai'an.

93
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,920
This is the list of everyone
involved in this operation.

94
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,560
It is time to face it.

95
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,160
Five li outside the city,

96
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,200
the man who passed inspection
was Yan Fengshan.

97
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,480
But somewhere along the way,
Bai Wan was switched in.

98
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,360
That means we had long been exposed,

99
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,840
and the men outside the city

100
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,800
had long been infiltrated
by Huben members.

101
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,520
The three signal officers on the towers

102
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,080
knew it wasn't Yan Fengshan,

103
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,080
yet they raised the flags anyway,

104
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,280
because they, too, were Huben members.

105
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,120
It is not hard to identify these people,

106
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,040
but the key still lies
in Hidden Soldier Alley.

107
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,800
General, Hidden Soldier Alley is empty.

108
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,120
Does it have another exit?

109
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,440
Residents of an entire ward,
thousands of people, have vanished.

110
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,000
There must be another way out.

111
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,920
It no longer matters.

112
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
What matters is
that Yan Fengshan has returned.

113
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,920
And with all the Huben guards
from Hidden Soldier Alley,

114
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,440
if he rallies them,

115
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,160
who do you think
he would want to strike at the most?

116
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,240
I should return to the palace.

117
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,000
Xiao Wuyang?

118
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,800
The greatest enemy
of our lives has appeared.

119
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,480
You may stay grieving,

120
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,760
but I am going to the palace
to support His Majesty.

121
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,720
If I die, I owe you one life
for Hidden Soldier Alley.

122
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,560
I will repay it in the next life.

123
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,480
With Yan Fengshan back,

124
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,960
I am prepared to lose Chang'an,

125
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,040
but I have never prepared
for Chang'an to lose Gu Yu.

126
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,600
You cannot die.

127
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,880
Then I hope that when we meet again,

128
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:55,680
I will see a Xie Huai'an
who has stood back up.

129
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,120
You will.

130
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,440
-Baiwenhu soldiers, hear my command!
-Yes!

131
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,560
Follow me to the palace!

132
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,120
Protect His Majesty!

133
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,680
At most two hours from now,
the city will fall into chaos.

134
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,640
You should leave.

135
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,440
I never told her the whole truth.

136
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,880
I owed her too much.

137
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,440
At the very least,

138
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,480
I should see her off as family.

139
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,440
Don't worry.

140
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,640
I know every skill the Huben guards use.

141
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,120
They cannot kill me.

142
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,880
What happened to her

143
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,040
matters deeply to me.

144
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,040
It matters to us too.

145
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,040
Huai'an, don't worry.

146
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,920
I will keep him safe.

147
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,720
I will not let him
fall into Yan Fengshan's hands.

148
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,560
Go do what you must.

149
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,960
Thank you.

150
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,160
Now go.

151
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,040
Use it for protection.

152
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,520
Huai'an, your white hair
draws too much attention.

153
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:48,000
When you go out,
wear a bamboo hat to cover it.

154
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,720
Huai'an, you will come find us, right?

155
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,080
Do not face Yan Fengshan alone.

156
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,000
When the time comes to kill him,

157
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,520
take us with you.

158
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,880
I have not finished this road yet.

159
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,280
Of course I'll need you both.

160
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,200
There was a scholar named Han Ziling.

161
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,360
He asked me to give you this letter.

162
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,080
He said he had long admired you.

163
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,800
If anything happens to me,

164
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,600
please give this to him.

165
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,000
Remember:

166
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:49,480
do not fail the hopes
of the scholars of this realm.

167
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,320
Live.

168
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,720
I will.

169
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,600
Now go.

170
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,880
Why did you return to Chang'an?

171
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,960
It was my fault.

172
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,200
It was my fault.

173
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,040
It was my fault.

174
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,560
Humans belong to heaven and earth.

175
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,160
Our souls come from the clouds,

176
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,840
our bodies return to the earth.

177
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,480
Heaven and Earth leave traces
upon a person,

178
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,280
and those traces can guide one back

179
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,720
to where they once walked.

180
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,080
Mother, I did something bad!

181
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,720
Miss.

182
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,040
Oh, dear.

183
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,080
I'm so sorry, truly sorry.

184
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,920
-Look at what you did.
-It's all right.

185
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,160
He didn't do it on purpose.
I simply happened to pass by.

186
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,560
Miss, I'm really sorry.

187
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,360
Why don't you come in
and change into something clean?

188
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,920
We have new clothes, all clean.

189
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,680
They should fit you well.

190
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,080
It's fine.

191
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,320
I insist. It was my son's fault.

192
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,720
With your clothes dirty,
you must be uncomfortable.

193
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,880
-Come on.
-Thank you.

194
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,920
We don't have much food to offer.

195
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,520
Please make do.

196
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,280
I've been living on cold,
plain food along the way.

197
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,200
A bowl of hot noodles
is more than wonderful.

198
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,320
What is he doing at the door?

199
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,320
He is waiting for his father.

200
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,240
His father works as
a ferryman in Nanwei Trough,

201
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,320
30 or 40 li from here.

202
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,920
It's not easy for him to come back,

203
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,800
but whenever he can
find someone to take his place,

204
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,680
even if it means
walking a whole day and night,

205
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,360
he'll come home to visit.

206
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,880
Some spend their whole lives walking,
only to reach home.

207
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,800
You too, miss?

208
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,240
I've lived in Chang'an for years.
Now I miss home.

209
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,880
Your father and mother
must be longing for you too.

210
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,400
To be missed by family is a blessing.

211
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,840
I think I've heard that…

212
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:27,000
My husband once said
he had a ferryman companion.

213
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,280
The man said he fled
to Nanwei Trough with his little sister.

214
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:34,520
Then his sister was taken in by a family,

215
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,480
and he stayed behind,

216
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,240
working as a ferryman
while watching over her.

217
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,080
He kept watch for seven whole years.

218
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,400
I don't know what disaster
struck their family.

219
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,400
His sister was right beside him,
yet they couldn't reunite.

220
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,400
How bitter that must have been.

221
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,720
That man also told my husband

222
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,880
that having someone to worry about
was a kind of blessing,

223
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,040
just like you said.

224
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,000
Is that ferryman still in Nanwei Trough?

225
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,000
No.

226
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,560
My husband said something happened,
and he left.

227
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,320
Let me light a lamp for my husband,

228
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:20,120
so he knows my son and I
are thinking of him.

229
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,280
Sir.

230
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,760
Miss, are you here to offer incense
or seeking a divination?

231
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,520
I came to ask for a naming slip.

232
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,600
Has a child been born at home?

233
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,720
Congratulations.

234
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,000
Is it a boy or a girl?

235
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,280
Please, have a seat.

236
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,560
It's not for a child. It's for myself.

237
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,560
No one asks for a naming slip at your age.

238
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,920
My family suffered a disaster
when I was little.

239
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,080
I was separated from a family member
for many years.

240
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,240
Recently, I found him again.

241
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,720
This naming slip
is to reclaim my true name

242
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,880
and restore my ties with him.

243
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,280
To spend half a lifetime adrift
and still find your family again

244
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,760
is no easy thing.

245
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,600
Fate parts people
but also brings them back together.

246
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,400
So, for this naming slip, I will write…

247
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,719
Do you still remember your name
after all these years?

248
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,320
My family name is Liu.

249
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,520
I've carried this amulet
for as long as I can remember.

250
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,159
I never understood the meaning,

251
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,360
but now I finally do.

252
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,560
My given name is written on it.

253
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:33,719
A single character: Li.

254
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,920
Then for the blessing, I will write,

255
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,920
"May you find home again
and know lasting peace."

256
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,400
How does that sound?

257
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,840
Thank you, sir.

258
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,920
LIU LI: MAY YOU FIND HOME AGAIN
AND KNOW LASTING PEACE.

259
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,840
LIU LI

260
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,920
BAI WAN

261
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,320
LIU LI

262
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,040
Liu Li,

263
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,920
so you

264
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,680
came back to reunite with me?

265
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,080
-Take care.
-Goodbye.

266
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:43,560
CHEN ZHIYING OF THE HUBEN ARMY

267
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,360
Can you promise that?

268
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,880
Of course I can.

269
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,200
Then will you write to me
to tell me you're safe?

270
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,480
Wherever you go, write to me every year,

271
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,360
so I know you're safe.

272
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,000
She's your sister,
yet you let her join another family.

273
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,200
You've been a ferryman here
for seven years, three li from her home,

274
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,440
just to protect her from afar.

275
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,640
How long can you keep this up?

276
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,880
I don't know.

277
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,760
I only hope she never remembers her past.

278
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,840
That night, I hid behind the wall

279
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,760
and saw someone feeding you soup.

280
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,400
You were surrounded by people

281
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,000
who cared for you.

282
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:18,560
At that moment,
I decided to leave you with that family.

283
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,960
I thought that if I was careful enough,

284
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,440
you would live a safe life.

285
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,400
Liu Li,

286
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,160
I was wrong.

287
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:45,120
When the time comes, I will reunite
with you, Father, and Mother.

288
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,040
The four of us

289
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,960
will be together again.

290
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:12,920
INCENSE

291
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,040
Is it a funeral?

292
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,640
The whole city is under martial law,
with killings everywhere.

293
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,520
Even the city gates
have changed hands several times.

294
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,720
And you…

295
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,040
You have to go through this
on the very day

296
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,320
the court is thrown into chaos.

297
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,760
Everyone suffers.

298
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,880
Everyone suffers!

299
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,560
Sir, please come in.

300
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,720
Do you need a memorial tablet made?

301
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,320
Who is it for? What should it say?

302
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,720
It is…

303
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,960
for my late sister, Liu Li.

304
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:25,560
LATE SISTER LIU LI

305
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,840
General Fengshan.

306
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,800
YAN FENGSHAN

307
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,160
In this courtyard,

308
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,000
I can almost see the traces
of my old friends.

309
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,360
When you have time,
ask around at the brokerages.

310
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,320
If it can be bought, buy this place.

311
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,720
It is a fine courtyard indeed.

312
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,760
Even convenient for cooking.

313
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,120
I will go to the brokers tomorrow.

314
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,200
General…

315
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,200
The Liu family's child is buried here.

316
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,280
From this day on,

317
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,200
no one is allowed
to set foot on this patch of land.

318
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,320
Understood.

319
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,360
General, we have taken the Imperial City.

320
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:50,560
But the 400 men we first sent
to assassinate Xiao Wuyang were all lost.

321
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,600
We found no trace of him.

322
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,720
What about Gu Yu?

323
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,040
Gu Yu led two 100-man Baiwenhu units
and tried to enter the Imperial City.

324
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,480
We surrounded them.

325
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,200
His men fought desperately
to break him out.

326
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,400
By the time they reached Yongchang Ward,

327
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,280
all the Baiwenhu soldiers had fallen,
and Gu Yu disappeared.

328
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,040
Lock down the area
surrounding the Imperial City,

329
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,800
west to Guangde Ward,
east to Xuanyang Ward,

330
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,480
and south to the outer streets
of Jingzhao Prefecture.

331
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,560
Both of them are injured.

332
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:27,000
If they want to hide,
it can only be within this area.

333
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,120
Find them.

334
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,160
Understood.

335
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,760
All 12 gates of Chang'an
are now under Huben guards' control.

336
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,920
Xiao Wuyang stationed the Wuyang Army
30 li outside the city,

337
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,160
but the armies

338
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,080
of the four regional commanders
marched early on your order

339
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,880
and have now arrived near Chang'an.

340
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,200
Their forces outnumber the Wuyang Army
three to one

341
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,400
and have kept them in check.

342
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Then that leaves only the north.

343
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,920
Send a messenger to Tiemo

344
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,960
and have them hold back
the main Baiwenhu forces.

345
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,680
As long as they don't march south,

346
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,280
Chang'an is ours.

347
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,720
I will go.

348
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,040
Zhiying will handle it.

349
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,000
Wang Pu, you carry a criminal record.

350
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:15,480
Now, where is White Hair?

351
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,160
He hasn't been found.

352
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:46,120
LATE SISTER LIU LI

353
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,080
White Hair!

354
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,920
Do you yield?

355
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,200
I will return.

356
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,400
And when I do, I will kill you.
