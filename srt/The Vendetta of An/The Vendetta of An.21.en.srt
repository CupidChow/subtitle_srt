1
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,000
Let me stay with you.

2
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,920
The King of Tiemo has made a move.

3
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,120
I'm sure they are well-prepared
for the assault on Chang'an.

4
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,320
You must deliver the military order
to the Baiwenhu main division.

5
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,920
We must be prepared.

6
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,640
Then, I'll stay.

7
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,360
Don't worry.

8
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,240
I still have arrows.

9
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,720
General.

10
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,520
Do not grieve.

11
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,000
Whether we are dead or alive,

12
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,800
we have done this dynasty proud.

13
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,160
As a soldier,

14
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,920
this might be

15
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,320
the best ending for me.

16
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,800
The famous general,
Gu Yu of Baiwenhu is dead.

17
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,040
Just like Yan Fengshan,
Xiao Wuyang, and Liu Ziwen,

18
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,160
he was also a respected enemy
who should be feared.

19
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,920
Go find a hill
and give General Gu a grand funeral.

20
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,160
He said he wanted to die in his homeland.

21
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,600
I'll grant his wish.

22
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,320
Noted.

23
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,680
General, you were friends with him.

24
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,600
Why didn't you go see him?

25
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,920
He suffered a great upheaval

26
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,480
and lived a life
wandering in hardships all these years.

27
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,400
Chancellor Gao could find him,

28
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,360
but I, a former friend of his,

29
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,600
thought he was already dead.

30
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,840
He did not even request help from me
just to not get me involved.

31
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,920
I don't have it in me to see him.

32
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,080
White Hair.

33
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,040
Come here.

34
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,880
‎CONTEMPLATION

35
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,320
SERVICE AND DUTY,
HONEST EFFORT, INNER DISCIPLINE

36
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,920
White Hair, you are
the most excellent student I've taught.

37
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,360
Let me ask you.

38
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,360
What do you want to achieve
when you grow up?

39
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,840
In times of peace, to aid a wise ruler.

40
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,040
RESPECT YOUR TEACHERS AND VALUE VIRTUE

41
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,280
But times of peace are hard to come by.

42
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,280
What if chaos comes?

43
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,280
In times of chaos, to kill every enemy.

44
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,880
It's good to have such an ambition.

45
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,520
First, you must remember what I told you.

46
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,440
Those who stand out invite trouble.

47
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,520
So…

48
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,679
WU ZHONGHENG, GRAND ACADEMY TUTOR

49
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:37,000
…you must first ensure your own survival.

50
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,640
General Gu.

51
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,920
The King respects you.

52
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,000
But my four sons died
in the hands of the Baiwenhu Army.

53
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,960
You deserve this.

54
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,480
I deserve this, as well!

55
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,480
Gu Yu, leave the rest to me.

56
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,200
Don't worry.

57
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,800
Chang'an will not fall.

58
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,080
Rest in peace.

59
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,680
Your friend is dead.
It's time for you to die.

60
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,880
Time to return General Fengshan's life!

61
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,440
It's not time yet.

62
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,560
Many of my comrades were killed.

63
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,400
I must stay here.

64
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,000
An eye for an eye.

65
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,240
You must help me.

66
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,960
With Yan Fengshan's return,
I'm prepared to lose Chang'an.

67
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,240
But I'm not prepared

68
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,440
for Chang'an to lose Gu Yu.

69
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,600
You mustn't die.

70
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,080
This is Baiwenhu's message token.

71
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,840
Before he died,

72
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,040
he left me a message.

73
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,160
He did all he could

74
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,720
for the dynasty.

75
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,960
Even when he was dying,

76
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,760
he still used his own body

77
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,800
to relay the military order.

78
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,080
The Huben Army

79
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,120
used to fight the Tiemo people
in the north too.

80
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,360
They also fought
alongside the Baiwenhu Army.

81
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,600
Back then,

82
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,360
everyone in the imperial court
respected the Huben Army.

83
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,200
You want me to pay with my life
but it's not time yet.

84
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,440
When the Tiemo people
are chased out of the border,

85
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,720
you may find me to avenge Yan Fengshan.

86
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,400
I will spare you.

87
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,000
When the Tiemo people
are chased out of the border,

88
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,120
I will come and take your life.

89
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,480
My friend,

90
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,720
I'll see you when the time comes.

91
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,960
IMPERIAL PHYSICIAN'S HALL

92
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,560
DING ER

93
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,000
You are finally awake. Come.

94
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,640
Come.

95
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,120
Get up. Come.

96
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,960
Drink the medicine.

97
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,320
Xiaoqing made this for you.

98
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,480
Here you go.

99
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,080
Give it to me.

100
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,400
How do you feel? Still alive?

101
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,680
Still alive.

102
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,840
That's good enough. Come.

103
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,400
You there.

104
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,240
Why is it you who takes care of me?

105
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,760
How did all of you find me?

106
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,680
Didn't… Didn't you come back on your own?

107
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,400
Back then, a Baiwenhu soldier
told us something had happened to you.

108
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,040
We searched all over Chang'an

109
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,080
and finally found you
lying in front of the clinic.

110
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,880
Oh. Where are Huai'an and the rest?

111
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,480
-Yan Fengshan and…
-Yan Fengshan is dead.

112
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,560
Huai'an left the city to quell the unrest
but he hasn't returned.

113
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,000
He's finally dead.

114
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,720
Yes.

115
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,480
Finally,

116
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,840
it's over.

117
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,520
Where's Xiaoqing? How is she?

118
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,840
She stayed by your side the whole night.

119
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,000
She only left
when the physician said you'd live.

120
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,040
We were mistaken about Su Changlin.

121
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,720
He's a pesky troublemaker.

122
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,000
When Huai'an is back,

123
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,160
we'll deal with him together.

124
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,960
-Here you go.
-Noodle bowls!

125
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,920
Thank you.

126
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You're welcome.

127
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,160
Come again when you're done.

128
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,000
-Sure.
-I want one with meat.

129
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,960
CUI'S DESSERT

130
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,480
Miss, what do you feel like eating?

131
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,720
If you want snow-pear tonic,
you have to wait for a while.

132
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,040
This batch still needs
some time to be ready.

133
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,320
Sir, do you know Yang Chuhao?

134
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,440
A rich merchant in Chang'an.

135
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,840
Of course, I do.

136
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,280
All the businesses
in the few streets around here

137
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,280
belong to him.

138
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,040
Miss, you wish to know more about him?

139
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,240
I'm running a small business.

140
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,840
I'm not close to someone like him.

141
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,520
He has a debt collector working for him.

142
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,560
A young man who looks harmless.
Do you know him?

143
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,800
Are you talking about Mr. Su?

144
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,920
He was here before.
He came here to buy snow-pear tonic.

145
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,160
He was very polite and generous.

146
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,840
He paid generously too.

147
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,600
Let me know when he visits again.

148
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,080
There's a clinic ahead at Xiaocaomen.

149
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,320
-I live there.
-Sure.

150
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,520
Miss. Let me ask one more thing.

151
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,200
Did Mr. Su buy
the snow-pear tonic for you?

152
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,440
Yes.

153
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,240
But I'm going to kill him.

154
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,160
Tell me.

155
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,360
Can we live a normal life in the future?

156
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,120
We can watch cockfights
on the streets and play backgammon

157
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,320
when we are free.

158
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,480
We'll find a reliable shopkeeper
and work for him

159
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,520
for a fixed income.

160
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,960
We will live in the same house

161
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,400
and pay the rent together.

162
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,680
Isn't that quite nice?

163
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,040
You'd never think about this in the past.

164
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,560
Yes.

165
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,040
With Yan Fengshan around,

166
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,280
I had to live cautiously
even as the Emperor.

167
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,280
I've never lived like a person.
Do you understand?

168
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,720
Huai'an wanted to take revenge

169
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,640
and I also wanted him dead.

170
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,080
I was a coward in the past.
I dared not say it.

171
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,800
I was very afraid of him in the past.

172
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,000
But now, Yan Fengshan is dead.

173
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,600
This day has finally come.

174
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,880
Yes.

175
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,280
Yan Fengshan is dead.

176
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,200
You can finally live
according to your wishes for once.

177
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,600
Your Majesty.

178
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,760
We are alone here.

179
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,200
Set aside the formalities.

180
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,080
The ground is cold.

181
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,880
We are both old.

182
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,520
I'm sure you can't handle
kneeling for a long time.

183
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,440
Stand up.

184
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,200
I failed my mission.
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

185
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,920
What's the point of punishing you?

186
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
If you fail this time,
just succeed the next time.

187
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,120
I've met Xie Huai'an.

188
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,120
His gaze was unlike his father's.

189
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,880
It felt like yours or mine.

190
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,600
It had the viciousness
of the Tiemo people.

191
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,800
So losing to him this time
wasn't your fault.

192
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,520
Stand up.

193
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,320
Yes.

194
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,560
Among the nobles of Chang'an,

195
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,680
Yang Chuhao loves
collecting tomes the most.

196
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:32,520
We saw this study
and thought Your Majesty would like it.

197
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,960
All of Your Majesty's old tomes
have been kept properly.

198
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,000
So many good tomes are abandoned here.

199
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,960
What a pity.

200
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,280
YISI DIVINATION

201
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,160
RIVERSIDE JOURNAL

202
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,280
See?

203
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,480
This book.

204
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,520
Cen Weizong spent more than
a decade of effort to write this.

205
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,400
This is a travel journal.

206
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,360
It was lost in the war.

207
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,680
He wanted to find this book
but to no avail.

208
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,240
Later, Cen Weizong
became the Grand Preceptor,

209
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,960
only second to the emperor.

210
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,520
He would never imagine

211
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,040
that his book would be used
by a stall owner

212
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,720
to prop up a table.

213
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,200
Everything in the world has its destiny.

214
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,360
I tried everything to find this book

215
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,080
because it recorded every pass
between the borders of two nations.

216
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,160
The Tiemo people
will soon have a use for this.

217
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,200
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

218
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,760
Oh. I have one more thing
to discuss with you.

219
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,120
Go ahead, Your Majesty.

220
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,960
Sit down. Let's talk about it.

221
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,200
Your identity has been exposed now.

222
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,520
What do you plan to do
with your two disciples?

223
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,600
Your Majesty, you should know
why I started serving you back then.

224
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,360
Of course.

225
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,960
Because your children died
in Tiemo during the winter.

226
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,040
Winter in Tiemo is too cold.

227
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,880
Many children cannot survive
such a harsh season.

228
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,280
We are lucky to be alive until now.

229
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,480
But you have lived
in Chang'an for so many years.

230
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,120
I'm sure you're attached to this place.

231
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,920
I believe you won't betray me

232
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,920
because your children are watching you

233
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,840
from high above.

234
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,160
I've arranged for someone
to keep an eye on them.

235
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,760
If they stand in our way,
they will be killed.

236
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,600
Good.

237
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,240
CHANGLE OUTPOST

238
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,760
Emergency!

239
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,800
Emergency!

240
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,480
It's an emergency! Sir! Sir!

241
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,360
It's an emergency, sir!

242
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,400
It's the North Office!

243
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,080
The military report from Shifu Pass
hasn't even reached Chang'an,

244
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,480
yet the North Office's has?

245
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,200
IMPERIAL PHYSICIAN'S HALL

246
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:49,320
‎BLESSINGS ABOUND, MISFORTUNE FADES

247
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,800
Am I really leaving?

248
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,280
News of Gu Yu's death
has spread all over Chang'an.

249
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,920
Huai'an hasn't returned until now
and Master is missing.

250
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,080
Something must have gone wrong.

251
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,320
Huai'an said that once the situation
in Chang'an changed,

252
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,120
you must leave at once.

253
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,640
Don't worry too much.

254
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,960
Huai'an's old friends are in Huainan.

255
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,120
They will protect you.

256
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,240
Just eat and rest along the way
and you'll arrive soon.

257
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:36,200
Are you telling me…
that Gu Yu is really dead?

258
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,480
Is Huai'an not coming back?

259
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,360
I thought

260
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,440
the world would be at peace
once Yan Fengshan was dead.

261
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,640
I didn't expect…

262
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,040
Don't be so pessimistic.

263
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,920
We are just preparing for the worst.

264
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,520
Perhaps Huai'an will appear

265
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,920
and stop your carriage
when you're halfway along your journey.

266
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,400
That…

267
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,840
That is quite scary.

268
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,000
FRAGRANT REMEDY,
DALING TONIC, STOMACH SOOTHER

269
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,480
In the past,

270
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,280
all of Chang'an was mine.

271
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,880
I'm leaving now

272
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,000
yet I can't take anything with me.

273
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,120
Wait for me.

274
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,960
Take this.

275
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:41,520
It was meant for Master,
but you are going to Huainan.

276
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,080
Winter in the south is humid and cold.

277
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,040
You can use it as your winter coat.

278
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,600
All right.

279
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,680
Thank you.

280
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,400
Wait. What is the meaning of this?

281
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,680
You are afraid of the dark.
Use it at night.

282
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,400
You are the one who's afraid.

283
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,360
All right.

284
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,320
Time to go.

285
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:12,600
You once owned all of Chang'an,
yet had no friends.

286
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,000
Now, you do.

287
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,400
You also have friends who will miss you.

288
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:34,920
Go.

289
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,880
All of you should take care as well.

290
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,960
If you meet Huai'an later,

291
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:48,480
tell him that I'm hiding
and I'm hiding well.

292
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,080
He can rest assured.

293
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,840
See you.

294
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,000
IMPERIAL PHYSICIAN'S HALL

295
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,360
Xiaoqing, have you noticed?

296
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,600
There are many strangers nearby.

297
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,760
That's right.

298
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,920
Huai'an said if the situation
changed in Chang'an,

299
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,840
the Nasty One would be
the first to get hurt.

300
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,960
I'm afraid he has already
been targeted now.

301
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,320
So, I want to send him off in secret,

302
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,680
at least until he's past the walls.

303
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,480
I'll come with you.

304
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,240
-You are still injured.
-No.

305
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,840
Master and Huai'an
might send news at any time.

306
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,080
Someone must stay at the clinic.

307
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,320
You must be careful.

308
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,880
My eyes have been twitching all day.

309
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,760
Don't worry.

310
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,240
My injury doesn't affect me much.
It'll be fine.

311
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,560
Who's worried about you?

312
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,880
I'm worried about Master.

313
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:14,040
He is our master.
It is not our place to worry over him.

314
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,800
CUI'S DESSERT

315
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,920
I know you want to kill me.

316
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,840
I asked the shopkeeper to lure you here.

317
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,320
Why?

318
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,040
Because I'm from Tiemo.

319
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,840
Have you come to kill me?

320
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,720
No.

321
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,080
I'm here to send you home.

322
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:02,240
Only when you and your friends are alive,

323
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,040
can Xie Huai'an be controlled.

324
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,840
You said your name was Su Changlin.

325
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,560
Is that true?

326
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,640
It is true.

327
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,360
You said you buried your widowed mother
at the age of 14.

328
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,000
You came to Chang'an to make a living.

329
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,880
During your first year in Chang'an,
it was always raining.

330
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,120
You ate a bowl of noodles
at the noodle shop south of the city.

331
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,080
You ran away

332
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,160
because you had no money.

333
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:04,160
You kept running and crying.

334
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,480
Is that true?

335
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,240
It is true.

336
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,400
However, my mother was also from Tiemo.

337
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,160
At first, I did not believe it.

338
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,720
It turns out you are indeed that person.

339
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,360
-Sir, give me a bowl of noodles.
-Sure.

340
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,280
Brat, you haven't paid!

341
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,160
Stay right there.

342
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,760
When I first met you,

343
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,560
I told you
the most miserable things in my life

344
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,400
to make you pity me.

345
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,480
I didn't expect…

346
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,280
What are you doing?

347
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,960
You're back?

348
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,240
I'm sorting out the accounts.

349
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,920
The account is a mess
so I'm sorting it out.

350
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,240
I'll be done soon.

351
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,560
I didn't expect…

352
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,200
I didn't expect

353
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,760
that it would be a meeting of old ties.

354
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,320
Have you paid for the bowl of noodles?

355
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,200
I have.

356
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,080
However, you won't be able to return

357
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,600
the debt you owe me.

358
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,720
Later, the noodle stall
was acquired by someone else

359
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,360
and became the dessert stall you see now.

360
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,640
Everything began there.

361
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,920
Let it end there.

362
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,840
What are you doing?

363
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,160
Don't stand in my way.

364
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,160
Master?

365
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,120
Come with me. My master wants to see you.

366
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,480
Don't step forward anymore.

367
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,640
If you value your life,
return to the Imperial Physician's Hall.
