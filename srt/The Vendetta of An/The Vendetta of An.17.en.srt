1
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,720
Little one, you've got quite the appetite.

2
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,120
Here. Have something sour
to cut through the grease.

3
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,920
Thank you, Mr. Yang. I'm full.

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,960
- Good.
- Settle the bill.

5
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,480
Your father and I were like brothers.
No need to pay.

6
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,760
Father is Father. I am me.

7
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,520
I don't like owing anyone anything.

8
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,600
I'm leaving, Mr. Yang.

9
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,560
WONTON SHOP

10
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,480
No. Take all of it.

11
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,120
This boy. Who knows
what he'll be like when he grows up.

12
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,760
Sir, take care.

13
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,760
ALL-GOODS SHOP

14
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,840
The pageboy hid himself
in the Cangshui River.

15
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,240
Is he all right?

16
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,720
All right? He was howling nonstop.

17
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,320
To keep me from getting out,
he nearly chewed through the skiff.

18
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,920
Speaking of which,

19
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,400
you really mean to entrust
something this important to him?

20
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,040
He's the only one who can pull it off.

21
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,600
He's not Huben.

22
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,320
He's someone
who admires your junior sister.

23
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,480
I've seen him.

24
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,480
He serves at Yang Chuhao's side.

25
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,840
What did you just say?

26
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,520
He admires Xiaoqing?

27
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,160
With eyes like that,

28
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,000
he should see a physician.

29
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,320
Xiaoqing is a good girl.

30
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,280
Don't talk too much.

31
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,560
Xiaoqing was never skilled
in music, chess, calligraphy, or painting.

32
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,480
But she loves her food.

33
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,800
So you should cater to what she likes.

34
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,000
Then may I ask, sir,
what she likes to eat and drink?

35
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,600
Could you give me some guidance?

36
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,360
I'm not sure about that.

37
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,320
But girls tend to like
a bit of something sweet.

38
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,360
Thank you, sir.

39
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,480
You blockhead.

40
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,120
Thanks.

41
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,640
WONTONS

42
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,800
Sir, please come inside.

43
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,080
You are here.

44
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,480
Have a seat.

45
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,200
- All right.
- I'll get you a bowl of wontons.

46
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,600
Take care, young lady.

47
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,880
Come again anytime.

48
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,960
Take care.

49
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,760
Have a look.

50
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,840
Here.

51
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,600
Good.

52
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,920
Boss.

53
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,440
For the past two weeks,
you've been wearing that gloomy face.

54
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,480
Is it so obvious?

55
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,560
Of course.

56
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,760
Boss, Su came looking for me on purpose.

57
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,360
He said, you and I were old acquaintances,

58
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,600
so he asked if I had any way
to ease your worries.

59
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,400
That boy.

60
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,800
Well, what advice did you,
my old partner, give him?

61
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,440
None.

62
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,920
I told him the boss
is not an ordinary man.

63
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,480
What troubles the boss
can only be solved by Heaven.

64
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,200
Boss.

65
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,080
We've both lived several decades,
one way or another.

66
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,520
When it comes to matters
truly hard to decide, I think

67
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,920
this is the only way.

68
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,120
<i>Sha is also one of the Liu faction.</i>

69
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,840
You've been the one sheltering him.

70
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:13,080
So in some way,
you are a man who remembers past ties.

71
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,560
A man of feeling.

72
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,720
I do not wish for him to die.

73
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,040
What happens next

74
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,800
I must leave to you, Mr. Yang.

75
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:29,000
At our age,
we don't have many friends left.

76
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,280
You must not let anything happen to you.

77
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,560
Heads, and I enjoy wealth and peace.

78
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,240
Tails, and I repay my debts.

79
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,080
Stop.

80
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,680
This city wall can't stop me,
and it won't trap you either.

81
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,240
Rest assured. Don't be afraid.

82
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,680
I had been thinking

83
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,600
that after you woke up,
I wouldn't know how to face you.

84
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,200
You are the Emperor.

85
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,960
I am nothing more than a commoner.

86
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,840
Should I call you Wuyang,

87
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,039
or Your Majesty?

88
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,760
I don't know.

89
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,600
But now it's settled.

90
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,480
We're parting ways,

91
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,120
and you're still not awake.

92
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,280
But I still have other matters

93
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,240
and must leave Cangshui River for now.

94
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,440
From here on in, Mr. Long
will send people to look after you.

95
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,920
Don't worry.

96
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,800
Wuyang.

97
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,960
If I come back alive,

98
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,640
I'll go on taking care of you.

99
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,360
If I die,

100
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,120
it will count as a valiant death
for the realm

101
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,400
and I won't have disgraced our Xiao clan.

102
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,400
I'm leaving.

103
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,280
Wuyang,

104
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,320
when you're not holding a blade,

105
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,160
you're actually easy to get along with.

106
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,280
- Here.
- Thank you.

107
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,200
Where is he?

108
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,760
Are you the lad from the salt shop?

109
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,080
Sir.

110
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,520
I'll take it.

111
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,880
So you still know how to show your face.

112
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,880
You've skipped work for days on end.

113
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,400
Are you planning to quit on me?

114
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,680
No, sir. Something came up at home.

115
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,880
You smell of medicine.

116
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,960
What is it?

117
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,560
Is your family member gravely ill again?

118
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,800
Do you have enough money for the medicine?

119
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,720
If not, I'll lend you some.

120
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,720
It's not that.

121
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,160
Forget it, go on in. Go inside.

122
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,080
All right.

123
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,840
Here.

124
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,400
Have some tea.

125
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,680
Drink a little. Warm yourself up.

126
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,280
You really don't seem short on money.

127
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,560
Look at you.

128
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,240
A whole new outfit.

129
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,760
New clothes.

130
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,560
All dressed up all of a sudden.

131
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,760
You must have someone you fancy.

132
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,200
That's not why.

133
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,720
This time I'm here to bid you farewell.

134
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,600
I'm going to Chang'an.

135
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,760
Before I leave,
I want to admit a wrong to you.

136
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,440
This clothing is for you.

137
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,840
I noticed your clothes were patched up.

138
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,000
So I bought new ones for you.

139
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,320
All this for the salt
you always sneak off with?

140
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:18,240
This fine clothing will settle the debt.

141
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,720
So you knew all along.

142
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,240
But this time,
it isn't just because of that salt.

143
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,200
What are you doing?

144
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,440
Because

145
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,680
I know you're Zhang Mo's father.

146
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,360
And because you knew I was the killer
yet never blamed me.

147
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,520
You even let me stay here,
letting me work to earn money.

148
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,600
And when I nodded off in laziness,

149
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,800
you covered me with your coat.

150
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,600
You sewed the old family letters
Zhang Mo wrote into that coat.

151
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,200
When I patched it up,

152
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,400
I learned who you were.

153
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,440
It's fate.

154
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,440
It's truly fate.

155
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,200
If you'd stabbed me a few times,

156
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,680
I might have felt better.

157
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,480
But instead you kept taking care of me,

158
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,880
leaving me ashamed.

159
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,480
I came to Cangshui River

160
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,080
with hatred in my heart.

161
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,360
Before you came to work in my salt shop,

162
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,960
I had already watched you for many days.

163
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,320
But I found…

164
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,280
I found you were just a foolish lad.

165
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,920
Always complaining with your mouth,

166
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,640
yet in your heart
always thinking of others.

167
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,480
Caring for the sick at home,

168
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,560
hoping

169
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,760
a lost friend would show up again soon.

170
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,000
You…

171
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,120
The less you seem like a bad person,

172
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,600
the harder it is for me to hate you.

173
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,240
If only you had never learned who I was.

174
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,240
You did not know,
and I would not have exposed it.

175
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,360
Day after day,
life could have just gone on like that.

176
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,440
Forget it.

177
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,600
It felt as if

178
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,120
Zhang Mo were still here by my side.

179
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,560
You may pour the salt
back into the funnel,

180
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,839
but time cannot be turned back.

181
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,160
I truly wanted to kill you.

182
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,040
But child, what use is it if I kill you?

183
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,040
Zhang Mo will not come back to life.

184
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,520
Zhang Mo

185
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,280
was ordinary to begin with.

186
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,560
In this world,

187
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,920
nothing is ever that perfect.

188
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,960
Listen well.

189
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,080
If you can do something great
to help restore the realm,

190
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,360
to support the state,

191
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,240
then Zhang Mo will not have died in vain.

192
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,960
Get up.

193
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:31,960
Sir.

194
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,600
Sir.

195
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,920
I am sorry.

196
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,400
Get up.

197
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,040
Remember.

198
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,520
From this day on,

199
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,240
you must live an honest and upright life.

200
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,520
All right.

201
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,560
WEI HOUR

202
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,440
Then, I will say something unpleasant.

203
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,840
The human heart
always carries its darkness.

204
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,480
You have it.

205
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,680
I have it too.

206
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,920
But do not be afraid.

207
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,200
No matter how dark it becomes,

208
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,000
just like this Cangshui River,

209
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,200
your heart must always

210
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,800
hold a single light.

211
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,520
I understand.

212
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:55,960
All right.

213
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,040
Go on.

214
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,120
Take this.

215
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,920
Eat it on the road.

216
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,200
Go on.

217
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,920
You are going to Chang'an
to do something important.

218
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,240
Do not delay it.

219
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,200
Go.

220
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,680
I have seen you now.

221
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,720
My heart is settled.

222
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,240
We part here.

223
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,760
Go.

224
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,920
Sir.

225
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,560
STONE-BAKED FLATBREAD

226
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,120
ZUIFENG TOWER

227
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,800
THE MERRY HOUSE, SKYWAY

228
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,960
Mr. Yang.

229
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,160
This street has suddenly gone quiet.

230
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,840
Have you thought it through?

231
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,760
What Yan Fengshan
plans to discuss with the Tiemo people

232
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,880
is no small matter.

233
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,320
If you stir up trouble now,
kidnap the Tiemo envoy,

234
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,120
and something unexpected happens,

235
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,200
it is not only
Yan Fengshan who will come after you.

236
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,040
Even Tiemo assassins

237
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,880
will travel all the way
to Chang'an to kill you.

238
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,480
What Yan Fengshan wants to discuss
with the Tiemo people

239
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,440
is nothing more than persuading them
to send troops

240
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,680
to attack the Baiwenhu Army.

241
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,400
He plans to trade away northern territory,

242
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,800
right?

243
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,080
The north is Xiao Wuyang's fief.

244
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,320
It is difficult to conquer.

245
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,720
So why not give it to the Tiemo people

246
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,480
and let them burn it barren?

247
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,200
This scheme of Yan Fengshan
is not hard to guess.

248
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,280
As for my plan,

249
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,840
I only want the Tiemo envoy
to meet with me once

250
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,480
before he meets Yan Fengshan.

251
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,200
After that, he can return
wholly unscathed to Yan Fengshan's side.

252
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,800
You want to negotiate
with the Tiemo envoy?

253
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,120
Can you bear the cost?

254
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,560
Naturally I cannot.

255
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,400
But someone can.

256
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,200
SILK AND SATIN

257
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,080
CHANGXING WORKS

258
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,200
Chen Zhiying of the Huben Army
welcomes you here, Mr. Wuyin.

259
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,880
Sir.

260
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,080
I recognize her.

261
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,120
She is indeed from the Huben Army.

262
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,640
Thank you.

263
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,760
Given the hour, I should take my leave.

264
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,640
You?

265
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,600
Surprised?

266
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:59,520
A man who lays the plan
must step forward himself,

267
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,280
or else who would follow him in?

268
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,280
But I heard that you do not know
any martial arts.

269
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,160
I have a stubborn life.

270
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,320
I am not meant to die yet.

271
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,760
This street is not the same as usual.

272
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,960
Be extra cautious.

273
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,360
Be on guard.

274
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,120
It is fine. Genghui is here.
No petty villain can get close.

275
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,800
Sir. All is well.

276
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,720
Then I will send men
to deal with those ruffians.

277
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,240
Do not send too many.

278
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,440
It is clearly a ploy to lure us away.

279
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,880
You all.

280
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,880
Yes.

281
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,640
Mr. Wuyin is unharmed.
Bring out two horses.

282
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,240
Sir. The carriage is broken.
We should switch to horses.

283
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,800
Very well.

284
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,760
Let go of him.

285
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,520
Let go of him now.

286
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,560
If you do not want
your master to die, step aside.

287
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,000
Tell them to move aside.

288
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,360
- Stand down.
- Fall back.

289
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,000
Out of the way!

290
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,560
You are no ordinary servant.

291
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,920
As long as you cooperate,
I will not harm you in the slightest.

292
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,760
Young man, which way is the exit?

293
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,880
Are you Tiemo people?

294
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,880
The meteor iron from the altar
of Mount Shiluoman

295
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,520
obtained through ritual,
is worn only by Tiemo nobles.

296
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,880
Even if you changed into Han clothing,

297
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,080
the meteor iron on your chest
is far too obvious.

298
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,440
You know of Mount Shiluoman's altar.

299
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,640
Are you Tiemo people as well?

300
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,920
Lately Tiemo people are not very welcome
on the streets of Chang'an.

301
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,840
Explain as we walk.

302
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,640
Can you take me to Yankang Ward?

303
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,320
You will be well rewarded.

304
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,800
There are too many patrols at night.

305
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,240
I dare not escort a Tiemo noble
down the street.

306
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,840
Then take me in for the night.

307
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,840
Send me there at dawn.

308
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,120
Young man, just for one night.

309
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,440
I will not treat you poorly.

310
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,520
Chang'an is vast.

311
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,960
Why dwell in such a shabby alley?

312
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,960
For Tiemo people in Chang'an,
there are not many ways to make a living.

313
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:57,480
Most days we sell a few leather goods,
and that's barely enough to get by.

314
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,720
Times are unsettled now, so we moved here.

315
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,960
We are almost there. Come on.

316
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,280
<i>Heads means enjoying wealth and honor.</i>

317
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,760
<i>Tails means paying off the debt.</i>

318
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,600
I am Yang Chuhao of the Huben Army.

319
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,040
I greet you, Mr. Wuyin.

320
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,600
Do not fear, sir. You know me.

321
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,560
I know you are Yang Chuhao.

322
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,000
But you cannot appear out of nowhere.

323
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,920
Anyone would be frightened.

324
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,040
Who is he?

325
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,360
He is with the people
who tried to seize you just now.

326
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,280
A linked scheme.

327
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,880
I almost fell for it.

328
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,840
Sir, this place may not be safe.

329
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:08,800
I should escort you away first,
then send people to eliminate them.

330
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,840
It is fortunate you arrived in time.

331
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,800
To protect you well,
I would give my life without hesitation.

332
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,080
- Sir, please.
- Let us go.

333
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,080
What is this? Did you bring a blade?

334
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,720
No, no.

335
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,040
- Yang Chuhao.
- Come.

336
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,520
- Help me quickly.
- All right.

337
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,160
So heavy.

338
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,440
WARRANT

339
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,120
This…

340
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,360
All along the way
you kept telling me to be cautious.

341
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,120
Chang'an truly sits in turmoil.

342
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,400
Anyone who can set themselves
against the Huben Army… is him?

343
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,880
It looks like…

344
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,560
Yes, it must be him.

345
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,159
This man has been wanted
by the Huben Army for 15 years.

346
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,800
Mr. Wuyin, this time
you have made great merit.

347
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,440
Genghui.

348
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,960
Sir, this is…

349
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,120
Say no more. Give me the blade.

350
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:42,360
Since he is wanted by the Huben Army,
I shall claim this merit first.

351
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,880
Sir, wait.

352
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,760
Sir, he is Liu Ziwen's son.

353
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,480
He is remarkably gifted.

354
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,760
To kill him would be a waste.

355
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,520
Alive, he is far more useful to us.

356
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,240
General Fengshan still wants to see him.

357
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,440
Yan Fengshan bears deep hatred for him,
and has him wanted across the city.

358
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,000
Then take it as my gift to Yan Fengshan.

359
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,640
Come.

360
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,840
Sir, you were frightened.

361
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,920
The carriage is here.

362
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:18,520
I promise that from now on
you will not be disturbed again.

363
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,800
Please, sir.

364
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,880
- Carry him away.
- Yes.

365
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,600
Was this also part of the plan?

366
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,040
I do not know.

367
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:07,040
<i>When you read this letter,</i>
<i>I will likely already have been seized.</i>

368
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,400
<i>But do not worry.</i>

369
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,520
<i>The plan is still under control.</i>

370
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,320
<i>As for why I arranged this,</i>

371
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,120
<i>first, it is for my acquaintance</i>
<i>Yang Chuhao.</i>

372
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,000
<i>The old debt he bore is repaid.</i>

373
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,600
<i>He should not be implicated any further.</i>

374
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,720
<i>By using this plan,</i>

375
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,600
<i>I can win him some time</i>
<i>to break away from Yan Fengshan.</i>

376
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,960
<i>Second, it is because of Ye Zheng.</i>

377
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,640
<i>Your martial skills are strong,</i>
<i>but you lose your calm when you care.</i>

378
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,040
<i>If you knew the entire plan,</i>

379
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,440
<i>you would try to stop me.</i>

380
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,960
<i>Third,</i>

381
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,400
<i>when the Huben Army seizes me,</i>

382
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,320
<i>the secret I carry can hold</i>
<i>Yan Fengshan's attention for a while.</i>

383
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,240
<i>And that will be</i>
<i>our best chance to negotiate</i>

384
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,880
<i>with the Tiemo envoy.</i>

385
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,400
<i>The one going to negotiate</i>
<i>is already on the way.</i>

386
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,080
<i>This plan may be dangerous…</i>

387
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,320
SPRING WINDS RISE. THE SWALLOW RETURNS.
THUNDER STIRS. LIGHTNING BEGINS.

388
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,560
<i>…but it is exactly what I wished for.</i>

389
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,560
<i>To confront Yan Fengshan face to face is,</i>

390
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,520
<i>in all my life,</i>
<i>the meeting I have anticipated most.</i>
