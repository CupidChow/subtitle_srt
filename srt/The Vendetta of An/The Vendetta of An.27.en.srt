00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,980
[The Vendetta of An]

2
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,060
She can survive seven days

3
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,750
without food and water.

4
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,520
She's not an ordinary girl.

5
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,860
This woman is a shadow guard sent from Chang'an.

6
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,620
Before we discovered her identity,

7
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,510
she lied

8
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,990
and said she came to Tiemo as a merchant.

9
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,740
She has lived here alone for seven months.

10
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,970
A lot of information was sent back to Chang'an

11
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,690
through her.

12
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,370
These shadow guards have

13
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,740
a common name in Chang'an.

14
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,580
They are called the Huben Army.

15
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,810
Huben Army?

16
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:52,770
Yes.

17
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,860
There's a person called Liu Ziwen in Chang'an

18
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,150
who put them through systemic training

19
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,370
and sent these people

20
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,530
to Tiemo in secret.

21
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,060
Liu Ziwen

22
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,490
was just an administrative official.

23
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,650
Do you want to go to Chang'an?

24
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,020
Of course.

25
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,460
There's tea in Chang'an.

26
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,300
The information

27
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,300
obtained from this woman

28
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,860
has helped turn the tide of war.

29
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,460
I heard

30
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,530
the people on Mount Shiluoman's altar

31
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,090
wanted you to go further north.

32
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,090
Do you not want

33
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:30,970
this opportunity any more?

34
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,860
Does it matter if I want it or not?

35
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,970
Even if I become the king of Tiemo,

36
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,620
I can only live with everyone else

37
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,520
on this barren

38
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,810
and freezing land.

39
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,580
If we want to end Tiemo's suffering,

40
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,740
we must head south

41
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,340
and go to Chang'an.

42
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,460
I have an idea.

43
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,140
We can also do the same as Liu Ziwen.

44
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,180
We'll train a group of shadow guards

45
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,860
and send them to Chang'an.

46
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,580
We'll let them blend into every corner

47
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,770
of Chang'an.

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,130
It might take five years

49
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,780
or 30 years.

50
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,490
When Chang'an is at its weakest,

51
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,420
it'll be time when we, the Tiemo people,

52
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,010
come out of our suffering.

53
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,180
Not us.

54
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,540
Just you.

55
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,330
What?

56
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,490
Cen Pickles.

57
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,060
You're not going to Chang'an with me?

58
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,250
We shouldn't go together.

59
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,620
We shouldn't do the same thing.

60
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,690
Even if we meet

61
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,490
in Chang'an one day,

62
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,980
even if we are beside Liu Ziwen,

63
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,250
we shouldn't reunite with each other.

64
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,060
I think

65
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,130
doing that as a shadow guard

66
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,660
is the only way to deceive

67
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,810
Liu Ziwen, who is good at using shadow guards.

68
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,180
Only by deceiving Liu Ziwen,

69
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,930
can we deceive all our enemies.

70
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,450
That is

71
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,420
how we can achieve something great.

72
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,540
Yes. You are right.

73
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,960
You've gotten smarter.

74
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,940
Cen Pickles, you've become smarter.

75
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,660
Let me say one more thing.

76
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,630
You must not die

77
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,490
before we achieve a great cause.

78
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,060
All right?

79
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,370
If I die, I'm afraid

80
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,570
no one will help collect your dead body.

81
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,450
This is a good enough reason

82
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,570
for me to stay alive.

83
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:36,660
Sure.

84
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,860
We must both be alive.

85
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,250
See you in Chang'an.

86
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,340
[Episode 27]

87
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,620
Open his mouth

88
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,330
and see if he is hiding a small metal piece inside.

89
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:06,660
Yes.

90
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:09,490
Open!

91
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,690
Sir, there's nothing.

92
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,480
Do you find it fun

93
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,330
to humiliate me?

94
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,010
I'm not humiliating you.

95
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,330
Don't you know?

96
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,810
Xie Huai'an

97
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,740
will come and rescue you later.

98
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,620
Both of you have a strong bond.

99
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,540
He is afraid that you'd rather suicide

100
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,490
than let him risk his life to save you.

101
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,660
You can't die yet.

102
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,860
Is that not true?

103
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,650
- Move. - Move.

104
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,620
About the wonton stall...

105
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,450
I went there last night.

106
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,930
No one was there

107
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,330
and there were no traces of an ambush.

108
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:23,890
Right.

109
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,330
Xie Huai'an won't set up an ambush

110
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,010
at a place that has been exposed.

111
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,780
What will

112
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,180
he try to do this time?

113
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,490
Mister.

114
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,860
The street is empty.

115
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,100
No one is coming

116
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,330
to buy wine today.

117
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,220
Whether someone comes here or not

118
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,450
isn't important.

119
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,570
What's important for me

120
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,890
is sitting here.

121
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,860
A war is starting.

122
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,130
Mister,

123
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,860
why aren't you leaving?

124
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,890
I'm already seated here.

125
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,890
Where else can I go?

126
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,810
But if we lose

127
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,300
and Chang'an falls,

128
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,900
you will

129
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,540
also die.

130
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,420
The fall

131
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,180
of a city

132
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,210
and deaths are inevitable.

133
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,810
But Heaven

134
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,610
and Earth

135
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,060
won't change, right?

136
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,210
You're right.

137
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,660
Heaven and Earth won't change.

138
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,570
Then, I'll sit here.

139
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,900
All I have

140
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,540
is cheap wine.

141
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,610
I'm not buying wine today.

142
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,660
I'm only buying a bench.

143
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:33,900
A bench...

144
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,210
Please accept it.

145
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,990
Xie Huai'an.

146
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:49,930
Xie Huai'an!

147
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,810
Don't be foolish!

148
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,140
Xie Huai'an.

149
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,610
Run!

150
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,090
Run!

151
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:58,610
What are you doing?

152
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,490
Why did you come here alone?

153
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:01,040
Xie Huai'an,

154
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,900
are you listening?

155
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,690
Xie Huai'an!

156
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,930
Xie Huai'an.

157
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,090
What trick are you trying to pull?

158
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,690
Where are your strategies

159
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,140
and ambushes?

160
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,260
I'm the only one here.

161
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,210
Don't worry.

162
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,540
The King of Tiemo wants to get rid of me.

163
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,420
I'm at my wits' end.

164
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,180
Instead of resisting,

165
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,540
I chose to bid farewell

166
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,690
to my friend

167
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,140
before I die.

168
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,730
When this is over,

169
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,690
I

170
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,610
leave myself at Tiemo's mercy.

171
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,450
This place is secure.

172
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,450
Even if I meet my pageboy here,

173
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,330
we won't be able to escape.

174
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,020
It's a small wish from someone who is about to die.

175
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,540
I hope you'll allow it.

176
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,200
You resisted us alone for so long

177
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,300
and finally surrendered.

178
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,850
I will fulfill the wish

179
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,450
of a dying person.

180
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:32,730
Let him out.

181
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,060
You've suffered.

182
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,930
Why?

183
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,300
Why didn't you listen to me?

184
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:48,780
Why did you come?

185
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,500
I know

186
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,060
I can't save you at this moment.

187
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,660
But I have something to tell you

188
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,930
so I wait for you here.

189
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,360
But if you do this, you'll...

190
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,570
I have to

191
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,930
meet the King of Tiemo sooner or later.

192
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,810
This is my destiny.

193
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,140
Xie Huai'an,

194
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,020
are you trying to give your life away?

195
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,730
What will I do if you die?

196
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,730
What about Ye Zheng?

197
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,970
What about Xiaoqing?

198
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,300
Even if you don't care about us,

199
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,810
what about Bai Wan?

200
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,840
When she was alive,

201
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,910
she wanted you

202
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,420
to stay alive.

203
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,730
People die and return to the soil.

204
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,420
We can't go to another world.

205
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,970
It's also impossible

206
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,380
to meet our family members who died.

207
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,850
Staying alive

208
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,570
is the only way to remember them.

209
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,540
I came here today

210
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:35,260
to bid farewell to you.

211
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,720
But if you do this,

212
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,780
you will really die.

213
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:47,970
Don't worry.

214
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,180
I guarantee

215
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,300
we'll surely meet again.

216
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,500
However, this is important.

217
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,680
I believe

218
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,330
you will surely

219
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,140
get this done.

220
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:12,900
Go.

221
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:38,220
[Qingyun Pavilion]

222
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:45,780
I used to say

223
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,180
that I'm the only one who can keep you alive.

224
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,380
I gave you Mo's face

225
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,990
and make you a pageboy to protect you.

226
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,300
You might not have what it takes to be an emperor,

227
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,300
but you know the suffering of the people.

228
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,930
After the war is over,

229
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:06,570
if you are willing to leave your past behind

230
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,330
and stay in the imperial court,

231
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,020
it will be a blessing to the world.

232
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,780
If that day does come,

233
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,220
will you still be by my side?

234
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,100
I will.

235
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,110
When that day arrives,

236
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:30,840
I will be your pageboy.

237
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,650
You look calm.

238
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,020
You don't look like you're here to die.

239
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,260
Where I die

240
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,700
isn't important.

241
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,810
I only know

242
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,850
that the person who shares my goal

243
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,570
is already in front of the King of Tiemo.

244
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:35,810
Free him.

245
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,260
This way, please.

246
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,130
He's here.

247
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:33,810
I'm cooking the lamb.

248
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,610
It seems like I came at the right time.

249
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,810
However, there's not enough firewood.

250
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,130
Let me do it.

251
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,780
How long has it been since this stove was last used?

252
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,740
The stove is too wet.

253
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,940
I don't know.

254
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,090
It might be an unusable stove.

255
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,890
Young man, you are still too inexperienced.

256
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,890
The stove is too wet.

257
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,460
Books burn quicker.

258
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,330
I want to burn books, too.

259
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,130
Are you willing to...

260
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,980
I would never do it back then.

261
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,460
Now, both of you

262
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,330
are here.

263
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,060
Burn it.

264
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,650
What a good book.

265
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,500
I'm burning it.

266
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,330
White Hair.

267
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,500
You want me dead so badly.

268
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,850
If I'm dead,

269
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,800
do you still have somewhere to go?

270
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,650
I hid in Huainan

271
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,460
for seven years.

272
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,570
I had a job

273
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,260
at a remote place.

274
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,370
It was relaxing.

275
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:40,550
I used to help the people

276
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,020
go down the field,

277
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,610
plant paddy,

278
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,740
and harvest the grains.

279
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,370
Now that I think about it,

280
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,780
I actually miss the place.

281
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,810
It certainly sounds like a prosperous place.

282
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,090
No.

283
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,130
Huainan isn't a prosperous place.

284
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,410
If it suffers from a natural disaster,

285
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,500
people will still starve to death.

286
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,300
There were despicable magistrates

287
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,330
who wouldn't spare food from the official granary.

288
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,060
I broke open granaries once

289
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,460
and was imprisoned.

290
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,090
And if I die,

291
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,090
do you have somewhere to go?

292
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,090
I don't.

293
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,260
I can no longer return

294
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,780
to where I've been before.

295
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,570
I

296
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:57,220
was a slave when I was young.

297
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:00,650
My father also grew up as a slave.

298
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,740
In the noble families of Tiemo,

299
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,060
slaves

300
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,440
use themselves as bait

301
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,850
to lure out the wolves and kill them.

302
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,300
Then,

303
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,020
the sheep in the pen can survive.

304
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:17,940
Because of that,

305
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,020
they don't care no matter how many slaves they sacrifice.

306
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,460
In the end,

307
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,460
I retrieved my father's limbs

308
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,330
in the mouth of a wolf.

309
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,610
I still remember

310
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,610
the feeling of hunger back then.

311
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,610
But even if

312
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,090
your father is dead,

313
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,060
your master still won't

314
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,780
give you a full meal.

315
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,020
Later,

316
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,300
more slaves followed me.

317
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,700
I only wanted to capture a town

318
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,020
but the feeling of hunger

319
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,330
still followed me.

320
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,370
Later,

321
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,540
after that,

322
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,850
I want to dominate the world.

323
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,650
Today is a farewell.

324
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,260
One will only

325
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,610
say some sincere words during a farewell.

326
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:32,810
Speaking of which,

327
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,500
how White Hair

328
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,500
broke open a granary in Huainan

329
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,260
resembled what we did when we were young.

330
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,500
Yes.

331
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,410
10 years ago?

332
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,260
20 years ago?

333
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,170
No.

334
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,410
It was 40 years ago.

335
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,090
There are so many sheep

336
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,410
but they still force us to kill and eat wolves.

337
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:22,620
Wolf meat is sour.

338
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,840
Since we will die one way or another,

339
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,020
let's have a feast for now.

340
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,850
Must we die?

341
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,020
Do you have a way?

342
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,650
Those who kill for the nobles

343
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:36,940
are also slaves.

344
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,060
If they come after us,

345
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,300
I will tell them

346
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,500
what we did.

347
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,740
I'm going to ask them

348
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,020
why nobles can kill slaves without any punishment

349
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,020
but when a slave kills a noble,

350
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,610
they will be punished.

351
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,370
I also want to ask them

352
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,500
why can't we be the nobles

353
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,230
and let them be the slaves.

354
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,080
- Yes! - Yes!

355
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,020
Exactly.

356
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,790
We can also become nobles.

357
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:58,650
Exactly.

358
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:02,170
We can become someone who kills sheep without feeling sorry.

359
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,410
We can kill another person without being punished.

360
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:12,540
Are you scared?

361
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,220
No.

362
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:17,020
It has nothing to do with what you said.

363
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,460
I didn't expect

364
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,220
the meat to be so fatty.

365
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,370
I wish I had some pickles

366
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,980
to cut out the greasiness.

367
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,010
Look at you.

368
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:28,700
- You're such a good-for-nothing. - Do you hear yourself?

369
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,370
You sound so lame.

370
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,500
After both of us came to Chang'an,

371
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,460
we had not reunited with each other for more than two decades.

372
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,700
Just in case we encounter

373
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,500
a highly-intelligent enemy.

374
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,260
Today,

375
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,060
you get to see the result.

376
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,330
My dear teacher,

377
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,260
your move

378
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,220
is impressive.

379
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:28,810
White Hair,

380
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,370
tell me.

381
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,940
What is your purpose in life?

382
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,540
If you are just doing it

383
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,890
for the fleeting memories,

384
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,650
it's only natural for you to lose to me.

385
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,780
You

386
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,980
want to dominate the world.

387
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,540
Isn't it because

388
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,300
you want to become

389
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,810
the slave masters

390
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:08,220
you killed back then?

391
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:14,330
You grow in the spring and harvest in the autumn.

392
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,460
Life and death are irreversible.

393
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,220
But the cycle of power struggles continues endlessly.

394
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,130
As for you,

395
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,330
if you want to become a slave master,

396
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,370
you won't have a place to go.

397
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,300
You're wrong.

398
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,980
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.

399
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,370
Today,

400
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,260
I win.

401
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:19,700
Let's go.

402
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,060
Don't you want to see him take his last breath?

403
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,980
He is White Hair.

404
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:31,780
Right.

405
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,500
He is White Hair.

406
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,460
His life has been full of hardship.

407
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:39,980
So,

408
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,300
he should die in this desolate place

409
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,610
with no one around him.

410
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,500
No friends,

411
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,370
not even his enemies,

412
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,810
will witness his end.

413
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,740
Hold on.

414
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,370
I must bring back these lamb chops.

415
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,810
I'll give them to my neighbors.

416
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,020
This is enough for them to have a feast tonight.

417
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,220
You have nowhere to go

418
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:07,090
but I do.

419
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:10,460

Why?

454
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,540
Stop pretending.

455
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,420
If I had

456
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,300
killed White Hair a moment later inside,

457
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,010
you would've killed me.

458
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,740
White Hair

459
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,820
is more dangerous than Xiao Wuyang and Yan Fengshan.

460
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,820
He must die.

461
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,340
Because of that, I can kill anyone

462
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,740
who stops me from killing him.

463
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,090
After the Liu family was wiped out,

464
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,820
you went missing for 15 years.

465
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,830
I had no choice but to be cautious of you.

466
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,460
I'm sure this is reasonable.

467
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:31,500
Cen Pickles.

468
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,170
You made up stories about your neighbors

469
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,590
and even removed

470
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,020
and drained the lamb

471
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,860
to stall time.

472
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,860
You wanted to prove

473
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,730
that you didn't feel sorry for White Hair.

474
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,460
That was too pretentious.

475
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:55,000
I did it because I couldn't trust you completely.

476
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,380
Luckily, I did it.

477
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,110
He is just

478
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,240
the son of an acquaintance

479
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:03,730
and the son of an enemy.

480
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:04,940
An unparalleled genius.

481
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,300
For your ambition,

482
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,460
he should die.

483
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,250
It's the ambition of the Tiemo people.

484
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,500
I didn't make up stories about my neighbors.

485
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,980
I really want to bring the lamb back.

486
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,250
Those who are lazy

487
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,420
will usually

488
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,570
leech for free food at my place.

489
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,970
I even gave them nicknames.

490
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,170
There's Gulouzi

491
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,940
and Gourd Chicken.

492
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,570
In this world,

493
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,650
we need some bad friends.

494
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,250
White Hair is dead inside.

495
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,980
I need to bring back the lamb.

496
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,130
After tonight,

497
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,420
Chang'an will belong to you.

498
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,940
Tomorrow,

499
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,980
I'll bring some Huoshan Huangya tea.

500
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:33,650
What do you think?

501
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,170
Sure.

502
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,170
As for you,

503
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,690
if you want to become a slave master,

504
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,860
you won't have a place to go.

505
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:06,130
You have nowhere to go but I do.

506
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:58,250
He's completely dead?

507
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,210
Yes.

508
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,690
You got your wish.

509
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:03,530
Drink tea and kill people.

510
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:06,090
Just like the person we admired.

511
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,860
Why did you come back?

512
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,340
Our most worthy enemy is dead.

513
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,940
I'm worried that you might feel lonely.

514
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:16,170
Why not come with me?

515
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,690
There's lamb,

516
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:23,980
pickles,

517
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:25,860
and premium tea.

518
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,420
It's much better than this place of yours.

519
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,860
You can't even light the stove here.

520
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,300
Huoshan Huangya tea?

521
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,090
Your residence

522
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,800
is just as I imagined.

523
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:43,380
It's not that quiet.

524
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,690
The prison is quiet

525
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:46,820
but I can't stay there.

526
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:51,730
If you don't mind,

527
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:53,690
come and chat with me often.

528
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:55,020
However,

529
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:57,090
you must first help me dry the pickles.

530
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:00,060
Sure thing.

531
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,650
Two children of slaves

532
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:05,730
who weren't eaten by wolves

533
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,250
experienced a chaotic period.

534
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:10,900
We met each other

535
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,020
after hiding for more than a decade.

536
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,210
We should spend days catching up.

537
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,130
We were just two children of slaves.

538
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,380
Neither of us would expect

539
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,290
that one day, we could live in Chang'an

540
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:26,210
and decide the fate of this city.

541
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:27,940
I expected it.

542
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:32,250
I've expected it since the day

543
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,210
we picked up the blade.

544
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,210
After so many years,

545
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:47,290
you have gotten old.

546
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,820
You are one to talk.

547
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:54,340
We should be old.

548
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,690
If we are not,

549
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,130
we will become demons.

550
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:01,420
Do you know?

551
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:04,170
When I dream at night,

552
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:06,570
I usually see us when we were young

553
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:09,340
with sheep in the grasslands

554
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:10,900
and wolves.

555
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,340
They look at me, baring their white fangs.

556
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,130
I always wake up

557
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,210
in cold sweats.

558
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,200
Cen Pickles!

559
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,170
Cen Pickles!

560
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:25,940
You're so rude.

561
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:27,090
Call me Grandpa.

562
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,210
Cen Pickles!

563
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:29,380
Your house has been robbed.

564
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:30,210
What?

565
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:31,650
Gulouzi and the rest

566
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:34,020
took all your pickles and meat.

567
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,570
They said a war was coming

568
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:36,340
and wanted to prevent food shortages.

569
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:49,250
My house was robbed. Forgive me for not hosting you.

570
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:52,090
Where did they take my food?

571
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:54,170
The granary over there!

572
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,420
Are you going to beat them up?

573
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:58,900
Yes!

574
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:00,340
I'll beat them up badly!

575
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:01,610
Bring me along!

576
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:13,280
Don't kill them.

577
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,940
We just need to teach them a lesson.

578
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:16,290
Just teach them a lesson.

579
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:18,380
Cen Pickles.

580
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:19,910
You are old.

581
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,020
You might lose.

582
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:22,650
Let me lead the charge.

583
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:23,860
I promise not to kill them.

584
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:16,290
I have a big family and business.

585
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:18,500
I must bring back these lamb chops.

586
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,730
I'll give them to my neighbors.

587
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,090
This is enough for them to have a feast tonight.

588
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,540
Those who are lazy

589
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,170
will usually

590
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:29,090
leech for free food at my place.

591
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:30,680
I even gave them nicknames.

592
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:33,070
There's Gulouzi

593
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:35,860
and Gourd Chicken.

594
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:37,690
In this world,

595
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:39,730
we need some bad friends.

596
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,730
Why did you give your neighbors

597
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,570
the names of our dead friends as their nicknames?

598
00:46:57,830 --> 00:46:59,730
I remember what White Hair said to me.

599
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:02,970
He could kill Yan Fengshan

600
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,250
because he believes

601
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:09,130
he is someone who lives in a lie.

602
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,460
His younger sister is dead

603
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:14,860
but he can see his younger sister's spirit.

604
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:18,570
All humans have a fatal weak spot.

605
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:20,650
So, he came up with the idea

606
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:23,860
of disguising an assassin as Yan Fengshan's adopted son

607
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:26,540
to fake his son's revival

608
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:31,170
and kill Yan Fengshan when he is

609
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:32,770
at his most vulnerable.

610
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:36,420
Killing someone by using their fatal weak spot.

611
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:39,690
How exquisite.

612
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:43,290
Yan Fengshan stood no chance.

613
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,500
So do I.

614
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,570
Gulouzi

615
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:49,980
and Gourd Chicken

616
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:51,770
were dead.

617
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:53,340
They have been dead for decades.

618
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:56,690
I gave my neighbors these nicknames

619
00:47:58,840 --> 00:47:59,900
to lie to myself.

620
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,460
You are lying to me.

621
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,770
White Hair told me

622
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,540
you'd never trust me.

623
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:09,730
The only way to solve this

624
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,770
is to use his life

625
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:13,020
as a lure.

626
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:16,380
I've known you for more than 40 years.

627
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,610
I've always seen you as a friend.

628
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,380
We are friends but we are not walking the same path.

629
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,410
You killed, too!

630
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:25,460
I killed

631
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,340
so more people can live.

632
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,500
You killed

633
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,770
because you want to become

634
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,420
the slave masters we killed.

635
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,250
War ravaged Chang'an

636
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:36,060
and dead bodies are everywhere.

637
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:37,770
This isn't what I want.

638
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:41,090
Cen Pickles!

639
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,610
If I die,

640
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:45,770
do you still

641
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:49,500
have anywhere to go?

642
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:38,860
White Hair sacrificed himself

643
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:41,020
to achieve your goal.

644
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,380
Who are you?

645
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:54,170
When do we act?

646
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:55,860
What is the signal?

647
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:57,020
Tomorrow

648
00:49:58,150 --> 00:49:59,060
at the hour of Shen.
