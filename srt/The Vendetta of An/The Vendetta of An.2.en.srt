00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,200
<i>Huainan is good</i>

2
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,760
<i>A safe haven</i>

3
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,400
<i>The mountains and rivers</i>
<i>Stretch on like our affection</i>

4
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,280
<i>An affectionate person…</i>

5
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,960
Huainan is indeed a fine place,

6
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,280
but we are no longer there.

7
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,000
Huai'an truly thinks ten steps ahead.

8
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,360
He even predicted
matters of life and death in his letter.

9
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,400
<i>You are too gentle by nature.</i>

10
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,720
<i>You are the one I worry about most.</i>

11
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,040
If you face something

12
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,520
you cannot overcome one day,

13
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,640
open this letter.

14
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,480
<i>Zhou Mo joined the Huben Army</i>

15
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,120
<i>and fell under their yoke.</i>

16
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,280
<i>Only death could free him.</i>

17
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,040
<i>Killing him was to save him.</i>

18
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,680
If I make it to the Capital alive,

19
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,000
they will hunt you
to the ends of the Earth.

20
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,960
Only by dying once

21
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,520
can you truly be free.

22
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,160
ZHOU MO JOINED THE HUBEN ARMY
AND FELL UNDER THEIR YOKE.

23
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,920
ONLY DEATH COULD FREE HIM.
KILLING HIM WAS TO SAVE HIM.

24
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,880
No, we are no longer in Huainan.

25
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,840
He should be in Chang'an by now.

26
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,080
The dangers of Chang'an
far surpass Huainan's.

27
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,440
I hope he stays safe.

28
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,720
He will.

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,960
<i>I wake from wine</i>
<i>To Hu-horses trampling the land</i>

38
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,040
<i>The loyal dead would never</i>
<i>Stain their bones with rebel fire</i>

39
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:04,760
<i>Yet traitors crave</i>
<i>The splendor of the August hall</i>

40
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,480
<i>Half a life I spent on these texts</i>
<i>For whom were they written?</i>

41
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,120
<i>For whom, I ask?</i>

42
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:27,000
<i>Let this long lament burn</i>
<i>As an offering unto the mountain spirits</i>

43
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:36,120

‪SCHOLARS' HALL

45
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,200
Sir!

46
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,480
Sir…

47
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,240
Sir?

48
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,080
Sir…

49
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,120
Why are you guarding this traitor?

50
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,600
I was his student.

51
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,880
Now that he lies dead on the street,

52
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,560
please let me keep vigil

53
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,600
until the Jingzhao Yamen
comes to claim his body.

54
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,640
He was a traitor.

55
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,240
We of the Imperial Guards will take him.

56
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,080
You call yourself his student.

57
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,120
Are you a traitor too?

58
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,800
Sir, this has nothing to do with us.

59
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,560
Please proceed.

60
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,000
It has nothing to do with you indeed.

61
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,880
- Take her!
- Stop.

62
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,000
In this bitter snow,

63
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,400
she is willing to keep vigil
over this old man's body.

64
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,560
It is a righteous deed,

65
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,360
yet you call her a traitor?

66
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,520
Have you any proof?

67
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,120
I cannot stand scholars.

68
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,280
Are you seeking
to light your own path to the grave?

69
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,600
You all heard him.

70
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,240
He tried to defend this traitor.

71
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,720
Take him too!

72
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,680
Hold!

73
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,840
Who dares bar the Imperial Guards?

74
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,920
Academician Li, what brings you here?

75
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,360
You Imperial Guards are bold indeed,

76
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,880
blocking anyone as you please.

77
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,400
Greetings to you, Mr. Huai'an.

78
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,000
Greetings, Academician Li.

79
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,960
His Majesty awaits you in the palace.

80
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,440
Please get in.

81
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,640
"Studying by the cold window, I never
sensed how brief the seasons were."

82
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,600
"In a blink, my temples
have turned to gray frost."

83
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,120
"Schemes for the realm are but a dream."

84
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,200

85
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,320
"The loyal dead would never

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,800
"Half a life I spent on these texts.
For whom were they written?"

88
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,240
"Let this long lament burn
as an offering unto the mountain spirits."

89
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,760
You called me a traitor

90
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,880
without a shred of proof.

91
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,600
I recited a seditious poem just now.

92
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,920
That, at least, is some proof.

93
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,960
Can you confirm that I am a traitor now?

94
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,880
You are silent.

95
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,040
Does that mean I am not one?

96
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,720
If we've come to a point where words alone

97
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,520
can convict someone of treason,

98
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,760
then heed my words:

99
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,640
you are a traitor.

100
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,280
You are a traitor.

101
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,640
A traitor!

102
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,080
Mr. Huai'an,

103
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,600
don't take his words to heart.

104
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,600
- Academician Li, I have one small request.
- Of course.

105
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,120
Please leave them be.

106
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,800
Very well.

107
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,880
Be gone!

108
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,280
I shall take my leave.

109
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,360
Let us go!

110
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,880
This way, please.

111
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,960
ORCHID PAVILION

112
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,440
Take this to shelter him

113
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,360
from the wind and snow.

114
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,560
Thank you.

115
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,280
<i>Wan, there is something I must tell you.</i>

116
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,480
That article slandering the new emperor

117
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,200
was written by me.

118
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,360
I work for the Huben Army.

119
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,400
My rise to this post

120
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,960
was propped up by them.

121
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,080
Everything I did

122
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,840
was at their command.

123
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,080
Now, I must let this frail body of mine
fulfill its final purpose

124
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,800
so that they will keep my family safe.

125
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,160
The Huben Army

126
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,520
once asked me about you.

127
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,160
After I die,

128
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,880
they will come for you.

129
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,520
I can only give you one last warning:

130
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,320
never defy the Huben Army.

131
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,120
You still hope to see
your family again, don't you?

132
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,560
Then do whatever it takes

133
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,320
to survive.

134
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,960
Sir…

135
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,040
Do not grieve for me.

136
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,920
Everyone

137
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,800
must walk the road fate has set for them.

138
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,360
Rest now,

139
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,840
Wan.

140
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:56,720
This may be your last peaceful sleep.

141
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,320
Tonight,

142
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,920
I will take my life at the city gate

143
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,920
<i>as an old minister of the former court</i>

144
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,960

<i>Yan Fengshan commands the Huben Army</i>

146
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,280

00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,880
<i>Xiao Wuyang seized Chang'an</i>

00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,400
<i>to keep imperial power from slipping away.</i>

<i>Though the Huben Army</i>
<i>has avoided meeting him head-on,</i>

150
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,440
<i>Yan Fengshan still intends</i>
<i>to set Chang'an aflame</i>

151
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,560
<i>and grant Xiao Wuyang no peace.</i>

152
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:44,600
<i>And I am a piece of wood</i>
<i>they need for that fire.</i>

‪HOUSE OF WESTERN CURIOSITIES

154
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,320
Academician Li.

155
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,040
I hope you do not mind

156
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,400
that I used your hand to slap

157
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,720
the Imperial Guards in the face.

158
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,800
Not at all.

159
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,000
They deserved it.

160
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,560
I meant to humble that commander.

161
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,320
Even if you hadn't been there, sir,

162
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,880
I would have simply found another way

163
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,640
to shame him another day.

164
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,160
That is how I handle matters.

165
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,840
Assassins!

166
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,920
Protect His Majesty!

167
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,320
Quick, protect His Majesty!

168
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,480
- Understood!
- Understood!

169
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,680
Assassins!

170
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,800
Assassins! Protect His Majesty!

171
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,520
The realm is still unsettled.

172
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,760
It's been but a month
since His Majesty took the throne,

173
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,960
and already a dozen assassination attempts
have been made.

174
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,200
No need to panic, though.

175
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,120
Under the Dingtang Sword,

176
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,160
all who come lose their heads.

177
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,600
Your servant, Xie Huai'an,

178
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,000
greets Your Majesty.

179
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,120
Lift your head.

180
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,400
I asked many people

181
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,240
who could seek someone for me
in this vast world.

182
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,200
They all recommended you,

183
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,040
so I wished to see for myself

184
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,640
whether you were equal to the task.

185
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,600
These ten essays were all written
for the imperial examination

186
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,040
in the 11th year of the dynasty.

187
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,120
One of them was written by me.

188
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,680
Find it.

189
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,000
As you command.

190
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,680
WISDOM AND DEPTH

191
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,200
ZHU XIAOCHUN, VICE MINISTER OF RITES
AND KEEPER OF IMPERIAL SEALS

192
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,240
BENEVOLENT RULE

193
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,760
HE UNITED THE LORDS AND STEADIED
THE REALM, RISING AS THE FOREMOST HEGEMON

194
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,440
THE FORCEFUL RULE
AND THE BENEVOLENT RULE

195
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,360
Your Majesty, I have found your essay.

196
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,680
It's only been half a stick of incense.

197
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,560
Even if you read ten lines at a glance,

198
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,800
you could only have finished
three or four essays.

199
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,680
How did you manage it?

200
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,280
Southerners and northerners differ.

201
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,520
Their wording and phrasing leave traces.

202
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,120
Before Your Majesty turned 20,
you lived long in Chang'an.

203
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,240
Your early studies

204
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,520
were under Grand Secretary Bai Linian,

205
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,600
who was from Wuyue.

206
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,920
Therefore, Your Majesty's writing
shows southern traits.

207
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,200
Southerners write "lu" as "six,"

208
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,800
"qi" as "stand," and "bei" as "cover."

209
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,440
Northerners write "chen" as "ugly,"

210
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,640
"geng" as "road," and "tong" as "reach."

211
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,600
By this measure,

212
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,960
seven of the essays
were written by northerners,

213
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,280
and only three by southerners.

214
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,520
Everyone has words and phrases
they tend to repeat.

215
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,280
"In troubled times,

216
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,880
hearts are easily disturbed,

217
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,240
so virtue alone cannot calm them."

218
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,920
I once saw this line in a court memorial.

219
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,560
That's how I knew.

220
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,320
How could a mere registrar

221
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,360
have access to memorials?

222
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,360
The Memorials Office
keeps expired memorials.

223
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,400
They say they are burned
after three months,

224
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,160
but royal writings

225
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,000
are cherished among the people,

226
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,600
so some were secretly sold.

227
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,080
I also bought some myself.

228
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,200
This level of wit

229
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,680
is not enough for this mission.

230
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,320
You would do well

231
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,640
to give me more surprises.

232
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,200
More surprises, Your Majesty?

233
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,800
I know I wasn't the only one
commanded to enter the Capital.

234
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,200
Nor was I the first to find

235
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,080
Your Majesty's essay.

236
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,000
The first to do so

237
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,760
is dead now.

238
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,960
In the assassination just now,

239
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,800
the assassins numbered two,

240
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,640
yet Your Majesty

241
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,960
killed three men.

242
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,600
Your Majesty, whom do you seek?

243
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,120
Yan Fengshan of the Huben Army

244
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,840
and Xiao Wenjing, the deposed emperor.

245
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,600
I want both their bodies

246
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,240
brought before me.

247
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,560
I will find the deposed emperor,

248
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,000
but Yan Fengshan

249
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,880
is mine.

250
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,240
How dare you haggle with me?

251
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,040
I have wanted to kill him

252
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,720
for 15 years.

253
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,320
Stand at attention!

254
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,040
If anyone sees you like this,

255
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,280
what will they think?

256
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,160
Your Majesty, do you care for this realm?

257
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,440
If I did not, why seize it?

258
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,840
And do you care for the throne?

259
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,240
Even if I don't,

260
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,920
it is not for Yan Fengshan to touch.

261
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,960
The deposed emperor is weak-willed.

262
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,520
Yan Fengshan controlled the court
for years.

263
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:23,400
He was long known
as Emperor Yan among the people.

264
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,200
Now that Your Majesty
has reclaimed Chang'an,

265
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,080
he will not yield easily.

266
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,560
He abducted your brother.

267
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,800
He will strike back.

268
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,440
Kill Yan Fengshan,

269
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,880
and his head is yours.

270
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,520
If you fail,

271
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,440
your head is mine.

272
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,240
My thanks, Your Majesty.

273
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,800
In my memory, whenever Your Majesty

274
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,000
has something on your mind,

275
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,840
you always take out that flute.

276
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,480
You have just ascended the throne,

277
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,720
yet you look burdened.

278
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,680
It seems this throne

279
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,000
matters little to Your Majesty after all.

280
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:48,960
Sir.

281
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,080
Sir, please get in the carriage.

282
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,560
It is bitterly cold tonight.

283
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,240
Allow us to escort you
from the Palace City.

284
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,360
No need for a carriage.

285
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,920
But I'd like to trouble you
to walk with me.

286
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,480
I prefer to go on foot.

287
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,080
Academician Li,

288
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,960
don't you wish to know
why His Majesty summoned me?

289
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,880
That is not for me to ask.

290
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,880
Whatever His Majesty commands, we obey.

291
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,360
We must not inquire.

292
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,160
The deposed emperor was taken
by Yan Fengshan.

293
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,440
His Majesty wishes to…

294
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,920
Have mercy!

295
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,320
You said nothing.

296
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,000
I heard nothing.

297
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,840
Have mercy, I beg you.

298
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,200
I just checked the palace registry.

299
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,120
Among all Imperial Academy scholars

300
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,120
permitted to enter the Inner Court,

301
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,760
there is no academician named Li.

302
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,960
Chancellor Gao,

303
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,840
we have exchanged messages

304
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,240
for some time now.

305
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,800
We finally met today.

306
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,440
How long do you intend
to maintain this act?

307
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,560
Your wit borders on the uncanny.

308
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,880
Take care, or you will not live long.

309
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,080
Xie Huai'an greets Chancellor Gao.

310
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,120
GAO YAN

311
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,760
Where… where did I give myself away?

312
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,640
Chancellor Gao, you did not.

313
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,040
It is simply that
I am too cautious by nature.

314
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,560
I do not overlook
a single word or sentence.

315
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,000
No need to panic, though.

316
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,480
Under the Dingtang Sword,

317
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,160
all who come lose their heads.

318
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,440
"Under the Dingtang Sword,

319
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,760
all who come lose their heads."

320
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,160
Were you a mere academician
of the Imperial Academy,

321
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,960
how could you have shown such pride

322
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,760
when faced with assassins?

323
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,560
The Marquis of Northguard, Gu Yu,
recommended the famed Han Ziling,

324
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,240
while I recommended you.

325
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,960
It seems my judgment was sound.

326
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,040
Han Ziling only writes fine prose.

327
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:44,000
He is not likely to survive
the Dingtang Sword.

328
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,240
You have accepted His Majesty's mission.

329
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,080
How am I to assist you?

330
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,840
Chancellor Gao,

331
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,120
haven't you already done so?

332
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,160
How so?

333
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,920
Since there is no Academician Li,

334
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,160
why did that commander

335
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,560
address you as such?

336
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,400
Academician Li.

337
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,840
He is your man, isn't he?

338
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,360
If ever I require aid,

339
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,240
I will seek him out.

340
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,720
To find such an uncut piece of jade

341
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,080
in this freezing night

342
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,400
is worth the cold.

343
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,800
Han Ziling is already
one of the brightest minds in the realm,

344
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,160
yet His Majesty chose this Xie Huai'an.

345
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,720
His days are numbered.

346
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,280
We shall see.

347
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,040
After all,

348
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,360
he was chosen by Chancellor Gao,

349
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,720
and Chancellor Gao
has never misjudged a man.

350
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,120
BUDDHA TEMPLE

351
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,640
<i>Wan, when you wake,</i>

352
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,680
<i>go to the ruined temple east of the city.</i>

353
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,040
<i>Light the candle before the Buddha statue,</i>

354
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:28,200
<i>and a Huben guard will appear.</i>

355
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,440
This temple

356
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,480
was ruined by war
and fell into this state.

357
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,480
QINGYI OF THE HUBEN ARMY

358
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,000
It used to be crowded with worshippers.

359
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,680
Those who came here

360
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,720
all said it was blessed.

361
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,760
You may as well make a wish.

362
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,440
Yang Xuan is dead.

363
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,120
You were his student.

364
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,680
Pray to the Bodhisattva and the underworld

365
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,600
that he may suffer less pain over there.

366
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,040
You have a fiery temper.

367
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,840
But it is useless,

368
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,360
at least before a Huben guard.

369
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,040
You have never taken a life, have you?

370
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,240
If not,

371
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,440
there is no need to draw the dagger
in your sleeve.

372
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,400
It cannot harm me.

373
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,080
You knew the Huben Army
would come for you,

374
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,160
yet you still came as you were told.

375
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:05,200
Had you used this chance to flee,
wouldn't that have been better?

376
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,440
Chang'an is full of Huben shadow guards.

377
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,600
I'd be caught before reaching
the city gate.

378
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,720
Rather than make a fool of myself,

379
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,200
I'd sooner

380
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,400
vent my anger before I die.

381
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,120
I never intended to kill you.

382
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,720
Yang Xuan was the Vice Minister
of Revenue, a third-rank official.

383
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,800
His death means something
to the Huben Army.

384
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,280
As for you, you are but a lowly painter.

385
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,160
Even if you die in a roadside ditch,

386
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,760
who will truly care?

387
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,200
Anyway, I invited you here for a purpose.

388
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,960
You have no value,

389
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,720
but the one

390
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,920
who corresponded with you does.

391
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,560
I want you to tell me

392
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,240
how you first met him.

393
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,840
We met by chance.

394
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,800
I cannot help you.

395
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,400
No matter.

396
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,400
Met by chance, did you?

397
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,520
I still have patience enough.

398
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,000
I know you work at the Painting Academy.

399
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,280
And I also know

400
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,480
there is a Mr. Yu there
who treats you well.

401
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,320
I give you two hours.

402
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,960
If you still say the same after two hours,

403
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,000
the hands of the Huben Army

404
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,560
will reach for Mr. Yu.

405
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,680
This silver needle…

406
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,800
What a clumsy trick.

407
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,920
You have a long way to go.

408
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,200
Someone, open the door!

409
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,640
- Miss Bai Wan?
- Is Mr. Yu here?

410
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,640
Master was about to rest.

411
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,520
- Miss Bai Wan, why--
- I must speak with him.

412
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,840
A life is at stake. Forgive my intrusion.

413
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,520
Miss Bai Wan!

414
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,240
Mr. Yu, forgive me
for disturbing you so late,

415
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,320
but I must speak with you.

416
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,200
MR. YU, CHIEF PAINTER
OF THE PAINTING ACADEMY

417
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,560
Why did you come?

418
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,760
Why did you come?

419
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,760
If I hadn't,

420
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,920
would you have…?

421
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,760
The Huben guards said

422
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,920
that if you came tonight,

423
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,639
I would have to die.

424
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,280
Why did you come?

425
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,520
When the Huben Army gives an order,

426
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,719
you follow it.

427
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,560
Why resist?

428
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,440
- Sir!
- Come no closer!

429
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,280
I accept my fate.

430
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,240
Mr. Qingyi
asked me to bring you a message.

431
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,000
He said that before the Huben Army,

432
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,280
one could only obey.

433
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,920
Mr. Yu's death

434
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,840
is the price of your defiance.

435
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,920
Greetings, Mr. Qingyi.

436
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,880
The world is in chaos.

437
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,840
Human lives are worth little more
than weeds.

438
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,880
What value does that girl have
that Mr. Yu must die for her?

439
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,360
She knows the one

440
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,440
the entire Huben Army has been hunting
for more than a decade.

441
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,880
She wrote to him.

442
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,960
I once intercepted a messenger.

443
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,280
He killed himself,

444
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,080
and the trail went cold.

445
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,680
Only by slaying Mr. Yu

446
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,840
could we frighten her.

447
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,640
Give her two days.

448
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,920
She will write to beg him for help,

449
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,960
and I will have a trail to follow.

450
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,800
<i>Yan Fengshan refused to serve</i>
<i>under your father,</i>

451
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,080
<i>so he led the entire Huben Army</i>
<i>in rebellion.</i>

452
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,160
<i>The late emperor was too old</i>

453
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,520
<i>to hold him accountable.</i>

454
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,600
<i>He could only let</i>
<i>Yan Fengshan's power grow.</i>

455
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,280
<i>Find the men I seek,</i>

456
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:29,480
<i>and I will avenge the Liu family.</i>

457
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,560
- Run!
- Father!

458
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,200
<i>Run!</i>

459
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,640
I have returned.

460
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,440
YE ZHENG

461
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,320
What you instructed is done.

462
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,200
How badly are you hurt?

463
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,480
To fulfill the mission you assigned,

464
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,640
this is nothing.

465
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,760
Even losing half my life would have been

466
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,160
worth the cost.

467
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,560
Take this.

468
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,280
Where is he?

469
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,920
This way.

470
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,040
XIAO WENJING, THE DEPOSED EMPEROR

471
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,280
Greetings, Your Majesty.
