1
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,000
Two streets away
is your sister's courtyard.

2
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,760
I know.

3
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,880
All these years,

4
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,920
your junior sister has acted
as a messenger.

5
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,920
Every now and then,
I could tell how she was doing.

6
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,120
Don't sniff the tree, or it'll go bald.

7
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,360
Bai Wan!

8
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,320
This is the second this year.

9
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,120
I need you to make another sudden trip.

10
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,240
So you've kept writing to him
all these years

11
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,480
just because you want to know
every year that he's safe?

12
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,640
Yes…

13
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,400
and no.

14
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,240
Seeing how he's all by himself,
he does seem a bit pitiful.

15
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,360
I have been writing for so many years

16
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,840
because I want him to know
someone out there is thinking of him.

17
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,600
Now you're on your own too,
living all alone in Chang'an,

18
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,240
and I care about you as well.

19
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,720
You have to let me know
that you are safe every single day.

20
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,920
I'm not made of porcelain.

21
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,760
I'm not that easy to crack or bruise.

22
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,400
Better safe than sorry.

23
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,840
How about this?

24
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,400
If you ever run into danger,

25
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,800
you can let a paper kite fly.

26
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,760
I have plenty of eyes and ears
in the city.

27
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,000
They will tell me right away.

28
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,680
I almost got him.

29
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,760
I chased him to Yanzuo Ward,

30
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,880
but Qingyi showed up and pulled him out.

31
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,280
He slipped into Hidden Soldier Alley.

32
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,760
When the Huben Army was first established,

33
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,000
my father secretly
set up Hidden Soldier Alley.

34
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,160
There are hidden bases in Chang'an.

35
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,440
Inside them are enough food and weaponry.

36
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,080
If they ever need to retreat,

37
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,760
there are craftsmen assigned
to make travel passes for the Huben Army.

38
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,880
Where is it? I can go in.

39
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,440
No need to rush.

40
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,079
He is inside. He won't come out just yet.

41
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,279
My goal is to wipe out

42
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,600
the entire Huben Army
centered around Yan Fengshan.

43
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,600
There is no intel confirming that
Yan Fengshan is in Hidden Soldier Alley,

44
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,280
so sending troops is pointless.

45
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,440
It would only alert them.

46
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,520
Stop.

47
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,920
You may not know me,
but you should at least know him.

48
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,280
OLD WOMAN
GATEKEEPER OF HIDDEN SOLDIER ALLEY

49
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,400
I know you two.

50
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,400
But the general set the rules.

51
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,560
Anyone entering or leaving
Hidden Soldier Alley

52
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,520
has to leave gold behind.

53
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,280
Hurry up.

54
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,200
Wait.

55
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,160
I bought you some pinellia and poria.

56
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,680
Boil them and drink the decoction
every day. It helps your throat.

57
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,880
Go.

58
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,360
Ziyan, this way.

59
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,400
Ziyan.

60
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,640
Who on earth injured you so badly?

61
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,720
A man who was already supposed to be dead.

62
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,200
Pu Nichuan.

63
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,400
But last night,

64
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,280
he was dead for good.

65
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,840
Whoever is behind all this
is really something.

66
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,800
Even a discarded pawn
of the Huben Army was put to use.

67
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,040
The one behind this
is someone you probably know too.

68
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,440
My brother's son, Liu Zhi.

69
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,880
He's all grown up.

70
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,640
He probably came back
to avenge his father.

71
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,960
Ziyan.

72
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,040
I don't come here very often.

73
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,280
Stay here and take your medicine.
Rest and recover.

74
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,440
Once I bring a physician back,

75
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,200
you can stay here and focus on recovering.

76
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,800
Once your wounds mend,
you can go wherever you want.

77
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,720
Leave on your own whenever you like.

78
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,520
You only need to show up
when General Fengshan summons you again.

79
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,960
Since when did you

80
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,360
start arranging my affairs?

81
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,400
You're overthinking it, Ziyan.

82
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,680
What I'm saying is,
just focus on getting better.

83
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,600
As for the rest, leave it to me.

84
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,960
That brat ran off
with the deposed emperor.

85
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,520
General Fengshan sent word.

86
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,080
He must live.

87
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,760
If he dies,

88
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,039
the deposed emperor's whereabouts
will vanish.

89
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,880
It'll ruin General Fengshan's grand plan.

90
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,880
It won't be that easy.

91
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:47,160
The people around him
aren't simpletons either.

92
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,800
TRAVEL PASS

93
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,600
Someone close to him

94
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,400
is already in my control.

95
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,680
The Liu bloodline
isn't so easy to deal with.

96
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,960
Ziyan,

97
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,400
when it comes to killing,

98
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,560
I'm nothing compared to you.

99
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,600
But when it comes to scheming,

100
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,120
you may not match me.

101
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,560
You're back.

102
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,560
-I'm back.
-Here.

103
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,560
Alright.

104
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,840
IRON

105
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,600
The General's letter.

106
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,720
Choose the most alert person
to deliver it.

107
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,880
Yes.

108
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,440
-Be quick.
-Understood.

109
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,240
This is what happens when you oppose me.

110
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,040
From now on,

111
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,880
I am willing to be a slave or a mutt.

112
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,400
Back at the Grand Academy,

113
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,240
every time the teacher scolded you,
you would copy the Shanglin Ode

114
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,200
so your heart could feel a little lighter.

115
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,400
After all these years,

116
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,280
you haven't made any progress.

117
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,960
You shouldn't have used
your own handwriting.

118
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,320
If someone sharp notices it,

119
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,760
we'll be targeted.

120
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,640
And Mo is my pageboy.

121
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,680
A pageboy doesn't need
to write things like this.

122
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,360
Then…

123
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,160
what should I write?

124
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,520
You should write a letter home.

125
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,600
Say the business
in the Capital is improving,

126
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,520
and you'll return after some time.

127
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,760
As for him and his family,

128
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,760
I'll tell you what to say.

129
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,760
Mo is my pageboy.

130
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,520
He grew up with me.

131
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,400
We studied in the clan school together.

132
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,960
His handwriting

133
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,400
carries the brushstroke style
of my family.

134
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,520
Remember this well.

135
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,440
From now on,

136
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,320
whenever you write a turning stroke,

137
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,920
slow your brush at the finish.

138
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,000
His wife is called Yanniang.

139
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,600
She's a fisherwoman.

140
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,000
Kind-hearted.

141
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,800
A wonderful cook.

142
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,240
Yanniang gave him two children.

143
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,480
A boy who's 6, named Xiaoman.

144
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,080
A girl who's 4, named Chudong.

145
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,240
You two, slow down.

146
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,200
Mo is gentle by nature.

147
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,480
He knows what I'm thinking.

148
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,640
He said he wanted to do his part.

149
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,880
And I agreed.

150
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,560
But it's all my fault.

151
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,720
Right now,

152
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,280
he should be on his way home.

153
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,920
He would've reached home
by the end of the month.

154
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,720
His family lives by a small hill
outside Huzhou.

155
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,160
Three little rooms.

156
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,360
A modest patch of farmland.

157
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,520
-Dinner's ready!
-Coming!

158
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,000
It's enough to provide
for the whole family.

159
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,360
He could've lived out his life
safe and sound.

160
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,200
Mother, we get to eat eggs today!

161
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,480
But you ruined everything.

162
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,600
Mo…

163
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,680
Where is he buried?

164
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,680
You don't deserve to know.

165
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,960
If you sit here any longer without a word,

166
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,280
the neighbor lady
is going to come out with a stick.

167
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,000
Alright. I'm coming down.

168
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,359
So pretty.

169
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,760
What fabric is this?

170
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,680
Don't touch it.
I'm rushing to finish this.

171
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,280
If you get it dirty, they'll dock my pay.

172
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,920
Alright. I won't touch it.
I won't touch it.

173
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,400
ZHAOLU

174
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,360
Is staring at me
supposed to cook the rice?

175
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,520
It is.

176
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,400
I'll cook it.

177
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,440
Come and eat.

178
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,040
Here.

179
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,880
-It really is cooked.
-Liu Ziyan is back.

180
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,200
Don't worry.

181
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,240
He calls himself
the Huben Army's top assassin.

182
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,240
But he's nothing special in my eyes.

183
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,800
I crossed blades with him last night.

184
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,720
I struck him three times.

185
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,560
Chest, back, left shoulder.

186
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,280
I almost took his head off.

187
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,880
Too bad… the brat still escaped.

188
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,640
And you?

189
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,680
Not a scratch on me.

190
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,920
Why is your clothing torn?

191
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,560
When did my clothes get torn?

192
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,680
-Let me see your wound.
-No.

193
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,320
Men and women should…

194
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,760
Let's eat first.

195
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,800
Consider the silver I paid you earlier

196
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,080
a payment for
those three strikes last night.

197
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,000
Alright?

198
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,280
From now on,

199
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,120
you don't have to risk your life anymore
to avenge me against Liu Ziyan.

200
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,560
Why not?

201
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,560
I earn only 100 wen for a wedding quilt,

202
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,920
and 50 wen for a wedding outfit.

203
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,440
Even if I sew for ten more years,

204
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,320
I still wouldn't be able
to afford your service.

205
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,200
I don't want money.

206
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,200
I don't want money.

207
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,560
Stay away!

208
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,480
Why do you keep following me?

209
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,560
Are you good at killing people?

210
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,440
As you saw. Yes.

211
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,640
I began sewing to survive when I was 14.

212
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,880
This is all I've saved
these past five years.

213
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,160
This is the man's portrait.

214
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,800
I want you to kill him.

215
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,880
Why do you want him dead?

216
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,880
My mother was a seamstress.

217
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,000
Every time she finished a garment,

218
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,400
she'd deliver it
to the client's residence.

219
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,520
That winter solstice,

220
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,080
she braved the snow
and brought a newly finished cloak

221
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,240
to Liu Ziyan's residence.

222
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,760
But Liu Ziyan accused her of being a spy
who eavesdropped for secrets.

223
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,760
Liu Ziyan hung my mother
right at our doorstep.

224
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,760
When she died,
even her kneecaps were carved out.

225
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,080
This is the deposit.
I'll make up the rest someday.

226
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,600
I don't kill for money.

227
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,000
A deposit, though…

228
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,600
Give me a smile first.

229
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,080
What you just said…

230
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,600
were you feeling sorry for me?

231
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,440
I was worried about you.

232
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,320
What's there to worry about?

233
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,720
I made you a promise, so I'll get it done.

234
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,160
Also, from now on,
don't bring up the money again.

235
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,840
You've already paid.

236
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,520
Fresh vegetables!

237
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,440
Come take a look!

238
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,200
Crisp and tender greens!

239
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,800
Come look!

240
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,760
-Come take a look.
-Fresh greens today.

241
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,480
I picked them this morning.

242
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,640
-Come look.
-I'll take one.

243
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,320
Take care, miss.

244
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,160
Very nice.

245
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,680
-These are handwoven by us.
-This one.

246
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,600
-This looks good.
-It suits you.

247
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,520
-Alright.
-The silver one is nice.

248
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,640
I'll take that one then.

249
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,640
Miss, want to look at kites?

250
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,960
-How much is this?
-Two wen.

251
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,120
-Here.
-Thank you.

252
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,840
Pick some more.

253
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,080
They're very fresh.

254
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:53,160
If you ever run into danger,
you can let a paper kite fly.

255
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,720
I have plenty of eyes and ears
in the city.

256
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,000
They will tell me right away.

257
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,320
Thank you.

258
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,680
Sesame oil.

259
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,480
It flies really high.

260
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,840
Come take a look.

261
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,920
-Sesame oil.
-This one.

262
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,080
-I'll take one.
-Alright.

263
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,280
Pears!

264
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,880
Xiaoqing, why aren't you…

265
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,720
I'm never buying pears from you again.

266
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,240
This girl… What's gotten into her today?

267
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,840
Thank you, miss.

268
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,880
Take care. Come again next time.

269
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,440
Rain capes! Selling rain capes!

270
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,320
Rain capes!

271
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,680
-Go over there.
-Yes.

272
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,800
Go.

273
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,760
You're sharp.

274
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,880
You could tell
those men outside were mine.

275
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,480
Has no one ever told you

276
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,640
you don't need to act
so high and mighty all the time?

277
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,520
You know, I grew up without parents.

278
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,600
I was raised being beaten
in an opera troupe.

279
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:56,440
My masters told me
when you live in this world,

280
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,400
every movement onstage,

281
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,120
every frown and smile
is something people have to watch.

282
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,880
If anyone found it displeasing,

283
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,280
my masters would beat me.

284
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,360
So I've had to watch myself
every moment of every day.

285
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,000
Regardless of whom I'm performing for.

286
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,960
The kite flew away.

287
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,360
Which means you're not leaving.

288
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,240
The night Mr. Yu died,

289
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,160
you didn't even give me two hours.

290
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,760
Why would you give me two days?

291
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,480
You're worthless.

292
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,400
But the person you were writing to
has value of his own.

293
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,720
I was only bait.

294
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,640
I saw that. What are your hands doing?

295
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,160
Split this bundle,
then split the next two days' worth.

296
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,120
I'll check before dark.

297
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,440
Assassin! There's an assassin!

298
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,680
Where?

299
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,360
The assassin you're talking about is her?

300
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,480
What are you yelling for?
Get back to work.

301
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,680
Why are you here? What's the rush?

302
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,720
What happened?

303
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,840
It's Bai Wan. Something happened to her.

304
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,720
The Huben Army.

305
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,000
Xiaoqing was followed on her way back.

306
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,840
They surrounded the courtyard.

307
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,840
Wait.

308
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,600
Is there a secret tunnel or a hidden room?

309
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,560
No.

310
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,480
They brought many men.

311
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,360
The only ones here who can fight
are Xiaoqing and me.

312
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,520
I caused this mess. I'll deal with it.

313
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,880
Fire. Burn the walls first.

314
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,560
I can't get out.
And no one is coming to save me.

315
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,160
To you, I'm useless.

316
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,840
Stop wasting time.

317
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,960
How is it a waste?

318
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,920
Maybe you don't know this yet.

319
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,600
The person you were writing to
is already back in Chang'an.

320
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,360
And what you definitely don't know

321
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,560
is that your little messenger
was still being watched,

322
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,960
even if you two had your little tricks.

323
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:55,120
All it takes is one trip
to where he lives.

324
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,120
Once she does that,

325
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,240
his location

326
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,680
is exposed.

327
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,600
-Don't let a single one escape!
-Yes.

328
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,480
I'm going to save her.
Break through, then go find Mr. Long.

329
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,000
Stay alive.

330
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:27,280
Wherever you go, write to me.

331
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:31,640
Let me know you're safe every year.

332
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,720
YOUNG BAI WAN

333
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,880
I only want to know
that he's safe every year.

334
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,080
So all these years,
I've kept writing to him.

335
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,000
Seeing him all alone,
he seemed a little pitiful.

336
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,880
All these years of writing,

337
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:51,200
I only wanted him to know
that someone is thinking of him.

338
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,200
Still alive, I see.

339
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,560
Go!

340
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,520
Go.
