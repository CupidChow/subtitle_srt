1
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,200
The Wuyang Army
is guarding outside the city.

2
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,600
Why are you still here
to check the city's defense, General?

3
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,480
I've followed His Majesty
to the south for a while now.

4
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,880
Sometimes,

5
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,560
I still miss the north.

6
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,280
Have another look.

7
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,080
-Look.
-I don't want it.

8
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,880
-Let's go.
-Why are you buying so much?

9
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,800
Move quickly!

10
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,560
This is for nourishing
your body back home.

11
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,360
-Let's go.
-Have a persimmon.

12
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,120
Take a look.

13
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,560
Don't miss out on this deal!

14
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,280
Local persimmons!

15
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,480
Pears!

16
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,640
Three wen for a jin.

17
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,680
Sir, do you want some pears?

18
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,840
They are sweet.

19
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,840
WANG PU, HUBEN MEMBER

20
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,000
Miss, you are pretty and have smooth skin.

21
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,600
I'm sure the pear is sweet.

22
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,560
Absolutely.

23
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,760
I only have one wen on me.

24
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,880
Your mouth is sweeter than my pear.

25
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,480
I'll sell it to you for one wen.

26
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,680
Let me pick two big ones.

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,960
Thank you.

28
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,960
If I can marry someone as pretty and kind

29
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,240
as you one day,

30
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,640
I'd be blessed.

31
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,800
You have a silver tongue.

32
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,160
-Here you go.
-Sure.

33
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,240
Come back again.

34
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,240
Take another look.

35
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,480
This is good.

36
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,760
-Try more. Miss, take another one.
-No, thanks.

37
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,120
Bamboo baskets!

38
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,160
Take a look at my bamboo basket!

39
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,640
Madam,

40
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,880
your ribs look good.

41
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,320
Yes. They are all fresh.

42
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,920
I only have seven wen on me.

43
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,440
Lamb offal only costs three wen.
Let me get you a jin of it.

44
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,440
I'm not greedy

45
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,640
but my wife

46
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,600
is eight months pregnant now.

47
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,960
She's going to give birth soon.

48
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,840
However, I'm poor and cannot afford
to buy nourishment for her.

49
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,800
Forget it.

50
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,960
Here. Take it for seven wen.

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,080
Thank you, madam.

52
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,560
-Thank you, madam.
-Sure. Take care.

53
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,960
All right.

54
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,080
Sir!

55
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,200
Do you want a coach ride?

56
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,080
Where are you going?

57
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,040
Northern foot of the Qinling Mountain,
Yulong Ridge.

58
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,000
Seven wen.

59
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,680
Sir,

60
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,920
I shopped at the market
and bought many offerings.

61
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,440
I only have three wen left.

62
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,360
Offerings?

63
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,800
I'm going to the mountains
to pay respects to my dead wife.

64
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,440
She passed away three years ago.

65
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,320
I purposely rushed
from the north to the Capital

66
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,680
to pay respects to her.

67
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,480
You're pitiful.

68
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,960
Get on.

69
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,960
Thank you.

70
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,200
-We are leaving.
-All right!

71
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,360
Sir,

72
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,960
did you come to the wrong place?

73
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,200
This place is full of mountains.

74
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,120
There's no grave here.

75
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,720
She isn't buried here.

76
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,520
She died here.

77
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,680
Three years ago,
she was on a journey at night

78
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,680
and she encountered bandits.

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,640
Forget it. Keep it.

80
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,160
You're in the wilderness.

81
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,920
You need money to take a carriage back.

82
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,000
Thank you, sir!

83
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,560
Thank you!

84
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,160
Everyone, you've worked hard.

85
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,880
Later, I'll request that the general

86
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,480
arranges more manpower

87
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,800
so you'll get fewer shifts.

88
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,720
I am Wang Pu,

89
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,240
General Fengshan's messenger.

90
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,760
I have been asked

91
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,680
to come see you.

92
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,600
Huben sent someone here again?

93
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,360
Does Yan Fengshan
have something to tell me?

94
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,920
Yes. Of course.

95
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,560
General Fengshan wants me

96
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,200
to improve your meal.

97
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,960
Is Liu Ziyan dead?

98
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,000
What a fine prediction, sir.

99
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,080
-He is indeed dead.
-Who killed him?

100
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,920
There were many people.

101
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,120
As soon as he left here,
he fought nonstop.

102
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,840
He was wounded in every fight

103
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,840
and finally died in the wilderness.

104
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,720
Even the sharpest blade breaks in the end.

105
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,720
I heard he had served you for three years.

106
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,000
It's an honor

107
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,960
he's remembered by you.

108
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,720
Served me?

109
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,640
Liu Ziyan was the best assassin of Huben.

110
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,799
He would never serve anyone.

111
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,760
He was there to kill me.

112
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,400
However, he was very cautious.

113
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,080
We spent day after day together,

114
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,960
and through our interactions,

115
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,920
he probed me for three years.

116
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,360
But he couldn't find a chance to kill me.

117
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,320
An assassination that lasted three years?

118
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,360
No wonder even General Fengshan

119
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,160
called Liu Ziyan

120
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,240
a blade that no one could wield.

121
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,200
I hear you can kill
with anything in this world.

122
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,120
No one in this world can match you.

123
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,960
Liu Ziyan was biting off
more than he could chew.

124
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,040
Sir.

125
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,480
The general did not ask me to kill you.

126
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,720
I'm not that brave either.

127
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,240
The soup isn't poisoned.

128
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,920
The Wuxi Mountain is covered in snow,

129
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,280
and there's a vast grassland below it.

130
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,720
This is the taste

131
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,040
of the lamb that lived there.

132
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,680
You boiled it in water

133
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,040
and added a pinch of salt.

134
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,920
Young man,

135
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,760
have you been there?

136
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,640
No.

137
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,240
I came from the city.

138
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,760
I bought the lamb in the city.

139
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,080
The person who went to your homeland

140
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,240
was General Fengshan.

141
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,320
He said that place had 200,000 men
ready to fight in a battle.

142
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,320
Anyone would fear that place.

143
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,120
Right now,

144
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,080
even the lamb of Wuxi Mountain

145
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,960
can be bought in Chang'an.

146
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,400
That means the world is at peace.

147
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,760
If you stay here,

148
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,320
the world

149
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,680
will remain at peace.

150
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,400
Go back and relay a message
to Yan Fengshan.

151
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,400
Tell him

152
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,240
that I prefer

153
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,040
the tea of Chang'an now.

154
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,840
Still no word of Yan Fengshan?

155
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,600
Looking for one person in this world

156
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,600
is like looking for a needle
in a haystack.

157
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,040
Moreover, you're looking
for the world's best shadow guard.

158
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,040
It won't be that easy.

159
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,640
You failed your task.

160
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,200
Yet here you are,
playing weiqi with me in a carefree manner

161
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,680
and even surrounding my pieces.

162
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,640
I failed my task indeed

163
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,480
but my skill at weiqi is good.

164
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,520
With it,

165
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,960
my life remains safe before Your Majesty.

166
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,000
If you were Yan Fengshan,

167
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,880
what would you do next

168
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,720
after abducting the deposed emperor?

169
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,880
With the emperor in hand,
one can order every marquis around.

170
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,480
Everyone knows that.

171
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,560
Since the founding emperor's time,

172
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,760
regional commanders were appointed.

173
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,440
Everyone has military power.

174
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,720
These four places, Beiting, Fanyang,

175
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,400
Long'an, and Zhenxi are the strongest.

176
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,880
If I was Yan Fengshan,

177
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,040
I would try to win them over.

178
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,000
Or, perhaps

179
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,000
I've already won them over.

180
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,640
As my greatest enemy,

181
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,800
you'd best not let me ally with them.

182
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,400
If I take away the military authority
of these four commanders,

183
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,160
it will be pointless

184
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,480
even if he allies with them.

185
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,640
You won't be able to do that.

186
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,240
The four of them

187
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,560
used to serve the founding emperor.

188
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,880
They are still loyal.

189
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,680
They won't give in so easily.

190
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,600
Your Majesty, you need another plan.

191
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,800
Then devise it.

192
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,680
You failed your task already.

193
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,120
Your Majesty, you have an army.

194
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,360
They also have their army.

195
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,120
I also have an army.

196
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,840
Summon the four regional
military commanders to the Capital.

197
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,800
I will relinquish
my military authority to you

198
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,560
in front of them.

199
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,560
In this way, you are also forcing them
to hand over their authority.

200
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,120
But the Baiwenhu Army
is your family's private army.

201
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,160
If there's no war in this world,

202
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,800
my family no longer needs our own army.

203
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,960
We only need servants.

204
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,960
Your selflessness

205
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,680
shows how scheming I am.

206
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,280
Sure. I'll accept your suggestion.

207
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,800
Hand over your military command,

208
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,200
and you may take the seat

209
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,560
behind me.

210
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,920
I am a cripple.

211
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,600
I prefer sitting in a wheelchair.

212
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,800
Just do as I say

213
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,600
so Yan Fengshan
will have no way out of this.

214
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,240
I'll do as you say as well.

215
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,840
Moreover, there's one more thing

216
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,880
that I want to ask you, Your Majesty.

217
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,240
Han Ziling whom I chose initially

218
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,720
was killed by Your Majesty.

219
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,960
Was the person Your Majesty
chose after that

220
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,720
White Hair?

221
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,040
White Hair?

222
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,960
I haven't heard this name for so long.

223
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,200
That's right. It was him.

224
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,600
The last person of the Liu family.

225
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,440
His father founded the Huben Army.

226
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,360
Using him to defeat the Huben Army

227
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
is the most suitable choice.

228
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,720
I know a bit
about what befell the Liu family.

229
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,080
It's not easy

230
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,440
for a child of that age
to escape the Huben Army's pursuit

231
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,640
and survive.

232
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,440
He was born with white hair.

233
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,880
As he grew up,

234
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,920
his hair slowly turned black.

235
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,000
Someone who was born with rare traits

236
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,360
won't die so easily.

237
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,760
Were you friends in the past?

238
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,640
We were.

239
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,120
I hope

240
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,760
to meet him again.

241
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,040
Taking away military authority

242
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,000
will leave Yan Fengshan with no way out.

243
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,960
He hands over the Baiwenhu Army

244
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,760
so Your Majesty will have no worries.

245
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,640
Gu Yu is very aware of the bigger picture.

246
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,920
Someone like him

247
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,840
is rare.

248
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,480
Do you think he won't realize

249
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,720
this is all a part of our scheme?

250
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,560
It is my scheme.

251
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,480
He won't hold it against Your Majesty.

252
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,760
What are you doing today?

253
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,400
What's wrong?

254
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,000
Aren't we using someone else's residence?

255
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,680
You should add more furniture

256
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,240
and clean the place.

257
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,200
After all, we have to live our lives here.

258
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,680
Living our lives?

259
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,000
What? Are you cooking tonight
so I can relax?

260
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,800
I can't do that. My cooking is bad.

261
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,080
Your noodles taste better.

262
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,520
You can cook for now.

263
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,560
Once I learn from you,

264
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,080
I'll be in charge of both of your meals.

265
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,480
By the time you learn how to cook,

266
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,480
I will be 60 years old.

267
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,600
Enough. Stop fussing.

268
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,640
I just finished sweeping.

269
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,600
Go and wash the bowls.

270
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,840
Sure. I'll go and wash the bowls.

271
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,400
Remember to cook the noodles later.

272
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,600
Huai'an.

273
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,080
Are we going

274
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,200
to keep living in the house

275
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,560
Bai Wan lent us?

276
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,080
Before she left,

277
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,800
she left this place to me

278
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,560
because she wanted someone

279
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,920
to keep this house lived-in.

280
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,960
Every time I see his face,

281
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,520
it'll remind me of Zhang Mo.

282
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,720
But the real Zhang Mo is…

283
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,480
We

284
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,800
all have to move on.

285
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,640
I can't kill him,

286
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,800
yet I need him to stay by my side.

287
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,800
I need to get along with him
in another way.

288
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,320
Come in.

289
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,200
Speak.

290
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,600
TO YANNIANG

291
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,080
Today, I wrote a letter.

292
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,080
I want to send it
to Zhang Mo's family at Huzhou.

293
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,800
In the letter,

294
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,320
I said I had made enough dowry
for the daughter,

295
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,920
but business
had been very good in the Capital.

296
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,760
Therefore, I said wanted to stay

297
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,760
and make more money.

298
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,920
I've only written one letter.

299
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,000
I hope

300
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,520
my wife and children
can put their minds at ease.

301
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,480
That said,

302
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,840
I tried to copy Zhang Mo's handwriting.

303
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,040
I don't know how well I did.

304
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,560
I hope you can check it for me.

305
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,760
Why are you doing this?

306
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,960
I want to atone.

307
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,320
It's the loss of a life.

308
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,840
How do you atone for it?

309
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,760
I'll atone with my life then.

310
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,320
Aren't you going to use me
to defeat Yan Fengshan

311
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,760
and the Huben Army?

312
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,480
When you think of a way,

313
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,080
send me.

314
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,600
Liu Ziyan is dead.

315
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,960
Qingyi has also been captured.

316
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,160
They've lost
two great Huben leaders in the city.

317
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,520
Yan Fengshan

318
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,040
will surely act again.

319
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,240
When the Huben Army causes trouble again,

320
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,920
it'll be our chance for a breakthrough.

321
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,840
Perhaps,

322
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,720
you'll be useful.

323
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,200
I understand.

324
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,840
When the day comes,

325
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,200
I won't blink

326
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,520
even if I die.

327
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,000
Leave the letter.

328
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,680
You may leave.

329
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,200
If the handwriting is similar enough,

330
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,400
I'll send the letter.

331
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,320
Speaking of which,

332
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,000
there's a scholar
at the Lide Ward in Luoyang.

333
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,520
His surname is Wang.

334
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,360
We'll call him Wang Sheng for now.

335
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,960
He loves to drink.

336
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,280
He must drink a few cups every day.

337
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:36,480
One day, he was drunk again.

338
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,560
He wobbled back home,

339
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,720
lay on his bed, and fell asleep.

340
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,680
When he was sleeping, one of his hands

341
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,240
touched the ground.

342
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,680
His wife saw it…

343
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,640
SHAN, BAIWENHU MEMBER

344
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,880
…and feared he'd catch a chill,

345
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,880
so she quickly approached him

346
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,280
to tuck his hand

347
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,960
back into his bed.

348
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,160
When his wife

349
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,240
was about to touch Wang Sheng's hand…

350
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,760
Suddenly!

351
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,480
Why did you shout?

352
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,000
I thought you weren't afraid.

353
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:12,920
I'm not afraid.

354
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,160
All right. You are not afraid.

355
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,400
Give me your hand then. Give it to me.

356
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,280
Let me grab it.

357
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,600
Suddenly,

358
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,440
a large hand reached out from underground

359
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,720
and grasped Wang Sheng's hand.

360
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,800
It started pulling him underground.

361
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,520
It kept pulling.

362
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,680
His wife was afraid

363
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,080
and called for help.

364
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,440
Someone! Save my husband!

365
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,440
Her neighbors came to help her

366
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,720
and they saw Wang Sheng

367
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,400
was about to be pulled underground
like this.

368
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,200
They quickly tried to fish him out.

369
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,320
Wang Sheng, come out!

370
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,800
It was useless.
The large hand was too powerful

371
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,920
and it dragged Wang Sheng underground.

372
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,760
That's… Just like that,

373
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,120
Wang Sheng was pulled underground
and became a wandering spirit.

374
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,080
His wife couldn't eat and drink

375
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,960
because she missed her husband.

376
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,760
One night,

377
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,120
his wife had a dream.

378
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,680
She saw

379
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,480
her husband coming back
to find her at night.

380
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,480
He approached her.

381
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,640
He got closer and closer.

382
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,920
Suddenly!

383
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,720
Didn't you say you weren't afraid?

384
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,280
You're so annoying.

385
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,320
Wait, what's that smell?

386
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,640
-Something is burnt.
-The porridge!

387
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,560
-The porridge!
-Hurry!

388
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,600
-The porridge.
-The porridge smells nice.

389
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,960
-General!
-General!

390
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,200
All of you are enjoying your meal.

391
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,000
I'm sure you haven't forgotten your duties
to guard the city walls as well.

392
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,680
The general is busy with official matters.
He toils all day long.

393
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,760
He only returns to his residence
to rest at midnight.

394
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,320
Passing the walls

395
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,080
he heard your chatter and laughter.

396
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,120
It was so lively.

397
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,880
If news of this spreads, the reputation
of Baiwenhu Army's strict discipline

398
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,360
will be just a joke.

399
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,200
General.

400
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,080
While it is true
that I slack and eat a lot,

401
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,120
this was mainly because Shan was hungry

402
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,040
so I gathered everyone

403
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,320
to have some porridge.

404
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,440
I was wrong.

405
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,600
Please punish me.

406
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,360
What did you do wrong?

407
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,760
I…

408
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,360
I know the Huben Army
is still in the city.

409
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,200
But I paid them no mind

410
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,880
and even fooled around with Shan.

411
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,960
No.

412
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,360
Your mistake

413
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,920
is that you're having porridge here

414
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,400
without inviting me.

415
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,960
Right.

416
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,120
Why didn't any of you
invite the general to eat porridge?

417
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,800
Get up quickly
and invite the general over.

418
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,480
General, please come here.

419
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,920
-General, over here.
-Come.

420
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,280
All of you were screaming and shouting.

421
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,800
You were telling ghost tales again.

422
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,680
No. We were joking.

423
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,800
Shan is timid.

424
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,880
Pangtou, you shouldn't bully
and scare him.

425
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,680
I was just horsing around.

426
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,000
General, I am a Baiwenhu member.

427
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,160
I'm not afraid of ghosts.

428
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,960
General, it's like this.

429
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,600
We are sharing ghost stories

430
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,720
to make this place lively

431
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,560
so everyone can be happy.

432
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,160
I didn't mean to scare them.

433
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,960
Pangtou is great at livening the mood.

434
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,360
My apologies.

435
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,360
I spoiled the mood.

436
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,520
Not at all.

437
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,880
Fine. I'll take a drink as punishment.

438
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,160
No need.

439
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,080
There's no wine.
I'll take a sip of porridge.

440
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,120
Sure.

441
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,680
General!

442
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,880
-It's hot.
-Hot!

443
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,320
You scared us this time.

444
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,360
-Everyone.
-Come.

445
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,840
-Everyone.
-Come.

446
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,400
Come.

447
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,320
Mister.

448
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,320
Where have all the sellers gone to?

449
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,080
My mother wants me
to buy two jin of pork shoulder.

450
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,520
Something good will happen tonight.

451
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,040
You want pork shoulder?

452
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,920
Let me help you.

453
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,640
Little boy,

454
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,040
go home now.

455
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,680
Later,

456
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,080
there'll be absolute chaos.

457
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,000
-Be careful!
-Yes.

458
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,520
-Here.
-Move the general to the brick path

459
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,640
so it's easier to push.

460
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,880
I've told you to use the lift.

461
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,120
What are you talking about?

462
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,320
I had fun chatting with you.

463
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,440
Bringing you down is fine.

464
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,640
Yes.

465
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,280
It's late at night now.

466
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,760
When the sun rises,

467
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,000
all of you

468
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,320
should return to camp and sleep well.

469
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,200
-Farewell, General.
-Farewell, General.

470
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,600
It's rare for me

471
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,200
to see you smiling
since you entered Chang'an, General.

472
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,720
I grew up in the army.

473
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,880
Naturally, I'll feel more relaxed
being with the soldiers.

474
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,000
Later, I inherited the title

475
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,640
and took command of the military.

476
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,520
I live beside the emperor.

477
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,640
I have no choice
but to show another facade to others.

478
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,920
General, your position demands that you

479
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,120
uphold many standards.

480
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,120
You can hardly be relaxed.

481
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,800
It won't be long.

482
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,040
The regional military commanders
enter the Capital next month.

483
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,280
According to the plan,

484
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,640
I will also hand over
my military authority.

485
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,800
Once the commander
of the Baiwenhu Army changes,

486
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,960
I'll be free.

487
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,760
General…

488
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,240
Xiao Wuyang

489
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,440
is a trustworthy emperor.

490
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,880
When the other commanders and I
give him our seals,

491
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,720
the fight for power will be no more.

492
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,200
With no way out for Yan Fengshan,

493
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,280
the battle won't happen.

494
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,120
Then,

495
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,160
no one will die.

496
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,240
How unlucky.

497
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,320
I still need to wash the dishes.

498
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,920
Pangtou?

499
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,120
Are you trying to scare me again?

500
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,400
We are under attack!

501
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,680
It's an ambush!

502
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,040
I recognize that.

503
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,000
That's Baiwenhu's arrow of command.

504
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,440
-Hurry!
-Yes!

505
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,600
-Throw them down.
-Yes.

506
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,760
Let's go.

507
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,280
There are so many of them.

508
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,280
This is so cruel.

509
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,760
All these human lives!

510
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,320
I wonder who did this.

511
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,160
General.

512
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,920
Help me get down.

513
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,720
Don't look.

514
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,800
It's fine. Don't be afraid.

515
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:10,920
There are assassins!

516
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,640
Run! Protect the general!

517
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,960
Yes!

518
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,320
Stop!

519
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,440
-General!
-General!

520
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,640
Are you the one who killed my soldiers?

521
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,480
Yes.

522
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,560
I did this tonight

523
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,800
because I want

524
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,480
you to come with me, General Gu.

525
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,360
General!

526
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,280
Stop!

527
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,200
I don't want to kill him.

528
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,520
In a while,

529
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,360
I will send General Gu back.

530
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,200
Before that, I hope the Baiwenhu Army

531
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,360
won't do anything reckless.

532
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,480
Otherwise,

533
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,880
when General Gu returns,

534
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,400
he won't return merely crippled.

535
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,760
Are you aware of the consequences?

536
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,880
Your Majesty. General Gu was attacked.

537
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,880
Gu Yu is an old acquaintance of mine.
I came here

538
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,400
to save Gu Yu.

539
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,280
I underestimated the enemy.

540
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,040
I should have
protected the general fiercely

541
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,120
and not left him.

542
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,560
Given what the Huben Army did tonight,

543
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,640
Gu Yu wouldn't have been safe

544
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,760
even if Xiao Wuyang were beside him.

545
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,200
Don't worry.

546
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,200
I have my own way

547
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,760
of rescuing Gu Yu.

548
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,040
Right now,

549
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,320
the only place to hide Gu Yu

550
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,840
is Hidden Soldier Alley.

551
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,960
I wanted to meet His Majesty

552
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,280
but seeing you suffices, Chancellor Gao.

553
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,680
Hearing that Gu Yu was being attacked,

554
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,760
His Majesty wanted to leave the palace

555
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,760
but I stopped him.

556
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,000
Well done.

557
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,360
Just in case it's another trap.

558
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,840
How's your injury?

559
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,600
I'm fine.

560
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,040
Qingyi has been captured

561
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,360
and Liu Ziyan is dead.

562
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,560
You fended off Huben alone. Well done.

563
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,400
I didn't make the wrong choice

564
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,920
by choosing you.

565
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,320
But losing Gu Yu

566
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,000
is a loss.

567
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,440
The regional military commanders
enter the Capital next month.

568
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,680
According to Gu Yu's plan,

569
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,000
he will first hand over
the military command of the Baiwenhu Army.

570
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,440
That act will also prompt

571
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,280
the other commanders
to yield their command.

572
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,440
Then, Yan Fengshan

573
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,280
will have no one to ally with.

574
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,440
It is a good move indeed.

575
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,040
In that case,

576
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,040
you need to make sure

577
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,840
the move succeeds.

578
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,000
You mustn't let Gu Yu defect,

579
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,240
even if it means killing him.

580
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,720
Chancellor Gao, you sure are devoted

581
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,480
to securing His Majesty's dynasty.

582
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,480
But Chancellor Gao,

583
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,720
don't forget.

584
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,640
Gu Yu is a general.

585
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,160
When a soldier bleeds,

586
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,400
he will take revenge.

587
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,440
He will never defect to the Huben Army.

588
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,440
That's for the best.

589
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,040
I am an old acquaintance of Gu Yu.

590
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,800
If I'm going to rescue him,
I will protect him forever.

591
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,960
But once the military
authority issue settles down,

592
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,200
I hope you don't

593
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,200
abandon those who help you,
Chancellor Gao.

594
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,080
Perhaps I will,

595
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,920
perhaps I won't.

596
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,760
Nasty One.

597
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,200
Nasty One!

598
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,320
You're the nasty one.

599
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,160
Collect the laundry.

600
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,720
How annoying.

601
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,480
I've noticed it now.

602
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,800
Life is just work upon work, without rest.

603
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,880
What's wrong with you today?

604
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,080
Weren't you all fired up a few days ago?

605
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,520
Why so down all of a sudden?

606
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,720
That was a few days ago.

607
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,760
This is me right now.

608
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,600
Perseverance is a virtue, young man.

609
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,280
I'm leaving as well.

610
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,560
Where are you going?

611
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,560
Gu Yu has been taken by Huben.

612
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,400
If I'm not mistaken,

613
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,320
they will imprison him
at Hidden Soldier Alley.

614
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,360
So, I need to infiltrate
Hidden Soldier Alley

615
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,520
to rescue Gu Yu.
