1
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:09,600
IT WON'T BE LONG
UNTIL WE RETURN TO CHANG'AN

2
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,240
<i>In the 28th year of Qiansheng,</i>

3
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,000
<i>the founding emperor fell ill suddenly</i>

4
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,000
<i>and passed away unexpectedly.</i>

5
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,160
<i>General of the Huben Army, Yan Fengshan,</i>
<i>took control of the imperial court</i>

6
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,000
<i>and threw the government into chaos.</i>

7
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,360
<i>He helped the late emperor's youngest son,</i>
<i>Xiao Wenjing, ascend the throne</i>

8
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,360
<i>and killed the feudal lords,</i>

9
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,040
<i>causing imperial authority to decline.</i>

10
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,520
<i>In the 4th year of Wencheng,</i>

11
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,960
<i>the late emperor's eldest son,</i>
<i>a feudal lord, Xiao Wuyang,</i>

12
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,680
<i>mobilized troops from the north</i>

13
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,480
<i>to overthrow the tyranny.</i>

14
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,360
<i>They traveled 1,300 li southward.</i>

15
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,200
<i>With strict military discipline</i>
<i>along the way,</i>

16
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,080
<i>all sides submitted to him.</i>

17
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,080
<i>He arrived in Chang'an,</i>

18
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,720
<i>eliminated the treacherous officials,</i>

19
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,800
<i>and took control of the imperial court.</i>

20
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,120
TAIQING PALACE

21
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,200
XIAO WUYANG, NEW EMPEROR

22
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,880
<i>Unable to bear the defeat,</i>
<i>the deposed emperor, Xiao Wenjing,</i>

23
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,680
<i>burned himself inside Taiji Hall.</i>

24
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,000
Your Highness,
there were five dead bodies.

25
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,280
None of them were the deposed emperor.

26
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,720
GU YU, MARQUIS OF NORTHGUARD

27
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,120
Have you verified all of them?

28
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,600
The deposed emperor fell
on a Hanbaiyu staircase as a child.

29
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,400
Because of that,
his upper left molar was chipped.

30
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,960
He also fractured his left leg.

31
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,600
All of this is recorded
in the palace archives.

32
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,240
These dead bodies might be unrecognizable,

33
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,280
but it is not difficult
to verify these injuries.

34
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,360
Your Highness, we just pulled this
from one of the corpses.

35
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,560
It finally turned up.

36
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,880
It was set up on purpose.

37
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,240
They are waging war against Xiao Wuyang.

38
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,400
All subordinates
of the city-guarding general,

39
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,840
Li Longjing, have surrendered.

40
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,720
There might still be
skirmishes in the city,

41
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,440
but it's nothing to worry about.

42
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,320
We've captured
all 12 gates of the Capital.

43
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,760
We will set up camps

44
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,040
in the south and southwest.

45
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,640
Moreover, the north side of the city
is under our army's control.

46
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,680
The north is secure.

47
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,960
What about Yan Fengshan and his army?

48
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,120
Greetings, Your Majesty.

49
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,360
WISDOM AND DEPTH

50
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,000
The scene at Taiji Hall has been examined.

51
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,520
The deposed emperor, Xiao Wenjing,

52
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,600
did not die in the fire.

53
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,040
This was recovered from the stomach

54
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,200
of one of the dead bodies in Taiji Hall.

55
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,600
I'm sure Your Majesty
recognizes the token.

56
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,040
A Huben Token.

57
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,520
Does it mean

58
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,240
he has abducted
that useless brother of mine?

59
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,480
Yes.

60
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,360
Xiao Wenjing might be useless,

61
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,960
but one can rule the world
simply by abducting the emperor.

62
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,800
Perhaps this battle is far from over.

63
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,320
Perhaps it is just the beginning.

64
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,280
Yan Fengshan and the Huben Army
have decided to stay hidden

65
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,600
because they do not want
to face Your Majesty directly.

66
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,600
But as long as
the deposed emperor is in his hands,

67
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,000
he will surely rise again.

68
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,160
A hidden battle will soon begin.

69
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,640
I am old.

70
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,840
I was careless.

71
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,320
When you are facing Yan Fengshan,

72
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,080
no one can win in one move.

73
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,480
I do recommend one particular person

74
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,840
if you plan to face the Huben Army.

75
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,240
He understands the army better
than anyone in this world.

76
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,280
His father, Liu Ziwen,

77
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,320
is the founder of the Huben Army.

78
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,679
Fifteen years ago,

79
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,520
<i>Yan Fengshan led the Huben Army</i>
<i>and betrayed Liu Ziwen.</i>

80
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,720
<i>The Liu clan was annihilated.</i>

81
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,160
<i>He was fortunate enough to survive.</i>

82
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,440
He is an exceptional talent.

83
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,880
Moreover, he carries a grudge.

84
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,720
After 15 years, he is now fully prepared.

85
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,360
Many former retainers of the Liu clan
are also helping him secretly.

86
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,240
An exceptional talent?

87
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,160
How does he compare to you?

88
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,000
I am old.

89
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,360
I'm inferior to him.

90
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,520
In that case, bring him to me.

91
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,400
I will test him myself.

92
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Understood.

93
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,320
HUAINAN

94
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,720
Be careful with that.

95
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,320
There's more over here.

96
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,600
Have some water.

97
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,200
In times of turmoil,

98
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,200
the government stalls
and the people suffer.

99
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,280
Extraordinary individuals will arise

100
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,080
like leopards and magpies.

101
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,000
With the momentum of soaring eagles,

102
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,560
they achieve remarkable feats.

103
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,440
Therefore, extraordinary accomplishments
require extraordinary people.

104
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,080
How extraordinary.

105
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,080
As extraordinary as I am ignorant.

106
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,360
No need for you to understand.

107
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,800
As long as I

108
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,240
and the officials above me understand it.

109
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,560
Just listen to these sentences.

110
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,720
Divide and reclaim the land
to rebuild the realm.

111
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,080
With Heaven's mandate to crush the rebels,

112
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,440
no rebellion can stand.

113
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,360
With righteous deeds to attain merit,

114
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,200
all great feats may be accomplished.

115
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,560
The sentences are magnificent

116
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,080
and every word is exquisite.

117
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,560
All of you are bumpkins.

118
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,960
Don't even dream of writing that,

119
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,160
not in this life or the next.

120
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,720
Sir, we specialize in repairing roofs
and catching chickens

121
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,000
for the residents.

122
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,280
You cannot compare us to them.

123
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,560
Exactly, sir.

124
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,040
Yes.

125
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,000
That's right, sir.

126
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,360
Sir! Sir!

127
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,760
What is it?

128
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,920
The imperial envoy is near the city gates.

129
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,040
All of you, pull yourselves together.

130
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,040
Come with me to meet the imperial envoy.

131
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,320
Huai'an? Where is our beloved Huai'an?

132
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,320
Huai'an!

133
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,800
Huai'an!

134
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,880
Huai'an! The imperial gazette is here!

135
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,640
XIE HUAI'AN

136
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,920
Be careful.

137
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,000
I just got it.

138
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,000
That's all you harvested after half a day?

139
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,800
The weather is good today.

140
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,640
I'm letting the paddy dry in the sun.

141
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,560
Sure. If you say so.

142
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,880
I've read the imperial gazette.

143
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,560
The latest issue is from a month ago.

144
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,560
It's fine even if it's late.

145
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,760
At least, we know
what is happening out there.

146
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,920
Huainan is remote and desolate.

147
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,400
What happens outside
has nothing to do with this place.

148
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,720
The weather is changing.

149
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,440
Yes. Rain is coming
from behind the mountain.

150
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,840
Ziya. Look at this article.

151
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,040
It has been a month since Xiao Wuyang
attacked Xigu Mountain City.

152
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,240
After passing Xigu Mountain City,

153
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,240
it's only 300 li from Chang'an.

154
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,280
There is no choke point in between

155
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,800
to defend against any attack.

156
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,480
I'm sure Chang'an
won't be captured so easily.

157
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,800
The Imperial Guards
are in charge of Chang'an's defense.

158
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,600
The soldiers are all from noble families.

159
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,560
They have adequate military strength,
but look at General Li.

160
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,280
His name is Li Longjing.

161
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,640
He is a coward.

162
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,920
Chang'an might have been captured already.

163
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,160
That's impossible.
An imperial envoy has come from Chang'an.

164
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,720
Zhou Mo is probably waiting at the gates

165
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,160
with your proclamation against the rebels.

166
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,880
What?

167
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,640
HUAINAN

168
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,800
Sir, what's taking them so long?

169
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,800
Waiting on your wife?

170
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,120
How fast do you want them?

171
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,880
You are useless.

172
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,680
HUAINAN DISTRICT OFFICE

173
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,080
What is it? Is the imperial envoy here?

174
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,120
I wrote a tribute for the new emperor.

175
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,040
Help me find it, now.

176
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,480
There's no congratulatory article here.
Didn't you write to condemn the rebels?

177
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,280
Zhou Mo took it
to meet the imperial envoy.

178
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,880
That article must not be submitted.

179
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,200
One and a half months ago,

180
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,920
Xiao Wuyang took Xigu Mountain City.

181
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,640
The city is only 300 li away
from Chang'an.

182
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,840
There's no choke point left to stop him.

183
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,160
I'm sure Chang'an
won't be captured that easily.

184
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,920
It has already been captured.

185
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,840
The imperial envoy serves the new emperor.

186
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,960
If Zhou Mo submits the article,
we'll all be dead.

187
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,480
- That's…
- Enough.

188
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,800
Look for it, quickly.

189
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,160
When did you write it?

190
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,480
Two years ago.

191
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,400
Two years ago?
Are you some kind of prophet?

192
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,200
Found it.

193
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,200
They are here. Play the music!

194
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,200
Quick, sound the drum.

195
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,600
Why does he look like a eunuch?

196
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,000
Look like a eunuch? He is a eunuch.

197
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,560
It's my first time seeing one.

198
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,440
Stop talking from now on.

199
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,200
I, the Magistrate of Huainan District,
Zhou Mo,

200
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,200
greet the imperial envoy.

201
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,360
You may stand, Magistrate.

202
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,760
Thank you, Imperial Envoy.

203
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,840
Huainan District is so remote.

204
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,520
I think I've traveled
70 li of mountainous roads

205
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,320
to arrive here from the county.

206
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,240
Sir, Huainan might be remote,

207
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,160
but every land here
belongs to the emperor.

208
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,360
The people of Huainan
are also blessed by His Majesty's grace.

209
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,160
You have a silver tongue.

210
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,200
Imperial Envoy,

211
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,960
I've prepared the best inn
in the district town

212
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,960
to give you a warm welcome.

213
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,800
That's right. One more thing.

214
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,760
We have prepared an article
for you to peruse

215
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,280
when you arrive.

216
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,720
Show me.

217
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,920
Sorry, sir. Are you hurt?

218
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,040
How absurd!

219
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,440
Which…

220
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,520
He's one of our own.

221
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,920
Sorry, Imperial Envoy.

222
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,680
I am the registrar here.

223
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,680
I apologize for my reckless action.

224
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,040
I'm very sorry.

225
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,360
Sorry.

226
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,280
Sir, this is
the congratulatory article you wrote.

227
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,400
Please show it to the imperial envoy.

228
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,560
Sir.

229
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,360
What a good article. How impressive.

230
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,400
I've traveled across the realm
and read 80 tributes

231
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,800
celebrating His Majesty's ascension.

232
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,560
This is the best one yet.

233
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,160
Mr. Zhou,
your literary talent is remarkable.

234
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,400
You shouldn't humble yourself
in this desolate place.

235
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,319
When I return,

236
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,160
I will put in a good word
to His Majesty for you.

237
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,440
Thank you, sir.

238
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,400
Oh. Beyond declaring the new emperor,

239
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,640
I had one more task.

240
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,960
I also traveled to your district
for one more purpose.

241
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,320
Do tell, sir.

242
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,240
Do you have someone called Xie Huai'an
in your district?

243
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,280
His Majesty has summoned Xie Huai'an
to the Capital.

244
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,360
I am Xie Huai'an.

245
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,720
The imperial envoy said

246
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,760
your journey to the Capital
would be paid for by the district office.

247
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,440
We must ensure a comfortable trip for you
in terms of food and accommodation.

248
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,960
Thank you, sir.

249
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,640
He also said

250
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,880
that when you arrive in Chang'an,

251
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,680
an academic named Li
from the Imperial Academy

252
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,200
will be there to receive you.

253
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,120
This man is famous in the Capital.

254
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,400
He will welcome you in person.

255
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,760
The imperial envoy also said…

256
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,080
He said something else?

257
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,640
His Majesty is going to meet Huai'an
in person

258
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,080
and order him to do something huge.

259
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,080
The imperial envoy
wants you to depart tomorrow

260
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,000
without any delay.

261
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,440
Huai'an,

262
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,360
you said you'd be my registrar forever.

263
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,640
Enough. Stop pouring.
He is completely drunk.

264
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,080
It's fine.

265
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,640
I'm going to leave anyway.

266
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,040
Tonight, just let him drink
to his heart's content.

267
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,240
Zhou Mo,

268
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,600
I used to tell you

269
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,600
I'd either be your registrar forever,

270
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,200
or head straight to the court.

271
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,160
I won't choose any other path.

272
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,640
Before today,

273
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,320
I thought I'd stay in Huainan forever.

274
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,760
You are a good superior
and a good friend of mine.

275
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,600
Being your registrar isn't that bad.

276
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,200
Sir, why are you crying?

277
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,360
He sounds so devoted.

278
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,560
My friend is loyal.

279
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,520
What's wrong with me
crying just for a while?

280
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:09,400
I believe you will complete
His Majesty's task dutifully.

281
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,400
Right?

282
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,880
The two of us will soon meet again.

283
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,040
Right?

284
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,640
That's right.

285
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,640
But it might not be necessary
to return here just to reunite.

286
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,600
This is a farewell gift.

287
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,200
I don't know if your career as an official
will be smooth in the future.

288
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,240
But if you are no longer an official
one day,

289
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,840
open this letter.

290
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,760
It'll be easier
for us to gather in the future.

291
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,840
All right.

292
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,480
Let's make a toast to Huai'an.

293
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,640
- Sure!
- Drink up!

294
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,760
Huai'an, may you soar to great heights.

295
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,400
<i>Huainan is good</i>

296
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,080
<i>A safe haven</i>

297
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:09,760
<i>The mountains and rivers</i>
<i>Stretch on like our affection</i>

298
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,720
<i>An affectionate person…</i>

299
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,040
When you were 17 years old,

300
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,600
you carried a tattered pack

301
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,200
and came to Huainan, a remote place,

302
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,280
like a homeless man.

303
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,120
You worked as a registrar for seven years,

304
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,840
and served four magistrates.

305
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,880
When they left, they wanted
to take you with them but you refused.

306
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:30,120
All of us knew
you were destined for great things.

307
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,760
We treated you well
not because we wanted you to help us out

308
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,800
when you achieved success one day,
but we did so out of sincerity.

309
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,200
However, you are also aloof.

310
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,240
Yes.

311
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,080
But that's who I am.

312
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,240
Are you that happy?

313
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,000
Lie here and count the stars
as your punishment.

314
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,240
Stars!

315
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,880
Stars, why are you so far away?

316
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,400
You are as far as Chang'an.

317
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,560
Enough already.

318
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,640
Do you know
why I only have two paths to choose from?

319
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,640
Why?

320
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,520
I am a descendant of a condemned official.

321
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,040
Fifteen years ago,
my family was wronged and annihilated.

322
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,680
I was fortunate enough to survive.

323
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,920
Since then, I've been living in hiding.

324
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,560
I slept in the wilderness.

325
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,640
I've lived in the reed swamps.

326
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,360
Had I taken one wrong step

327
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,960
back in those days,

328
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,160
I would have been dead.

329
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,320
Did your family
offend some powerful figures?

330
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,000
The dynasty's most powerful man.

331
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,280
The leader of the Huben Army,

332
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,120
Yan Fengshan.

333
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,240
Yan Fengshan?

334
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,280
His influence spreads
across the imperial court.

335
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,720
But times have changed.

336
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,640
Xiao Wuyang ascended
to the throne as a general.

337
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,360
He won't have Yan Fengshan around.

338
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,000
I don't know what he wants me to do,

339
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,120
and I don't know who recommends me.

340
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,640
But this is my opportunity.

341
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,240
I must grasp it.

342
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,840
Huai'an.

343
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,240
Are you trying
to clear your family's name?

344
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,240
Everyone is dead.

345
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,600
There's no use clearing their name.

346
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,480
I'm going to take revenge.

347
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,000
All right. Go back and rest.

348
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,160
Sleep for six hours.

349
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,800
We'll send you off
at the city gates in the morning.

350
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,360
Sure.

351
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,680
You all should rest too.

352
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,840
Sure.

353
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,040
Enough. Don't be sad.

354
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,280
I'm leaving.

355
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,160
Father!

356
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,440
- Go!
- Father!

357
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,480
Father!

358
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,560
Go!

359
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,080
Go!

360
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,560
Move a little.

361
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,640
You came back late
and you're still not sleeping?

362
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,400
- The sun is coming up.
- I'm not sleeping.

363
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,120
Why are you taking eggs?

364
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,960
Huai'an leaves for the Capital tomorrow.

365
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,200
I want to give him some eggs.

366
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,320
Here, cook the eggs
so he can take them with him on his way.

367
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,320
The journey to the Capital is long.

368
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,200
Cooked eggs go rotten in a few days.

369
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,840
What should we do?

370
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,440
Just give him some fresh eggs.

371
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,800
When he feels like eating them,

372
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,720
he just needs to start a fire,
boil some water, and cook them.

373
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,240
You are right.

374
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,960
As expected of my wife.

375
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,320
- Move.
- What's wrong?

376
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,720
You have no idea, do you?

377
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,640
The chickens will lay eggs in a while.

378
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,120
We can give Huai'an more.

379
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:04,440
CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR MAJESTY'S ASCENSION

380
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:16,120
CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR MAJESTY'S ASCENSION

381
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,280
What?

382
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,880
Are you sad to see me go

383
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,920
and want me dead instead?

384
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,960
Go inside.

385
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,400
Sit down.

386
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,800
You've read it?

387
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,600
News is hard to come by in Huainan.

388
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,600
I deduced what happened in Chang'an
by using old imperial gazettes.

389
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,560
But you already knew things had changed.

390
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,520
And your name, Zhou Mo,

391
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,480
must be a pseudonym.

392
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,440
I am with the Huben Army.

393
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,880
Huai'an, I didn't lie to you.

394
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,480
I didn't lie to Haoran or the rest.

395
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:21,240
What I have been showing all of you
is my true character.

396
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,000
However, I was a member of the Huben Army
before I met all of you.

397
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,200
General Yan Fengshan saved me.

398
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,200
I pledged my loyalty to him.

399
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,040
When you were talking
about your background,

400
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,760
I was shocked.

401
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,560
I did not expect my friend

402
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,640
to be a descendant of Liu Ziwen.

403
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,120
Is fate playing a joke on me?

404
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,680
Huai'an.

405
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,120
I might be one of the Huben Army's men,

406
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,720
but I've never killed anyone until today.

407
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,760
I did not expect the first person
I would kill to be my friend.

408
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,520
This cruel fate.

409
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,440
The imperial court must be crawling

410
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,880
with shadow agents.

411
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,800
Indeed.

412
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:14,000
They are like a shapeless net

413
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,320
that hangs above the imperial court.

414
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,680
You will never win against them.

415
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,320
This is indeed a cruel joke.

416
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:29,280
I thought I'd become a registrar
here forever,

417
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,800
but to my surprise…

418
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,120
Forget it.

419
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,000
Here.

420
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,920
Drink this farewell wine.

421
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,440
Forget that we've ever met.

422
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,120
Live or die, we'll have no regrets.

423
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,720
A cup for life

424
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,240
and a cup for death.

425
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,480
Come, Huai'an.

426
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,480
Life

427
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,520
for you.

428
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,680
When I was young,

429
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,160
my mother died in the north.

430
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,840
When I was ten years old,

431
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,520
my father died as well.

432
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,680
The whole Huben Army
defected and killed him.

433
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,880
I can't die.

434
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,520
I must get revenge on the Huben Army.

435
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,600
I'll kill any Huben soldiers I see

436
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,240
until none of them are left.

437
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,880
I collected the eggs for him.

438
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,840
Are you sure?

439
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,360
- I'm sure it was your wife who did that.
- I did it.

440
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,600
Huai'an.

441
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,600
- We are here to send you off.
- Huai'an.

442
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,800
- Look what we brought.
- Huai'an!

443
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,520
What happened?

444
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:15,960
Zhou Mo.

445
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,159
- Sir!
- What happened?

446
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,639
Don't ask.

447
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,159
It's not his fault.

448
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,800
Don't tell anyone.

449
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,600
Don't…

450
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,400
Don't trouble him.

451
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,480
We all

452
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,880
have our own reasons.

453
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,560
Zhou Mo.

454
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,639
- Zhou Mo.
- Sir!

455
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,320
Zhou Mo!

456
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,840
- Sir!
- Sir!

457
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,080
Sir!

458
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,960
What have you done?

459
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,000
That's Zhou Mo!

460
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,000
Stay away from me

461
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,160
if you don't want to die.

462
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,560
AUTUMNAL EQUINOX:
THUNDER BEGINS TO SOFTEN

463
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,600
INSECTS MAKE NESTS,
AND WATER BEGINS TO SOLIDIFY

464
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,920
The river runs cold. The chill cuts deep.

465
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,240
Travelers, move along.

466
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,240
Those near the riverbank,
stay away from the shore.

467
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,440
You truly surprise me.

468
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,400
This place could cost you your life.

469
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,400
Why did you come back?

470
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,240
Only one person is buried here.

471
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,280
It's not a dangerous place.

472
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,280
The real danger is Chang'an,
70 li away from us.

473
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,800
It seems you truly are only passing by.

474
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,800
I won't be sharing this fish
with you then.

475
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,880
I'm going back to Chang'an.

476
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,320
I don't know if I'll leave alive.

477
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,640
So, I came to see you

478
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,280
before I enter Chang'an.

479
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,800
Right.

480
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,120
You are bound to return one day.

481
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,480
Yes.

482
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,680
Your younger sister
went to Chang'an as well.

483
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,880
She went to study.

484
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,680
Perhaps she is an imperial scholar now.

485
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,760
I know.

486
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,320
Both of you are so far apart.

487
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,000
How did you know?

488
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,040
She has been writing letters to me.

489
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,040
I've been writing back too.

490
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,080
Why wouldn't you reunite with her?

491
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,800
I dare not.

492
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,320
It is best that we never reunite.

493
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,040
None of my family

494
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,880
ended up well.

495
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,080
The people of the Liu clan

496
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,960
suffer a harsh fate.

497
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,840
Her name has been changed.

498
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,000
Hopefully, she can live her life in peace.

499
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,480
You've changed your name as well.

500
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,840
You must be safe.

501
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,800
Come.

502
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,680
CHANG'AN

503
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,200
Mr. Huai'an,
we are both here to pick you up.

504
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,040
Winter starts today. Snow is falling hard.

505
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,600
Thank you, both.

506
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,360
- Mister, let me carry it.
- Open the gates.

507
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,120
This way.
