00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,540
When they start cooking, the smoke drifts over.

196
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,230
Huai'an,

197
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,300
I don't think they mend pots here.

198
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,540
Let's ask.

199
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:04,940
Sir,

200
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:06,820
my pot is broken.

201
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,100
Take a look.

202
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,700
Can you mend it?

203
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:13,710
I can.

204
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,180
When do you want it done?

205
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,110
Today?

206
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:19,770
Not today.

207
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:21,730
I'm too tired to walk.

208
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,420
Tomorrow.

209
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,100
Tomorrow?

210
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,540
At night?

211
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,250
Not at night.

212
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:31,970
Tomorrow at the Shen hour.

213
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:33,970
Shen hour?

214
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,370
Very well.

215
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,830
I'll have it done then.

216
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,010
My thanks.

217
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,510
Think nothing of it.

218
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:42,940
Let's go.

219
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,300
Huai'an,

220
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,490
there was something odd

221
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,540
about that man.

222
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,130
How so?

223
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,240
He almost

224
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:58,850
seemed

225
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,100
afraid of you.

226
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,460
You're overthinking things.

227
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,980
Come with me to a clinic.

228
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,120
If we could return to Taiyiji,

229
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,930
we wouldn't need to go to another clinic.

230
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,210
Can a clinic in a place like this

231
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,220
really be trusted?

232
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,300
Yes.

233
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,160
Your senior brother's life was saved there.

234
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:27,750
Really?

235
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,500
Yi Zhihu.

236
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,260
Yi Zhihu is real?

237
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,650
How did you meet this physician?

238
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,850
I've been hunted for years.

239
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,780
One winter, Yi crossed paths with me

240
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,130
and saved me.

241
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:41,900
Yi said obsession

242
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,100
as deep as mine had never been seen

243
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,850
and wished to see how my story would end.

244
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,650
Yi Zhihu,

245
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,780
you're a woman?

246
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,690
I thought Yi would be some ugly old man.

247
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,740
Rumor says

248
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,210
that a northern healer, hideous of face,

249
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,820
can bring the dying back to life

250
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,890
and wed a young bride at 50.

251
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,540
But in truth, Yi Zhihu

252
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,500
is a woman.

253
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,300
The ugly one

254
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:17,980
is her helper.

255
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,850
Those who come to me

256
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,500
have all been to the verge of death.

257
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,450
Without a few tricks,

258
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,410
I couldn't have survived.

259
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,820
Treating your senior brother last time, for example,

260
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,220
drew the Huben guards upon me.

261
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,410
Aren't you going to step out?

262
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,410
Why should I?

263
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,920
I need to examine his wounds.

264
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,520
There's no need to keep things from Xiaoqing.

265
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,770
There's nothing

266
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,370
she can't know.

267
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:07,220
Is that so?

268
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,840
Seems to me you're still hiding something from her.

269
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,820
Where is he?

270
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,060
The King of Tiemo is in the city now.

271
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,260
Is your blade ready?

272
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,850
With the enemy at the gates,

273
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,540
killing him alone won't be enough.

274
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,980
I've devised a plan

275
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,580
to kill every Tiemo invader.

276
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,460
Do you have enough forces?

277
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,810
Of course.

278
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:28,880
- General. - General.

279
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,760
- General. - General.

280
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:33,900
Where are the others?

281
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,420
Have my orders

282
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,500
lost all weight in this camp?

283
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:38,900
General,

284
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,260
the other officers

285
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,130
are gone.

286
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,130
What did you say?

287
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,600
The other officers

288
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,610
and their men

289
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:45,850
have vanished.

290
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,220
Have they deserted?

291
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,500
Then track them down!

292
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,450
General,

293
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,130
it's been nearly five days.

294
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,370
We have

295
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,810
no trail to follow.

296
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,130
Xiang Xuehuai!

297
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:14,550
Please.

298
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,310
How are you

299
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,420
still drinking tea?

300
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,500
Look,

301
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,410
he caught us.

302
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,560
This is Mr. Xie Huai'an's friend,

303
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,110
Ye Zheng.

304
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,980
He's brought Mr. Xie's command.

305
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,370
Whatever the order is,

306
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,410
we have a greater internal crisis.

307
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,060
Do you realize

308
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:35,850
what is happening?

309
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,440
Six entire units have disappeared!

310
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,450
I know that.

311
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,950
That was due to Mr. Xie's first order.

312
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,550
Then why didn't you tell me?

313
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,940
Calm yourself.

314
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,000
I knew your temper,

315
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,070
so I held back.

316
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,270
The messenger that day

317
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,120
was from the Huben Army.

318
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,210
This letter is from Xie Huai'an.

319
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,450
If we follow his strategy,

320
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,100
we may

321
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,560
have a chance to defeat the Tiemo people.

322
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,360
Farewell.

323
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,310
Wait.

324
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,690
Why are you helping us?

325
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,580
You are soldiers.

326
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,930
So are we.

327
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,470
That's why Xie Huai'an

328
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,650
trusts me.

329
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,340
Where will you go next?

330
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,650
The four regional commanders hold massive forces.

331
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,300
I will carry Xie Huai'an's order

332
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,780
to each of them.

333
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,440
Five days ago,

334
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,860
Mr. Xie Huai'an secretly ordered me

335
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,540
to send out

336
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:51,980
our finest troops.

337
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,930
Where were they sent?

338
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,650
They're all in Chang'an.

339
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,060
When do we strike,

340
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,890
and what is the signal?

341
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,500
Tomorrow

342
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,650
at the Shen hour.

343
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,260
The wind will rise.

344
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,100
Where have you been?

345
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,740
Zheng, how thoughtful you are.

346
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:58,930
You look grumpy,

347
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:00,610
but the congee you made smells wonderful.

348
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:01,580
Thank you.

349
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,500
You and that mouth of yours.

350
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:06,450
Come in.

351
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,580
The food's ready.

352
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,820
Tiemo shadow guards won't risk alerting us.

353
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,360
If they're walking openly with axes,

354
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,210
they're likely just ordinary neighbors.

355
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:30,980
Come on.

356
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,930
Cen Pickles!

357
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,820
Is Cen Pickles not home?

358
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,820
Why are you here?

359
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,100
For a meal!

360
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,930
You've run out of grain already?

361
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,100
We're saving it.

362
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,130
Once war starts,

363
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,610
supplies may be cut off at any moment.

364
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,740
We eat his grain first,

365
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,610
then ours. Come on.

366
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,610
Shameless.

367
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,410
You "flatter" us.

368
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:43,590
Your Majesty.

369
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,040
Have you found Xie Huai'an?

370
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,370
Not yet.

371
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,610
We're sending more men to search.

372
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,520
He's Liu Ziwen's son.

373
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,740
Everything

374
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,890
the Huben Army learned, he learned.

375
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,210
Finding him

376
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,850
won't be easy.

377
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,580
There is another matter

378
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,500
Your Majesty may want to hear.

379
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,000
Speak.

380
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,200
Sha from the wonton stall

381
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,680
treated Xiao Wenjing

382
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:13,610
to a bowl of rice.

383
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:16,710
Rice?

384
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:17,600
Yes.

385
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,210
He used the chance

386
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,020
to see how many of us

387
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,650
were tailing Xiao Wenjing.

388
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,260
They may

389
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:33,960
act soon.

390
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,150
Then we've likely

391
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:41,060
found Xie Huai'an.

392
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,670
And Cen Weizong.

393
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,620
Thank you.

394
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,870
All right, that's enough.

395
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,070
Full?

396
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:11,140
Yes.

397
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:11,890
Good. We're leaving!

398
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,320
- We'll take the clay pot tomorrow. - We're leaving.

399
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,440
Carry the ax for me.

400
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:15,490
We're leaving.

401
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:16,410
I'll come back tomorrow.

402
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,580
- We're leaving, sir. - Be careful.

403
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,690
Come on.

404
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,450
Your neighbors in Ronghua Alley

405
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:28,100
are treating your home like it's a granary.

406
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,060
Those few you saw,

407
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,540
plus the ones who didn't come today,

408
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,740
come here to eat

409
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,890
whenever they like.

410
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,810
I gave them nicknames:

411
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,370
Gulouzi,

412
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:45,500
Gourd Chicken,

413
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:46,740
Noodle Soup,

414
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:47,890
and Boiled Lamb.

415
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,740
Food is the primary need of the people.

416
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,700
When grain runs out,

417
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,810
their world collapses.

418
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,200
Sha told me

419
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,890
that in the old days,

420
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,980
the founding emperor, you, my father,

421
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,850
and Wu Zhongheng

422
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,500
often gathered in that little shop

423
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,780
for a bowl of wontons.

424
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,680
Sha worked all night

425
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,780
and barely earned a few coins.

426
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,020
So he complained?

427
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:25,540
But he's right.

428
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,650
It's been nearly 20 years.

429
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,690
Among the few of us, I'm the one

430
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:31,780
who achieved the least.

431
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:33,840
But I enjoyed

432
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,090
being with my friends.

433
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,780
Wu Zhongheng

434
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,060
is now the King of Tiemo.

435
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,690
Are you still friends?

436
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,260
Most likely not.

437
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,890
After your father

438
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,260
hung the red silk on the hemlock tree,

439
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,220
I never showed up again.

440
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,920
Wu Zhongheng must have known then

441
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,890
that I belonged to the Liu faction.

442
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,650
If we were still friends,

443
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,650
I could have walked into his courtyard

444
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:39,460
to assassinate him,

445
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,070
regardless of the outcome.

446
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,330
The Grand Preceptor cannot die.

447
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,260
As for killing him,

448
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,830
I already have a plan.

449
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,600
Are you hungry?

450
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,020
Want some congee?

451
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:37,780
Here.

452
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,410
No, thanks.

453
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:39,080
You go on and eat.

454
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,090
I'm not hungry.

455
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,260
Then why the long face?

456
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,260
I feel uneasy.

457
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,900
It's freezing out there,

458
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:02,130
yet he sits alone like that.

459
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,530
He'll catch a cold.

460
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,040
- I'll call him back. - Don't.

461
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:12,770
We'd better

462
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,170
let him be.

463
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,820
[You hour]

464
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,480
Open the door.

465
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,290
Yes, sir.

466
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,310
My men have been negligent.

467
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,500
You are, after all, about to be emperor.

468
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,260
How could they serve you a meal like this?

469
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,460
The empire is collapsing.

470
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,670
What emperor?

471
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:35,180
It's only a show,

472
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,170
with me playing the monkey

473
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,420
for the Tiemo people.

474
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,130
This is the peace treaty I drafted.

475
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,770
Accept it,

476
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,460
and you can save your nation,

477
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,750
Your Majesty.

478
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,000
[Firstly, the two nations shall be as brothers.]

479
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,400
[Secondly, the three prefectures north of North Office are ceded to Tiemo.]

480
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,950
"All land north of North Office

481
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:19,090
belongs to Tiemo"?

482
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,940
"Annual tribute: 250,000 liang of gold,

483
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:33,020
250,000 liang of silver,

484
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,420
100,000 horses,

485
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,940
300,000 bolts of silk,

486
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,660
[900,000 dan of grain]

487
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,900
and 900,000 dan of grain"?

488
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,290
Even the fertile fields of Ganzhou

489
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,770
yield only 200,000 dan a year.

490
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,500
Huzhou, Huai'an, and the others

491
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:12,240
yield less than 100,000 dan a year.

492
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,170
Yet you demand 900,000 in tribute?

493
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,500
You call this a peace treaty?

494
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,940
Isn't this

495
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,010
just turning my people

496
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:31,920
into your slaves

497
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,230
and livestock?

498
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,570
Past Xigu Mountain City,

499
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,500
Chang'an has no natural defenses left.

500
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,380
My main forces

501
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,820
are just 300 li away.

502
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,290
When they arrive,

503
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:58,170
the well-off people of Chang'an

504
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:00,980
won't just be slaves or livestock.

505
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,820
Even the chance to stay alive

506
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,940
won't belong to everyone.

507
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:16,380
Tomorrow,

508
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,210
tear off that mask of yours,

509
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:21,060
show yourself as the Emperor of Chang'an,

510
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,640
and sit on your throne.

511
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,850
We will seal this treaty by exchanging

512
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,630
letters of credence.

513
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:32,860
In return,

514
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,800
your people will live.

515
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,730
I was once a useless emperor,

516
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,340
blind to the sufferings of the people.

517
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,570
But now I understand.

518
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,340
A bowl of rice

519
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,650
or a single flatbread

520
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,820
can be the line between life and death.

521
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,500
If you can't even give them that,

522
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,330
then attack.

523
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,420
When you do, the people of Chang'an

524
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,770
will die fighting with you.

525
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,540
You can try.

526
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,170
If you lose,

527
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,020
Chang'an will be a wasteland.

528
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,020
Monster.

529
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:28,340
But so am I.

530
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:45,730
Huai'an.

531
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:47,980
Why are you sharpening my blade?

532
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:03,760
Here.

533
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:05,390
It's done.

534
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:17,880
Huai'an,

535
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,450
you're acting strangely today.

536
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,570
Are you hiding something from me?

537
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:24,650
No.

538
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,230
You're the one hiding something.

539
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,140
The pageboy is locked in the Imperial Guard Station.

540
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:37,610
You scouted out the place, right?

541
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,020
So?

542
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,820
Did you find a way to rescue him?

543
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:42,900
You knew?

544
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:46,720
We're friends.

545
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,390
How could I not know what you're thinking?

546
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,060
I'm not confident.

547
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:55,440
There are too many guards.

548
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:56,460
It's hard to break in.

549
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,560
Once the Shen-hour plan begins,

550
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,340
the Tiemo people will kill him the moment

551
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:01,210
they feel threatened.

552
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,340
He won't die.

553
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:04,980
Give me a battalion.

554
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,130
I will take

555
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:07,730
the station within two hours.

556
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:10,380
If you storm it, he may truly die.

557
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,090
Ye Zheng,

558
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,250
the Shen-hour plan

559
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,610
cannot afford

560
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,900
a single misstep.

561
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,540
Therefore,

562
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,840
you must appear at the exact place

563
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,090
I designated for you

564
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:29,820
and wait for me there.

565
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:33,420
I will

566
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,290
rescue the pageboy.

567
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,730
How?

568
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:42,010
Yesterday,

569
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,500
I had Sha serve him a bowl of rice.

570
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,380
I let the Tiemo people see it on purpose

571
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:48,610
so they'd believe

572
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,820
I intended to rescue him.

573
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,170
That means today,

574
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:54,820
the pageboy will be

575
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,020
forced to exchange letters of credence with Tiemo

576
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:00,020
as the Emperor of Chang'an,

577
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:01,540
and

578
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:04,210
the best moment to act is when he is

579
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:06,610
on his way to the palace.

580
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:10,290
But

581
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:12,650
why expose such a flaw?

582
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:13,860
It's the only

583
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,500
and the most convincing way.

584
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,570
Only by doing so

585
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,380
can the Shen-hour plan

586
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,940
remain concealed.

587
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:23,650
No.

588
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:24,640
Absolutely not.

589
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,420
You will expose yourself.

590
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:27,820
You will be risking your life!

591
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:30,860
It is a life for a life.

592
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,500
Ye Zheng,

593
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,900
if you were the one in danger,

594
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,020
I would do the same.

595
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:41,210
But...

596
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:42,090
Enough.

597
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:43,940
No more arguing.

598
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:46,540
If we do manage to drive out the Tiemo people,

599
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:47,730
don't forget

600
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,730
to reunite with Zhaolu.

601
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,230
I will.

602
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:55,270
When all this ends,

603
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:56,340
I will find her.

604
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,430
But until then,

605
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:59,250
I must keep you safe.

606
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:00,770
If anything happens to you,

607
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,090
what meaning will my life have left?

608
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,500
I know

609
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,500
that once you decide something,

610
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:18,940
no one can sway you.

611
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,340
Since following you,

612
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,210
I've never questioned your decisions

613
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:26,540
or faltered

614
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:28,460
in carrying out your orders.

615
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,020
But this is different.

616
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:31,860
You're walking straight to your death.

617
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:34,940
Huai'an,

618
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:38,900
sometimes you should put yourself first.

619
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:53,940
Huai'an,

620
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,170
your hair...

621
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:05,020
I was born white-haired,

622
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,220
and I'll die white-haired.

623
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:11,030
What is there to fear?

624
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:23,900
All right,

625
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:25,820
time for me to go.

626
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:27,900
At the Shen hour,

627
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:29,630
we'll meet again.
