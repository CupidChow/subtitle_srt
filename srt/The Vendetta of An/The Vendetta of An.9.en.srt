1
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,880
Mr. Long,

2
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,680
I've never had a serious illness
or chronic condition.

3
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,000
Why do I have
to come for my pulse check every month?

4
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,680
You were born with white hair.

5
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,400
Only at this age
has it fully turned black.

6
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,760
Ancient texts say

7
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,320
children born white-haired
face half a life of hardship.

8
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,880
No one can command the workings of fate.

9
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,759
Your father and I both hope
you grow up safe.

10
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,040
So what if half my life is hardship?

11
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,600
What matters is
the rest brims with sweetness.

12
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,920
True.

13
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,160
So young, yet already so enlightened.

14
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,120
Thank you, Mr. Long. I'll be going now.

15
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,840
Half a life of hardship,
half a life of sweetness.

16
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,320
The worry is you might have
only the bitter half.

17
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,720
I have to go.

18
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,240
-Where are you going?
-Gu Yu was taken by Huben.

19
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,000
Barring surprises, they'll hold Gu Yu
in Hidden Soldier Alley.

20
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,840
Therefore, I must infiltrate
Hidden Soldier Alley and rescue Gu Yu.

21
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,360
-You must be joking.
-You're injured

22
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,960
and still want to risk your life?
Are you mad?

23
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,680
He's right.
You haven't even recovered yet.

24
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,520
Going into Hidden Soldier Alley now
is as good as a death sentence.

25
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,400
He's right. And consider me too.

26
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,600
You just secured a safe place for me.

27
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,800
What if Huben comes after me again
after you leave?

28
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,640
What can he do?
He's all brawn and no brain.

29
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,440
-He can't handle them.
-I'll handle you right now.

30
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,960
But on the other hand,

31
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,280
compared to you,
I'm better suited to fighting and killing.

32
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,120
I must be the one
to enter the enemy's lair.

33
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,080
No.

34
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,160
I must go.

35
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,200
If anyone knows Huben the best, it's me.

36
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,560
Why are you staring at me?
Get back to work.

37
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,160
I…

38
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,720
STEAMED BUNS

39
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,080
Come in.

40
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,000
You're heading into Hidden Soldier Alley.

41
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,440
Can I help with anything?

42
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,880
Or is there something I can do for you?

43
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,720
Actually, I do require some preparations.

44
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,400
First, to enter Hidden Soldier Alley,

45
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,440
I'll need Huben's custom gold coins.

46
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,960
Qingyi has one.

47
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,000
Go get it.

48
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,400
If he refuses,

49
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,520
you're to order
the death of every Huben member

50
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,960
who has seen my face

51
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,840
on the night of the raid.

52
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,480
Well…

53
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,800
What if he agrees?

54
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,640
He won't.

55
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,680
Move it!

56
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,159
I'm not forcing you to kill.

57
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,679
I just want you to understand
that this is a ruthless world.

58
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,120
Some blood…

59
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,000
must be spilled.

60
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,600
Maybe you'll face moments like this
in the future.

61
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,360
When that time comes,
you'll know what to do.

62
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,000
The second thing.

63
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,400
I need a new identity.

64
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,600
Xiaoqing's already handled that.

65
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,560
IMPERIAL PHYSICIAN'S HALL

66
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,960
That's a massive and showy sign.

67
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,760
Can we even trust that physician?

68
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,720
Got it.

69
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,240
What's all the--

70
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,960
BLESSINGS ABOUND

71
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,040
Come in. Get inside.

72
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,880
The door…

73
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,600
The members of Huben
have been acting discreetly.

74
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,800
Few come and go in Chang'an.

75
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,480
Our people have watched for some time.

76
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,680
Only this man here fits your criteria.

77
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,040
His name is Wang Xing.
His age and build are similar to yours.

78
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,560
He knows no martial arts.
His moves are as clumsy as yours.

79
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,960
He has no close friends.

80
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,080
But he's married.

81
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,080
His wife resides in Chang'an.

82
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,440
Did you get everything out of him?

83
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,040
Of course.
You can trust me to get the job done.

84
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,360
Not enough yet. Question him again.

85
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,120
Bring his wife here.

86
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,880
If his answers don't match,

87
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,360
break a finger and give it to him.

88
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,760
That's the only way to secure
reliable answers.

89
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,880
You heard him.

90
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,240
Weigh your words carefully.

91
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,200
What if anything goes wrong?

92
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,600
You might have ten fingers,

93
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,400
but that won't save your wife
from breaking.

94
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,160
You're animals.

95
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,280
Even if you ask me 100 times,

96
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,280
I'll still answer the same.

97
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,440
Come at me all you want.

98
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,320
But if you so much
as lay a finger on my wife…

99
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,040
I'm talking to you!

100
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,160
I swear I'll…

101
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,560
So, when do we bring his wife here?

102
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,520
IMPERIAL PHYSICIAN'S HALL

103
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,040
All these passes were seized
from Wang Xing.

104
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,440
He's a skilled forger.

105
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,840
Even I nearly missed the flaws.

106
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,000
He's an expert.

107
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,120
No wonder Huben transferred him here.

108
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,960
Hidden Soldier Alley

109
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,320
always stations experts
to forge papers and identities.

110
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:35,080
Since the new emperor
issued his warrant against Huben,

111
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,640
any Huben men in the capital

112
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,680
need forged travel passes
for even the slightest movement.

113
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,520
Something must have happened
to the previous forger.

114
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,720
That's why they need
an outsider to fill in.

115
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,840
Where's Wang Xing's gold coin?

116
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,400
I almost forgot about that.

117
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,280
You didn't forget.
You wanted it for yourself.

118
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,560
Remember.

119
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,600
These coins will bring death
if used anywhere else.

120
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,840
They're only for coming
and going in Hidden Soldier Alley.

121
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,320
Huai'an.

122
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,560
You're injured, and you insist on
taking this mission on alone.

123
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,520
I'm worried.

124
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,560
Don't worry.

125
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,720
I bought you
a flatbread stall outside the alley.

126
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,440
If something happens, I'll contact you.

127
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,520
But not you. The stall
is too close to Hidden Soldier Alley.

128
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,600
You can't go there. You'll work
at the physician's hall in the meantime.

129
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,880
-That's not necessary.
-No.

130
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:01,000
I… I feel safer if I'm with you.

131
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,440
Last time I delivered a letter,
I caused trouble for you.

132
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,800
I need to vet all my people.

133
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,920
Now, I only have
a few trusted ones who can be used.

134
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,280
I can't take care of him too.
And that Wang Xing as well.

135
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,200
Get him out of here as soon as possible.

136
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,640
The physician's hall
may not be safe either.

137
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,760
Then, why don't I
watch over that Wang Xing?

138
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,760
You?

139
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,560
Yes. You just need to tie him up securely.

140
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,640
I'll watch him and bring his meals.

141
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,840
That's simple enough.

142
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,960
But where will we hold him?

143
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,360
Well…

144
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,640
The place where they locked me up before.

145
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,400
I'll just do as you guys did
and put him there.

146
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,560
All right. It's settled, then.

147
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,920
If you slip up and Wang Xing runs back

148
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,200
to Hidden Soldier Alley,

149
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,880
the whole plan will fall apart.

150
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,360
And I'll lose my life.

151
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,520
Don't worry.

152
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,520
Your life is in my hands. Safe and sound.

153
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,400
Master.

154
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,960
You just escaped death,
and now you're going to risk it again?

155
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,160
Have you thought this through?

156
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,040
The Huben Army was built
by my father's own hands.

157
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,040
What they can do,
I've learned by ear and eye.

158
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,360
What they can't, I've taught myself much.

159
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,000
I know what I'm doing, Mr. Long.

160
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,560
I've sealed your wounds with fish maw

161
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,480
and covered them with human skin.

162
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,760
You look no different from anyone else.

163
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,960
No one will notice
unless they get up close.

164
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,280
You were born with white hair.

165
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,360
As you aged,

166
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,760
the white turned black.

167
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:07,760
Both your father and I share one wish.

168
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,160
We only hope you live safely

169
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,240
to see your hair turn gray once more.

170
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,520
My boy,

171
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,240
come back alive.

172
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,240
IMPERIAL PHYSICIAN'S HALL

173
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,040
BLESSINGS ABOUND, MISFORTUNE FADES

174
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,800
Don't look at me like that.

175
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,440
When everything's settled,
I'll dye my hair black again.

176
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,520
Let's go.

177
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:11,880
Is this the Hidden Soldier Alley
you mentioned?

178
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,359
No.

179
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,960
Did you bring
the clean clothes I asked for?

180
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,000
Yes. They're in the carriage.

181
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,000
Huai'an, what exactly are you looking at?

182
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:45,040
I'm wondering how badly I'd be hurt
if I tumbled down this mountain.

183
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,920
Are you joking?

184
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,400
If you fall, you won't survive…

185
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,200
Huai'an!

186
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,120
Xie Huai'an!

187
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,280
Huai'an. Huai'an. Are you all right?

188
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,480
Have you lost your mind?
Did you actually want to die?

189
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,560
Xie Huai'an, why did you do that?
Have you lost your senses?

190
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,280
If you die, what'll happen to me?
Who'll protect me?

191
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,440
That's why I was trying
to find the right spot.

192
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,400
These injuries will be useful
inside Hidden Soldier Alley.

193
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,160
Come on. Help me up.

194
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,480
Are you all right?

195
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,400
What's that in your hand?

196
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,400
They call this Bitter-After.

197
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,560
It grows in the north
and is extremely bitter.

198
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,040
I observed Wang Xing.
He has a habit of chewing on this.

199
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,040
The taste is certainly bitter.

200
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,200
I don't believe you.

201
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,080
It can't be that bitter. Let me try it.

202
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,600
This is incredibly bitter.

203
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,760
Why would anyone like to chew this stuff?

204
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,440
Bitterness refreshes and relieves fatigue.

205
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,080
The people in the north chew it
to stave off the cold.

206
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,800
It's not that bad.
Why do they call it Bitter-After?

207
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,720
People in the old days
chose their words for a reason.

208
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,680
Once you chew it, the stalk's gone

209
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,360
and all that's left is the bitter taste.

210
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,480
That's inauspicious.

211
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,240
All right.

212
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,520
Beyond here lies
the territory of Hidden Soldier Alley.

213
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,120
I'll travel the rest of the path alone.

214
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:58,080
Can you two not look so gloomy for once?

215
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,480
Fine. What wishes do you both have?

216
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,240
I won't die before I grant them.

217
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,840
What wishes can I have?

218
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,720
I just hope you get justice soon,

219
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,040
reunite with Bai Wan, and enjoy calm days.

220
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,160
Don't strain yourself.

221
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,920
Same here.

222
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,080
I don't expect
to be emperor when I return.

223
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,200
I entrust my wishes to you.

224
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,080
I hope you take revenge
and wipe out all of Huben,

225
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,080
then live an ordinary, peaceful life.

226
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,840
All right.

227
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,480
I'll take your blessing. I'll be back.

228
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,200
Halt.

229
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,120
Wait for the contact.

230
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,920
Make way.

231
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,880
You're chewing the wrong end.

232
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,240
The bottom part is the most bitter.

233
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,880
What's that to you?

234
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,040
You're busy this morning.

235
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,880
It's becoming warmer.

236
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,520
If I don't clean up soon,
these alleys will stink before long.

237
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,000
There's no hurry.
Take your breakfast first.

238
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,480
Di Lu, are you waiting for someone today?

239
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,720
It's a newcomer.
I'm just about to fetch him.

240
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,160
Why? Something wrong?

241
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,800
Isn't there a general
locked up in the alley?

242
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,880
Mr. Wang Pu warned us to stay alert.

243
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,160
That general is a man of rank.
Someone might come to rescue him.

244
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,040
Do check this newcomer carefully.

245
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,160
How do I check him?
You're smarter than I am.

246
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,040
I'll do whatever you tell me to do.

247
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,280
He's been standing here long enough.
Hurry and take him away.

248
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,320
Wang Xing?

249
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,680
Come with me.

250
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,960
Everyone, stop a moment.

251
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,440
This is Wang Xing.

252
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,640
Xing, what do you think of the paper?

253
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,360
It's too thick, and the color is wrong.

254
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,800
The pulp needs to be finer.

255
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,600
Don't soak it too long.

256
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,680
Or else, the paper will go too soft.

257
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,320
Wang Xing. Our new fellow.

258
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,320
He'll be in charge of
all travel permits here.

259
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,160
Xing, work can wait.

260
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,320
Come with me.

261
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,680
The last man who did this job
was known as Ren.

262
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,120
He died of illness last month.

263
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,520
He lived here and worked here.

264
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,640
Do you mind staying here?

265
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,360
No. I'm fine with it.

266
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,400
Good. Then this will be your station.

267
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,160
Everyone outside
will follow your instructions.

268
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,640
But some procedures can't be skipped.

269
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,920
Show me your permit from the Capital.

270
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,880
All right.

271
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,680
TRAVEL PASS

272
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,880
Check his travel pass.

273
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,560
See when he set off and from where.

274
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,680
Every prefecture and sub-prefecture
he passed has left its seal.

275
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,040
Go through the seals one by one.

276
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,640
If he arrived more or less on time,

277
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,560
there should be no issue.

278
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,920
But if the timing is far off, take heed.

279
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,080
All right. I'll get to it.

280
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,800
I just don't understand.

281
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,760
You're so smart,
but you ended up collecting trash.

282
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,440
What was Wang Pu thinking?

283
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,640
You ask me? Who am I supposed to ask?

284
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,800
THE EIGHTH DAY OF THE TWELFTH MONTH,
FOURTH YEAR OF WENCHENG

285
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,720
CUI LUNIAN, INSPECTOR OF CHANG'AN

286
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,920
Guards.

287
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:16,760
You should've arrived three days ago.
The weather's been clear.

288
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,680
Why are you late? Explain yourself.

289
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,480
Answer the question.

290
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,400
Speak.

291
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,960
Where did you get this wound?

292
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,040
I met a man on the road.

293
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,400
He said he knew me
and forced me to forge a pass.

294
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,440
I refused, and we fought.

295
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:54,640
In the end, I stabbed him
a few times when he let his guard down

296
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,560
and killed him.

297
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,520
I fainted after that.

298
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,880
That delayed my trip.

299
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,360
Why didn't you report it?

300
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,240
I didn't dare.

301
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,400
Who did you kill?

302
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,960
Liu Ziyan.

303
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,600
You killed Liu Ziyan?

304
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,680
He was the Huben Army's top killer.
You killed him?

305
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,800
Di, I'm telling the truth.

306
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,320
When I met him,

307
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:36,160
he was badly wounded and nearly done for.

308
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,400
How many times did you stab him?

309
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,000
Where did you stab him?

310
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,600
The first stab was aimed at his chest,

311
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,960
but he grabbed my dagger.

312
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,360
I pulled it out
and stabbed a few more times.

313
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,080
I was afraid he'd survive.

314
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,080
So maybe ten stabs.

315
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,160
Where's the body?

316
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,520
In the forest 30 li south of the city.

317
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,240
I panicked

318
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,800
and dumped the body before running.

319
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,720
Watch him.

320
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,960
I'll be back.

321
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,480
Yes, sir.

322
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,800
What?

323
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,600
You hang around
that garbage collector all day

324
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,080
and don't mind his stink,

325
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,280
but when you're here, you're picky now?

326
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,080
They smell completely different.

327
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,040
How was it? Have you checked?

328
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,480
How many wounds?

329
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,080
I have. Eleven stab wounds.

330
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,280
Done by two different groups.

331
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,200
Here, look.

332
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,440
These stabs have clean edges.

333
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,400
The blade went in and out fast.

334
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,600
Skilled hands.

335
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,160
They should be from our people.

336
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,680
As for these wounds, they're serious,

337
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,240
but they avoided all the vital spots.

338
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,760
The real fatal wounds are nine.

339
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,480
Two to the chest,
the other seven to the abdomen.

340
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,120
Judging by the cuts,
the stabs were forceful,

341
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,440
but the depth varies.

342
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,880
Their edges are rolled back.

343
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,200
That means the blade
didn't go in or out cleanly.

344
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,800
Whoever stabbed him meant to kill,

345
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,720
but wasn't used to handling a weapon.

346
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,640
As for the wound on the arm,
shallow inside and deep outside.

347
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,920
Likely caused when he grabbed the blade

348
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
as the attacker tried to pull it back.

349
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,360
Could it have been staged after death?

350
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,040
A dead man can't grab anything.

351
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:00,040
Someone would've had to
press his hand onto the blade.

352
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,960
But if so, the force wouldn't be even.

353
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,360
Therefore, you wouldn't
get such a clean cut.

354
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,400
Carry on.

355
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,000
Keep writing. I'm just looking.

356
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,880
BY GUO ZI'AN

357
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,880
Your handwriting looks good.

358
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,080
Impressive.

359
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,600
You're way better than Ren.

360
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,160
Di.

361
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,240
-You…
-Sit.

362
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,400
Don't be nervous.

363
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,280
I came here to apologize.

364
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,080
I was too rash before.

365
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,240
I'd like to buy you a drink
and dinner tonight

366
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,480
to calm your nerves.

367
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,520
What do you think?

368
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,880
-I told you I'm fine.
-Yes.

369
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,320
More than fine.

370
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,000
You even killed Liu Ziyan.

371
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,640
That was something many wanted
but couldn't do.

372
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,560
Xing, you've got both brains and brawn.

373
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,760
You have a bright future.

374
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,160
Whether I have a future isn't the point.

375
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,360
What matters is I didn't lose my life.

376
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,920
What kind of talk is that?

377
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,640
All right then.

378
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,320
See you at the mutton-soup stall tonight.

379
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,720
I'll buy you a good drink.

380
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,280
I think I'll pass.

381
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,560
It's settled.

382
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,760
I'll introduce you to a friend.

383
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,400
I've prepared a gift for you.

384
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,200
You'll like it.

385
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,320
All right. See you tonight.

386
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,600
I'll hurry and finish this work.

387
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,160
Go on with your tasks.

388
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,600
I told you.

389
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,400
You're different from the rest of them.

390
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,679
How am I supposed to eat it
when you put it on the ground?

391
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,280
How about this, lad? Put it on my leg.

392
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,040
Leave the rest to me.

393
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,480
On your leg?

394
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,120
After I leave,
you'll find a way to drop the bowl,

395
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,960
break it, take a shard,

396
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,880
cut the rope, and escape.

397
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,200
I pity you,

398
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,800
but I'm no fool.

399
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,760
Lad, I can't reach the bowl.

400
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,800
Think of something yourself.

401
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:16,280
You can lean your whole body over,

402
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:20,400
then press your face
to the ground, like a dog.

403
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,640
I've done it before.

404
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,320
You can do the same.

405
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,880
Wang Xing.

406
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,840
There are two people
in Hidden Soldier Alley you must befriend.

407
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,720
Do you mean General Fengshan?

408
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,640
I've never even met him.

409
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,280
The first is Li Sangeng.

410
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,720
The calmest man in Hidden Soldier Alley.

411
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,160
I noticed your travel pass
was overdue by three days

412
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,320
because he reminded me.

413
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,880
If you didn't say it,
he'd never know it was my idea.

414
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,640
What? You hold a dagger to his neck,

415
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,320
and try to blame it on me?

416
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,280
That's all in the past now.

417
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,560
Exactly. It's all in the past.
No need to bring up old matters.

418
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,560
The second person is me. Di Lu.

419
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,280
The warmest man in Hidden Soldier Alley.

420
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,600
Everyone here is my friend.

421
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,760
If you ever need anything,
just give me a shout.

422
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,560
Sure. Thank you, Di.

423
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,240
Don't be so courteous.

424
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,560
The more you thank me,
the more long-winded it sounds.

425
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,920
Wang,

426
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,560
care to tell us
what kind of person you are?

427
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,640
Just get him drunk, and you'll find out.

428
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,640
No. I'm not a good drinker.

429
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,960
Just like Di said,

430
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,080
I'm probably the luckiest man
in Hidden Soldier Alley.

431
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:15,800
After all, I faced Liu Ziyan
and lived to tell the tale.

432
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,880
Liu Ziyan?

433
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,360
Speaking of him,
I must pour a cup for you.

434
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,680
Here, Wang Xing.

435
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,080
Who would've thought
that after Liu Ziyan was gravely injured,

436
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,400
he happened to run into you,
happened to know you,

437
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,520
and forced you to forge a pass?

438
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,400
Sangeng, the cup is full.

439
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,000
What a coincidence.

440
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,960
I wouldn't believe it
unless I saw it with my own eyes.

441
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,720
Sangeng, I know you're cautious,

442
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,800
but I've looked into it.

443
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,920
Stop being so suspicious.

444
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,520
Come on. Sit.

445
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,000
He's like that.

446
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,080
He sees enemies even in a pile of garbage.
Don't blame him.

447
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,680
You two have a toast,
and let this matter rest.

448
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,800
It's all in the past. Come on.

449
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,800
Sangeng, if you need
a travel pass, come to me.

450
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,880
If there's garbage, I'll take it.

451
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,480
Xing, don't blame me for that day.

452
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,800
I was just scared.

453
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,840
The Huben Army
is like rats in the street now.

454
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,120
I have to keep my eyes open.

455
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,040
That's enough.
You're drunk. Don't talk nonsense.

456
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,040
You don't understand.

457
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:49,080
The Huben Army was glorious once,
back when General Liu was still alive.

458
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,320
Not anymore.

459
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,720
General Fengshan wants to push for reform.
That's a great undertaking.

460
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,400
I can't help with anything.

461
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,640
I'm just afraid
that one day this alley will be raided,

462
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:05,200
and every Huben member
won't be able to escape.

463
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:10,320
I only hope
they can live just one more day.

464
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,160
Come. Drink.

465
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,200
Huainan is good

466
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,480
A safe haven

467
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:52,000
The mountains and rivers
Stretch on like our affection

468
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:57,000
A devoted soul sings here

469
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:02,000
I brave the snow to see you off

470
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:06,400
I await your return
Though my temples may turn to frost

471
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,760
My devotion endures
As long as water flows

472
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,240
Am I the one drunk,
or are both of you drunk?

473
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,000
My place is over this side.

474
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,000
-This way.
-Let's go.

475
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,120
Di,

476
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,200
why are you suddenly singing this tune?

477
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,760
It doesn't sound like
a tune from Chang'an.

478
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,400
I used to know someone

479
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,760
who lived in the place
from this song, Huainan.

480
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,200
I used to deliver messages for him.

481
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,560
I had to go
to this remote village every time.

482
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,960
It was exhausting.

483
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,040
Then, word came
from above that he'd betrayed us.

484
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,960
I was given the task to kill him.

485
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,480
But when I got there,
there wasn't even a trace of him.

486
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,680
Only those who've died once
can be truly free.

487
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,040
To be honest,

488
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,800
before he turned against us,
I actually liked him.

489
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,000
Di, why did you try to kill him?

490
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,800
Xing,

491
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:35,880
liking someone
has nothing to do with killing them.

492
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:41,440
In the end, the only person
you can afford to like is yourself.

493
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,280
Keeping yourself alive
matters more than anything.

494
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,920
If I didn't take the job,

495
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,800
I'd be the one dead.

496
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,200
I haven't had enough.

497
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,280
Come to my place and let's drink more.

498
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,480
Let's drink more.

499
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,280
This is it.

500
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,920
Sangeng, bring the liquor.

501
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,360
-Over there.
-That's enough.

502
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,480
You're plastered.

503
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,080
-Come. Careful.
-Liquor.

504
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,880
I should get going.

505
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,240
Don't go.

506
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,560
Let's drink some more.

507
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,080
It's rare for us to be this happy.

508
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,000
You're an interesting man.

509
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,960
Let's drink. Come on.

510
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,040
Maybe not today.

511
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,440
Your head will hurt tomorrow.

512
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:37,800
-Drink some water.
-I don't want water. I want liquor.

513
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:48,160
Xing, I prepared a gift for you.

514
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,080
Drink a little more with me.

515
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,560
If not, I'll give it to someone else.

516
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:56,240
Sangeng, you too. Drink with us.

517
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,320
Let me tell you. I…

518
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,880
Xing,

519
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,920
when did you get that wound?

520
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:47,080
Liu Ziyan stabbed someone recently.

521
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,880
It was a man
the Huben Army had been ordered to kill.

522
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:56,720
I heard the blade
was driven in from the neck.

523
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,400
It was the right side of the neck.

524
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,120
You almost had me there.

525
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,720
Good thing you're here tonight,
Han Ziling.
