[The Vendetta of An]

2
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:44,690
Mr. Long,

3
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,690
I've never had a serious illness

4
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,290
or chronic condition.

5
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,460
Why do I have

6
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,900
to come for my pulse check

7
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,900
every month?

8
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,130
You were born with white hair.

9
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,100
Only at this age

10
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,370
has it fully turned black.

11
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,740
Ancient texts say

12
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,410
being born white-haired means you'll face hardship for half your life.

13
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,620
No one can command

14
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,930
the workings of fate.

15
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,410
Your father and I both hope

16
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,850
you grow up safe.

17
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,420
So what if half my life will be spent in hardship?

18
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,300
What matters is the rest brims with sweetness.

19
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,060
True.

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,420
So young,

21
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,420
yet already so enlightened.

22
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,460
Thank you, Mr. Long.

23
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,180
I'll be going now.

24
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,650
"Half a life of hardship, half a life of sweetness."

25
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,210
The worry

26
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,250
is you might have only the half of hardship...

27
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,740
[Episode 9]

28
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,740
I have to go.

29
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:15,860
Where are you going?

30
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:17,970
Gu Yu was taken by Huben.

31
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,650
Barring surprises,

32
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,740
they'll hold Gu Yu in Hidden Soldier Alley.

33
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,020
Therefore,

34
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,180
I must infiltrate Hidden Soldier Alley

35
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:27,810
and rescue Gu Yu.

36
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,650
You must be joking!

37
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,490
You're just hurt,

38
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,860
and you want to risk your life again? Have you gone mad?

39
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,580
He's right.

40
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,020
You haven't even recovered yet.

41
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,020
Going into Hidden Soldier Alley now

42
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,340
is as good as a death sentence.

43
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,250
He's right.

44
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,340
And consider me too.

45
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,580
You just found a safe place for me.

46
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,740
If after you leave,

47
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,080
and Huben comes after me again...

48
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,530
What can he do?

49
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,800
He's all brawn and no brain.

50
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,590
He won't be able to deal with them.

51
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,620
I'll let you have it right here and now!

52
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,370
But on the other hand,

53
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,810
compared to you,

54
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,740
I'm better suited to fight and kill.

55
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,900
I must be the one

56
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,140
to enter the enemy's lair.

57
00:03:59,430 --> 00:03:59,770
No.

58
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,810
I must go.

59
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,090
If anyone knows Huben the best,

60
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,140
it's me.

61
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,180
Why are you staring at me?

62
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,690
Get back to work!

63
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:27,520
I...

64
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:28,770
Come in.

65
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,420
You're heading into Hidden Soldier Alley.

66
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,540
Can I help

67
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,130
with anything?

68
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,890
Or

69
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,890
is there something

70
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,590
I can do for you?

71
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,280
Actually,

72
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,370
I do require some preparations.

73
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,740
First,

74
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,010
to enter Hidden Soldier Alley,

75
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,180
I'll need Huben's custom gold coins.

76
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,570
Qingyi has one.

77
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,570
Go get it.

78
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,890
If he refuses,

79
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,180
you're to order

80
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,100
the death of every Huben member

81
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,490
who has seen my face

82
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,370
on the night of the raid.

83
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:43,980
Well...

84
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,930
What if

85
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,780
he agrees?

86
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,420
He won't.

87
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:55,960
Move it!

88
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,810
I'm not forcing you to kill.

89
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,090
I just want you to understand

90
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,210
that this is a ruthless world.

91
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,930
Some blood

92
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,930
must be spilled.

93
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,210
Maybe you'll face moments like this

94
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,300
in the future.

95
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,970
When that time comes,

96
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,970
you'll know what to do.

00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,730
Second.

98
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,690
I need

99
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,140
a new identity.

100
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,690
Xiaoqing's

101
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,330
already handled that.

102
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,730
That's a massive

103
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:37,450
and showy sign.

104
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,210
Are we sure we can trust the physician's medical skills?

105
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,210
Got it.

[Taiyiji Clinic]

107
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:01,780
What's all the...

108
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,500
Come in. Get inside.

109
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,500
The door...

110
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,210
The members of Huben

111
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,140
have been acting with discretion.

112
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,660
Few come and go

113
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,690
in Chang'an.

114
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,300
Our people have been watching for quite a while.

115
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,330
Only this man here

116
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,060
fits your criteria.

117
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,900
His name is Wang Xing.

118
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,330
His age and build are similar to yours.

119
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,900
He knows no martial arts.

120
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,210
His moves are as clumsy as yours.

121
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,930
He has no close friends.

122
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,730
But he's married.

123
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,900
His wife

124
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:47,850
resides in Chang'an.

125
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,450
Did you get everything out of him?

126
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,570
Of course.

127
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,140
You can trust me to get the job done.

128
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:55,500
Not enough yet.

129
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,500
Question him again.

130
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,690
Bring his wife here.

131
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,780
If his answers don't match,

132
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,210
break a finger

133
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,260
and give it to him.

134
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,810
That's the only way to secure

135
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,570
reliable answers.

136
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:09,420
You heard him.

137
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,140
Weigh your words carefully.

138
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,730
If there's even the slightest error...

139
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,450
You might have ten fingers,

140
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:15,970
but that won't save your wife

141
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,540
from breaking.

142
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,690
You're animals!

143
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,320
Even if you ask me a hundred times,

144
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,660
I'll still answer

145
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,140
the same.

146
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,970
Come at me all you want!

147
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,300
But

148
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,570
if you lay a hand

149
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,210
on my wife...

150
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,090
I'm talking to you!

151
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,100
Let me!

152
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,210
So, when do we

153
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,450
bring his wife here?

154
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,660
All these passes

155
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,780
were seized

156
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,690
from Wang Xing.

157
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,380
He's a skilled forger.

158
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,140
Even I

159
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,570
nearly missed the flaws.

160
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,900
He's an expert.

161
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,690
No wonder

162
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,850
Huben transferred him here.

163
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,540
Hidden Soldier Alley

164
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,930
always stations experts

165
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,210
to forge papers and identities.

166
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,380
Now the new emperor has put Huben Army on the wanted list.

167
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,450
If the Huben Army within the City

168
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,420
wish to make any further move,

169
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,500
they require custom travel passes

170
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,540
forged for any movement.

171
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,020
Something must have happened

172
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,300
to the previous forger.

173
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,300
Now,

174
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,570
people from outside will be brought in to fill the gaps.

175
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,500
Where's Wang Xing's gold coin?

176
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,970
I almost forgot about that.

177
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,660
You didn't forget.

178
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,260
You wanted it for yourself.

179
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,420
Remember.

180
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,090
These coins will bring death

181
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,300
if used anywhere else.

182
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,170
They're only for coming and going in Hidden Soldier Alley.

183
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:22,810
Huai'an.

184
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,380
You're injured,

185
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,450
and you insist on taking this mission alone.

186
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,180
I'm worried.

187
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:30,670
Don't worry.

188
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,970
I bought you

189
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,540
a flatbread stall

190
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,850
outside the alley.

191
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,660
If something happens, I'll contact you.

192
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,470
But not you.

193
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,450
The stall is too close to Hidden Soldier Alley.

194
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,380
You can't go there.

195
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,560
You'll work at the physician's hall in the meantime.

00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,810

Last time I delivered a letter,

202
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,540
I caused trouble for you.

203
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,730

204
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:04,570

And that Wang Xing as well.

209

Get him out of here as soon as possible.

210
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,570
The physician's hall may not be safe either.

211
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,180
Then,

212
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,660
why don't I watch over that Wang Xing?

213
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,690

00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,300
Yes.

215
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,660
You just need to tie him up securely.

216
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,780
I'll watch him

217
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,660
and bring his meals.

00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,570
That's simple enough.

But where will we hold him?

220
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,210
Well...

221
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:32,450

222

I'll just do as you guys did

224
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,420

225
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,020
All right.

226
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:40,420
It's settled, then.

227

If you

228

mess this up,

229
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,520
and Wang Xing escapes back to Hidden Soldier Alley,

230
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,690
the whole plan will fall apart.

231
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,020
And I'll lose my life.

Don't worry.

Your life is in my hands.

You just escaped death once,

237
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,610
and now you're going to risk it again?

238
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,210
Have you thought this through?

I observed Wang Xing.

307
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,060

Bitterness refreshes and relieves fatigue.

The people in the north chew it

316
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,610

Why do they call it Bitter-After?

People in the old days chose their words for a reason.

320
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,090
Once you chew it, the stalk's gone

321

00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:37,980
Everyone,

386
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,570
stop a moment.

387
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,220
This is Wang Xing.

388
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,060
Xing,

389
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,300
what do you think of the paper?

390
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,260
It's too thick,

391
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,170
and the color is wrong.

392
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,540
The pulp needs to be finer.

393
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:12,940
Don't soak it too long.

394
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,570
Or else,

395
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,500
the paper will go too soft.

Wang Xing.

397
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,220
Our new fellow.

398
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,330
He'll be in charge of

all travel permits here.

400
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:22,740
- Alright. - Got it.

401
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,260
Xing,

402
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,220
work can wait.

403
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,060
Come with me.

404
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,650
The last man who did this job

405
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,170
was known as Ren.

406
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:36,650
He died of illness last month.

407
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,330
He lived here

408
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,260
and worked here.

409
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,220
Do you mind staying here?

410
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:42,260
No.

411
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,370
I'm fine with it.

412
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:44,850
Good.

413
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,220
Then

414
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,090
this will be your station.

00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,810
Everyone outside

416
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,130
will follow your instructions.

417
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:51,650
But

418
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,570
some procedures can't be skipped.

419
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,540
Show me your permit from the Capital.

420
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:56,540
All right.

421
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,890
Check his travel pass.

422
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,300
[Travel Pass]
See when he set off

423
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,370
and from where.

424
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,020
Every prefecture

425
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:22,850
and sub-prefecture he passed

426
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,780
has left its seal.

427
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,940
Go through the seals one by one.

428
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,260
If he arrived

429
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,650
more or less on time,

430
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,330
there should be no issue.

431
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,540
But if the timing is far off,

432
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,850
take heed.

433
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:40,890
All right.

434
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,130
I'll get to it.

435
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,540
I just don't understand.

436
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,540
You're so smart,

437
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,740
but you ended up

438
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,650
collecting trash.

439
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,300
What was Wang Pu thinking?

440
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,020
You ask me?

441
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,370
Who am I supposed to ask?

Why are you late?

448
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,370
Explain yourself.

449
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:20,170
Answer the question.

450
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,020
Speak.

451
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,610
Where did you get this wound?

452
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,090
I met a man

453
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:43,890
on the road.

454
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,260
He said he knew me

455
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,460
and forced me to forge a pass.

456
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,810
I refused,

457
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,500
and we fought.

458
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,570
In the end,

459
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,300
I stabbed him a few times when he let his guard down

460
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,650
and killed him.

461
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,940
I fainted after that.

462
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,020
That delayed

463
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,500
my trip.

464
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,220
Why didn't you

465
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,220
report it?

466
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,570
I didn't dare.

467
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,170
Who did you kill?

468
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,650
Liu Ziyan.

469
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:17,240
You killed Liu Ziyan?

470
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,090
He was the Huben Army's top killer.

471
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,060
You killed him?

472
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,260
Di,

473
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,570
I'm telling the truth.

474
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,020
When I met him,

475
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,980
he was badly wounded

476
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,850
and nearly done for.

477
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,740
How many times did you stab him?

478
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,540
Where did you stab him?

479
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,940
The first stab

480
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,500
was aimed at his chest,

481
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,330
but he grabbed my dagger.

482
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:49,570
I pulled it out

483
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,980
and stabbed a few more times.

484
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:54,570
I was afraid he'd survive.

485
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,890
So maybe

486
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,740
ten stabs.

487
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,780
Where's the body?

488
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,020
In the forest

489
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,460
thirty li south of the city.

490
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,020
I panicked

491
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,020
and dumped the body

492
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,460
before running.

493
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,570
Watch him.

494
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:17,780
I'll be back.

495
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,060
- Yes. - Yes.

496
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,260
What?

497
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,090
You hang around

498
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,810
that garbage collector all day

499
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,810
and don't mind his stink,

500
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:47,890
but when you're here,

501
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,330
you're picky now?

502
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,130
They smell completely different.

503
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:54,890
How was it?

504
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:55,890
Have you checked?

505
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:56,940
How many wounds?

506
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:58,260
I have.

507
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,060
Eleven stab wounds.

508
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,020
Done by two different groups.

509
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,060
Here, look.

510
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,300
These stabs

511
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,680
have clean edges.

512
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,090
The blade went in and out fast.

513
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,370
Skilled hands.

514
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,370
They should be

515
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,060
from our people.

516
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,890
As for these wounds,

517
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,820
they're serious,

518
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,780
but they avoided all the vital spots.

519
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,370
The real fatal wounds are nine.

520
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,300
Two to the chest,

521
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,260
the other seven to the abdomen.

522
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:23,650
Judging by the cuts,

523
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,020
the stabs were forceful,

524
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,410
but the depth varies.

525
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,780
Their edges are rolled back.

526
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,500
That means

527
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,060
the blade didn't go in or out cleanly.

528
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,850
Whoever stabbed him meant to kill,

529
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,300
but wasn't used to handling a weapon.

530
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:41,020
As for the wound on the arm,

531
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,850
shallow inside and deep outside.

532
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,700
Likely caused

533
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,060
when he grabbed the blade

534
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,850
as the attacker tried to pull it back.

535
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,700
Could it have been staged

536
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,060
after death?

537
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,780
A dead man can't grab anything.

538
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,570
Someone would've to

539
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,940
press his hand

540
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,060
onto the blade.

541
00:31:59,070 --> 00:31:59,980
But if so,

542
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,780
the force wouldn't be even.

543
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:02,510
Therefore,

544
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:05,130
you wouldn't get such a clean cut.

545
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,110

546
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,060

00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:21,260
I'll buy you a good drink.

579
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:23,300
I think I'll pass.

580
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,220
It's settled.

581
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,780
I'll introduce you

582
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,780
to a friend.

583
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,510
I've prepared

584
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,570
a gift for you.

585
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:30,940
You'll like it.

586
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:32,650
Alright.

587
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,020
See you tonight.

588
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,890
I'll hurry and finish this work.

589
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:37,740
Go on with your tasks.

590
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,460
I told you.

591
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,770
You're different

592
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,650
from the rest of them.

593
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,340
How am I supposed to eat it when you put it on the ground?

594
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,290
How about this, lad?

595
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,900
Put it on my leg.

596
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:42,060
Leave the rest to me.

597
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,690
On your leg?

598
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,980
After I leave,

599
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,340
you'll find a way to drop the bowl,

600
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,820
break it,

601
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,540
take a shard,

602
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,250
cut the rope,

603
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,730
and escape.

604
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,940
I pity you,

605
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,690
but I'm no fool.

606
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,500
Lad,

607
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,460
I can't reach the bowl.

608
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,650
Think of something yourself.

609
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:11,980
You can

610
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,060
lean your whole body over,

611
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:16,500
then

612
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,170
press your face to the ground,

613
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,540
like a dog.

614
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,650
I've done it before.

615
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:25,340
You can do the same.

616
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,610
Wang Xing.

617
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,090
There are two people in Hidden Soldier Alley

618
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,650
you must befriend.

619
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,250
Do you mean

620
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,170
General Fengshan?

621
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,030
I've never

622
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,380
even met him.

623
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:05,090
The first is

624
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,690
Li Sangeng.

625
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,340
The calmest man in Hidden Soldier Alley.

626
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,950
I noticed your travel pass

627
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:12,970
was overdue by three days

628
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,690
because he reminded me.

629
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,210
If you don't say it,

630
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,820
he'll never know it was my idea.

631
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,170
What?

632
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,980
You hold a dagger to his neck,

633
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,060
and try to blame it on me?

634
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,250
That's all in the past now.

635
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:26,540
Exactly.

636
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:27,340
It's all in the past.

637
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,250
No need to bring up old matters.

638
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,210
The second person

639
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:32,730
is me.

640
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:33,730
Di Lu.

641
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,940
The warmest man in Hidden Soldier Alley.

642
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,290
Everyone here

643
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,170
is my friend.

644
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,340
If you ever need anything,

645
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,290
just give me a shout.

646
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,170
Sure.

647
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,730
Thank you, Di.

648
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:47,250
Don't be so courteous.

649
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,130
The more you thank me,

650
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,250
the more naggy it seems.

651
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,290
Wang,

652
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,540
care to tell us

653
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,420
what kind of person you are?

654
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,340
Just get him drunk, and you'll find out.

655
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,650
No.

656
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,770
I'm not a good drinker.

657
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,460
Just like

658
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,650
Di said,

659
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,900
I'm probably the luckiest man

660
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,820
in Hidden Soldier Alley.

661
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,540
After all,

662
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,980
I faced Liu Ziyan

663
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,770
and lived to tell the tale.

664
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,610
Liu Ziyan?

665
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,420
Speaking of him,

666
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,060
I must pour a cup for you.

667
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,340
Here, Wang Xing.

668
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,460
Who would've thought that after Liu Ziyan was gravely injured,

669
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,290
he happened to run into you,

670
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,340
happened to know you,

671
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,420
and forced you to forge a travel pass?

672
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,650
Sangeng,

673
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,690
the cup is full.

674
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,690
What a coincidence.

675
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,090
I wouldn't believe it

676
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,650
unless I saw it with my own eyes.

677
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:55,340
Sangeng,

678
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,730
I know you're cautious,

679
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,690
but I've looked into it.

680
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,550
Stop being so suspicious.

681
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:02,570
Come on.

682
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,290
Sit.

683
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,570
He's like that.

684
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:09,210
He sees enemies even in a pile of garbage.

685
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,070
Don't blame him.

686
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,570
You two have a toast,

687
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,610
and let this matter rest.

688
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,570
It's all in the past.

689
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,340
Come on.

690
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,610
Sangeng,

691
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,020
if you need a travel pass,

692
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:18,860
come to me.

693
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:20,420
If there's garbage,

694
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,520
I'll take it.

695
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,290
Xing,

696
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:27,250
don't blame me for that day.

697
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,540
I was just scared.

698
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,170
Huben Army

699
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,460
is like rats in the street now.

700
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,940
I have to keep my eyes open.

701
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:36,820
That's enough.

702
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:38,730
You're drunk. Don't talk nonsense.

703
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,570
You don't understand.

704
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,540
The Huben Army was glorious once,

705
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,500
back when General Liu was still alive.

706
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,500
Not anymore.

707
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,190
General Fengshan wants to push for reform.

708
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,250
That's huge.

709
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,900
I can't help with anything.

710
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:56,730
I'm just afraid

711
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,690
that one day this alley will be raided,

712
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,710
and every Huben member

713
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,020
won't be able to escape.

714
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,860
I only hope

715
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,090
they can live just one more day.

716
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:11,550
Come.

717
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,510
Drink.

718
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:43,980
♪Huainan is good♪

719
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,420

725
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,610
Am I the one drunk,

726
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:14,090
or are both of you drunk?

727
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,730
My place is over this side.

728
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,090
This way.

729
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:17,940
Let's go.

730
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:18,650
Di,

731
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,860
why are you suddenly

732
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,170
singing this tune?

733
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,650
It doesn't sound like

734
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,770
a tune from Chang'an.

735
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:29,460
I used to

736
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,290
know someone

737
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,130
who lived in the place from this song,

738
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:35,500
Huainan.

739
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,940
I used to

740
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,980
deliver messages for him.

741
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,460
I had to go to this remote village

742
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,420
every time.

743
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:44,900
It was exhausting.

744
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,060
Then,

745
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,730
word came from above that he'd betrayed us.

746
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,380
I was given the task

747
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,860
to kill him.

748
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:55,250
But when I got there,

749
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,060
there wasn't even a trace of him.

750
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,250
Only those who've died once

751
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:04,460
can be truly free.

752
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,770
To be honest,

753
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,940
before he turned against us,

754
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,500
I actually liked him.

755
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,260
Di,

756
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:17,900
why did you try to kill him?

757
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,500
Xing,

758
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,980
liking someone

759
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,060
has nothing to do with

760
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,650
killing them.

761
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,020
In the end,

762
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:40,090
the only person you can afford to like is yourself.

763
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:42,380
Keeping yourself alive

764
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:43,770
matters more than anything.

765
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,420
If I didn't take the job,

766
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,860
I'd be the one dead.

767
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,940
I haven't had enough.

768
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,170
Come to my place and let's drink more.

769
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:00,320
Let's drink more.

770
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:03,380
This is it.

771
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:06,770
Sangeng, bring the liquor.

772
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,570
Over there.

773
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:08,420
That's enough.

774
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,730
You're plastered.

775
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:11,820
- Come. Careful. - Liquor.

776
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,570
I should get going.

777
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:22,820
Don't go.

778
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,460
Let's drink some more.

779
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,020
It's rare for us to be this happy.

780
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,690
You're an interesting man.

781
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,100
Let's drink.

782
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:30,860
Come on.

783
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,210
Maybe not today.

784
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,420
Your head will hurt tomorrow.

785
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:34,210
Drink some water.

786
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:36,610
I don't want water. I want liquor.

787
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:43,090
Xing,

788
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,060
I prepared a gift

789
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:46,900
for you.

790
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:49,060
Drink a little more with me.

791
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:49,980
If not,

792
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:51,170
I'll give it to someone else.

793
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:53,160
Sangeng,

794
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:54,040
you too.

795
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:54,940
Drink with us.

796
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,690
Let me tell you.

797
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,090
I...

798
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,500
Xing,

799
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:27,170
when did you

800
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,730
get that wound?

801
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,730
Liu Ziyan stabbed someone recently.

802
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,940
It was a man

803
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:50,690
Huben Army have been ordered to kill.

804
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,610
I heard

805
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,660
the blade was driven in from the neck.

806
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:59,050
It was the right side of the neck.

807
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,090
You almost

808
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:21,540
had me there.

809
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,770
Good thing you're here tonight,

810
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:31,380
