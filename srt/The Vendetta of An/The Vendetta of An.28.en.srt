My death

4
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,020
will clear the path for Cen Pickles,

5
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,210
and the Tiemo King's life

6
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,820
will draw out the 3,000 Tiemo shadow guards.

7
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,540
This plan is nearing its end.

8
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,540
Fate

9
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,660
will soon show its hand.

10
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,820
The realm's future

11
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,740

[Tea]

14
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:37,870
Move!

15
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,130
Surround Hidden Soldier Alley!

16
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,130
Yes!

17
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,610
The people who moved into Hidden Soldier Alley

18
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,450
brought life back to it,

19
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,170
but today,

20
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,860
smoke and fire will return.

21
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,380
Will Mr. Xie Huai'an arrive on time?

22
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,730
Ye Zheng,

23
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,780
the Shen-hour plan

24
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,120
cannot afford

25
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,380
a single misstep.

26
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,170
Therefore,

27
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,430
you must appear at the exact place

28
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,540
I designated for you on time

29
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,260
and wait for me there.

30
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,380
This is the grandest stratagem of his life.

31
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,490
He will not be absent.

32
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:45,990
Run!

33
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,650
Goodbye!

34
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:55,770
After him!

35
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,970
I do not know what tomorrow holds.

36
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:11,850
But today, let us

37
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,180
say our farewell properly.

38
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,970
If you do that, you will die.

39
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,530
Don't worry.

40
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,140
I promise

41
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,180
we will meet again.

42
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,290
Your task is crucial.

43
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,060
I believe

44
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,970
you can

45
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,650
do it.

46
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,290
I won't die.

47
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,410
And you must not die either.

48
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,920
Everything today

49
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,420
had been arranged in advance,

50
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,220
including the pot mender

51
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,240
and the physician named Yi Zhihu.

52
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,450
What are you hiding

53
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,840
that you cannot tell me outright?

54
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,530
Very well.

55
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:37,610
I will be honest.

56
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,140
Tomorrow,

57
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,370
I am going to meet the King of Tiemo,

58
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,410
staking my life on this plan.

59
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,780
The pot mender

60
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,460
is linked to the units I've hidden in the city.

61
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,140
Tomorrow at the Shen hour,

62
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,410
our clash with Tiemo

63
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,580
will unfold within the city.

64
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:02,820
And

65
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,500
what will happen to you?

66
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,530
When fireworks rise

67
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,380
at the Shen hour,

68
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,290
you and Yi Zhihu

69
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,410
should come to the Tiemo King's residence for me.

70
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,290
As for the outcome,

71
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,210
it rests in Heaven's hands.

72
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:31,650
Remember:

73
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,650
if you act

74
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,140
before the Shen hour,

75
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,060
you will alert them,

76
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,740
and the entire plan

77
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,530
will collapse.

78
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,650
You must not die.

79
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,970
One man's life

80
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,620
is nothing beside the fate

81
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:56,970
of Chang'an.

82
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:58,850
Besides,

83
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,210
Yi Zhihu's medical skill

84
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,290
matches your master's.

85
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,020
Perhaps

86
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,850
she will keep me alive.

87
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:31,900
Sir,

88
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,290
the two of them

89
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,740
split in two directions.

90
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,500
We lost them both.

91
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,100
Had Genghui been here,

92
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,210
we wouldn't have failed.

93
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,380
But did Xie Huai'an truly risk his life

94
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,990
just to draw Fang Genghui away

95
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,170
and rescue Xiao Wenjing?

96
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,320
Stay back!

97
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,740
Xiao Wenjing,

98
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,100
you are not useless after all.

99
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,100
But don't forget

100
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,260
that Xiao Wuyang is still in our hands.

101
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,380
He's in Yulong Ridge, isn't he?

102
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,650
Someone is already on the way to save him.

103
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,500
Kill them!

104
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,050
Break through!

105
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:27,590
Charge!

106
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,780
Kill Xiao Wuyang!

107
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,100
You won't be able to rescue Xiao Wuyang.

108
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,730
Even if we fail,

109
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,690
the Tiemo King will die in Hidden Soldier Alley.

110
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,690
At worst,

111
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,620
we trade one life for another.

112
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:24,280
Sir.

113
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:32,840
Report!

114
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,860
Sir,

115
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,610
large numbers of Wuyang troops appeared in the city.

116
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,800
They've surrounded Hidden Soldier Alley.

117
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:42,930
Hidden Soldier Alley?

118
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,410
Is His Majesty still in his residence?

119
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:45,930
Zheng.

120
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,030
Has he returned?

121
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,610
He has.

122
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,620
This is the next move.

123
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,780
[The Tiemo King will be locked in battle with Yan Fengshan.]

124
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,170
We've fallen into Xie Huai'an's trap.

125
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:14,460
His Majesty

126
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,420
has been taken by Cen Pickles.

127
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,180
Surround Hidden Soldier Alley!

128
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,460
Breaking into the granary

129
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,730
will not be easy.

130
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,480
[Map of Yanzuo Ward]

131
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,580
They made the first move.

132
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:44,100
The whole ward must have become a trap.

133
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,720
Xie Huai'an

134
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,090
wants to force a decisive battle.

135
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,990
Hidden Soldier Alley is certainly a trap.

136
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:53,720
The guards at the Imperial Guard Station

137
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,700
may not be able to break through.

138
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:59,490
Notify every shadow guard

139
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:00,600
in the city to armor up

140
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:01,760
and converge

141
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,260
on Hidden Soldier Alley.

142
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:03,960
Understood.

143
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,340
I know your concern.

144
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,930
To expose the shadow guards

145
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,860
is to reveal our last cards.

146
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,500
But Genghui,

147
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,530
His Majesty cannot die.

148
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,260
If he falls,

149
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,620
even if our army

150
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,770
takes Chang'an,

151
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,570
trouble will never end.

152
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,290
For years,

153
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,740
our 3,000 shadow guards have scouted

154
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,140
every corner of Chang'an,

155
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,930
including Hidden Soldier Alley.

156
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,650
This spot has long been piled with clutter,

157
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,710
poorly guarded,

158
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,120
and forgotten.

159
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,410
From here,

160
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,570
we can cut straight into the alley.

161
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,190
Stay close. Move!

162
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:45,170
The formation inside Hidden Soldier Alley is already set.

163
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,780
The breach on the west side

164
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,140
was left there on purpose.

165
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,950
It is the death gate laid for the Tiemo forces.

166
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,300
To save their king,

167
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,210
they will enter through it.

168
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:56,830
Once they're in,

169
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,160
they will never leave.

170
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,300
Among Tiemo forces,

171
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:07,950
only centurions and above

172
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,320
carry the command arrows,

173
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,710
and a centurion

174
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,900
is hard to kill.

175
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,510
Ye Zheng,

176
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,320
this is your task.

177
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,360
Gather the command arrows.

178
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,540
They will be

179
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,810
of great use to us.

180
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,780
The Tiemo King is not in Hidden Soldier Alley.

181
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,300
The Wuyang Army's blockade

182
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,600
is only a performance to mislead the Tiemo people.

183
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:50,180
The command arrow

184
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,980
is their signal for reinforcements.

185
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,860
More shadow guards, armored and armed,

186
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,620
will break in from the west side of the alley

187
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,420
and walk straight into our trap.

188
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,240
Tiemo will commit all its strength

189
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,820
and have no cards left.

190
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,900
We will put everything to an end

191
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,220
in Hidden Soldier Alley.

192
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,620
Even if you kill me,

193
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,690
you still...

194
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,800
Are there more enemies?

195
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,330
All dead.

196
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:07,460
What is it?

197
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,330
By now,

198
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,850
inside the granary,

199
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,330
the victor has been decided.

200
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,420
After all these years,

201
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,420
you are still trapped in that granary.

202
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,500
Today,

203
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,130
you will not walk out either.

204
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,090
I've always wanted to ask you something.

205
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,610
On that snowy night,

206
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,500
why did you spare him?

207
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:25,810
They say

208
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,830
that in Mount Shiluoman,

209
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:31,090
there is a rare

210
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,940
and ugly toad.

211
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,620
A toad?

212
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:37,810
When it meets its own kind,

213
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,660
it is frightened by the other's ugliness

214
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,530
and exudes an oil in shock,

215
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,700
only then realizing

216
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,850
it is just as ugly.

217
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:53,940
The tale exists.

218
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,330
That oil

219
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:57,260
is said to be the world's only cure for regret.

220
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,330
I spared Yan Fengshan that night

221
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,850
because I thought of that toad.

222
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,850
In his eyes,

223
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,420
I seemed to see myself.

224
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,970
Finish it, White Hair.

225
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,660
No.

226
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,770
You must die slowly.

227
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,180
That hurts more.

228
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,900
A traitor like you

229
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,570
should have died long ago.

230
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,090
Speak.

231
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,090
Why did you rebel?

232
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,140
You never walked out

233
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,730
of the Liu Manor

234
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,280
from the night it fell 15 years ago.

235
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,360
I never walked out

236
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,880
of the granary at Chen Valley either.

237
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,680
I've always believed

238
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:21,640
that only by killing everyone

239
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,090
can I stay alive.

240
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:30,820
Aren't you the same?

241
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:33,610
Yes.

242
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,850
Only by killing my enemies

243
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,900
can I go on living.

244
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,180
In truth,

245
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:46,330
you and I share one enemy.

246
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,220
The one who drove me into that granary.

247
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,770
He took part in killing your father.

248
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:56,020
On the night your family was massacred,

249
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,670
he stood in the shadows.

250
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,280
You remember him,

251
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,580
but you do not know him.

252
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,940
After I die,

253
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,900
he will come.

254
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:22,000
The Huben Army's top shadow guard

255
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,530
must have made preparations

256
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,400
for his death.

257
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,180
Somewhere in this house,

258
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,330
there must be a head wearing a face made to look like yours.

259
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,370
Why did you return?

260
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:16,640
After that night,

261
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,030
I sat on the street for a long time.

262
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,530
The streets of Chang'an

263
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,660
truly have fine scenery.

264
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,460
People came and went,

265
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,290
living their lives as usual.

266
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,480
No one spoke of Yan Fengshan's

267
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,080
rise or fall.

268
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,130
Tomorrow at the Shen hour,

269
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,180
fight for Chang'an,

270
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:52,250
and you will finally walk out of that granary.

271
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,700
Your ending

272
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,330
is yours to choose.

273
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,660
Thank you for granting me this chance.

274
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:11,460
I am granting nothing.

275
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,090
You killed my family.

276
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,330
The Liu clan will never forgive you.

277
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:30,090
You carved this amulet

278
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,660
for Liu Li back then.

279
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,180
Now that the realm is in peril,

280
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:40,540
I use it

281
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,550
to buy your life

282
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,260
and return it to Chang'an.

283
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,700
White Hair,

284
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,850
I owe you nothing now,

285
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,120
and I owe Chang'an nothing.

286
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,660
Even if we cannot save His Majesty,

287
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,810
even if I die here today,

288
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,180
there are still 200,000 Tiemo troops

289
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,650
in your lands.

290
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,470
In half a day's time,

291
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,210
they will reach Chang'an.

292
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,040
When they arrive,

293
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,810
the city will run with blood.

294
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,290
You think

295
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,610
Xie Huai'an did not foresee that?

296
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,660
The Baiwenhu Army fell so easily

297
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,810
because that was Gu Yu's stratagem.

298
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:37,850
By not fighting to the death,

299
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,460
they preserved most of their forces.

300
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:42,090
For this,

301
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,660
Xie Huai'an devised his master plan.

302
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,850
As the Tiemo army marched south,

303
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:49,900
Xie Huai'an's messenger

304
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,660
met with the four regional commanders.

305
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,570
If they refused

306
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,810
to help break the siege of Chang'an,

307
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,500
the Baiwenhu Army

308
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:00,500
would immediately take Xie Huai'an's order

309
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,050
and attack them.

310
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,980
The choice between perishing together

311
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,610
and standing united

312
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:06,570
against Tiemo

313
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,300
should be

314
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,610
easy to make, shouldn't it?

315
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,730
By now,

316
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:21,780
your Tiemo army

317
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:24,380
should already be under attack from all sides.

318
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,730
Impossible.

319
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,690
How so?

320
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,340
I see.

321
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,540
The military reports you received

322
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,610
did not say any of this,

323
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,220
did they?

324
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,490
Xie Huai'an and the Huben Army have reconciled.

325
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:47,050
That force, skilled in disguise

326
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,460
and infiltration,

327
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,570
was his by right.

328
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,190
They merely did what they excelled at

329
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,860
and slipped into your

330
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,440
intelligence network.

331
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:57,710
So for the past three days,

332
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,170
every report you received

333
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,460
was exactly what we wanted you to see.

334
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:08,530
By the way,

335
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,420
the battle in Hidden Soldier Alley was also a ruse,

336
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,700
meant to draw out

337
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,420
every shadow guard you had

338
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,500
in the city.

339
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,380
And one more thing.

340
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,530
The Tiemo King

341
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,860
was never here.

342
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,650
By now,

343
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,820
he should already be dead

344
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,730
somewhere else.

345
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,130
Accept defeat.

346
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,860
You wanted an alliance with me, didn't you?

347
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,420
Then sign

348
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:04,980
this treaty

349
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,500
and withdraw your troops.

350
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:09,900
Otherwise,

351
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,760
two generations of Tiemo's strength,

352
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,900
every man fit to ride

353
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,170
into battle,

354
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,130
will die.

355
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,860
None will be able to return home.

356
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,780
[The Emperor pays respects to the King of Tiemo.]

357
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,780
[Envoy Wuyin Chong proposes to cease the war and restore the lands.]

358
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,980
[A new pact shall be forged to bring peace among the peoples.]

359
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,260
White Hair?

360
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,630
Yan Fengshan died for you.

361
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:37,820
And Cen Pickles risked everything for you.

362
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,950
You truly are something.

363
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,170
They did not risk their lives for me.

364
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,170
They only wished

365
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,380
to protect the grain and flour of Chang'an.

366
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,050
You asked me what I lived for.

367
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,490
I live

368
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:41,370
for that same grain and flour.

369
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,380
Since it's over the grain and flour,

370
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,130
you and I are enemies.

371
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:57,220
If you die here,

372
00:40:58,550 --> 00:40:59,740
no one will know.

373
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:01,860
I spent years planning

374
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:04,650
before returning to Chang'an

375
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:10,010
to destroy the entire Huben Army,

376
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,700
yet I failed to realize

377
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:20,690
I was one of them.

378
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:24,720
My father

379
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:28,340
raised the Huben Army for Chang'an.

380
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:30,340
Every member is a shadow guard.

381
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,390
So many died

382
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:35,130
without leaving their names behind.

383
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,650
That is the price of protection.

384
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,170
For a Huben guard,

385
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:46,170
to kill the enemy

386
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:48,650
is the highest merit.

387
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:50,530
You think

388
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,820
you can win?

389
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:00,780
The shadow guards you hid in the city

390
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,930
all believe you are trapped

391
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:04,860
in the granary of Hidden Soldier Alley.

392
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:07,940
The remnants of the Baiwenhu Army

393
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,700
and the forces of the four regional commanders

394
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:14,820
have already united.

395
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,940
The entire heartland of our empire

396
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:21,740
has become a trap for your Tiemo army.

397
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,780
Do you think

398
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,260
you can win?

399
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,870
As long as I live,

400
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,490
the victor is not yet decided.

401
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,090
White Hair,

402
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,050
you

403
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:50,380
forced yourself here on sheer will alone.

404
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,860
How do you plan to kill me?

405
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:59,490
Can your hands, meant for writing and pouring tea,

406
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:01,970
even lift a sword?

407
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,050
Can the words

408
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:09,740
"protect Chang'an" kill me?

409
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:12,490
No.

410
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:15,570
But another phrase can.

411
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,220
Fifteen years ago, in the Grand Academy,

412
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,010
when you taught us to make funnel timers,

413
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:28,820
you said six words.

414
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:24,220
The room is full of flour dust.

415
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:26,740
You should "settle the dust to prevent fire."

416
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:28,860
Remember?

417
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,480
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

418
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:41,610
With a broken body,

419
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:44,820
I kill the King of Tiemo.

420
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:46,300
Today,

421
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:48,090
I win!

422
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:30,780
After tomorrow,

423
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,530
I hope Chang'an

424
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:36,420
can still know such peace.

425
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:39,650
But you

426
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,380
will be gone then.

427
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:48,380
The plan is set.

428
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:51,220
Whether I am here or not

429
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:54,050
won't matter.

430
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:00,780
