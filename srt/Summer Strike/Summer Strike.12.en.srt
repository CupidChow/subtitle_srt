on the surveillance camera when he came to this building before?

On the day of the incident, Dae Beom's father said he went fishing with Mr. Kwak.

But Mr. Kwak denied doing so.

Okay, I'll do so.

[Economy Store]

165
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:17,706
No matter how we can't see inside people's heads, Mr. Kwak ruined our building in the end.

166
00:14:17,706 --> 00:14:21,386
I know. I mean, the world is so scary.

167
00:14:21,386 --> 00:14:25,300
Hyung Mu Cheol committed such a horrific crime and still became a policeman.

168
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,100
It's so freaky.

169
00:14:27,106 --> 00:14:30,436
Chang Soo's family must have gone through a hard time.

170
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:33,426
Why don't you take good care of them?

171
00:14:33,426 --> 00:14:35,836
You also feel bad for them, right?

172
00:14:35,836 --> 00:14:38,476
Just so you know, I decided to sell the building to them.

173
00:14:38,476 --> 00:14:40,156
What?

174
00:14:40,156 --> 00:14:43,606
Are you selling it to Hyung Chang Soo? Did he say he'll buy it?

175
00:14:43,606 --> 00:14:47,510
I said I'd sell it at half price; why would he reject that?

176
00:14:48,936 --> 00:14:52,506
Father! You are really awesome! You made a great choice!

177
00:14:52,506 --> 00:14:55,076
Wow, I'm even thankful on their behalf.

178
00:14:55,076 --> 00:14:58,676
Hey, you punk. Why is this something you're thankful for?

179
00:14:58,676 --> 00:15:01,376
Seriously, this punk is...

180
00:15:06,116 --> 00:15:07,716
Hello.

181
00:15:07,716 --> 00:15:09,996
Welcome. You went through so much.

182
00:15:09,996 --> 00:15:11,466
No, I'm okay.

183
00:15:11,466 --> 00:15:14,606
I hope you can shake it off and cheer up soon.

184
00:15:14,606 --> 00:15:16,896
Thank you for saying that.

185
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,496
Yeo Reum, welcome. Why don't you sit here?

186
00:15:21,496 --> 00:15:23,836
What brings you here today?

187
00:15:23,836 --> 00:15:25,956
Well...

188
00:15:25,956 --> 00:15:31,816
I think you need to take back the stuff you let me use in that building.

189
00:15:31,816 --> 00:15:35,396
Oh, do you want to move out of the billiards now?

190
00:15:35,396 --> 00:15:36,306
Yes.

191
00:15:36,306 --> 00:15:40,156
I just heard the building will be sold to Hyung Chang Soo anyway.

192
00:15:40,156 --> 00:15:42,086
Oh, that's good news.

193
00:15:42,086 --> 00:15:43,620
Yes, it is.

194
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:49,170
I know you must be sick of this town

195
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,920
and want to leave soon,

196
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,120
but I'm a bit sad to see you go.

197
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,906
I feel the same way.

198
00:15:57,906 --> 00:16:01,626
Actually, Bom must be sadder than I am.

199
00:16:01,626 --> 00:16:05,336
You know Hyung Jung Hoon,

200
00:16:05,336 --> 00:16:10,630
Bom's dad, made trouble. Bom must be having a hard time right now.

201
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,766
Did something happen to Bom?

202
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:20,126
- Hey, you.
- Yes, Sir.

203
00:16:20,126 --> 00:16:21,946
Bring this up to the third floor.

204
00:16:21,946 --> 00:16:23,116
Okay.

205
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:26,190
Go easy! Do we have enough?

206
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:42,496
Wait, where are the structural support materials that were here?

207
00:16:42,496 --> 00:16:44,716
They were here before.

208
00:16:44,716 --> 00:16:48,836
For goodness' sake, what's wrong with this site?

209
00:16:48,836 --> 00:16:52,836
Hey, Mr. Kim! What are you doing right now?

210
00:16:52,836 --> 00:16:53,916
Pardon?

211
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:56,356
Why are you taking that up there?

212
00:16:56,356 --> 00:16:58,956
You told me to bring this up here.

213
00:16:58,956 --> 00:17:03,156
Did I tell you that? What a moron!

214
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:05,810
Why would anyone want structural support materials on the third floor?

215
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,550
We have to use that over here!

216
00:17:07,556 --> 00:17:11,506
- I mean...
- Hurry and bring it down here!

217
00:17:11,506 --> 00:17:13,906
Yes, I'm sorry, Sir!

218
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:25,386
Look at how he works. He's not even young.

219
00:17:25,386 --> 00:17:27,816
It's pathetic.

220
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:33,866
Put the rice in the bowl when Dad gets home. Otherwise, it'll get cold.

221
00:17:33,866 --> 00:17:35,616
You're right.

222
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,436
The rice cooked well.

223
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,846
Why don't you eat some?

224
00:17:43,846 --> 00:17:45,706
Have some rest.

225
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,436
Enjoy the food.

226
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:53,036
I thought you wouldn't join the dinner, but you came.

227
00:17:53,036 --> 00:17:55,376
Why don't you have a glass, Sir?

228
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:06,526
Forget what happened earlier.

229
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,056
When I watch you working, it's a close call.

230
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,646
But why don't you come to work next month as well?

231
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,480
Don't be like that and have a drink!

232
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,260
He thinks of you in such a good way!

233
00:18:23,266 --> 00:18:25,637
You don't have to drink if you don't want to.

234
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,526
Why don't you have another glass, Sir?

235
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:51,610
You are a good drinker!

236
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:55,090
Why don't you have another glass? Here, have another shot.

237
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:26,350
Noona. Noona, I think Dad came by and left.

238
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,840
Noona.

239
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,726
Noona...

240
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,926
He started to gamble again.

241
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:39,426
He grabbed all the money in the house and left with those guys.

242
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:49,196
Bom. Bom?

243
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,326
Ha Neul.

244
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,266

Where are you coming from?

248
00:21:05,616 --> 00:21:07,936
I started working.

249
00:21:07,936 --> 00:21:09,956
What about school?

250
00:21:11,476 --> 00:21:13,536
But what brings you here today?

251
00:21:13,536 --> 00:21:15,376
Where's my sister?

252
00:21:16,366 --> 00:21:18,026
Bom?

253
00:21:18,776 --> 00:21:22,486
She went out to see you yesterday.

254
00:21:22,486 --> 00:21:24,326
Didn't you see her?

255
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:26,030
To see me?

256
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:29,136
I didn't hear anything from her.

257
00:21:33,436 --> 00:21:35,616
When did she go out?

258
00:21:36,626 --> 00:21:39,186
Yesterday morning...

259
00:21:41,146 --> 00:21:46,426
Ha Neul, first, why don't you go to the police station and report a missing person?

260
00:21:46,426 --> 00:21:49,966
Then look around the places where Bom might go.

261
00:21:51,146 --> 00:21:52,966
Noona...

262
00:21:53,636 --> 00:21:55,736
I'll look around as well.

263
00:21:55,736 --> 00:21:57,480
Let's go.

264
00:21:58,186 --> 00:21:59,916
Let's go.

00:23:56,546 --> 00:23:58,536
I'm sorry.

00:25:10,936 --> 00:25:12,996
Please wake up.

283
00:25:12,996 --> 00:25:15,836
Can you sit up? Please wake up.

284
00:25:18,486 --> 00:25:20,506
Are you okay?

- Bom!
- Unnie.

Unnie...

288
00:25:30,396 --> 00:25:32,216
It's okay.

289
00:25:34,256 --> 00:25:37,166
I'm so sorry.

290
00:25:38,646 --> 00:25:40,040
It's okay.

291
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,850
Unnie, I'm sorry.

00:25:44,746 --> 00:25:47,226
Everything's fine now.

294
00:25:50,256 --> 00:25:52,156
It's okay.

295
00:25:52,156 --> 00:25:54,176
Everything will be okay.

296
00:26:37,966 --> 00:26:43,426
Dae Beom had the same face as Bom on that night.

297
00:26:44,456 --> 00:26:47,526
It felt like I saw his deepest sorrow.

298
00:27:02,356 --> 00:27:05,896
I decided to stay in Angok.

299
00:27:05,896 --> 00:27:08,596
Also, I decided to work.

300
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:13,856
For 4.5 hours of work, I get ₩50,000 ($40) per day,

301
00:27:13,856 --> 00:27:16,996
and I work six days a week.

302
00:27:16,996 --> 00:27:19,956
I start work at 4 a.m.

303
00:27:26,016 --> 00:27:27,836
Oh, my goodness!

304
00:27:31,386 --> 00:27:34,676
At first, it was a burden to wake up early in the morning,

305
00:27:34,676 --> 00:27:38,336
but that's the best part now. Good morning!

306
00:27:39,086 --> 00:27:40,946
Please, have some apples.

307
00:27:40,946 --> 00:27:42,916
Thank you for the apple.

308
00:27:42,916 --> 00:27:47,586
Even if it's the same light, the dusk at the end of day is gloomy,

309
00:27:47,586 --> 00:27:51,826
but the dawn at the start of one's day is refreshing.

310
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:57,746
It's the same light, but unbelievably different.

311
00:28:01,726 --> 00:28:04,866
When I finish my work, it's 8:30 a.m.

312
00:28:04,866 --> 00:28:08,816
From then, the rest of the day is entirely mine.

313
00:28:09,816 --> 00:28:13,486
I work less and earn the time.

314
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:24,566
Now I'm living in Bom's house and paying rent.

315
00:28:29,196 --> 00:28:31,936
After paying monthly rent

316
00:28:31,936 --> 00:28:37,226
and using some for living expenses, I had some left so I started saving it.

317
00:28:39,196 --> 00:28:42,056
After Bom and Ha Neul go to school,

318
00:28:42,056 --> 00:28:45,656
I go to the library every day.

319
00:28:45,656 --> 00:28:49,376
I said you need to upload it every day before leaving work.

320
00:28:49,376 --> 00:28:54,386
How many times did I say book usage data can't be uploaded just once a week?

321
00:28:54,386 --> 00:28:58,566
But, Sunbaenim, that young lady is our only customer.

322
00:28:58,566 --> 00:29:01,496
What's the point of uploading data daily?

323
00:29:01,496 --> 00:29:03,596
You complain too much for a civil servant.

324
00:29:03,596 --> 00:29:06,146
I didn't expect to be stuck in this place!

325
00:29:14,256 --> 00:29:15,866
Unnie.

326
00:29:20,526 --> 00:29:23,306
Where's the real estate agency in this town?

327
00:29:24,766 --> 00:29:27,136
I'm not an "unnie."

328
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,110
These days, I got into hand-copying books

329
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:38,576
so I handwrite books that I like.

330
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:43,656
I feel it empties my worry and fills my soul.

331
00:29:45,096 --> 00:29:49,026
When the library closes, we two go for a jog.

332
00:29:49,026 --> 00:29:54,536
Dae Beom switched the morning jogging to evening jogging for me.

333
00:29:54,536 --> 00:29:58,726
We usually talk while jogging.

334
00:29:58,726 --> 00:30:02,936
Every day is rather similar, but there are endless things to discuss.

335
00:30:02,936 --> 00:30:07,056
I think Dae Beom definitely talks more than I do lately.

336
00:30:07,056 --> 00:30:10,956
- It's not as hard as before.
- I think you're a better runner now than I am.

337
00:30:10,956 --> 00:30:13,476
Maybe I am.

338
00:30:13,476 --> 00:30:16,236
Okay, so now that you've reviewed it, what do you think?

339
00:30:16,236 --> 00:30:21,636
I read this, and this was very, very interesting that you sent me.

340
00:30:21,636 --> 00:30:23,906
But...

341
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:27,466
Dae Beom started to work again with the Netherlands' professor.

342
00:30:27,466 --> 00:30:30,016
Explain by calculating it.

343
00:30:30,016 --> 00:30:31,036
Why is that?

344
00:30:31,036 --> 00:30:35,106
The Netherlands' professor said family is more important for him than work.

345
00:30:35,106 --> 00:30:37,366
- So he proposed working together, like hanging out.
- I do want to see.

346
00:30:37,366 --> 00:30:41,076
- And Dae Beom was impressed by his words so he decided to work with him.
- Am I wrong?

347
00:30:41,076 --> 00:30:43,456
No, I mean, that was a difficult one.

348
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:49,146
- He said he's working from the beginning with the Netherlands' professor.
- I'll see it so...

349
00:30:49,146 --> 00:30:51,456
Well, I don't think it was difficult at all.

350
00:30:51,456 --> 00:30:56,916
Actually, I have a problem that is much more difficult to solve.

351
00:30:56,916 --> 00:30:58,776
Like what?

352
00:31:00,006 --> 00:31:01,916
My wife!

353
00:31:12,526 --> 00:31:14,756
- Unnie.
- Yes?

354
00:31:14,756 --> 00:31:17,476
There's something I want to do with you.

355
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:19,366
What is it?

356
00:31:19,366 --> 00:31:23,506
But can you promise me first that you'll do it with me?

357
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:27,376
I think I really can't do it by myself.

358
00:31:27,376 --> 00:31:29,476
What is it for you to say so?

359
00:31:29,476 --> 00:31:32,526
Noona, don't get involved in this; ignore her.

360
00:31:32,526 --> 00:31:34,516
It is...

361
00:31:37,976 --> 00:31:39,796
this thing.

362
00:31:41,076 --> 00:31:43,436
What's this?
[A Competition for Webtoon Proposals]

363
00:31:46,356 --> 00:31:48,006
"A competition for Webtoon proposals"?

364
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:50,976
Yes. But Unnie, this is the crazy part.

365
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:53,166
The winner's prize is 100 million won ($79,000).

366
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:55,146
Isn't that amazing?

367
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:57,446
But why do you want to do this with me?

368
00:31:57,446 --> 00:32:00,956
I mean, I can draw, but I'm not good at writing.

369
00:32:00,956 --> 00:32:04,366
But you worked in a publishing company before and read many books.

370
00:32:04,366 --> 00:32:06,606
So you will write the story, and I will draw.

371
00:32:06,606 --> 00:32:08,406
No, I can't!

372
00:32:08,406 --> 00:32:11,316
You know how much I dread writing.

373
00:32:11,316 --> 00:32:13,226
Unnie, please!

374
00:32:13,226 --> 00:32:16,386
You wrote an article about a grandmother with Oppa Dae Beom before.

375
00:32:16,386 --> 00:32:20,086
But this and that are completely different things.

376
00:32:20,086 --> 00:32:24,056
Just ignore her idea. She has such false hope. You are not even good at drawing!

377
00:32:24,056 --> 00:32:26,616
Seriously! What do you know about my drawing?

378
00:32:26,616 --> 00:32:28,836
I'll do the dishes.

379
00:32:28,836 --> 00:32:32,516
Unnie, let's just try one time. Pretty please!

380
00:32:32,516 --> 00:32:35,666
No, I can't do it. Focus on your food.

381
00:32:35,666 --> 00:32:38,656
Please, do it with me!

382
00:32:39,546 --> 00:32:43,606
Jo Ji Young, you've been acting weird lately. Why are you eating meals with us all the time?

383
00:32:43,606 --> 00:32:46,020
Also, you should call me before coming over!

384
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:49,600
Then I would prepare more food.

385
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,576
This is enough for me.

386
00:32:52,816 --> 00:32:57,196
Now I found a place in Seoul, all that's left is moving my stuff.

387
00:32:57,196 --> 00:32:59,866
Are you here to ask me to pack your stuff?

388
00:32:59,866 --> 00:33:01,746
Pack what stuff?

389
00:33:05,106 --> 00:33:11,626
I already prepared boxes and the truck to move your stuff so don't worry.

390
00:33:11,626 --> 00:33:14,986
What? I didn't even think about that.

391
00:33:18,536 --> 00:33:20,936
We are eating this together.

392
00:33:21,756 --> 00:33:23,436
I'm sorry.

393
00:33:23,436 --> 00:33:25,530
You are better than your dad.

394
00:33:26,506 --> 00:33:28,546
You guys were having a meal together.

395
00:33:28,546 --> 00:33:30,526
Oh, hello?

396
00:33:30,526 --> 00:33:32,436
Seong Min, the thing is...

397
00:33:32,436 --> 00:33:33,726
Why? Do you need some help?

398
00:33:33,726 --> 00:33:36,466
No, it's not like that.

399
00:33:36,466 --> 00:33:39,986
I wanted to ask for the phone number of the young lady from the billiards.

400
00:33:39,986 --> 00:33:42,066
Yeo Reum?

401
00:33:42,066 --> 00:33:45,546
It's good you are here, too, Manager Jo.

402
00:33:45,546 --> 00:33:49,156
Can you give a message to Dae Beom?

403
00:33:49,156 --> 00:33:51,726
About what?

404
00:33:51,726 --> 00:33:56,676
I didn't have a chance to thank them properly.

405
00:33:56,676 --> 00:34:01,256
I want to treat them to dinner at our restaurant.

406
00:34:01,256 --> 00:34:04,306
- Oh, really?
- That's a great idea!

407
00:34:04,306 --> 00:34:10,316
But while you're at it, do you have any intention of throwing a bigger party?

408
00:34:10,316 --> 00:34:11,966
How?

409
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:13,176
Beef.

410
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:17,566
- Beef! Beef!
- Yes! Yes!

411
00:34:17,566 --> 00:34:20,746
- Jun, come over for a beef party.
- Hooray!

412
00:34:21,366 --> 00:34:22,876
Please come to the party later. Call me!

413
00:34:22,876 --> 00:34:25,336
- See you later!
- You, too.

414
00:34:28,426 --> 00:34:31,836
Then let's take Ha Neul as well.

415
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:34,986
Why would you want Ha Neul to join? Let him just focus on studying.

416
00:34:34,986 --> 00:34:36,746
Why?

417
00:34:36,746 --> 00:34:41,006
Why? He didn't even go on the valley trip. I think he'll say he won't come.

418
00:34:41,006 --> 00:34:43,186
Oh, that's right. Bom.

419
00:34:43,186 --> 00:34:44,696
Yes?

420
00:34:44,696 --> 00:34:49,520
Are you no longer in contact with Jae Hoon?

421
00:34:50,366 --> 00:34:52,376
I'm asking...

422
00:34:53,356 --> 00:34:56,826
I was so surprised when I saw this text from him.

423
00:34:58,266 --> 00:35:02,356
[Jae Hoon: Noona, I'm going to America. Please take good care of Bom.]

424
00:35:06,106 --> 00:35:09,636
I don't know what happened between you two.

425
00:35:09,636 --> 00:35:12,616
But Jae Hoon likes you a lot.

426
00:35:13,596 --> 00:35:15,706
You know that, right?

427
00:35:15,706 --> 00:35:18,406
Let's not talk about him anymore.

428
00:35:19,636 --> 00:35:21,656
Okay.

429
00:35:23,546 --> 00:35:25,866
- Unnie.
- Yes?

430
00:35:25,866 --> 00:35:29,846
It would be great if we win the contest and get the 100 million won.

431
00:35:29,846 --> 00:35:32,416
What do you want to do if you get that money?

432
00:35:32,416 --> 00:35:34,266
Well...

433
00:35:40,006 --> 00:35:42,496
I miss my grandmother.

434
00:35:56,166 --> 00:36:00,976
If Bom draws with what I wrote, I think it'll fail.

435
00:36:00,976 --> 00:36:02,486
No.

436
00:36:02,486 --> 00:36:06,126
I'm really not good at writing. You know that.

437
00:36:06,126 --> 00:36:09,036
I don't know about that.

438
00:36:09,036 --> 00:36:10,836
You're just saying that.

439
00:36:13,446 --> 00:36:15,716
If I tell you honestly,

440
00:36:15,716 --> 00:36:18,896
I think I'm very similar to you.

441
00:36:18,896 --> 00:36:21,316
What's similar?

442
00:36:21,316 --> 00:36:26,286
I get very nervous I might be wrong when I'm solving math problems.

443
00:36:26,286 --> 00:36:29,006
But one day, the Netherlands' professor

444
00:36:29,006 --> 00:36:35,316
gave a wrong answer and simply said, "Oh, my gosh!"

445
00:36:35,316 --> 00:36:37,386
Really?

446
00:36:39,496 --> 00:36:42,176
For me,

447
00:36:42,176 --> 00:36:45,906
I enjoy conversing with you so much.

448
00:36:51,176 --> 00:36:55,276
So I decided to write a story.

449
00:36:55,276 --> 00:36:57,876
Why can't I think of anything?

450
00:36:59,496 --> 00:37:01,446
Gyeo Wool!

451
00:37:01,446 --> 00:37:05,386
I'm going to develop a white-page phobia.

452
00:37:10,466 --> 00:37:13,936
But it was difficult like I expected.

453
00:37:13,936 --> 00:37:17,026
What should I do?

454
00:37:18,856 --> 00:37:20,536
What did you say?

455
00:37:20,536 --> 00:37:23,596
"Just do it since I'm not good at it anyway"?

456
00:37:26,016 --> 00:37:28,156
You're right.

457
00:37:28,156 --> 00:37:30,496
How did you know that?

458
00:37:31,706 --> 00:37:33,526
Okay.

459
00:37:38,366 --> 00:37:41,206
What if I go to Hollywood with this?

460
00:37:46,896 --> 00:37:50,066
I can't go anywhere with this!

461
00:37:50,066 --> 00:37:53,646
Bom, I'm sorry!

462
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:56,526
I would like to pay for these.

463
00:38:00,796 --> 00:38:03,556
I'm not a genius.

464
00:38:03,556 --> 00:38:06,876
Let's admit that first and start the work.

465
00:38:08,366 --> 00:38:10,346
I'm just an ordinary human.

466
00:38:10,346 --> 00:38:14,366
No, I might be lacking a bit.

467
00:38:16,556 --> 00:38:18,956
No matter what, live every day.

468
00:38:18,956 --> 00:38:23,026
That's the only thing I can do about it.

469
00:38:28,296 --> 00:38:31,126
- Oh, what is it?
- You surprised me!

470
00:38:31,126 --> 00:38:32,416
When did you come home?

471
00:38:32,416 --> 00:38:36,116
You are good at writing, but you said you couldn't.

472
00:38:36,116 --> 00:38:39,586
Did you read it? You couldn't see it, right?

473
00:38:39,586 --> 00:38:44,166
But isn't the main character too old? How can I draw a woman with a child?

474
00:38:44,166 --> 00:38:48,316
No, I just wrote this as a test.

475
00:38:48,316 --> 00:38:50,096
- It's not like that...
- Let me read it again.

476
00:38:50,096 --> 00:38:51,716
- No!
- Let me see!

477
00:38:51,716 --> 00:38:53,536
Someone's at the front door.

478
00:38:53,536 --> 00:38:55,336
Who would that be?

479
00:38:56,136 --> 00:38:58,326
Who is it?

480
00:39:02,566 --> 00:39:04,576
Jae Hoon!

481
00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:05,916
Heo Jae Hoon.

482
00:39:05,916 --> 00:39:08,866
Bom, Noona.

483
00:39:08,866 --> 00:39:10,666
Have you been well?

484
00:39:10,666 --> 00:39:13,236
Didn't you go back to America?

485
00:39:13,236 --> 00:39:15,346
I did.

486
00:39:15,346 --> 00:39:17,596
But...

487
00:39:17,596 --> 00:39:20,066
I thought a lot while I was over there.

488
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:23,146
Then did you go to America and come back here?

489
00:39:23,146 --> 00:39:25,506
Yes, Bom.

490
00:39:27,196 --> 00:39:29,326
While I was away from you,

491
00:39:29,326 --> 00:39:32,496
I thought a lot about myself.

492
00:39:32,496 --> 00:39:34,306
Heo Jae Hoon, are you out of your mind?

493
00:39:34,306 --> 00:39:38,066
Is America right next door? Do you know how much plane tickets cost?

494
00:39:38,066 --> 00:39:42,566
Can you let me talk? Please don't cut me off.

495
00:39:42,566 --> 00:39:45,746
Okay. I'm sorry.

496
00:39:45,746 --> 00:39:49,466
I thought deeply about my life.

497
00:39:49,466 --> 00:39:52,326
I thought of what I truly wanted.

498
00:39:52,326 --> 00:39:56,046
I thought of what I should live for.

499
00:39:56,046 --> 00:40:00,166
After pondering those things, I returned here.

500
00:40:00,166 --> 00:40:03,826
Really? Why did you come here?

501
00:40:03,826 --> 00:40:05,356
I came here to marry you.

502
00:40:05,356 --> 00:40:07,026
What!

503
00:40:07,726 --> 00:40:11,056
M-Marriage? Are you crazy?

504
00:40:11,056 --> 00:40:14,976
So please give me your sincere answer as well.

505
00:40:14,976 --> 00:40:18,046
Should I go back to America?

506
00:40:21,266 --> 00:40:24,176
But we are too young to get married.

507
00:40:24,176 --> 00:40:26,826
I'm serious right now.

508
00:40:26,826 --> 00:40:29,346
Stop avoiding and answer my question.

509
00:40:31,016 --> 00:40:33,806
Do you hate that I came back?

510
00:40:34,926 --> 00:40:37,716
It's not that I dislike it.

511
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:43,746
But we should date properly before discussing marriage.

512
00:40:43,746 --> 00:40:45,706
Is that so?

513
00:40:45,706 --> 00:40:47,856
Then shall we do that?

514
00:40:47,856 --> 00:40:50,696
I didn't mean we should get married right now.

515
00:40:50,696 --> 00:40:55,006
Are you kidding me again? Stop it.

516
00:40:56,146 --> 00:40:58,566
Jae Hoon.

517
00:40:58,566 --> 00:41:00,106
It's so good to see you again.

518
00:41:00,106 --> 00:41:01,976
Noona.

519
00:41:02,706 --> 00:41:04,146
You did good.

520
00:41:04,146 --> 00:41:05,946
Thank you.

521
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:13,676
I missed you so much.

522
00:41:13,676 --> 00:41:15,416
Yes, me, too.

523
00:41:15,416 --> 00:41:17,486
Gyeo Wool!

524
00:41:21,536 --> 00:41:23,496
Who is this guy?

525
00:41:23,496 --> 00:41:27,806
- Well...
- Hello, I'm your brother-in-law.

526
00:41:27,806 --> 00:41:32,286
What? Are you really out of your mind?

527
00:41:32,286 --> 00:41:34,356
He's my young brother-in-law.

528
00:41:34,356 --> 00:41:37,436
Seriously, stop it!

529
00:41:38,606 --> 00:41:40,546
- Is it good?
- It's incredible!

530
00:41:40,546 --> 00:41:43,706
Of course, it'll be.

531
00:41:45,416 --> 00:41:46,916
Hyung!

532
00:41:46,916 --> 00:41:49,026
- Oh, Unnie!
- We are here.

533
00:41:49,026 --> 00:41:51,716
- Come on!
- Welcome! Have a seat.

534
00:41:51,716 --> 00:41:53,546
I bet you must be hungry.

535
00:41:53,546 --> 00:41:55,356
Thank you so much for the food.

536
00:41:55,356 --> 00:41:57,556
Jun, you, too. Come and sit.

537
00:41:57,556 --> 00:41:59,706
That's right, Jun.

538
00:41:59,706 --> 00:42:02,266
Geun Ho is now going to school!

539
00:42:02,266 --> 00:42:04,826
Wow, amazing!

540
00:42:04,826 --> 00:42:07,126
- My Geun Ho now goes to school!
- Great news!

541
00:42:07,126 --> 00:42:11,576
This beef's marbling is no joke. Eat as much as you want!

542
00:42:11,576 --> 00:42:13,446
You should also eat now.

543
00:42:13,446 --> 00:42:15,956
- Yeo Reum, Dae Beom.
- Yes?

544
00:42:15,956 --> 00:42:20,366
I'm so grateful to you two.

545
00:42:20,366 --> 00:42:22,106
It's nothing.

546
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:25,066
What do you mean "it's nothing"? Please, enjoy the food.

547
00:42:25,066 --> 00:42:27,956
Thank you for the food!

548
00:42:27,956 --> 00:42:31,126
- Thank you for the food!
- Uncle, Uncle!

549
00:42:31,126 --> 00:42:35,496
But weren't Unnie Yeo Reum and Oppa Dae Beom the stars of tonight?

550
00:42:35,496 --> 00:42:37,486
What's that?

551
00:42:37,486 --> 00:42:39,846
Oh, seriously!
[Congratulations to Manager Jo Ji Young on moving to Seoul!]

552
00:42:39,846 --> 00:42:44,046
It's nice to celebrate good things together with good people. Shall we read it together?

553
00:42:44,046 --> 00:42:48,926
Congratulations to Manager Jo Ji Young on moving to Seoul!

554
00:42:48,926 --> 00:42:52,726
- Seriously!
- She's leaving Angok!

555
00:42:52,726 --> 00:42:55,576
What's wrong with him?

556
00:42:55,576 --> 00:42:58,456
Jun, eat as much as you want!

557
00:42:58,456 --> 00:43:01,876
Yes, I'll eat a lot. Thanks for the food!

558
00:43:01,876 --> 00:43:03,496
- Shall we eat as well?
- Thanks for the food.

559
00:43:03,496 --> 00:43:05,546
- Thank you for the food!
- Enjoy!

560
00:43:05,546 --> 00:43:08,226
Do you want greens for the meat?

561
00:43:08,226 --> 00:43:10,236
It's so good.

562
00:43:10,236 --> 00:43:12,606
Go ahead and eat before it gets cold.

563
00:43:12,606 --> 00:43:15,126
Jae Hoon, eat the meat.

564
00:43:17,186 --> 00:43:20,056
- Eat as much as you want.
- Thank you.

565
00:43:30,036 --> 00:43:32,336
You're so good at it!

566
00:43:32,336 --> 00:43:35,276
Come! Come to the stage!

567
00:43:52,186 --> 00:43:55,356
I thought about what "happiness" means.

568
00:43:56,496 --> 00:43:59,106
When I searched it in the dictionary,

569
00:43:59,106 --> 00:44:03,236
it means you feel content with enough satisfaction and joy in your life

570
00:44:03,236 --> 00:44:06,936
or such a state.

571
00:44:08,216 --> 00:44:13,126
Since that was so long, I shortened it.

572
00:44:14,546 --> 00:44:16,956
"Happiness":

573
00:44:16,956 --> 00:44:20,036
"The state where you lack nothing."

574
00:44:25,526 --> 00:44:28,686
I thought about today.

575
00:44:28,686 --> 00:44:31,426
Through the air that chills at dawn now,

576
00:44:31,426 --> 00:44:34,996
I rode my bicycle down the streets before the sun rose.

577
00:44:34,996 --> 00:44:36,976
I felt content.

578
00:44:37,856 --> 00:44:39,806
It is enough.

579
00:44:45,236 --> 00:44:49,706
I came home thirsty and drank water.

580
00:44:49,706 --> 00:44:54,536
I remembered Grandma's remark that water is the tastiest thing in the world.

581
00:44:56,636 --> 00:44:58,496
It was true.

582
00:44:58,496 --> 00:45:00,576
It is enough.

583
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:10,286
I like the snapping sound when I hang the laundry on the line.

584
00:45:10,286 --> 00:45:15,036
Also, I like the smell of detergent left on my hands.

585
00:45:15,036 --> 00:45:17,036
It is enough.

586
00:45:22,696 --> 00:45:26,246
In the library, the afternoon sun felt like a drug;

587
00:45:26,246 --> 00:45:28,586
I dozed off a little bit.

588
00:45:28,586 --> 00:45:30,816
It was a sweet nap.

589
00:45:30,816 --> 00:45:32,866
It is enough.

590
00:45:34,336 --> 00:45:40,746
Standing before a bookcase, it's always fun to think what to read.

591
00:45:40,746 --> 00:45:42,740
It's exciting.

592
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,250
["The Beautiful Truth" by Kim Seong Hyeon]

593
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:46,266
It is enough.

594
00:45:51,586 --> 00:45:54,250
Whenever Bom and I lie down for bed,

595
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:57,276
we always laugh until our stomachs hurt.

596
00:45:57,276 --> 00:46:00,816
Sometimes it's funny just looking into each other's eyes.

597
00:46:00,816 --> 00:46:02,776
It is enough.

598
00:46:05,856 --> 00:46:08,476
What should I do then?

599
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:17,366
Bom, wake up.

600
00:46:21,856 --> 00:46:23,686
It's okay.

601
00:46:24,706 --> 00:46:26,666
Bom told me,

602
00:46:26,666 --> 00:46:27,646
"It's okay."

603
00:46:27,646 --> 00:46:31,136
When I said, "Everything's okay," on that day,

604
00:46:31,136 --> 00:46:37,116
surprisingly, it really felt like everything would be fine.

605
00:46:37,116 --> 00:46:38,976
I also felt the same way.

606
00:46:38,976 --> 00:46:45,836
When I said, "Everything's okay," it really felt like all would be okay.

607
00:46:49,626 --> 00:46:51,986
Wow, feel the wind.

608
00:46:51,986 --> 00:46:54,806
Unnie, I think it's really autumn now, isn't it?

609
00:46:54,806 --> 00:46:56,636
I think so, too.

610
00:46:57,426 --> 00:46:59,796
Can I tell you something surprising?

611
00:46:59,796 --> 00:47:01,576
What is it?

612
00:47:02,596 --> 00:47:04,446
Bom (Spring),

613
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:06,536
Yeo Reum (Summer),

614
00:47:06,536 --> 00:47:08,056
autumn (in the air),

615
00:47:08,056 --> 00:47:09,416
and Gyeo Wool (Winter)!

616
00:47:09,416 --> 00:47:12,786
- You're right!
- All four seasons are here now.

617
00:47:22,616 --> 00:47:29,316
Goodbye to my first summer in Angok.

618
00:47:38,636 --> 00:47:41,616
It really feels weird.

619
00:47:45,936 --> 00:47:49,706
I'm leaving soon. Do you feel okay?

620
00:47:49,706 --> 00:47:55,086
Ji Young, waiting for you is my hobby, and I'm best at it.

621
00:47:55,916 --> 00:47:58,466
I may meet a man if you keep waiting.

622
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:02,656
- If you want to, go for it!
- No.

623
00:48:03,376 --> 00:48:05,946
Hey, you live for the fun of criticizing others,

624
00:48:05,946 --> 00:48:09,306
and how can you find a better man than me who is easily criticized?

625
00:48:09,306 --> 00:48:13,516
I act like this only with you. Do you think I'd be like this to others?

626
00:48:13,516 --> 00:48:17,586
You are the one who makes me angry the most!

627
00:48:17,586 --> 00:48:19,986
Or you can go and return like me (getting married and divorced).

628
00:48:19,986 --> 00:48:22,616
I will still like you even so.

629
00:48:24,656 --> 00:48:26,536
Go where?

630
00:48:29,896 --> 00:48:32,306
Are you out of your mind?

631
00:48:32,306 --> 00:48:34,716
Unless you're crazy, how can you say that?

632
00:48:34,716 --> 00:48:37,386
- Jun might wake up.
- How can you say that in front of a child?

633
00:48:37,386 --> 00:48:39,916
Take back what you said. Take it back!

634
00:48:43,006 --> 00:48:44,396
Jun woke up!

635
00:48:44,396 --> 00:48:48,076
- He woke up due to you!
- Oh my.

636
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:57,486
What are you doing for this week's day off?

637
00:48:57,486 --> 00:48:59,946
Why? Do you want to go out for delicious food again?

638
00:48:59,946 --> 00:49:03,676
No, I was going to say, "Let's see Dae Ho."

639
00:49:03,676 --> 00:49:06,456
What? Dae Ho?

640
00:49:06,456 --> 00:49:08,976
You told me to be friends with him.

641
00:49:08,976 --> 00:49:11,266
I guess you matured a bit.

642
00:49:16,866 --> 00:49:18,596
- What was that?
- What?

643
00:49:18,596 --> 00:49:20,996
I wanted to play hard to get sometimes, too.

644
00:49:20,996 --> 00:49:23,446
It feels great after doing so.

645
00:49:23,446 --> 00:49:28,036
How dare you play hard to get?

646
00:49:28,036 --> 00:49:29,366
It's so much fun playing hard to get!

647
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:32,016
Come over here! Gyeo Wool, go get him!

648
00:49:32,016 --> 00:49:33,976
Give Gyeo Wool back to me!

649
00:49:33,976 --> 00:49:35,626
- Come here!
- Hurry, catch me.

650
00:49:35,626 --> 00:49:38,876
Gyeo Wool, go and bite him!

651
00:49:38,876 --> 00:49:41,666
Gyeo Wool, look at this. Look over here!

652
00:49:41,666 --> 00:49:42,946
Stop it!

653
00:49:42,946 --> 00:49:46,286
- Dae Beom.
- Yes?

654
00:49:46,286 --> 00:49:50,076
Do you ever regret staying here?

655
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:53,166
I don't regret it.

656
00:49:53,166 --> 00:49:55,166
What about you, Yeo Reum?

657
00:49:57,386 --> 00:49:59,326
Me, neither.

658
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:18,350
♫ I never knew it would burn me out ♫

659
00:50:20,866 --> 00:50:25,326
It's truly enough.

660
00:50:25,326 --> 00:50:30,306
I still don't know the answer to how I should live.

661
00:50:30,306 --> 00:50:34,526
But I'm enough now.

662
00:50:34,526 --> 00:50:36,496
Let's live.

663
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:41,240
♫ Let's go outside around ♫

664
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:46,510
♫ And feel the breeze somehow ♫

665
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:53,360
