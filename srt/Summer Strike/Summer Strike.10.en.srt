Grandma.

329
00:26:22,493 --> 00:26:27,513
Whenever I saw you, you reminded me of my mom.

330
00:26:31,443 --> 00:26:34,343
All you have done for me,

331
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:36,933

Goodbye.

Farewell.

335
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,843
Agasshi, you're back!

336
00:27:08,843 --> 00:27:12,263
I kept waiting for you to come home.

337
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:15,383
- Can you come to my place and talk for a second?
- No.

338
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:17,933
I... I have something for you.

339
00:27:17,933 --> 00:27:19,563
Can you come with me for a second, please?

340
00:27:19,563 --> 00:27:22,073
- No, I have nothing to say to you.
- No, please. I'm sorry.

341
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:24,753
- What are you doing right now?
- Young Lady, please!

342
00:27:24,753 --> 00:27:27,123
It won't take a lot of time.

343
00:27:27,123 --> 00:27:30,033
I'll make it quick and brief!

344
00:27:30,033 --> 00:27:33,243
Here, come inside.

345
00:27:33,243 --> 00:27:35,863
Come, come.

346
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:38,283
Have a seat. Do you want something to drink?

347
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:41,275
No, should I put together a meal? Aren't you hungry?

348
00:27:41,275 --> 00:27:43,775
No, I don't want to eat.

349
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:48,423
Look at this. This is a petition for my son.

350
00:27:48,423 --> 00:27:51,663
Can't you sign this for me?

351
00:27:52,313 --> 00:27:53,763
No, I won't sign it.

352

No, please! Young Lady.

353
00:27:57,323 --> 00:28:01,893
I understand it won't be easy for you to sign this from your perspective. But, please.

354
00:28:01,893 --> 00:28:05,893
Please do something for my son. Please, I beg you.

355

Ajumeoni.

357
00:28:12,713 --> 00:28:15,623
The one who wrote graffiti in the past was my Geun Ho.

358
00:28:15,623 --> 00:28:18,623
But this incident really has nothing to do with my son.

359
00:28:18,623 --> 00:28:20,323
Why do you keep acting like this?

360
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:24,703
Listen! My son lost his glasses the day before the incident so he wasn't wearing them that day.

361
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,163
But if he doesn't wear them, he can't see anything!

362
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:29,143
How could he have written the graffiti that day?

363
00:28:29,143 --> 00:28:30,583
Please stop this.

364
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,683

368
00:28:40,893 --> 00:28:43,893
How can you be this selfish?

369
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:47,903
Bom's grandmother passed away due to Geun Ho.

370
00:28:47,903 --> 00:28:49,953
That's not true!

371
00:28:49,953 --> 00:28:53,883
When you came to the billiards and said don't report Geun Ho for the graffiti,

372
00:28:53,883 --> 00:28:58,453
Grandma said Geun Ho is a sweet boy.

373
00:28:58,453 --> 00:29:02,803
She said Geun Ho's a sweet boy and I shouldn't report him.

374
00:29:02,803 --> 00:29:06,160
But he killed Grandma!

Is that so?

384

But I don't know why I feel sorry for him.

385
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,903
Why do you feel sorry for him?

386
00:29:47,903 --> 00:29:54,380
I called you to bring him no matter what

387
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:58,403
because the ethics committee was investigating.

388
00:29:58,403 --> 00:30:01,503
But that's not your fault.

I'll try hard. So please forgive me just once.

Please give me one chance.

I'm sorry.

Is it okay to leave Dae Beom alone like that?

What about it?

452
00:37:18,663 --> 00:37:22,303
I mean, he's studying without even sleeping.

That's the real Dae Beom.

Why would he do that?

Professor Lee made him do it.

460
00:37:58,413 --> 00:38:02,273
And Prof Lee asked the Dean to set up the call to the Dutch professor.

461
00:38:02,273 --> 00:38:06,563
So he made Dae Beom meet him on purpose.

I think Prof Lee purposely did this

465
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:19,100

If anyone drifts from you, let them.

491
00:40:15,553 --> 00:40:20,193
If anybody hates you, let them.

492
00:40:20,193 --> 00:40:22,613
But for me,

493
00:40:22,613 --> 00:40:28,393
I'll always like you the same as now, when or wherever I see you again.

494
00:40:29,423 --> 00:40:31,933
When we see each other again,

495
00:40:31,933 --> 00:40:35,133
I'll run to you with a smile and a big hug.

496
00:40:35,983 --> 00:40:37,813
I'll say, "It's been a while."

497
00:40:37,813 --> 00:40:41,053
I'll ask how you've been and say, "I missed you."

498
00:40:43,263 --> 00:40:45,163
That's how much...

499
00:40:46,803 --> 00:40:50,053
you are a good person to me.

500
00:40:51,203 --> 00:40:52,933
Noona...

501
00:40:55,153 --> 00:40:57,483
And...

502
00:40:57,483 --> 00:41:00,193
I think Bom thinks of you the same way I do.

503
00:41:05,453 --> 00:41:07,243
Thank you.

504
00:41:22,153 --> 00:41:24,153
Hello?

505
00:41:24,153 --> 00:41:26,643
Seong Min,

506
00:41:26,643 --> 00:41:28,883
are you happy?

507
00:41:28,883 --> 00:41:30,432
What?

508
00:41:30,432 --> 00:41:32,326
What are you saying out of the blue?

509
00:41:32,326 --> 00:41:35,486
I came to Seoul, but why am I unhappy?

510
00:41:37,713 --> 00:41:40,570
Ji Young, did something happen to you?

511
00:41:41,817 --> 00:41:44,173
I miss Angok, where nothing happens.

512
00:41:44,173 --> 00:41:46,650
What "nothing happens"?

513
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:49,250
The town became a mess.

514
00:41:49,873 --> 00:41:53,613
Is it due to Dae Beom again?

515
00:41:53,613 --> 00:41:57,043
I don't know what to do with Dae Beom.

516
00:41:57,043 --> 00:42:01,563
I guess Dae Beom has it tough since Yeo Reum is leaving here.

517
00:42:01,563 --> 00:42:03,263
What are you saying?

518
00:42:03,263 --> 00:42:05,133
Didn't you know?

519
00:42:05,133 --> 00:42:07,963
Yeo Reum is leaving this town soon.

520
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:11,613
Hello? Ji Young?

521
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:13,223
Hello?

522
00:42:38,513 --> 00:42:40,943
It's been a while.

523
00:42:44,073 --> 00:42:46,113
I missed you.

524
00:42:53,813 --> 00:42:56,073
You must be enduring a lot.

525
00:42:57,453 --> 00:42:59,643
Did you eat anything?

526
00:43:12,813 --> 00:43:14,703
I'm sorry.

527
00:43:23,503 --> 00:43:26,463
Also, I'm sorry to say "I'm sorry."

528
00:43:32,633 --> 00:43:34,153
Unnie.

529
00:43:37,103 --> 00:43:40,473
I know it's not your fault.

530
00:43:40,473 --> 00:43:43,393
But I kept blaming you.

531
00:43:43,393 --> 00:43:47,133
I tried my best not to blame you.

532
00:43:47,133 --> 00:43:49,733
But I couldn't help but feel resentment.

533
00:43:50,563 --> 00:43:53,703
I feel so sorry for my grandmother.

534
00:43:55,283 --> 00:43:57,843
It's so unfair

535
00:43:57,843 --> 00:44:00,553
and upsets me so much.

536
00:44:00,553 --> 00:44:03,653
I get upset when I try to eat,

537
00:44:04,893 --> 00:44:08,543
and I get angry when I lie down to sleep.

538
00:44:08,543 --> 00:44:11,513
I even get upset just breathing, like now.

539
00:44:17,653 --> 00:44:19,373
So...

540
00:44:22,403 --> 00:44:24,783
Let's see each other later.

541
00:44:24,783 --> 00:44:26,473
After some time...

542
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,793
Okay.

543
00:45:25,773 --> 00:45:27,713
Dae Beom.

544
00:45:27,713 --> 00:45:29,763
Oh, Noona.

545
00:45:36,003 --> 00:45:37,462
Can we talk?

546
00:45:37,462 --> 00:45:40,752
I need to read this part, one second.

547
00:45:43,013 --> 00:45:46,373
Yeo Reum is leaving Angok.

548
00:45:48,903 --> 00:45:50,373
What?

549
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:56,153
Something big happened to Yeo Reum while you were doing this.

550
00:45:57,503 --> 00:45:59,883
You didn't hear about this, did you?

554
00:47:27,656 --> 00:47:30,380
What did Grandma do wrong? Why did you do it?

555
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:32,984
Grandma is in danger! Run away!

556
00:47:32,984 --> 00:47:35,509
I can't help but think of Geun Ho.

557
00:47:35,509 --> 00:47:38,692
Look at what my son wrote in his room. He's really not the culprit!

558
00:47:38,692 --> 00:47:41,503
Can you just tell us what this means?

559
00:47:41,503 --> 00:47:44,863
It really felt like he was telling me to run from someone.

560
00:47:44,863 --> 00:47:48,513
I think someone was pretending to be Geun Ho and wrote this graffiti.

561
00:47:48,513 --> 00:47:52,183
How could my son have written this? He's in jail right now!

562
00:47:52,183 --> 00:47:54,263
Geun Ho, you didn't kill Grandma, right?

563
00:47:54,263 --> 00:47:56,383
You killed her, didn't you?
