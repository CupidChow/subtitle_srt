I've been mindlessly running toward some place for a while.

00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,480
I'm running with all my might,

The closer I get to the classroom,

it becomes increasingly clear to me.

Sir! I'm here. Can you open the door, please?

Sir!

14

The places, where I arrived after running with all my might,

24
00:03:15,005 --> 00:03:18,150
were the school, the office,

25

Yeo Reum, were you practicing the presentation?

35
00:04:25,386 --> 00:04:27,526
When did you get to the point of presenting a proposal?

36
00:04:27,526 --> 00:04:31,621
"From the Hand to the Poem," wow, the concept is very...

37

Oh, you look quite okay today.

Why are you making me nervous? What is it?

44

I heard the recent CEO has very high taste.

45
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:57,080
I heard he doesn't drink cheap coffee.

46
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,510
But would he be okay with this canned coffee?

47
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,494
- Is that true?
- Yes.

48
00:05:02,494 --> 00:05:05,389

- Yes!
- Mom, are you working in a restaurant again?

Oh, I'm taking up your lunchtime; I'll call you later!

Why is she working in a restaurant again?

121
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,843
I said I was working late tonight.

122
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:12,420
You didn't eat dinner, did you?

123
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,850
I know you like sushi from this place.

124
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,440
You didn't have to.

125
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,300
You have to go back to work right away, right?

126
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,185
- Excuse me, can I have another beer?
- Okay.

127
00:10:30,185 --> 00:10:35,380
When I was running in front of the cars holding the coffee, I wasn't afraid at all.

128
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:39,164
So I brought the coffee to the meeting room,

129
00:10:39,164 --> 00:10:42,609
but the CEO said he doesn't drink coffee!

130
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:46,694
And Da Mi says Assistant Manager Kim deceived me on purpose.

131

Do you think that's true?

132
00:10:50,592 --> 00:10:54,570
So what you are curious about right now

133
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:58,580
is if they lied to you or not. Is that correct?

134
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,150
Yes, sort of.

135
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:06,070
Okay. Let's say... they did lie to you.

136
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,510
But why?

137
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,590
Why would they do that?

138
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:12,320
It's a lie to be revealed in a second.

139
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,760
That's true.

140
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,170
Why? Why are they walking all over you?

141
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,870
Let's think about it.

142
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,720
Let's think if you really didn't do anything wrong.

143
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,880
Oppa.

144
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,880
Also, the real problem here is not their lie.

145
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,800
It's that you didn't go into the meeting room.

146
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:36,850
Think if you went in there all sweaty with the coffee.

147
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:39,449
The CEO would have loved it.

148
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:44,690
So if you got in there today and did the presentation, it would have been your jackpot.

149
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,880
Don't you think so, Yeo Reum?

150
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:52,810
Yeo Reum, the lie is not the problem right now.

151
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,560
Your complacency is the problem.

152
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,220
What is it?

153
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,340
Are you angry again since I said it like this?

154
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,750
You always liked to teach me things.

155
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,310
But...

156
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:26,090
I don't think you were angry at me before while teaching me things.

157
00:12:26,814 --> 00:12:29,104
Yeo Reum, I...

158
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,110
I'm not angry at you right now.

159
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,570
It's not that I'm angry at you.

160
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,440
I'm just a bit tired of you.

161
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,430

00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,820
Over time, we have changed.

164
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:15,290
During that time, I started to get obsessed with the idea of getting married.

165
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,620
Of course, that version of myself wasn't attractive anymore.

166

[I'm sorry for complaining when you're busy.]

167

[I'm sorry for complaining when you're busy. I won't do that again.]

168
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,940
I shouldn't have gone there to see him today.

169

173
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,310
I haven't heard from my boyfriend since then.

174
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,470
It's not like this hasn't happened before in the last six years.

175
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,760
But in the past, he called me back right away.

176
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,560
Ms. Yeo Reum.

177
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,300
Ms. Yeo Reum!

178
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,120
- Yes?
- What are you doing?

179
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,830
The Team Leader is calling you.

180
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:40,200
Oh, yes.

181
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,930
Come in here for a second.

182
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:47,894
It's been four years since you started working here, right?

183
00:15:47,894 --> 00:15:50,439
Yes, it's been about four years and three months.

184
00:15:50,439 --> 00:15:53,154
Right, okay.

185
00:15:53,154 --> 00:15:57,144
It must be the time when you want to work hard, isn't it?

186
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,310
Is that why you did something like this?

187
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,180
Well... We have been only working with Joo Seong until now,

188
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,940
and they get paid 100 million won (74,000 USD) from us.

189
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:14,040
Yes. Oh, keep going.

190
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,160
So I looked around and found another company with newer machines,

191
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,070
and they asked for 80 million won ($59,000).

192
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,380
The 80 million won,

193
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,370
then we save 20 million won, right?

194
00:16:27,793 --> 00:16:29,920
Yeo Reum.

195
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,270
Do you know why I hired you?

196
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:39,250
Frankly, you are not charismatic like Assistant Manager Kim.

197
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:43,000
You are like, how should I put this?

198
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,360
Right, you are like a cow.

199
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,730
Putting your head down, doing as you're told like a cow,

200
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,610
that is your strength.

201
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,890
A small company like ours doesn't have a system.

202
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:57,010
So all need to do what they are good at.

203
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:03,670
So I want you to just do what you are ordered to do in silence like a cow!

204
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,300
Got it?

205
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:10,570
But how dare you try to change the printing company on your own?

206
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:17,230
Why? Is it because the CEO loved your proposal yesterday, and you thought this was the chance?

207
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,940
No, I'm sorry.

208
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,240

You are not a human level yet.

When I was young, you worked at a restaurant,

and you always came late after my brother and I were asleep.

238

was myself.

♫ Take a pic by the beach now ♫

484
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:50,870
♫ Let's go on a sun route ♫

485
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:55,390
♫ And feel the breeze surround ♫

486
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:59,380
♫ I do what I want to do ♫

487
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:03,910
♫ I'll dance and fly high ♫

488
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:07,890
♫ No matter what they say ♫

489
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:12,870
♫ I'm going to relax now ♫

490
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:36,190
♫ I never knew it would burn me out ♫

491
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:43,910
♫ Never knew how to take care of myself ♫

492
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,290
It's nice.

493
00:46:58,235 --> 00:47:02,070
From now on, I'm not going to do anything.

494
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:04,470
My life is on strike!

495
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:13,160
♫ I'll dance and fly high ♫

496
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:28,840
♫ I was young when I thought that being a hero ♫

497
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:34,430
♫ Put on a cape, take flight ♫

498
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:40,100
♫ Like a fading Polaroid and my favorite childhood toy ♫

499
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:45,720
♫ I'm filled with faith. I take flight ♫

500
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:49,640
[Summer Strike]

501
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:54,120
A person can be destroyed, but not defeated.

502
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:57,130
That's right. I'll live here not worrying what other people think.
[Library Membership Card]

503
00:47:57,130 --> 00:47:58,780
I'll do as I wish.

504
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:00,400
What's wrong with that young woman?

505
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,080
What a disgrace.

506
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:05,640
How much did she drink for her to fall asleep in the library?

507
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,810
- I'm sorry.
- Sure!

508
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:10,510
If you can't live there anymore, move out anytime.

509
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:12,750
There's nothing more to lose.

510
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:15,620
Let's live to the fullest and not regret anything.

511
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:18,020
I can do it!
