And going in that direction

236

is a spacious, clean one, but reviews say their chicken is just okay.

237

Then this way, a place has outdoor tables.

Then the next question...

332
00:24:09,561 --> 00:24:15,341
Then my next question, who is your favorite writer?

333
00:24:15,341 --> 00:24:19,181
Well... This is a hard one.

334
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,251
Pick who comes to mind.

335
00:24:22,251 --> 00:24:25,651
I like Kim Ae-ran (wrote "My Brilliant Life").

336
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,091
What about you, Dae Beom?

337
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:31,000
My favorite is Carl Sagan (American astronomer).

338
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,140
I enjoyed "Murmurs of Earth" so much.

339
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:37,351
That suits you very well.

340
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:40,201
Okay, last question!

341
00:24:40,201 --> 00:24:42,841
What's your favorite season?

342
00:24:42,841 --> 00:24:45,280
I like summer ("Yeo Reum").

343
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,711
I meant the summer season.

344
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:54,641
I know. My favorite season is also summer.

345
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:01,901
Can I ask one more? It's the final question, really.

346
00:25:01,901 --> 00:25:03,421
Of course.

347
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:11,541
Why didn't you speak to me when we first met?

348
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,621
Well, actually,

349
00:25:16,621 --> 00:25:21,101
I find it difficult to talk to strangers.

350
00:25:21,101 --> 00:25:22,761
That's why.

351
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:29,011
Then I guess you feel comfortable with me now.

352
00:25:29,011 --> 00:25:31,821
You spoke a lot with me today.

353
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:35,521
Maybe that's why I feel like my throat is sore. Ahem.

354
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:39,651
We didn't talk that much.

355
00:25:47,091 --> 00:25:50,831
[I know you're the one who killed Seon Ah. I saw it.]

356
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:55,311
What's that?
[I know you're the one who killed Seon Ah. I saw it.]

357
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,661
Are you okay?

358
00:26:04,661 --> 00:26:06,521
Yeo Reum, I'm sorry.

359
00:26:06,521 --> 00:26:08,981
Dae Beom.

360
00:26:08,981 --> 00:26:11,181
Dae Beom!

361
00:26:37,351 --> 00:26:39,141
[I know you're the one who killed Seon Ah.]

362
00:26:41,041 --> 00:26:42,831
[I saw it.]

363
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,701
You better tell me the truth!

364
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:42,041
I don't know.

365
00:27:42,041 --> 00:27:45,971
How dare you keep lying? You shouldn't lie here!

366
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:53,221
Dae Beom, you spoke well; why do you not talk suddenly?

367
00:27:53,221 --> 00:27:56,671
You said, "On my way home, I saw my father run away."

368
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,180
Is that wrong?

369
00:27:59,851 --> 00:28:02,811
Dae Beom, look at me.

370
00:28:02,811 --> 00:28:05,571
I told you to look at me!

371
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:14,861
Honestly, you are happy Seon Ah died, aren't you?

372
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,781
You didn't like your sister.

373
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:20,351
Right?

374
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,020
It seems like you're right.

375
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,740
He's happy his sister died.

376
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:33,931
No. That's not true.

377
00:28:33,931 --> 00:28:36,491
That's not true!

378
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:41,211
It's not true.

379
00:28:59,501 --> 00:29:01,301
[I know you're the one who killed Seon Ah.]

380
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,540
[Pesticides]

381
00:29:20,481 --> 00:29:22,451
Dae Beom.

382
00:29:27,081 --> 00:29:29,291
Ahn Dae Beom!

383
00:29:37,781 --> 00:29:39,541
Oh, you're here.

384
00:29:39,541 --> 00:29:41,811
Who pulled up the shutter?

385
00:29:41,811 --> 00:29:44,891
- Did you pull it up, Mr. Kwak?
- No, I didn't.

386
00:29:44,891 --> 00:29:47,401
Hey, go ahead and pull it down.

387
00:29:50,481 --> 00:29:52,351
What kind of crazy b*stard did this?

388
00:29:52,351 --> 00:29:54,601
They did this sh*t again!

389
00:29:54,601 --> 00:29:57,571
"I know you're the one who killed Seon Ah."

390
00:29:59,301 --> 00:30:02,301
"I saw it"?

391
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:05,151
The one who killed Seon Ah was her father!

392
00:30:05,151 --> 00:30:08,901
Father, I think we need to report this to the police, or it may become a bigger problem.

393
00:30:08,901 --> 00:30:11,621
Then word will spread to the county; that's not good.

394
00:30:11,621 --> 00:30:14,331
How is that the issue right now?

395
00:30:14,331 --> 00:30:19,411
Seriously! What kind of karma do I have with Seon Ah's household?

396
00:30:19,411 --> 00:30:22,651
Father! Watch your words!

397
00:30:23,311 --> 00:30:27,611
Dae Beom, that punk! I overlooked it because I felt bad for him, but...

398
00:30:27,611 --> 00:30:29,971
He's a victim.

399
00:30:29,971 --> 00:30:31,651
What?

400
00:30:31,651 --> 00:30:34,511
Dae Beom is the biggest victim here.

401
00:30:34,511 --> 00:30:37,151
Yes, good that you brought it up.

402
00:30:37,151 --> 00:30:39,331
Did I kill his sister and his mother?

403
00:30:39,331 --> 00:30:43,641
Because they died, this building turned into a useless thing!

404
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:45,831
The victim of that is me! Me!

405
00:30:45,831 --> 00:30:49,081
Ahjussi, please calm down.

406
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:53,701
Let me put a surveillance camera right here as the first step.

407
00:30:53,701 --> 00:30:56,741
Yes, a surveillance camera!

408
00:30:56,741 --> 00:30:59,291
We should have put one up a while ago.

409
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:03,261
Mu Cheol, thank you. You're the only one I can rely on.

410
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:07,031
Yeo Reum.

411
00:31:10,371 --> 00:31:15,041
If you see anyone suspicious, please contact me right away.

412
00:31:16,261 --> 00:31:17,561
I will.

413
00:31:17,561 --> 00:31:20,471
Hello, Professor. This is Reporter Park Cheol Hyun from "Tomorrow's News."

414
00:31:20,471 --> 00:31:23,921
- I won't take any interviews. Bye.
- Wait! One second, Sir.

415
00:31:23,921 --> 00:31:26,791
Someone reported on your recent paper in the science community.

416
00:31:26,791 --> 00:31:29,171
I don't have any time. Bye.

417
00:31:29,171 --> 00:31:31,881
Professor? Professor?

418
00:31:31,881 --> 00:31:36,231
Professor, I think you need to see this.

419
00:31:36,231 --> 00:31:39,001
This is up on the anonymous community.

420
00:31:39,001 --> 00:31:41,011
What is this?

421
00:31:41,011 --> 00:31:45,521
It says you paid to take someone else's idea so people are wild right now.

422
00:31:45,521 --> 00:31:48,011
"Took someone else's idea"?

423
00:31:48,011 --> 00:31:51,291
They don't know what's going on.

424
00:31:51,291 --> 00:31:55,961
This might become a bigger issue if Sunbae Dae Beom doesn't show up in person.

425
00:31:55,961 --> 00:31:59,291
The university president will meet Ethics Committee.

426
00:31:59,291 --> 00:32:02,781
"Ethics Committee"? Then what happens next?

427
00:32:02,781 --> 00:32:06,751
In the worst-case scenario, both of them can be banned from academia,

428
00:32:06,751 --> 00:32:10,881
since selling an idea is a huge issue in this field.

429
00:32:10,881 --> 00:32:13,711
So Sunbae Dae Beom may get dragged into it and be harmed.

430
00:32:13,711 --> 00:32:15,561
Dae Beom as well?

431
00:32:15,561 --> 00:32:16,991
Yes.

432
00:32:16,991 --> 00:32:22,321
So he must show up to the ethics committee and tell the truth.

433
00:32:22,321 --> 00:32:24,151
Please ask him to come.

434
00:32:27,551 --> 00:32:33,311
Okay. I'll call you later after talking to Dae Beom.

435
00:32:34,211 --> 00:32:36,191
Hello.

436
00:32:36,991 --> 00:32:39,721
Where's Dae Beom?

437
00:32:39,721 --> 00:32:41,731
"Dae Beom."

438
00:32:42,301 --> 00:32:44,821
He hasn't come to work yet.

439
00:32:47,631 --> 00:32:50,001
By any chance...

440
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:52,951
Did something happen between you two last night?

441
00:32:55,221 --> 00:32:57,031
The thing is...

442
00:32:58,581 --> 00:33:01,871
Why are you obsessing over things like this?

443
00:33:01,871 --> 00:33:04,101
It's just a short trip, not a sixtieth birthday.

444
00:33:04,101 --> 00:33:06,771
I'm sorry. I went overboard shopping.

445
00:33:06,771 --> 00:33:10,291
It seems a lot, but we'll eat it all. Right?

446
00:33:13,051 --> 00:33:15,301
Hey, where are you going?

447
00:33:15,301 --> 00:33:17,131
What? Won't you come in?

448
00:33:17,131 --> 00:33:18,451
This is my place.

449
00:33:18,451 --> 00:33:21,111
- This house?
- Yes.

450
00:33:21,911 --> 00:33:23,681
Come in.

451
00:33:27,321 --> 00:33:30,311
You can put the groceries over here.

452
00:33:32,861 --> 00:33:35,951
Is this really your house?

453
00:33:35,951 --> 00:33:38,151
No, it's my aunt's place.

454
00:33:38,151 --> 00:33:40,011
Our homeroom teacher?

455
00:33:40,011 --> 00:33:42,231
Did you know that?

456
00:33:42,231 --> 00:33:44,531
I bet all in school know besides you and her.

457
00:33:44,531 --> 00:33:47,511
You two always talk at the back in teacher's room.

458
00:33:47,511 --> 00:33:49,781
You all knew it.

459
00:33:50,591 --> 00:33:52,850
But the homeroom teacher...

460
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:56,711
So your aunt was this rich?

461
00:33:56,711 --> 00:33:59,591
It's complicated to say it. But come over here.

462
00:33:59,591 --> 00:34:03,731
My dad bought this house for her to keep an eye on me.

463
00:34:03,731 --> 00:34:05,551
Have a seat here.

464
00:34:07,521 --> 00:34:10,871
I guess it must be uncomfortable for you to live with your aunt.

465
00:34:10,871 --> 00:34:13,711
- She doesn't live here.
- What?

466
00:34:13,711 --> 00:34:16,391
Do you use this gigantic house all by yourself?

467
00:34:16,391 --> 00:34:19,101
Actually, I use only this space on the first floor.

468
00:34:19,101 --> 00:34:20,401
Why?

469
00:34:20,401 --> 00:34:22,571
I don't know. Sit there and have a rest.

470
00:34:22,571 --> 00:34:24,371
It's okay. Let's do it together.

471
00:34:24,371 --> 00:34:26,821
I'd appreciate your help.

472
00:34:29,001 --> 00:34:31,621
What's going on?

473
00:34:31,621 --> 00:34:34,311
Why is this big fridge so empty?

474
00:34:34,311 --> 00:34:36,271
Don't you like cooking?

475
00:34:36,271 --> 00:34:38,751
Cooking's meaning is not eating, but doing it for someone else.

476
00:34:38,751 --> 00:34:41,361
On my own, I just eat whatever.

477
00:34:44,141 --> 00:34:47,901
Bom, can you peel some pears for me?

478
00:34:50,201 --> 00:34:52,431
I think somebody came home.

479
00:34:54,091 --> 00:34:56,311
It's a beautiful house.

480
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:58,751
Hi.

481
00:34:58,751 --> 00:35:00,901
Aunt, why come here out of the blue?

482
00:35:00,901 --> 00:35:04,201
I told you a new English teacher is coming today.

483
00:35:04,961 --> 00:35:08,811
But what's all this? And why is she here?

484
00:35:08,811 --> 00:35:10,981
Aunt, the thing is...

485
00:35:10,981 --> 00:35:13,241
Heo Jae Hoon, let's talk for a second.

486
00:35:13,241 --> 00:35:16,191
Thomas, wait a minute. I'm sorry.

487
00:35:16,191 --> 00:35:19,641
- No problem. Take your time.
- Thank you.

488
00:35:19,641 --> 00:35:22,041
Bom, I'm sorry. Excuse me a second.

489
00:35:26,381 --> 00:35:30,981
Heo Jae Hoon! Why are you doing this, seriously?

490
00:35:30,981 --> 00:35:33,021
- Hi.
- How many times must I tell you?

491
00:35:33,021 --> 00:35:35,931
You wouldn't act this way if you consider your parents!

492
00:35:35,931 --> 00:35:38,461
You can't act this way!

493
00:36:27,131 --> 00:36:30,201
Stand up. Let's go to the hospital.

494
00:36:32,211 --> 00:36:34,411
I said stand up.

495
00:36:37,741 --> 00:36:42,041
I... I'm fine.

496
00:36:43,341 --> 00:36:45,091
Okay then.

497
00:36:45,881 --> 00:36:48,961
Live or die, do whatever you want by yourself.

498
00:36:58,351 --> 00:37:01,601
I've warned you! I won't say this twice.

499
00:37:02,691 --> 00:37:04,271
Jae Hoon, I'll get going.

500
00:37:04,271 --> 00:37:07,441
Hey! Listen well.

501
00:37:07,441 --> 00:37:12,091
I don't know your scheme, but if you call him again, I won't leave you alone.

502
00:37:13,871 --> 00:37:16,051
Heo Jae Hoon.

503
00:37:16,051 --> 00:37:17,771
Do you hate hanging out with me?

504
00:37:17,771 --> 00:37:19,461
Wait, what?

505
00:37:20,431 --> 00:37:22,461
No, I love it.

506
00:37:22,461 --> 00:37:24,611
I like it the most.

507
00:37:24,611 --> 00:37:27,661
See? He chases after me.

508
00:37:27,661 --> 00:37:30,571
Look how this girl speaks! Do you want to get expelled from school?

509
00:37:30,571 --> 00:37:32,091
Bom, let's go together.

510
00:37:32,091 --> 00:37:34,011
Heo Jae Hoon! Where are you going?

511
00:37:34,011 --> 00:37:35,941
I'll tell your dad everything.

512
00:37:35,941 --> 00:37:38,211
Do as you wish.

513
00:37:38,211 --> 00:37:43,431
Hey, Thomas. She is a very bad aunt.

514
00:37:43,431 --> 00:37:45,361
I heard everything as well.

515
00:37:45,361 --> 00:37:46,801
Thomas!

516
00:37:46,801 --> 00:37:48,431
What?

517
00:38:00,191 --> 00:38:01,741
- Nurse Kim.
- Yes?

518
00:38:01,741 --> 00:38:04,531
- Give him a shot.
- Okay.

519
00:38:04,531 --> 00:38:07,221
- Get the shot before you go.
- Okay.

520
00:38:07,221 --> 00:38:09,371
Please come this way.

521
00:38:16,101 --> 00:38:17,661
How is he?

522
00:38:17,661 --> 00:38:22,661
Trauma isn't easily forgotten, even if they say they forgot everything;

523
00:38:22,661 --> 00:38:25,571
your body is smarter than you think.

524
00:38:26,151 --> 00:38:28,021
You know he needs an emotional rest, right?

525
00:38:28,021 --> 00:38:29,651
Yes.

526
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:33,221
Just let him do what he wants to do.

527
00:38:33,221 --> 00:38:35,171
We have to wait and see.

528
00:38:35,171 --> 00:38:36,761
Lie down comfortably here.

529
00:38:36,761 --> 00:38:40,101
Is he in a bad state?

530
00:38:40,101 --> 00:38:43,771
Yes, he's not in a great state.

531
00:38:43,771 --> 00:38:48,671
I'll increase his medication; make sure he takes it regularly.

532
00:38:48,671 --> 00:38:50,041
Yes, I will.

533
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:52,401
Good. But that is it.

534
00:38:52,401 --> 00:38:54,601
When will you two invite me to your wedding?

535
00:38:54,601 --> 00:38:56,071
Next patient, please come to the office.

536
00:38:56,071 --> 00:38:59,361
I told you! We are not like that.

537
00:38:59,361 --> 00:39:01,871
It's because he's not good at expressing his feelings!

538
00:39:01,871 --> 00:39:03,431
It's not like that.

539
00:39:04,511 --> 00:39:06,461
By the way,

540
00:39:06,461 --> 00:39:09,281
who wrote that graffiti?

541
00:39:21,541 --> 00:39:23,601
Seon Ah, die.

542
00:39:23,601 --> 00:39:26,291
Kill Seon Ah. Seon Ah, die.

543
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:28,631
Kill Seon Ah. Seon Ah, die.

544
00:39:28,631 --> 00:39:30,691
Kill Seon Ah. Seon Ah, die!

545
00:39:30,691 --> 00:39:33,151
Kill Seon Ah. Seon Ah, die!

546
00:39:33,151 --> 00:39:34,801
Kill Seon Ah! Kill Seon Ah!

547
00:39:34,801 --> 00:39:37,551
She's not Seon Ah, Geun Ho!

548
00:39:37,551 --> 00:39:39,221
- Okay? Please!
- No, kill Seon Ah.

549
00:39:39,221 --> 00:39:41,961
Please get yourself together, can you?

550
00:39:41,961 --> 00:39:44,561
Geun Ho, look at me. Look at Mom's face.

551
00:39:44,561 --> 00:39:46,771
If you do that again, I'll call the police.

552
00:39:46,771 --> 00:39:49,671
The policeman is scary! The policeman is scary!

553
00:39:49,671 --> 00:39:51,661
Geun Ho!

554
00:39:51,661 --> 00:39:53,491
The policeman is scary!

555
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:57,981
- Seon Ah is in danger. Seon Ah is in danger...
- It's okay, Geun Ho. Please calm down.

556
00:40:01,831 --> 00:40:03,591
Noona.

557
00:40:05,641 --> 00:40:07,811
You were...

558
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:13,411
friends with my sister.

559
00:40:16,191 --> 00:40:18,281
Did you like her?

560
00:40:19,671 --> 00:40:21,801
We weren't friends.

561
00:40:21,801 --> 00:40:24,701
She was the sky, and I was the ground.

562
00:40:29,631 --> 00:40:32,061
I didn't like her.

563
00:40:38,141 --> 00:40:41,301
Because of my sister,

564
00:40:44,961 --> 00:40:47,791
I was scolded by my father every day.

565
00:41:21,691 --> 00:41:25,081
What brings you all the way here?

566
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:32,341
This is how you live here.

567
00:41:32,341 --> 00:41:34,281
Let me sit down.

568
00:41:37,221 --> 00:41:39,371
How is...

569
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:42,031
How is Dae Beom?

570
00:41:42,031 --> 00:41:47,451
He got a sedative at the hospital. I'm back from laying him down at his place.

571
00:41:47,451 --> 00:41:49,391
Did he go to a hospital?

572
00:41:54,741 --> 00:41:56,611
Yeo Reum.

573
00:41:57,351 --> 00:42:01,061
You said you heard what happened here before, right?

574
00:42:01,901 --> 00:42:05,401
Yes. I heard it from Bom.

575
00:42:06,501 --> 00:42:12,401
Did you hear who found the body first when Dae Beom's sister died?

576
00:42:14,701 --> 00:42:16,661
It was Dae Beom.

577
00:42:17,551 --> 00:42:22,091
Also, the one who found Dae Beom's mother after she committed suicide

578
00:42:22,091 --> 00:42:23,911
was Dae Beom.

579
00:42:24,791 --> 00:42:30,481
He's already having a hard time just because you are living in this building.

580
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:33,771
It'll keep reminding him of the past.

581
00:42:33,771 --> 00:42:38,931
He thinks he killed all his family members.

582
00:42:40,711 --> 00:42:42,861
What about Bom's hospital bill?

583
00:42:42,861 --> 00:42:45,201
Do you know who paid for it?

584
00:42:45,201 --> 00:42:47,781
Her hospital bill? Did he?

585
00:42:47,781 --> 00:42:52,311
Since you were stressed out about Bom's hospital bill,

586
00:42:52,311 --> 00:42:57,771
Dae Beom called his former professor and sold the paper he wrote

587
00:42:57,771 --> 00:42:59,821
so he could pay Bom's hospital bill.

588
00:43:02,141 --> 00:43:06,911
But due to that, the professor who helped Dae Beom is now in trouble.

589
00:43:06,911 --> 00:43:11,081
And if Dae Beom doesn't go to Seoul right now,

590
00:43:11,081 --> 00:43:14,001
too many things will be messed up.

591
00:43:14,001 --> 00:43:16,021
Why did this happen?

592
00:43:17,121 --> 00:43:19,271
Yeo Reum.

593
00:43:19,271 --> 00:43:21,301
Do you like Dae Beom?

594
00:43:22,051 --> 00:43:23,061
Pardon?

595
00:43:23,061 --> 00:43:25,451
But I don't care about that anymore.

596
00:43:25,451 --> 00:43:29,031
I don't care if you have feelings for him or not.

597
00:43:29,031 --> 00:43:34,961
I just really hate that Dae Beom's life keeps getting worse because of you.

598
00:43:35,701 --> 00:43:39,801
Do you know how hard it is for Dae Beom to live?

599
00:43:39,801 --> 00:43:43,361
He just runs every day without sleeping.

600
00:43:43,361 --> 00:43:45,701
He's always alone.

601
00:43:45,701 --> 00:43:47,481
That's how he survived.

602
00:43:47,481 --> 00:43:51,421
He tried his best to endure with all his strength.

603
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:54,201
But that all collapsed today.

604
00:43:54,941 --> 00:43:57,601
If he goes into his room like now,

605
00:43:58,431 --> 00:44:04,091
I have no idea when he'll be able to come out again.

606
00:44:08,781 --> 00:44:10,171
I'm sorry.

607
00:44:10,171 --> 00:44:14,001
No, anyone can say sorry.

608
00:44:14,001 --> 00:44:16,301
Yeo Reum.

609
00:44:16,301 --> 00:44:18,571
Can you take responsibility?

610
00:44:19,961 --> 00:44:24,411
Can you take responsibility for Dae Beom's life?

611
00:44:25,691 --> 00:44:27,651
I can do it.

612
00:44:27,651 --> 00:44:31,181
I did it until now; I'll do it in the future as well.

613
00:44:32,861 --> 00:44:34,951
Yeo Reum, for you,

614
00:44:35,611 --> 00:44:38,291
it might be just a summer fling in a beach town,

615
00:44:38,291 --> 00:44:40,191
but my relationship with Dae Beom is different.

616
00:44:40,191 --> 00:44:42,881
It's not like that for me.

617
00:44:44,521 --> 00:44:47,211
If not then please help me.

618
00:44:48,801 --> 00:44:54,521
If you won't leave this place, please help Dae Beom to go.

619
00:44:55,851 --> 00:44:57,851
I beg of you.

620
00:45:01,011 --> 00:45:02,841
Please help him once.

621
00:45:33,161 --> 00:45:35,221
Will you be okay?

622
00:45:36,571 --> 00:45:40,231
I'll beg my aunt's forgiveness when I get home.

623
00:45:40,231 --> 00:45:42,121
That sounds like you.

624
00:45:43,441 --> 00:45:46,111
Thank you, Bom.

625
00:45:47,371 --> 00:45:48,991
For what?

626
00:45:50,101 --> 00:45:52,101
Just everything.

627
00:45:53,961 --> 00:45:58,341
I'm envious you can act like that.

628
00:45:58,341 --> 00:46:00,601
Did you say you envy me?

629
00:46:00,601 --> 00:46:03,111
- I envy you.
- Of me?

630
00:46:03,111 --> 00:46:04,951
Yes.

631
00:46:04,951 --> 00:46:07,071
You are rich.

632
00:46:11,221 --> 00:46:16,041
I think you are richer than I am.

633
00:46:17,291 --> 00:46:21,071
You have Ha Neul and your grandmother.

634
00:46:31,061 --> 00:46:34,491
By the way, what if our homeroom teacher really expels me?

635
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:37,751
Please talk well of me to her when you get home.

636
00:46:38,821 --> 00:46:41,641
If she says so, I'll say I'll quit school, too.

If I didn't live in that billiard room...

645
00:48:32,651 --> 00:48:35,571
you wouldn't have to go through that, Dae Beom.

646
00:48:35,571 --> 00:48:37,921
You know it's not your fault, Yeo Reum.

647
00:48:37,921 --> 00:48:41,831
Because you came to Angok, I became sincerely happy.

648
00:48:41,831 --> 00:48:44,981
I don't want to create more sad situations.

649
00:48:44,981 --> 00:48:47,811
If anyone writes graffiti again, bite him.

650
00:48:47,811 --> 00:48:49,511
O-Okay, good luck with your work!

651
00:48:49,511 --> 00:48:52,001
Maybe he did the graffiti.

652
00:48:52,001 --> 00:48:53,472
We've installed the surveillance camera now.

653
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:54,434
Who the heck are you?

654
00:48:54,434 --> 00:48:56,952
So we can catch the culprit if it happens again.
