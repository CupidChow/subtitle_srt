The real problem is that I might need to do the work.

Is there anyone adequate?

180
00:14:18,828 --> 00:14:23,598
I did only proofreading at the publishing company.

181
00:14:23,598 --> 00:14:26,840
And it's very different from writing.

182
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,918
No. If you know how to proofread, you are very close to writing.

It's only for this month. Please take this job just this once. Please!

187
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:42,268
But I'm really not confident I can do the job right.

188
00:14:42,268 --> 00:14:45,698
I'm even less confident. I don't even write a diary!

Did he just say he'll get dinner?

330
00:25:17,468 --> 00:25:19,988
I'm in. What about you?

331
00:25:19,988 --> 00:25:22,288
Why are you so good at reading the room at times like this?

332
00:25:22,288 --> 00:25:25,148
Thank you for the food, Hyung. I was getting hungry.

333
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:27,558
- Dae Beom, Dae Beom.
- Yes?

334
00:25:27,558 --> 00:25:29,708
- What should I do now?
- What's going on?

335
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:32,348
- I passed the first exam!
- What?

336
00:25:37,678 --> 00:25:39,538
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

337
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,298
The result came out today.

338
00:25:41,298 --> 00:25:46,258
After you left, I wondered if I should open it on my own or wait until you returned, but then I opened it,

339
00:25:46,258 --> 00:25:48,758
and I saw that I had passed!

340
00:25:48,758 --> 00:25:52,508
How can you call everyone to tell them the result except me?

341
00:25:52,508 --> 00:25:55,178
Dong Chul called and asked if I knew you had passed the test!

342
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:58,108
- No, I didn't call him!
- Well, goodness.

343
00:25:58,108 --> 00:26:02,188
Anyway, tonight's dinner is covered!

344
00:26:02,188 --> 00:26:04,808
- Is it on you?
- No, it's on you, Jo Ji Young.

345
00:26:04,808 --> 00:26:07,108
Sister! Tonight's a jackpot.

346
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:08,938
We need a table for the group.

347
00:26:08,938 --> 00:26:11,648
It's good to see you, Manager Jo!

348
00:26:11,648 --> 00:26:14,258
Today, Manager Jo Ji Young passed the Grade 7 Civil Servant test.

349
00:26:14,258 --> 00:26:16,108
- Is that so?
- What should we call her now?

350
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:19,238
I'm so happy for you!

351
00:26:19,238 --> 00:26:22,058
- Let's put these tables together.
- Can you guys help?

352
00:26:22,058 --> 00:26:25,438
- Let's put them together.
- Okay, good.

353
00:26:25,438 --> 00:26:28,398
- We'll clean it for you. Give me one second.
- Thank you.

354
00:26:28,398 --> 00:26:32,960
[Jeil Restaurant]

355
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,548
I brought some lettuce. Is it okay for us to eat it here?

356
00:26:38,548 --> 00:26:41,708
"Lettuce"? Where did you get it? Take it out.

357
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:47,078
The grandmother we met during the interview gave it to us to share.

358
00:26:47,078 --> 00:26:48,588
What interview?

359
00:26:48,588 --> 00:26:51,698
A writer backed out so Yeo Reum did the job instead.

360
00:26:51,698 --> 00:26:54,568
Yeo Reum, what work did you do in Seoul to be able to do that job?

361
00:26:54,568 --> 00:26:56,768
She worked in a publishing company.

362
00:26:56,768 --> 00:26:59,928
Then I bet you had many boyfriends.

363
00:26:59,928 --> 00:27:03,348
What does a publishing company have to do with boyfriends?

364
00:27:03,348 --> 00:27:06,858
I've always thought women who read books are attractive.

365
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:10,288
So do you have a boyfriend?

366
00:27:10,288 --> 00:27:11,928
Well...

367
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:16,458
I did have one, but we broke up.

368
00:27:16,458 --> 00:27:19,158
Why? How long were you together?

369
00:27:22,768 --> 00:27:24,658
- It wasn't that short...
- Noona.

370
00:27:24,658 --> 00:27:28,108
The meat is about to burn. Hurry and eat more.

371
00:27:28,108 --> 00:27:30,358
- Thank you.
- It's hot.

372
00:27:31,768 --> 00:27:34,498
Dae Beom, you're not even good at grilling.

373
00:27:34,498 --> 00:27:36,798
You have to put salt on the meat while grilling.

374
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:38,458
Why are you putting salt on it?

375
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:42,698
- It's tastier with salt!
- No, now you ruined it.

376
00:27:42,698 --> 00:27:44,278
- Did I put too much salt on it?
- Yes.

377
00:27:44,278 --> 00:27:47,588
I heard the exam you took is very hard to pass.

378
00:27:47,588 --> 00:27:51,818
I know. She wasn't very smart even as a child, but she was diligent.

379
00:27:51,818 --> 00:27:53,228
Seriously!

380
00:27:53,228 --> 00:27:57,278
Honestly, your grades were worse than mine in middle school.

381
00:27:57,278 --> 00:27:59,778
Really? Were her grades worse than yours?

382
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:03,448
Yes! Her grades were worse than mine. She studied hard since then.

383
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:05,558
So she got into a college.

384
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:09,828
And she barely passed her Grade 7 Civil Servant exam on the fifth attempt.

385
00:28:09,828 --> 00:28:14,678
Your effort is number one in Angok-myeon.

386
00:28:17,198 --> 00:28:18,408
Why don't you say more (sarcasm)?

387
00:28:18,408 --> 00:28:20,828
There's a nickname I gave her.

388
00:28:20,828 --> 00:28:23,128
Jo Ji Young (sounds like "screw up"), the test wrecker.

389
00:28:23,128 --> 00:28:25,298
- Seriously, stop it!
- Okay, okay.

390
00:28:25,298 --> 00:28:27,898
On that note, I'll see myself out.

391
00:28:27,898 --> 00:28:31,218
But being hard-working is also a talent.

392
00:28:31,218 --> 00:28:33,168
It's not a talent.

393
00:28:33,168 --> 00:28:37,048
Someone really gifted doesn't need to work hard for this kind of thing.

394
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,748
What about you, Bom?

395
00:28:38,748 --> 00:28:41,428
You are always drawing in the library.

396
00:28:42,668 --> 00:28:45,768
I was going to have a talk with you; now is a good time.

397
00:28:45,768 --> 00:28:47,798
Now that I'm a grownup,

398
00:28:47,798 --> 00:28:53,358
I realize if you don't do what you're good at, using excuses like environment and stuff,

399
00:28:53,358 --> 00:28:55,298
you'll regret it so much in the future.

400
00:28:55,298 --> 00:28:57,318
You are already in second year of high school.

401
00:28:57,318 --> 00:29:01,118
If you like drawing, consider majoring in art at college.

402
00:29:01,118 --> 00:29:04,068
Don't just waste time by doodling.

403
00:29:04,068 --> 00:29:06,988
Why try to lecture me when you don't know my life?

404
00:29:06,988 --> 00:29:10,028
Aren't we here to eat dinner?

405
00:29:10,028 --> 00:29:13,648
Bom, I'm saying this as I feel bad for you!

406
00:29:13,648 --> 00:29:17,508
Life is all about timing. You don't feel that way yet, do you?

407
00:29:17,508 --> 00:29:21,388
- I made a delicious ssam (wrap) for you.
- Dae Beom is different from us. He doesn't understand.

408
00:29:21,388 --> 00:29:25,048
Regular people like us need to buckle up and try really hard.

409
00:29:25,048 --> 00:29:28,828
Do you know why? You need to grab the chance when it's before you.

410
00:29:28,828 --> 00:29:33,288
When the timing is over, it's all over.

411
00:29:33,288 --> 00:29:35,618
I'm serious.

412
00:29:35,618 --> 00:29:41,818
But I don't think all people have a goal in their lives.

413
00:29:41,818 --> 00:29:44,138
I don't have one.

414
00:29:49,458 --> 00:29:54,658
But that's why you are recharging yourself in this town

415
00:29:54,658 --> 00:29:57,588
and planning the future, isn't it?

416
00:29:57,588 --> 00:30:00,278
No, it's not like that.

417
00:30:00,278 --> 00:30:01,988
I'm just hanging out here.

418
00:30:03,088 --> 00:30:07,008
Shall we have fun "hanging out time," Noona?

419
00:30:07,008 --> 00:30:10,038
Let's eat ssam and meat.

420
00:30:10,038 --> 00:30:11,738
By the way, Dae Beom,

421
00:30:11,738 --> 00:30:15,388
why do you keep cutting me off?

422
00:30:16,508 --> 00:30:18,768
I just want you to eat more.

423
00:30:18,768 --> 00:30:23,108
From what I heard, nothing is wrong with what Manager Jo said.

424
00:30:23,108 --> 00:30:27,548
Bom, you must get yourself together so your family survives.

425
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,508
What a day.

426
00:30:30,508 --> 00:30:32,338
Don't get angry about what I say.

427
00:30:32,338 --> 00:30:35,588
How long do you think your grandmother can take care of you?

428
00:30:35,588 --> 00:30:40,618
I always say, "Your father will never stop drinking. So at least, you..."

429
00:30:40,618 --> 00:30:44,028
Ahjumma, can you please watch your words?

430
00:30:44,028 --> 00:30:46,498
Oh, listen to this girl talk!

431
00:30:46,498 --> 00:30:49,928
You run a business. How can you chase customers away with your words?

432
00:30:49,928 --> 00:30:54,238
Also, you should know I'm putting up with this for Unnie Yeo Reum.

433
00:30:54,898 --> 00:30:58,388
Ahjumma, mind your own business, and you should return ₩450,000 ($340) to Unnie Yeo Reum!

434
00:30:58,388 --> 00:31:01,038
- Seriously, that girl!
- Let me go with you!

435
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:05,038
♪ Congratulations and celebrations! ♪

436
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:08,758
♪ Congratulations on passing the test, Jo Ji Young ♪

437
00:31:08,758 --> 00:31:10,920
Where did everyone go?

438
00:31:11,798 --> 00:31:13,488
Blow out the candles!

439
00:31:15,798 --> 00:31:18,158
My head aches.

440
00:31:18,158 --> 00:31:20,178
What's going on here?

441
00:31:20,958 --> 00:31:23,398
Hey, hurry and blow the candles.

442
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:25,648
I prepared seven candles for you.

443
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:34,538
Why don't we go to karaoke for the second round to clear the air?

444
00:31:34,538 --> 00:31:36,728
I'm sorry, but I'll get going now.

445
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,438
What?

446
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:41,608
Noona, I think I should go home now as well.

447
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,458
Sure. Seong Min can do the second round by himself.

448
00:31:43,458 --> 00:31:45,558
What? What's wrong with you guys?

449
00:31:45,558 --> 00:31:47,948
Yeo Reum, why don't you go with me? I'll drive you home.

450
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:49,538
No, it's okay. I can walk home.

451
00:31:49,538 --> 00:31:52,188
No, you have one too many things in your hands.

452
00:31:52,188 --> 00:31:54,908
- Jo Ji Young, are you really going home?
- Yes!

453
00:31:54,908 --> 00:31:57,268
When will we have fun if not tonight?

454
00:31:57,268 --> 00:31:59,558
It wasn't easy for me to get permission from my father!

455
00:31:59,558 --> 00:32:01,658
Have some fun on your own! Who's stopping you from going out?

456
00:32:01,658 --> 00:32:03,528
Have a lot of fun and go home late, okay?

457
00:32:03,528 --> 00:32:05,238
Hey, but...

458
00:32:05,238 --> 00:32:06,678
Noona, get home safe.

459
00:32:06,678 --> 00:32:09,298
- Get home safe.
- You, too.

460
00:32:11,288 --> 00:32:13,668
Drive safely!

461
00:32:16,458 --> 00:32:18,318
Really?

462
00:32:20,588 --> 00:32:23,008
What should we do now?

463
00:32:29,568 --> 00:32:33,288
As Seong Min said, it's a shame to go straight home on a night like this.

464
00:32:33,288 --> 00:32:35,318
Should we two grab some beer?

465
00:32:35,318 --> 00:32:37,128
Right now?

466
00:32:37,128 --> 00:32:41,610
There's a raw fish place I really like. I don't take just anyone there.

467
00:32:42,548 --> 00:32:44,698
But I'm a bit full.

468
00:32:44,698 --> 00:32:48,128
Just have a taste! Okay?

469
00:32:50,778 --> 00:32:52,928
Dae Beom, I'm wondering.

470
00:32:52,928 --> 00:32:57,108
Will Ji Young leave for Seoul right away since she passed the first test?

471
00:32:57,108 --> 00:33:00,478
She still has to do the interview, and she might fail that.

472
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:04,978
But I heard you get accepted if you do the interview.

473
00:33:04,978 --> 00:33:06,988
Is that so?

474
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:11,808
I guess that girl is moving to Seoul in the end.

475
00:33:11,808 --> 00:33:13,708
- Hyung.
- Yes?

476
00:33:14,548 --> 00:33:16,318
I guess you feel very sad.

477
00:33:16,318 --> 00:33:17,808
Who, me?

478
00:33:17,808 --> 00:33:21,048
Why would I be sad? I feel relieved!

479
00:33:21,048 --> 00:33:25,658
I could even hand out rice cakes to the interviewers to get them to pass her.

480
00:33:25,658 --> 00:33:27,650
It'll be a bigger issue for you than for me

481
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:30,640
since Jo Ji Young is one of the few people you talk to.

482
00:33:30,648 --> 00:33:34,208
These days, people aren't dying from starvation, but from loneliness.

483
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,478
So why don't you date someone?

484
00:33:36,478 --> 00:33:38,898
You look fine, but what's wrong with you?

485
00:33:38,898 --> 00:33:41,508
No, don't just laugh at it.

486
00:33:41,508 --> 00:33:44,718
Hey, should I introduce some women to you?

487
00:33:44,718 --> 00:33:46,318
You?

488
00:33:46,318 --> 00:33:47,608
"You"?

489
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:50,798
Do you look down on me? I know many women!

490
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:53,878
Tell me your type. Is it someone like a puppy? Or a kitten?

491
00:33:53,878 --> 00:33:55,408
I don't have a type.

492
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:58,058
- I bet you have a type of female celebrity you like!
- Goodness.

493
00:33:58,058 --> 00:33:59,968
- IU!
- Excuse me?

494
00:33:59,968 --> 00:34:02,408
Okay! If you want to meet someone like IU, follow me.

495
00:34:02,408 --> 00:34:04,198
Hyung, I really need to go home now.

496
00:34:04,198 --> 00:34:06,668
For IU, follow me!

497
00:34:09,178 --> 00:34:11,828
- Congratulations on passing the exam.
- Thank you.

498
00:34:11,828 --> 00:34:15,448
I heard the Grade 7 Civil Servant test is difficult.

499
00:34:15,448 --> 00:34:18,118
I tried my best for it.

500
00:34:18,118 --> 00:34:21,798
But I couldn't do it if not for Dae Beom.

501
00:34:21,798 --> 00:34:23,588
Do you mean Mr. Librarian?

502
00:34:23,588 --> 00:34:28,688
You can't tell what an incredible person he is just by looking at him.

503
00:34:30,508 --> 00:34:34,908
Dae Beom got into Daehan University at age 17,

504
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:37,898
and he became the youngest researcher.

505
00:34:37,898 --> 00:34:39,468
Isn't that amazing?

506
00:34:39,468 --> 00:34:45,088
He isn't one who should be stuck in this country library.

507
00:34:45,088 --> 00:34:47,798
I can't tell you any more about him.

508
00:34:47,798 --> 00:34:50,068
But he has a lot of stories.

509
00:34:52,188 --> 00:34:58,408
It upsets me when people mistreat him without knowing what a great person he is!

510
00:34:58,408 --> 00:35:01,528
That includes children coming to the library, like Jun and the others.

511
00:35:01,528 --> 00:35:04,648
They are so rude to him.

512
00:35:04,648 --> 00:35:07,198
Someone needs to teach them a lesson.

513
00:35:07,198 --> 00:35:10,618
You worry about Mr. Librarian a lot.

514
00:35:10,618 --> 00:35:15,638
It's because I've known Dae Beom a long time.

515
00:35:18,268 --> 00:35:22,368
But I noticed earlier that Dae Beom seems comfortable around you.

516
00:35:23,178 --> 00:35:25,018
Is he?

517
00:35:27,028 --> 00:35:29,978
I'm happy I passed the Grade 7 test.

518
00:35:30,558 --> 00:35:35,018
But I'm very worried if Dae Beom will be okay here alone without me.

519
00:35:38,388 --> 00:35:40,988
Seriously, it's so annoying.

520
00:35:40,988 --> 00:35:43,188
Look who's here!

521
00:35:44,888 --> 00:35:46,938
It's Kim Bom.

522
00:35:46,938 --> 00:35:50,348
Where do you think you are going, you wicked wench?

523
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:52,788
Don't you need to say hello to your seniors?

524
00:35:52,788 --> 00:35:56,858
You don't come to school, but you wear the school uniform all the time!

525
00:35:56,858 --> 00:35:59,868
Do you get more money if you date your sugar daddy in a school uniform?

526
00:35:59,868 --> 00:36:01,538
Seriously, give me a break.

527
00:36:01,538 --> 00:36:03,688
You think only about what you do.

528
00:36:03,688 --> 00:36:05,648
Oh, I'm so scared!

529
00:36:05,648 --> 00:36:07,420
But what should we do?

530
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:11,060
Dae Ho, the one who can protect you, is in prison now.

531
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:14,750
Hey, you can't do anything alone,

532
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:17,428
but you feel you're somebody in a group, right?

533
00:36:17,428 --> 00:36:19,518
It's so pathetic.

534
00:36:20,358 --> 00:36:23,588
Why? Are you going to make money for your father's drinks?

535
00:36:23,588 --> 00:36:27,338
You all know her father is such a piece of trash, right?

536
00:36:27,338 --> 00:36:29,648
I heard her mom was an escort.

537
00:36:29,648 --> 00:36:32,248
A drunk girl and guy got together and made her.

538
00:36:32,248 --> 00:36:33,668
It's disgusting.

539
00:36:33,668 --> 00:36:35,028
- What an idiot.
- What a slut.

540
00:36:35,028 --> 00:36:37,128
Why is this town so noisy tonight?

541
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:40,018
Hey! Take your hands off!

542
00:36:44,938 --> 00:36:46,908
Yeo Reum, get in the car. I'll take you home.

543
00:36:46,908 --> 00:36:48,238
No, I can walk home.

544
00:36:48,238 --> 00:36:50,598
No! It's dangerous as it's too far away.

545
00:36:50,598 --> 00:36:52,738
Just wait a little bit.

546
00:36:56,198 --> 00:37:00,508
There's something I really want to ask you.

547
00:37:00,508 --> 00:37:04,468
Don't you get anxious if you really don't do anything with your life?

548
00:37:09,058 --> 00:37:10,408
I do get anxious.

549
00:37:10,408 --> 00:37:13,068
Right? You do get anxious.

550
00:37:13,068 --> 00:37:15,798
What will you do if Bom learns from you?

551
00:37:15,798 --> 00:37:19,418
You are an adult, and this might be an awesome life.

552
00:37:19,418 --> 00:37:21,308
But she's still a child.

553
00:37:21,308 --> 00:37:24,968
What I'm saying is a child's life can be ruined.

554
00:37:24,968 --> 00:37:27,228
Don't you get nervous at all?

555
00:37:27,228 --> 00:37:31,098
Why would I get worried? I'm a civil servant.

556
00:37:35,748 --> 00:37:38,168
I actually...

557
00:37:39,748 --> 00:37:43,838
got sick while living by other people's standards.

558
00:37:45,278 --> 00:37:48,028
I thought everyone else was doing great.

559
00:37:48,028 --> 00:37:51,508
I thought I was the only one not doing well, and I suffered.

560
00:37:54,428 --> 00:37:56,748
So now

561
00:37:56,748 --> 00:38:01,828
I'm taking time to get close to myself, not to others.

562
00:38:04,538 --> 00:38:07,968
I can't understand anything right now. My head is pounding.

563
00:38:07,968 --> 00:38:14,098
Also, I haven't known Mr. Librarian a long time,

564
00:38:14,098 --> 00:38:16,598
but he's a very warm person.

565
00:38:16,598 --> 00:38:21,308
I think children also know this, and they like him.

566
00:38:21,308 --> 00:38:23,808
They don't consider him a fool.

567
00:38:25,208 --> 00:38:26,858
So don't worry too much.

568
00:38:26,858 --> 00:38:30,018
Mr. Librarian will do well on his own.

569
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,748
Hello?

570
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:42,418
I'm at Bangrim raw fish place, but I drank. Can you pick me up?

571
00:38:42,418 --> 00:38:43,770
Thank you, and I'm sorry.

572
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:45,660
I'll be waiting for you.

573
00:38:46,368 --> 00:38:47,618
I'll get going first.

574
00:38:47,618 --> 00:38:50,098
No, he'll come soon. Please wait a little bit.

575
00:38:50,098 --> 00:38:53,468
No, I want to walk and sober up.

576
00:38:53,468 --> 00:38:56,078
Get home safely.

577
00:38:56,078 --> 00:38:58,608
Okay, then get home safely.

578
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:03,538
Bye.

579
00:39:15,848 --> 00:39:18,108
Why did I say that?

580
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,398
What do I know?

581
00:39:34,188 --> 00:39:36,378
Is it you, Bom?

582
00:39:37,598 --> 00:39:39,508
What happened to you?

583
00:39:39,508 --> 00:39:42,838
Bom! Bom.

584
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:45,918
What happened to my baby's face?

585
00:39:45,918 --> 00:39:49,028
I just stumbled on my way home. It's nothing.

586
00:39:49,028 --> 00:39:53,888
It's so horrible. How can someone hit this tiny girl?

587
00:39:53,888 --> 00:39:56,828
It's not like that. I really just stumbled on my own.

588
00:39:56,828 --> 00:39:59,648
Let's go inside. I'll put some ointment on you.

589
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:02,628
Grandma, it's nothing.

590
00:40:02,628 --> 00:40:04,718
Hey, you brat!

591
00:40:04,718 --> 00:40:08,138
Why are you going around like that?

592
00:40:08,138 --> 00:40:10,978
How can you go around fighting?

593
00:40:10,978 --> 00:40:13,638
You should just go inside.

594
00:40:13,638 --> 00:40:17,708
That girl is like that because she takes after her mother!

595
00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:20,098
How can you say that to your daughter?

596
00:40:20,098 --> 00:40:21,968
Just go inside.

597
00:40:21,968 --> 00:40:23,888
It's because of you.

598
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:25,298
What?

599
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:27,328
What did you just say?

600
00:40:27,328 --> 00:40:29,398
It's all because of you!

601
00:40:29,398 --> 00:40:33,558
You're the reason why we live like this and why Mom ran away!

602
00:40:33,558 --> 00:40:35,308
What did you just say, you wicked wench?

603
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:38,048
Why did you have me if you're like this? Why? Why?

604
00:40:38,048 --> 00:40:39,858
Just go out and die!

605
00:40:39,858 --> 00:40:42,298
Bom, why are you acting like this?

606
00:40:42,298 --> 00:40:45,008
Sure! Let's die!

607
00:40:45,008 --> 00:40:46,558
Let's all die!

608
00:40:46,558 --> 00:40:50,538
Are you still a father after all this? Just go out and die!

609
00:40:50,538 --> 00:40:51,998
Bom.

610
00:40:51,998 --> 00:40:55,360
Sure! Run from this house like your mom!

611
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,538
Go out and die!

612
00:40:57,538 --> 00:41:02,468
Let's just all die together! Let's just die!

613
00:41:05,708 --> 00:41:09,378
Jo Ji Young, am I your minion for life?

614
00:41:09,378 --> 00:41:12,788
Just consider your driving as a congratulatory gift for me.

615
00:41:12,788 --> 00:41:17,008
Look at her being so selfish.

616
00:41:17,008 --> 00:41:19,138
I'm sleepy.

617
00:41:21,648 --> 00:41:24,258
Also...

618
00:41:24,258 --> 00:41:26,948
Drop me at Dae Beom's place.

619
00:41:26,948 --> 00:41:28,818
What?

620
00:41:28,818 --> 00:41:31,888
Why would you go to Dae Beom's place this late at night?

621
00:41:31,888 --> 00:41:34,598
I have something to tell him.

622
00:41:34,598 --> 00:41:36,048
Talk to him during the day.

623
00:41:36,048 --> 00:41:39,228
Does it make sense to go to a man's house alone in the middle of the night?

624
00:41:39,228 --> 00:41:41,728
You might get a weird reputation in town.

625
00:41:41,728 --> 00:41:43,498
I'm doing this to spread the rumor.

626
00:41:43,498 --> 00:41:45,108
What?

627
00:41:45,108 --> 00:41:48,738
Look at her. Did you do this before as well?

628
00:41:48,738 --> 00:41:52,328
Yes. I'll rest a minute. Wake me when we arrive.

629
00:41:52,328 --> 00:41:55,718
- Did you say "yes?"
- Good night.

630
00:41:55,718 --> 00:41:57,678
This is driving me crazy!

631
00:41:57,678 --> 00:42:00,888
I mean... seriously!

632
00:42:11,338 --> 00:42:13,298
Hey, we're here.

633
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:16,358
Thank you.

634
00:42:17,798 --> 00:42:19,688
Get home safely.

635
00:42:21,008 --> 00:42:23,738
Wait, Jo Ji Young.

636
00:42:23,738 --> 00:42:27,348
I also have to talk to Dae Beom. Why don't we go together?

637
00:42:27,348 --> 00:42:30,328
What do you need to say to him? Do it later.

638
00:42:30,328 --> 00:42:34,608
Wait, Jo Ji Young! Why don't you take the cake with you? The cake.

639
00:42:34,608 --> 00:42:36,358
Why not have that with Jun?

640
00:42:36,358 --> 00:42:38,240
No, I can't eat cake right now.

641
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,878
My stomach doesn't feel good. You take it.

642
00:42:40,878 --> 00:42:43,048
Actually, save me two pieces. That'll be perfect.

643
00:42:43,048 --> 00:42:44,998
- I'm going inside.
- Hey...

644
00:42:44,998 --> 00:42:48,058
Will you really stay at Dae Beom's place? Really?

645
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:51,928
Seriously...

646
00:42:51,928 --> 00:42:54,818
You are such a bad...

647
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:01,158
Noona.

648
00:43:03,168 --> 00:43:04,788
Hi.

649
00:43:04,788 --> 00:43:07,640
What brings you here at this hour?

650
00:43:09,728 --> 00:43:15,488
You have been acting really strange lately.

651
00:43:15,488 --> 00:43:18,908
Did you drink a lot?

652
00:43:18,908 --> 00:43:20,718
Yes, I did drink a lot.

653
00:43:20,718 --> 00:43:23,148
- Oh, no...
- Have a seat.

654
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:28,048
Why did you drink so late?

655
00:43:28,808 --> 00:43:31,148
I was talking with Yeo Reum.

656
00:43:31,148 --> 00:43:33,218
She's really funny.

657
00:43:33,218 --> 00:43:38,668
Was Yeo Reum also drinking with you?

658
00:43:42,488 --> 00:43:47,728
You know today is a really happy day for me.

659
00:43:47,728 --> 00:43:50,328
So please do me a favor.

660
00:43:51,098 --> 00:43:52,748
What is it?

661
00:43:52,748 --> 00:43:56,248
No, you must promise you'll do it first.

662
00:43:56,248 --> 00:44:00,028
No, tell me first.

663
00:44:00,788 --> 00:44:05,998
Do you want to hear it from me first and meet after knowing it,

664
00:44:05,998 --> 00:44:09,648
or do you want to meet without knowing it?

665
00:44:09,648 --> 00:44:13,008
You are talking about my professor, right?

666
00:44:13,778 --> 00:44:16,248
You're as smart as I thought.

667
00:44:16,248 --> 00:44:19,358
He's coming tomorrow to see you.

668
00:44:20,078 --> 00:44:22,968
Isn't he incredible?

669
00:44:22,968 --> 00:44:26,058
He's coming all the way here to see a bad boy like you.

670
00:44:26,058 --> 00:44:29,478
You shouldn't think about running away.

671
00:44:29,478 --> 00:44:34,008
I'll be watching you with my own eyes right here.

672
00:44:34,008 --> 00:44:35,848
Okay?

673
00:44:38,358 --> 00:44:40,938
And let's go to Seoul together.

674
00:44:43,968 --> 00:44:46,078
Let's move together.

675
00:44:53,318 --> 00:44:55,548
Bom?

676
00:44:55,548 --> 00:44:57,278
Unnie.

677
00:44:58,048 --> 00:45:00,038
Are you okay?

678
00:45:00,038 --> 00:45:02,508
I had nowhere else to go.

679
00:45:07,478 --> 00:45:09,518
I'm glad you came here.

680
00:45:09,518 --> 00:45:12,668
That must be painful!

681
00:45:25,258 --> 00:45:26,628
Does it hurt?

682
00:45:26,628 --> 00:45:28,858
It's okay.

683
00:45:28,858 --> 00:45:30,728
You must be tired.

684
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,218
Why don't you get some sleep?

685
00:45:32,218 --> 00:45:33,858
Well...

686
00:45:34,668 --> 00:45:36,438
Unnie.

687
00:45:36,438 --> 00:45:41,098
Aren't you going to ask me why this happened?

688
00:45:42,718 --> 00:45:44,818
Do you want to tell me?

689
00:45:47,618 --> 00:45:49,328
Not really.

690
00:45:51,338 --> 00:45:55,328
You can tell me when you want to.

691
00:45:56,358 --> 00:45:58,308
But, Bom,

692
00:45:59,908 --> 00:46:02,988
I don't know what's going on with you,

693
00:46:04,518 --> 00:46:06,698
but please don't get hurt.

694
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:14,370
♫ In this quiet universe ♫

695
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:16,288
I'll turn off the lights.

696
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:24,470
♫ It's a strange day ♫

697
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:32,620
♫ I'll take back the words I couldn't say ♫

698
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:37,458
♫ As my heart ♫

699
00:46:37,458 --> 00:46:39,978
Good night.

700
00:46:39,978 --> 00:46:42,288
Good night, Unnie.

701
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:50,030
♫ Please stay and wait for me ♫

702
00:46:50,030 --> 00:47:01,010
♫ For my words, this long confession ♫

703
00:47:12,138 --> 00:47:15,158
[Summer Strike]

704
00:47:15,158 --> 00:47:18,568
Think of this place as your second home and come by whenever you want.

705
00:47:18,568 --> 00:47:21,298
Unnie, thanks to you, I like the present a little bit.

706
00:47:21,298 --> 00:47:23,388
She's having surgery right now.

707
00:47:23,388 --> 00:47:25,968
How was she injured?

708
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:27,698
Or our dad might go to prison.

709
00:47:27,698 --> 00:47:30,528
Let's say I did it. I can get arrested instead.

710
00:47:30,528 --> 00:47:32,728
- Grandma...
- The hospital bill is ten million won.

711
00:47:32,728 --> 00:47:35,808
Would it be possible for me to get the yearly rent back?

712
00:47:35,808 --> 00:47:37,858
Is it because of Bom's hospital bill?

713
00:47:37,858 --> 00:47:41,328
Can you take care of Gyeo Wool from now on?

714
00:47:41,328 --> 00:47:43,678
It was nice here.
