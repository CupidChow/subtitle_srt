I know you actually think I look good.

164
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,804
Oh, it's a bit too much to handle.

165
00:09:36,804 --> 00:09:38,644
What are we eating? I'm hungry.

166
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:44,274
I already asked Angok Garden to prepare a big carp for you.

167
00:09:44,274 --> 00:09:47,574
It's too hot for carp. Let's just eat something nearby.

168
00:09:47,574 --> 00:09:54,654
But I'm getting a meal to cheer you up so we should get braised carp, at least!

169
00:09:54,654 --> 00:09:56,744
Did you put on cologne?

170
00:09:58,444 --> 00:10:00,534
Why? Does it smell nice?

171
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:03,264
- Let me bring my car keys.
- Wait!

172
00:10:03,264 --> 00:10:07,294
I'll drive you today on my motorcycle.

173
00:10:07,294 --> 00:10:09,664
"Motorcycle"? We aren't in high school anymore!

174
00:10:09,664 --> 00:10:13,684
I'm saying to reminisce our high school memories.

175
00:10:13,684 --> 00:10:15,944
Go ahead and put this on.

176
00:10:15,944 --> 00:10:17,684
Seriously...

177
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:20,574
I'm too embarrassed to get on the bike with you now.

178
00:10:20,574 --> 00:10:22,504
Just hop on.

179
00:10:22,504 --> 00:10:23,954
Must we really do this?

180
00:10:23,954 --> 00:10:27,884
You hold on tight. Otherwise, you might fall.

181
00:10:27,884 --> 00:10:29,434
Did you meet a future marriage partner?

182
00:10:29,434 --> 00:10:32,704
What? No. I'm just in a good mood on a good day.

183
00:10:32,704 --> 00:10:34,614
I'm still putting on my helmet!

184
00:10:34,614 --> 00:10:36,534
Hold on tight.

185
00:10:36,534 --> 00:10:38,434
I said, "Hold on tight!"

186
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:48,104
Jo Ji Young, did you dress nicely today to see me?

187
00:10:48,104 --> 00:10:49,974
It's what I usually wear.

188
00:10:49,974 --> 00:10:53,204
- Oh, yes! What a nice view!
- Don't yell!

189
00:10:53,204 --> 00:10:56,664
What's wrong with you? Let's go calmly.

190
00:10:56,664 --> 00:10:59,614
Isn't it nice natural air-conditioning?

191
00:11:01,024 --> 00:11:03,354
Sure, it's nice.

192
00:11:05,544 --> 00:11:08,494
You only have me, right?

193
00:11:09,984 --> 00:11:11,054
No, thanks!

194
00:11:11,054 --> 00:11:14,394
- "No, thanks!"
- Oh, stop it.

195
00:11:14,394 --> 00:11:16,964
Let's go have delicious food!

196
00:11:26,264 --> 00:11:28,024
I don't understand.

197
00:11:28,024 --> 00:11:30,464
What was the peach farm owner's intention?

198
00:11:32,564 --> 00:11:34,424
Unnie.

199
00:11:34,424 --> 00:11:36,764
Don't you want to experience it once in your lifetime?

200
00:11:36,764 --> 00:11:39,674
No, never ever.

201
00:11:41,074 --> 00:11:43,834
Oppa Dae Beom, what about you?

202
00:11:43,834 --> 00:11:45,864
I'm good without experience as well.

203
00:11:45,864 --> 00:11:48,584
Seriously, what is this?

204
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:51,114
I was so happy when he said he'd give us a Korean chicken.

205
00:11:51,114 --> 00:11:52,914
Me, too.

206
00:11:52,914 --> 00:11:55,304
Who knew he'd give a live chicken?

207
00:11:57,194 --> 00:12:00,144
I'm starving. Let's just kill it.

208
00:12:00,144 --> 00:12:01,944
Who will do that?

209
00:12:01,944 --> 00:12:04,124
- If you don't play, you lose! Rock, paper, scissors!
- All of a sudden?

210
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:06,654
If you don't play, you lose! Rock, paper, scissors!

211
00:12:08,314 --> 00:12:10,914
If you don't play, you lose! Rock, paper, scissors!

212
00:12:14,194 --> 00:12:16,144
Go get him.

213
00:12:16,144 --> 00:12:18,684
I can't!

214
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:24,494
It looks amazing.

215
00:12:31,404 --> 00:12:33,254
It's so good.

216
00:12:35,044 --> 00:12:37,624
I was going to put eggs in it,

217
00:12:38,794 --> 00:12:40,214
but he kept looking at me.

218
00:12:40,214 --> 00:12:42,062
You did the right thing.

219
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:45,824
I think it's more delicious cooked in that iron pot.

220
00:12:45,824 --> 00:12:50,884
Right? I told you when we first met that I make great ramyeon.

221
00:12:50,884 --> 00:12:52,644
How is it, Hyung?

222
00:12:55,224 --> 00:12:57,304
It's so good.

223
00:13:00,134 --> 00:13:02,064
Wow, I'm so full now.

224
00:13:02,064 --> 00:13:03,974
That was a great meal.

225
00:13:03,974 --> 00:13:09,094
It was delicious ramyeon, but why did we work on the peach farm today?

226
00:13:09,094 --> 00:13:13,004
Whose fault is it we had to work at the orchard?

227
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,003
Hello?

228
00:13:22,003 --> 00:13:23,964
What? Right now?

229
00:13:23,964 --> 00:13:27,314
The other person told me they'd bring it tomorrow morning.

230
00:13:27,314 --> 00:13:28,974
Okay, I got it.

231
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,674
What is it? Who called?

232
00:13:30,674 --> 00:13:34,154
It was the bus company. They said they'll bring my suitcase to the bus stop right now.

233
00:13:34,154 --> 00:13:35,714
"Right now"?

234
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:38,584
Why now? We just finished eating our dinner.

235
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:40,414
- I know.
- It's okay.

236
00:13:40,414 --> 00:13:43,974
We can eat tomorrow's breakfast like dinner.

237
00:13:43,974 --> 00:13:46,334
Do you want me to come with you?

238
00:13:46,334 --> 00:13:48,104
No, it's okay.

239
00:13:48,104 --> 00:13:50,094
Bom, let's go together.

240
00:13:50,094 --> 00:13:52,314
Really?

241
00:13:52,314 --> 00:13:54,304
Thank you for cleaning up!

242
00:13:54,304 --> 00:13:56,074
We'll be back.

243
00:13:56,074 --> 00:13:58,334
Get back safely!

244
00:14:05,874 --> 00:14:07,814
Bom.

245
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:09,014
Yes?

246
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,754
It's nice.

247
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:13,914
What's nice?

248
00:14:13,914 --> 00:14:18,354
Nothing special, it's just us in this darkness.

249
00:14:18,354 --> 00:14:21,184
Seriously, stop it.

250
00:14:21,184 --> 00:14:24,894
When is the bus coming? Is it ever coming?

251
00:14:25,714 --> 00:14:29,774
After I met you, I became tremendously happier.

252
00:14:29,774 --> 00:14:32,147
Hey, be honest with me.

253
00:14:32,147 --> 00:14:35,164
Were you expelled from school in America for chatting?

254
00:14:35,164 --> 00:14:37,364
It's the opposite.

255
00:14:37,364 --> 00:14:43,294
When I first went to America, children teased my English so I didn't speak.

256
00:14:44,214 --> 00:14:46,584
When did you move to America?

257
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:48,814
I was in sixth grade.

258
00:14:48,814 --> 00:14:51,984
Then did you return to Korea because you couldn't speak English?

259
00:14:51,984 --> 00:14:57,120
No, my English got better over time.

260
00:14:57,614 --> 00:15:02,144
But children made fun of my pronunciation so much.

261
00:15:02,874 --> 00:15:06,174
I couldn't hold it in anymore and punched one of them.

262
00:15:06,174 --> 00:15:09,014
What? You punched someone?

263
00:15:12,034 --> 00:15:16,854
That's when my parents knew how serious it was and sent me here.

264
00:15:16,854 --> 00:15:19,764
Your parents must have been brokenhearted.

265
00:15:20,614 --> 00:15:22,594
I don't think so.

266
00:15:22,594 --> 00:15:26,114
I bet they are happy without me,

267
00:15:26,114 --> 00:15:28,014
since they're ashamed of me.

268
00:15:29,024 --> 00:15:33,664
Both my parents are very smart, but I'm like a freak.

269
00:15:36,694 --> 00:15:40,344
My parents are both famous psychology professors,

270
00:15:42,004 --> 00:15:44,554
but don't know how their son feels.

271
00:15:51,074 --> 00:15:53,814
The bus is here! Let's go.

272
00:16:00,494 --> 00:16:03,414
Hello, Sir. I'm here for my suitcase.

273
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:08,064
The food is here. The fish is very big!

274
00:16:08,064 --> 00:16:10,144
You do it like this.

275
00:16:11,983 --> 00:16:14,504
Let me do it for you.

276
00:16:14,504 --> 00:16:16,854
- Isn't that an organ?
- No, it's the meat.

277
00:16:16,854 --> 00:16:18,934
Have that with the rice.

278
00:16:23,954 --> 00:16:26,184
It's good.

279
00:16:26,184 --> 00:16:29,014
You can't even eat this if you go to Seoul.

280
00:16:29,014 --> 00:16:31,304
Eat as much as you want.

281
00:16:31,304 --> 00:16:33,154
Thank you.

282
00:16:36,504 --> 00:16:40,394
And I know you like rice wine.

283
00:16:40,394 --> 00:16:41,954
You shouldn't drink it.

284
00:16:41,954 --> 00:16:44,714
Of course! Have you ever seen me drinking?

285
00:16:50,774 --> 00:16:54,664
Well, Ji Young.

286
00:16:54,664 --> 00:16:59,114
The reason I asked you out for dinner today is...

287
00:17:02,864 --> 00:17:04,334
What's going on?

288
00:17:04,334 --> 00:17:08,334
You know it's hard for a man and woman to stay friends,

289
00:17:08,334 --> 00:17:11,214
but we are friends such a long time, right?

290
00:17:13,734 --> 00:17:17,334
But... you know...

291
00:17:18,414 --> 00:17:20,044
Ji Young.

292
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:25,324
- I...
- Seong Min.

293
00:17:25,324 --> 00:17:28,114
Can I ask you a favor as your friend?

294
00:17:28,824 --> 00:17:30,544
Of course!

295
00:17:30,544 --> 00:17:34,584
Ask me any favor. I'll do everything for you.

296
00:17:34,584 --> 00:17:39,474
Please kick that woman out of your building.

297
00:17:39,474 --> 00:17:41,754
Who? Do you mean Yeo Reum?

298
00:17:42,964 --> 00:17:45,444
Why all of a sudden?

299
00:17:45,444 --> 00:17:48,324
Isn't Yeo Reum a nice person?

300
00:17:48,324 --> 00:17:50,254
In what aspect?

301
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:55,334
She quit her job and doesn't work, are you also charmed by that?

302
00:17:55,334 --> 00:17:57,694
No, I-I'm not charmed...

303
00:17:57,694 --> 00:18:00,444
That's irresponsible.

304
00:18:00,444 --> 00:18:02,744
Also, it's very incompetent.

305
00:18:02,744 --> 00:18:04,934
Do you think I don't want to live like that?

306
00:18:04,934 --> 00:18:10,254
People endure and do their best, even if it's hard. Am I wrong?

307
00:18:10,254 --> 00:18:12,884
You're not wrong. You're right.

308
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:15,024
I wouldn't protest if she lived like that herself.

309
00:18:15,024 --> 00:18:18,174
But why is she affecting people around her?

310
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:24,714
Did Yeo Reum say something to you?

311
00:18:28,314 --> 00:18:30,304
Dae Beom...

312
00:18:31,134 --> 00:18:34,394
He gets weirder due to her.

313
00:18:42,744 --> 00:18:45,444
Ji Young, did you, by any chance...

314
00:18:46,674 --> 00:18:49,194
Did you cry over him?

315
00:18:50,314 --> 00:18:53,024
Dae Beom changed so much.

316
00:18:59,224 --> 00:19:01,344
Seong Min, what do I do?

317
00:19:03,204 --> 00:19:05,994
I think I have feelings for Dae Beom.

318
00:19:30,134 --> 00:19:32,984
- Bom.
- Yes?

319
00:19:34,594 --> 00:19:38,044
Do you know when I first had feelings for you?

320
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:41,994
Seriously, what's up with you?

321
00:19:43,744 --> 00:19:46,604
When I first got into the same class with you...

322
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:53,730
In the region near the Middle East called the Fertile Crescent,

323
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,450
they always knew it was domesticated

324
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:01,010
and running about 8,500 B.C.E.

325
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:06,434
Children were making fun of me again, saying I was being pretentious.

326
00:20:06,434 --> 00:20:09,074
I thought, "It's the same, even in Korea."

327
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,004
Guys, be quiet.

328
00:20:11,004 --> 00:20:14,484
I thought no place was here for me either.

329
00:20:15,864 --> 00:20:18,514
In the end, I hated myself.

330
00:20:19,053 --> 00:20:22,414
Who would like me when my parents don't?

331
00:20:22,414 --> 00:20:26,084
I also thought it wasn't racism in America, but I was the problem.

332
00:20:26,084 --> 00:20:27,959
Everyone, be quiet!

333
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:29,720
It was all my fault.

334
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:34,670
It spread west to Greece and Germany where probably...

335
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,730
So during breaks, I only listened to music.

336
00:20:41,034 --> 00:20:43,750
I pretended not to care about the situation.

337
00:21:07,214 --> 00:21:10,064
You listen to this kind of music?

338
00:21:11,734 --> 00:21:13,544
It's quite good.

339
00:21:14,704 --> 00:21:20,104
But you were the first who talked to me.

340
00:21:20,104 --> 00:21:22,734
You likely don't remember.

341
00:21:55,034 --> 00:21:58,054
When I'm with you,

342
00:21:58,054 --> 00:22:01,334
I feel very comfortable since we don't talk too much.

343
00:22:04,054 --> 00:22:06,774
I feel the opposite.

344
00:22:07,684 --> 00:22:10,274
For me, when I'm with you,

345
00:22:10,274 --> 00:22:12,764
I speak more than usual.

346
00:22:16,154 --> 00:22:19,534
Since I was young,

347
00:22:19,534 --> 00:22:25,934
talking with others has been such a burden to me.

348
00:22:32,834 --> 00:22:34,924
Dae Beom.

349
00:22:37,394 --> 00:22:40,614
After that day,

350
00:22:41,464 --> 00:22:44,654
I thought about it a lot.

351
00:22:46,554 --> 00:22:49,994
If I didn't quit my job,

352
00:22:50,814 --> 00:22:53,394
if I didn't come see the ocean,

353
00:22:55,414 --> 00:22:58,184
if I hadn't gone to the library,

354
00:23:03,144 --> 00:23:05,984
if I didn't live in that billiard room...

355
00:23:08,004 --> 00:23:11,454
If I hadn't done one of those things,

356
00:23:11,454 --> 00:23:14,944
you wouldn't have to go through that, Dae Beom.

357
00:23:17,794 --> 00:23:20,684
If I hadn't done one of them...

358
00:23:31,304 --> 00:23:36,650
When you first came to Angok,

359
00:23:37,234 --> 00:23:40,084
and the next day

360
00:23:40,084 --> 00:23:44,044
when you applied for the membership card because you decided to live here,

361
00:23:44,964 --> 00:23:49,550
and the time we stayed overnight at the library together,

362
00:23:50,084 --> 00:23:57,330
and the night I walked you to your place as you were drunk...

363
00:23:58,014 --> 00:23:58,974
That's...

364
00:23:58,974 --> 00:24:03,230
The day we ate ice cream together at the library,

365
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:06,590
and when we interviewed the grandmother together,

366
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,190
and also...

367
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:12,970
when we jogged together in the morning...

368
00:24:13,434 --> 00:24:16,414
I liked all those times.

369
00:24:18,934 --> 00:24:20,934
For me,

370
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:25,144
because you came to Angok,

371
00:24:26,284 --> 00:24:28,804
I became sincerely happy.

372
00:24:53,104 --> 00:24:55,194
It's raining.

373
00:24:59,224 --> 00:25:01,704
Hey, it's raining.

374
00:25:01,704 --> 00:25:03,704
Let's just walk.

375
00:25:03,704 --> 00:25:05,694
Do you want to get rained on?

376
00:25:05,694 --> 00:25:07,234
Yes.

377
00:25:07,984 --> 00:25:12,324
Okay. It's cool and nice.

378
00:25:22,274 --> 00:25:24,124
I remember it, too.

379
00:25:24,124 --> 00:25:25,614
What?

380
00:25:27,464 --> 00:25:29,844
I remember that time.

381
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:35,084
How can I forget that day?

382
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:45,200
♫ You... you're going to face tonight ♫

383
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:56,240
♫ You will always remain in my dreams ♫

384
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:02,250
♫ Will everyone still fall away? ♫

385
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:11,330
♫ I fall in love. Should I try hard not to? ♫

386
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:15,550
♫ Everyone knows I'm in love ♫

387
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,614
Thanks, we enjoyed the food!

388
00:26:17,614 --> 00:26:19,724
I called a cab.

389
00:26:23,204 --> 00:26:25,924
You can't ride your motorcycle in this weather. Let's take the cab together.

390
00:26:25,924 --> 00:26:28,574
Do you think it's my first day riding the motorcycle?

391
00:26:28,574 --> 00:26:31,134
It's different when it's pouring!

392
00:26:31,134 --> 00:26:32,524
Don't brag; ride with me.

393
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:34,264
It's here.

394
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:38,284
Come! Run!

395
00:26:38,284 --> 00:26:40,394
Get in first.

396
00:26:40,394 --> 00:26:42,354
- Ji Young, get home safely!
- Hey!

397
00:26:42,354 --> 00:26:45,024
- Sir, please go ahead.
- Hey, get in the cab!

398
00:27:07,484 --> 00:27:13,044
I have liked getting rained on since I was young.

399
00:27:13,044 --> 00:27:16,564
So I purposely didn't use an umbrella.

400
00:27:34,034 --> 00:27:37,214
I heard about Bom's hospital bill.

401
00:27:41,424 --> 00:27:44,524
I also heard about Seoul.

402
00:27:52,514 --> 00:27:56,854
It's too good an opportunity to miss.

403
00:28:08,374 --> 00:28:10,284
Yeo Reum.

404
00:28:13,034 --> 00:28:16,704
Do you want me to go to Seoul?

405
00:28:22,094 --> 00:28:23,644
Yes.

406
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:36,610
♫ Hear this ordinary, friendly song ♫

407
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,430
♫ Every day, it's you ♫

408
00:28:54,734 --> 00:29:00,834
I didn't use an umbrella in the rain when I was young, either.

409
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:15,140
♫ It's my perfect pace ♫

410
00:29:43,744 --> 00:29:47,354
Fresh shrimp is here! It's on sale today only!

411
00:29:47,354 --> 00:29:50,154
Hello, Sir. Don't you want some shrimp today?

412
00:29:50,154 --> 00:29:52,784
The shrimp is really good today.

413
00:29:52,784 --> 00:29:55,174
Today's the season. Thank you so much!

414
00:29:55,174 --> 00:29:57,914
Jae Hoon is so good at that!

415
00:29:57,914 --> 00:30:00,232
Do you have to do this every day?

416
00:30:00,232 --> 00:30:03,954
No, I have Mondays off.

417
00:30:03,954 --> 00:30:06,874
It'll be hot in summer now.

418
00:30:06,874 --> 00:30:09,244
Is this better than serving food inside?

419
00:30:09,244 --> 00:30:12,534
Yes. This pays better.

420
00:30:12,534 --> 00:30:16,294
Wow, you are so cool.

421
00:30:16,294 --> 00:30:18,054
Oh, that's right.

422
00:30:19,814 --> 00:30:23,644
It was on sale on Internet, and I thought of you.

423
00:30:24,694 --> 00:30:27,014
I won't draw anymore.

424
00:30:27,014 --> 00:30:29,330
I don't know. Just take it.

425
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:32,344
Fresh shrimp is here! It's on sale today only!

426
00:30:32,344 --> 00:30:35,424
But Jae Hoon is so good at that!

427
00:30:35,424 --> 00:30:38,354
You might lose your job to him.

428
00:30:40,074 --> 00:30:43,394
Heo Jae Hoon! Don't work too hard.

429
00:30:43,394 --> 00:30:45,174
Let me do it now.

430
00:30:46,114 --> 00:30:47,394
- Give it back to me!
- No!

431
00:30:47,394 --> 00:30:50,084
I said, "Give it back to me!"

432
00:30:50,084 --> 00:30:53,044
Seriously. Give it back.

433
00:30:53,044 --> 00:30:54,684
Hey, be careful!

434
00:30:54,684 --> 00:30:56,764
- Hello?
- Hello.

435
00:30:57,624 --> 00:31:00,634
"I'm eating well here,"

436
00:31:00,634 --> 00:31:05,004
"working out every day and have gotten much better."

437
00:31:05,834 --> 00:31:09,264
"Now that I think back on it soberly,"

438
00:31:10,184 --> 00:31:13,144
"I'm so sorry to you, Mom."

439
00:31:13,144 --> 00:31:15,274
"I'm sorry to my children."

440
00:31:16,044 --> 00:31:19,314
"My mom, who worked hard all her life,"

441
00:31:19,314 --> 00:31:21,854
"my poor mom."

442
00:31:22,994 --> 00:31:27,004
"When I come back home, I'll do my best for you."

443
00:31:27,754 --> 00:31:32,084
"Please say hello to Bom and Ha Neul for me as well."

444
00:31:42,874 --> 00:31:44,794
My son.

445
00:31:45,634 --> 00:31:48,774
Please be healthy. That's all I worry about.

446
00:31:50,344 --> 00:31:54,074
I'm sorry to call you and ask you to read this for me.

447
00:31:54,074 --> 00:31:56,064
Not at all.

448
00:31:57,154 --> 00:32:00,494
Please don't tell Bom about this.

449
00:32:00,494 --> 00:32:05,080
But I think she'll like seeing this letter.

450
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:07,374
Well...

451
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:11,674
Can I ask you for one more favor?

452
00:32:11,674 --> 00:32:13,534
What is it?

453
00:32:15,374 --> 00:32:18,884
It's a bit embarrassing to say it.

454
00:32:18,884 --> 00:32:21,994
Don't be embarrassed, Grandma?

455
00:32:23,904 --> 00:32:25,824
Yeo Reum.

456
00:32:26,994 --> 00:32:30,144
Is it hard to learn Hangul?

457
00:32:31,874 --> 00:32:34,124
It's because...

458
00:32:35,104 --> 00:32:39,634
I want to write a reply that we are well.

459
00:32:48,434 --> 00:32:50,534
Thank you.

460
00:32:50,534 --> 00:32:52,874
Now it feels a bit better.

461
00:32:52,874 --> 00:32:57,144
I think you might get heatstroke in that shrimp costume. Must you do that work?

462
00:32:57,144 --> 00:32:59,504
You don't make much more money.

463
00:33:01,204 --> 00:33:04,164
What? What did you just say?

464
00:33:04,164 --> 00:33:06,144
I'm just worried you may get sick.

465
00:33:06,144 --> 00:33:10,484
Hey, Heo Jae Hoon. That difference might be nothing to you.

466
00:33:10,484 --> 00:33:13,714
For me, that extra money is important.

467
00:33:13,714 --> 00:33:16,604
Bom, I'm really sorry. I made a mistake.

468
00:33:21,604 --> 00:33:23,934
Were you scared?

469
00:33:23,934 --> 00:33:25,554
What?

470
00:33:25,554 --> 00:33:27,834
Were you just scared, you idiot?

471
00:33:29,024 --> 00:33:32,604
What? You freaked me out.

472
00:33:34,134 --> 00:33:38,344
It feels my world is collapsing when you get angry.

473
00:33:39,074 --> 00:33:41,654
It's not collapsing.

474
00:33:41,654 --> 00:33:44,604
I wish we could go on a trip again.

475
00:33:44,604 --> 00:33:46,464
Me, too.

476
00:33:46,464 --> 00:33:48,724
It was fun.

477
00:33:48,724 --> 00:33:50,374
Hey.

478
00:33:50,374 --> 00:33:52,844
What's that devious smile?

479
00:33:54,524 --> 00:33:55,684
You know what it means.

480
00:33:55,684 --> 00:33:59,154
What are you doing? You must be crazy!

481
00:33:59,154 --> 00:34:02,354
Bom, you can't take it back now.

482
00:34:02,354 --> 00:34:05,404
What do you mean I "can't take it back"?

483
00:34:05,404 --> 00:34:07,094
Bom, let's go together!

484
00:34:07,094 --> 00:34:09,104
Don't follow me.

485
00:34:09,104 --> 00:34:11,934
Go where it's all gathered.

486
00:34:11,934 --> 00:34:17,834
We do the labeling. You add the information and paste it here.

487
00:34:17,834 --> 00:34:20,904
We need the title and the number.

488
00:34:20,904 --> 00:34:24,924
Do that work first and put the data in.

489
00:34:24,924 --> 00:34:25,964
Okay.

490
00:34:25,964 --> 00:34:30,214
Put the title and other info. It's all there so just manual labor.

491
00:34:33,064 --> 00:34:34,924
Yeo Reum.

492
00:34:34,924 --> 00:34:37,794
- How are you?
- I'm good.

493
00:34:38,394 --> 00:34:42,220
I wonder what happened to you this morning...

494
00:34:43,194 --> 00:34:45,574
since you didn't come jogging.

495
00:34:46,794 --> 00:34:49,204
Well, it's because...

496
00:34:50,584 --> 00:34:52,504
The sneakers.

497
00:34:53,144 --> 00:34:56,464
My sneakers got ripped.

498
00:34:58,714 --> 00:35:01,874
So I think I can't run for the time being.

499
00:35:06,754 --> 00:35:08,984
Oh, also,

500
00:35:10,854 --> 00:35:13,634
I'm going to Seoul tomorrow.

501
00:35:18,624 --> 00:35:22,064
That's good.

502
00:35:22,064 --> 00:35:23,364
Yes.

503
00:35:23,364 --> 00:35:25,624
You'll do great.

504
00:35:27,624 --> 00:35:31,724
Hey, Part-timer! Tell me where the library storage is.

505
00:35:31,724 --> 00:35:34,034
Yeo Reum, excuse me a second.

506
00:35:34,034 --> 00:35:36,154
We have to go out first.

507
00:35:36,154 --> 00:35:39,674
- Do I have to go outside?
- I'll show you where.

508
00:35:39,674 --> 00:35:42,434
Oh, well. I'll be back.

509
00:36:00,874 --> 00:36:02,734
Yeo Reum.

510
00:36:04,414 --> 00:36:06,194
Thank you.

511
00:36:09,324 --> 00:36:10,954
You're welcome.

512
00:36:44,134 --> 00:36:47,224
It's refreshing, isn't it?

513
00:36:47,224 --> 00:36:51,824
Gyeo Wool, now you took a bath, you look like a Seoul city puppy!

514
00:36:51,824 --> 00:36:55,384
You are so cute right now!

515
00:36:55,384 --> 00:36:58,124
Here you go.

516
00:37:00,304 --> 00:37:02,644
Is there anything else to do?

517
00:37:02,644 --> 00:37:05,574
Should I clean the bathroom?

518
00:37:40,944 --> 00:37:43,254
Does it hurt?

519
00:37:43,254 --> 00:37:45,894
I'm asking you, does it hurt?

520
00:37:47,604 --> 00:37:48,994
The person you are calling is unavailable now...

521
00:37:48,994 --> 00:37:51,594
He never picks up the phone at times like this.

522
00:37:52,234 --> 00:37:54,174
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

523
00:37:54,174 --> 00:37:57,924
I don't know the exact size, but it's for an 8-year-old boy.

524
00:37:57,924 --> 00:38:00,454
He's a bit chubby.

525
00:38:00,454 --> 00:38:05,494
If you're looking for clothes for an 8-year-old, sizes 120 to 130 will fit well.

526
00:38:05,494 --> 00:38:10,514
But considering he'll keep growing, size 140 might be best.

527
00:38:15,274 --> 00:38:17,714
Do you have this in that size right now?

528
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:20,684
Wait one second, please. I'll check in the back.

529
00:38:26,874 --> 00:38:32,674
There's always someone who loves you and hates you.

530
00:38:36,124 --> 00:38:40,774
That's something out of my control.

531
00:38:45,034 --> 00:38:50,614
But the hostile are hating you, and that's it.

532
00:38:51,364 --> 00:38:57,964
The one you love will make you sad because of your love.

533
00:39:01,574 --> 00:39:03,314
Stand up.

534
00:39:05,474 --> 00:39:11,004
All people who gave me deep sorrow

535
00:39:11,004 --> 00:39:15,714
were the people I loved the most.

536
00:39:20,994 --> 00:39:23,834
The degree of my sorrow

537
00:39:23,834 --> 00:39:27,794
was exactly equal to the size of my affection.

538
00:39:28,484 --> 00:39:34,694
So it makes me scared to love someone now.

539
00:39:40,004 --> 00:39:45,484
I don't want to create more sad situations.

540
00:40:10,334 --> 00:40:12,744
Why am I being so pretentious?

541
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:25,150
♫ Yes, I know it won’t be forgotten ♫

542
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:29,910
♫ During the dark days ♫

543
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:35,280
♫ Even if there’s no road ahead ♫

544
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,220
♫ To the place your footsteps reach ♫

545
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,564
Dae Beom!

546
00:40:44,324 --> 00:40:47,654
Dae Beom! Dae Beom?

547
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:49,574
Yeo Reum.

548
00:40:52,754 --> 00:40:54,904
You were over there.

549
00:40:54,904 --> 00:40:57,434
What brings you here?

550
00:40:59,344 --> 00:41:01,234
Well, the thing is...

551
00:41:07,004 --> 00:41:09,344
I wanted to say...

552
00:41:09,344 --> 00:41:12,394
have a safe trip to Seoul and come back safely.

553
00:41:13,724 --> 00:41:15,154
Sorry?

554
00:41:17,164 --> 00:41:19,334
I'm saying,

555
00:41:20,434 --> 00:41:22,924
"Have a safe trip to Seoul"

556
00:41:22,924 --> 00:41:25,134
"and come back safely."

557
00:41:32,284 --> 00:41:34,544
Yes, I'll come back safely.

558
00:41:38,994 --> 00:41:40,734
Also...

559
00:41:42,634 --> 00:41:46,954
I haven't canceled the movie tickets.

560
00:41:51,894 --> 00:41:53,854
Wait, Yeo Reum.

561
00:41:55,244 --> 00:41:58,404
This is for you.

562
00:41:59,214 --> 00:42:00,844
What's this?

563
00:42:00,844 --> 00:42:02,524
It's sneakers.

564
00:42:02,524 --> 00:42:06,424
You said that yours were ripped.

565
00:42:06,424 --> 00:42:08,854
But I wasn't sure on shoe size.

566
00:42:10,664 --> 00:42:12,554
Oh, but your sneakers...

567
00:42:13,324 --> 00:42:15,314
are fine.

568
00:42:16,914 --> 00:42:18,864
You're right.

569
00:42:20,014 --> 00:42:23,054
They are somehow fine.

570
00:42:24,624 --> 00:42:28,754
Then run for me as well, until I come back.

571
00:42:30,224 --> 00:42:32,304
Okay, I will.

572
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:51,860
♫  It's your season again  ♫

573
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:55,430
♫ I'll follow you ♫

574
00:42:55,430 --> 00:43:00,030
It's a nice... summer.

575
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:07,150
♫ We held hands back then ♫

576
00:43:22,734 --> 00:43:27,164
If you go to the end of the library on the left side,

577
00:43:27,164 --> 00:43:30,364
there's one more seat in that corner.

578
00:43:30,364 --> 00:43:33,894
That's my favorite seat.

579
00:43:43,044 --> 00:43:46,484
I can't believe he had this great spot all to himself.

580
00:43:55,334 --> 00:43:57,364
- Hello.
- Thank you so much for coming today.

581
00:43:57,364 --> 00:43:58,514
Of course, we should come.

582
00:43:58,514 --> 00:44:00,494
- Dae Beom, go inside first. I'll park the car.
- Okay.

583
00:44:00,494 --> 00:44:02,324
- You can find us on the third floor.
- Yes, please go ahead.

584
00:44:02,324 --> 00:44:04,604
Professor Lee is already upstairs. Let's go.

585
00:44:04,604 --> 00:44:08,984
Please don't be nervous and just tell it as it is.

586
00:44:21,804 --> 00:44:23,764
This is the place.

587
00:44:35,134 --> 00:44:39,034
I'm sorry to bring you into an uncomfortable place again.

588
00:44:39,944 --> 00:44:41,274
Then let's start.

589
00:44:41,274 --> 00:44:44,324
- Just leave it there!
- It's fine. Let me help.

590
00:44:44,324 --> 00:44:46,724
But where's Bom?

591
00:44:46,724 --> 00:44:49,684
I think she went to change her clothes.

592
00:44:49,684 --> 00:44:52,354
- Just put it down! I can clean up.
- It's all done.

593
00:44:52,354 --> 00:44:55,294
Oh, my goodness!

594
00:44:55,294 --> 00:44:56,794
Bom!

595
00:44:56,794 --> 00:44:58,664
Bye, I'll see you tomorrow.

596
00:44:58,664 --> 00:44:59,924
Bye, see you.

597
00:44:59,924 --> 00:45:03,044
Bye! It's an ice cream cake. Enjoy it with the other staff.

598
00:45:03,044 --> 00:45:05,704
Thank you for the cake!

599
00:45:05,704 --> 00:45:07,984
I told you not to do stuff for the owner lady.

600
00:45:07,984 --> 00:45:09,784
It only makes me tired.

601
00:45:09,784 --> 00:45:12,424
Why? She liked it.

602
00:45:13,664 --> 00:45:16,534
Why did you take something so expensive?

603
00:45:16,534 --> 00:45:19,184
If I buy her something nice, she'll like it.

604
00:45:19,184 --> 00:45:22,834
Do you even know how much I get paid in a day?

605
00:45:22,834 --> 00:45:25,714
I'm sorry. I'll get something cheaper next time—

606
00:45:25,714 --> 00:45:27,534
Hey, watch out!

607
00:45:27,534 --> 00:45:30,634
- You almost hit us!
- What craziness is that?

608
00:45:30,634 --> 00:45:32,344
Watch out!

609
00:45:32,344 --> 00:45:34,424
Who is that? Is it someone who fought with you?

610
00:45:34,424 --> 00:45:38,444
What? None of them have a motorcycle.

611
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:40,344
Hey, be careful!

612
00:45:40,344 --> 00:45:42,974
Who are you? Do you want to die?

613
00:45:42,974 --> 00:45:44,814
- That person must be crazy!
- Wait, wait.

614
00:45:44,814 --> 00:45:46,044
Wait!

615
00:45:46,044 --> 00:45:48,174
Bom, run away!

616
00:45:59,114 --> 00:46:01,884
What? Hey, Dae Ho!

617
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:04,124
Bom!

618
00:46:04,124 --> 00:46:06,694
- When did you get out of prison?
- I just got out.

619
00:46:06,694 --> 00:46:09,794
I visited your grandmother and heard you're here.

620
00:46:09,794 --> 00:46:12,334
You should tell me first of your return.

621
00:46:12,334 --> 00:46:13,914
How can you not tell me? Do you want to die?

622
00:46:13,914 --> 00:46:16,734
Wait, did you get taller?

623
00:46:16,734 --> 00:46:19,344
- What? Me?
- You were tiny before, but you're bigger.

624
00:46:19,344 --> 00:46:21,644
Hey, my height was the same since middle school.

625
00:46:21,644 --> 00:46:24,404
But you look like you lost weight.

626
00:46:24,404 --> 00:46:27,354
- I just worked out a little bit!
- Hey, stop!

627
00:46:27,354 --> 00:46:30,864
What's going on? Let go of her now!

628
00:46:34,754 --> 00:46:36,614
Who's this guy?

629
00:46:37,204 --> 00:46:38,514
Well, he is...

630
00:46:38,514 --> 00:46:41,384
It's obvious. I'm Bom's boyfriend.

631
00:46:45,284 --> 00:46:48,044
Wow, Kim Bom. A lot happened while I was away.

632
00:46:48,044 --> 00:46:50,824
So who the heck are you?

633
00:46:50,824 --> 00:46:53,604
He's my best friend. We've been friends since babies.

634
00:46:53,604 --> 00:46:56,164
- Your best friend?
- Yes.

635
00:46:56,164 --> 00:46:58,154
A guy is your best friend?

636
00:46:58,974 --> 00:47:02,234
Let's introduce ourselves later. Kim Bom.

637
00:47:02,234 --> 00:47:04,954
Hey! Seriously!

638
00:47:04,954 --> 00:47:06,794
Let's see each other often.

639
00:47:06,794 --> 00:47:08,944
Okay. See you.

640
00:47:08,944 --> 00:47:12,424
Also, your name was...

641
00:47:12,424 --> 00:47:14,154
It's Jae Hoon, Heo Jae Hoon.

642
00:47:14,154 --> 00:47:16,964
Right. It's good to meet you.

643
00:47:16,964 --> 00:47:19,174
- Get home safely.
- I'll get going.

644
00:47:19,174 --> 00:47:21,024
Bye!

645
00:47:22,074 --> 00:47:24,184
What's wrong with you?

646
00:47:27,589 --> 00:47:29,500
I told you, he's just a friend.

647
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,332
How can you hug so much with just a friend?

648
00:47:32,332 --> 00:47:35,544
He's my very close friend, my best friend!

649
00:47:35,544 --> 00:47:38,584
Yes, you can come over today.

650
00:47:38,584 --> 00:47:41,194
Okay, I'll see you soon.

651
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:11,700
♫ I was young when I thought that being a hero ♫

652
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:17,400
♫ Put on a cape, take flight ♫

653
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:23,110
♫ Like a fading Polaroid and my favorite childhood toy ♫

654
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:25,674
♫ I'm filled with faith ♫

Geun Ho was filmed running out of here. Did anything happen?

657
00:49:32,714 --> 00:49:36,654
You were going to say it, but I guess it didn't feel right.

658
00:49:36,654 --> 00:49:39,894
Grandma, it seems you are inside my heart.

659
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:42,474
My grandma will trade us and have you as her granddaughter!

660
00:49:42,474 --> 00:49:44,484
You came here to rest.

661
00:49:44,484 --> 00:49:47,254
Can't you think of it as an adventure you had on vacation?

662
00:49:47,254 --> 00:49:50,044
Please keep it secret! I'm so sorry.

663
00:49:50,044 --> 00:49:53,984
Grandma? Where did she go with the lights off?
