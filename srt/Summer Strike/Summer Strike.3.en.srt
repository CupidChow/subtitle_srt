00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,570
What part-time job?

161
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,720
For ₩50,000.

162
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,380
"For ₩50,000"?

Let's not avoid him.

166
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,880
I have to keep seeing him from now on.

167
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:22,494
Do you fix the books on your own?

168
00:12:22,494 --> 00:12:24,004
Yes.

169
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,110
Can I try it once?

170
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,550
Excuse me?

171
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:43,090
With the spatula, spread the glue out evenly.

172
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:47,840
And put the page where it is supposed to be.

173
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,230
Then...

174
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,340
- Wow.
- It's done.

175
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,580
You are like a doctor,

176
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,410
who fixes books by applying ointment.

177
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,020

N-No, I m-meant...

180
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:24,250
I like to fix and reuse old things.

181
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,690
Let me help you.

182
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:45,740
Have you ever heard that you look like Grandpa Santiago?

183
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,370
- Me?
- Yes.

184
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:53,630
The grandpa in "The Old Man and the Sea." You know whom I'm talking about, right?

185
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,210
Yes.

186
00:13:55,210 --> 00:14:01,490
When I first met you, I thought of that grandpa in the book.

187
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,300
Wait, where is this page going?

188
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,310
What should I do?

189
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,370
Do you memorize all stories in the books?

190
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,240
No.

191
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:34,880
If you can remember the characters and region names, you can figure it out.

192
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,300
I can't memorize people's names even if I read the same book multiple times.

193
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:44,340
Then can you do this part, Yeo Reum?

194
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,650
Yes, I will.

195
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,580
Wow, are you helping with our work?

196
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,250
Hi there.

197
00:14:55,250 --> 00:15:00,680
Well... I'm not really much help.

198
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,950
- Why are there flies when it's not summer yet?
- I know.

199
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:09,350
Why are you having such a late lunch?

200
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,880
Don't even think of sitting. Get out right now.

201
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:25,430
Sister, do you think I came here without an idea?

202
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,490
- Being territorial.
- Aigoo.

203
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,080
What's wrong with you?

204
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,570
I'm saying, be territorial!

205
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,020
What are you talking about?

206
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,600
I mean, listen.

207
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,340
Do you know why city people happily come to the countryside but go back crying?

208
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,590
Why? What is it?

209
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,390
Country folk are territorial.

210
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:47,590
Do you want to look it up on YouTube? I saw people taking antidepressants due to it.

211
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:50,620
- Why must they take medication for it?
- That's what I'm saying!

212
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,880
So I looked into it in more detail.

213
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,500
But Seoul people cry over nothing.

214
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:03,520
If those people encounter one like her, they'll say, "Wow, this is an example of territorial!"

215
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,300
They'll freak out and say, "Wow, the real one is here!"

216
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,070
What the heck are you saying? Are you picking a fight with me?

217
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:14,650
This is the official way to be territorial. You are making me pee my pants, too!

218
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:18,000
Why don't you go and show this to the woman at the billiards?

219
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,590
Then she'll pack and leave this town at once.

220
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:24,680
- Hey, you!
- Hey, Seong Min. We need to eat.

221
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,050
I'm pressuring her in all ways.

222
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:32,090
But our sister, Angok-myeon's star, is the best at being territorial.

223
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,170
Why don't you go and show her big time?

224
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,640
"Star," as if.

225
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,950
Hey, stop talking bullsh*t and go.

226
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:43,220
Also, you better bring the money next time!

227
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,700
I think you need to prepare the money,

228
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,220
to buy the building.

229
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,150
I'll get going. This kimchi looks delicious.

230
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,990
- How can you eat it with your hands?
- I'm sorry.

231
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:55,360
You are making a total mess.

232
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,390
I'll go now.

233
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,850
Oh, no!

234
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:15,070
What should I do?

235
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,930
- Just give it to me.
- I'm so sorry.

236
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:21,410
It's okay.

237
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,880
What's going on?

238
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,190
I'm sorry. You should have been careful!

239
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,340
It all got wet!

240
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:31,010
It's okay. I'll dry it out.

241
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:41,450
He says he'll do something so let's see how it goes and discuss it tomorrow.

242
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,330
If it doesn't work, I'll replace the book.

243
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,100
Please drink water outside.

244
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,550
I'm so sorry.

245
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:51,650
You slept in the library before, and now you damaged a book.

246
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,150
What a disaster!

247
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:56,160
- I'll wipe it.
- I'll bring a dry cloth.

248
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:09,070
Where are you going now?

249
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:11,420
I'll take care of myself!

251
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,770

How can he be like that every single day?

256
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:32,410
Grandma, I'm hungry.

257
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:35,880
Ha Neul will come home soon, but do you want to eat first?

258
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:41,440
Did you make dried pollack soup again? I'm sick of it.

259
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,220
I told you not to make those soups for him again.

260
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,310
He needs to be sick and have a near-death experience to stop drinking.

261
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:51,240
Bom, you shouldn't speak like that about your dad.

262
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,210
Wait, what happened to you here?

263
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,740
It happened earlier while taking your dad home.

264
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,170
I told you to leave him alone! Let him just die on the street!

265
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:04,240
How can you say it like that?

266
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:11,750
But a young lady helped me bring your dad home.

267
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,840
Who was that?

268
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,380
She said she recently moved here.

269
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,940
Does she have long hair?

270
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,180
Yes, long hair, and she was pretty.

271
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:30,040
Grandma! I told you not to bring strangers inside the house!

272
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,850
What's up with you again?

273
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,610
It's out of stock.

274
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,490
It's ₩65,000 ($49)?

275
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:48,230
Even if it's out of print, it's too expensive.

276
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:52,580
Sixty-five thousand won is one week's living expenses.

277
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,580
Who are you?

278
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:07,570
Where are you from? Why are you out here alone?

279
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,920
I'm going now. Okay?

280
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,290

- Pardon?
- Oh, no.

Wait, Mr. Librarian. Well...

296
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:31,700
Can I ask you what happened to the book from yesterday?

297
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,950
Oh, about that.

298
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,300
It's frozen.

299
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,490
Why did you put it in the freezer?

300
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,280
It's because the main material of paper is cellulose.

301
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,050
The characteristic of cellulose is that between molecules...

302

If you do that, you can restore the book.

Oh, my goodness.

484
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:28,610
Is that so? How much will you pay for him?

485
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:30,780
How much do you want me to pay?

486
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:35,220
- Give me ₩300,000 ($225).
- Excuse me?

487
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:38,430
Why? Don't you want to pay that much?

488
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:42,700
- Then give the dog back to me.
- No, no.

489
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,560
I'll pay you that amount.

490
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:49,010
Please wait here for a second.

491
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,720
You must leave the dog here.

492
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,300
How dare you try to take him with you?

493
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:02,230
I'll be back really soon.

494
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:05,950
Come over here, you dog! Where do you think you're going?

495
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:17,970
Please select the amount you want.

496
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,640
This place looks expensive. Is it okay?

497
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:35,610
Dae Beom, you know how much I like you, right?

498
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:36,990
Of course.

499
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,240
Let's go inside.

500
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:48,200
Hello, I'm Jo Ji Young, the one who got the call.

501
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,960
Yes, hello.

502
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:55,500
An Dae Beom, it's been such a long time!

503
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,230
Dae Beom, you look great!

504
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:04,800
Excuse me first, Professor.

505
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,310
Dae Beom.

506
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:08,210
Dae Beom. Hey!

507
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,270
Here's the ₩300,000.

508
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:26,200
Now I can take him with me, right?

509
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,180
You better consider it lucky I'm ending it like this.

510
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:32,340
Compared to our losses from your move to that building,

511
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:36,460
you should be thankful we decided to get even with ₩300,000 for this dog.

512
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,700
What are you talking about?

513
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,480
I don't know what you were doing before moving into this town.

514
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,310
Nobody thinks well of you in this town.

515
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:47,780
You better behave yourself! Don't spoil the town's culture.

516
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:51,140
Ahjumma, how can you be so mean to her?

517
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:56,040
When you hand over these dogs to the dog traders, you pay them ₩10,000 with the dog.

518
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,830
How can you ask her for ₩300,000?

519
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:00,820
What do you know to interfere with this?

520
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:03,730
That's not important. Return her money now.

521
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:06,310
Why do you care about this?

522
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:08,700
It's none of your business if I get ₩300,000 or ₩400,000.

523
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,310
I know it's none of my business.

524
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:14,640
But I'm worried she may think all villagers are total crooks due to you!

525
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,770
What? "A crook"?

526
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:19,930
Oh, my goodness!

527
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:23,050
You are indeed the daughter of the drunk!

528
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:25,840
How dare you speak like that to an adult?

529
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,170
What did you just say to me?

530
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:31,100
Do you want to have a fight with this drunk's daughter?

531
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:34,330
Seriously, listen to what this girl is saying!

532
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:37,790
Take this money back with you!

533
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:39,950
But you sold the dog to me.

534
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:42,740
I'm not selling the dog to you!

535
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,830
Give me the dog. I'm not selling to you.

536
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:46,760
- Give me the dog!
- You sold him to me already!

537
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,900
- Give it to me!
- Please let me take him with me!

538
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,520
I'll take good care of him, please!

539
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:56,660
Is that so? Then give me ₩150,000 more.

540
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,310
What did you just say?

541
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:03,960
If I'm going to be called a crook, I need to get paid more money.

542
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,160
Excuse me, just don't buy the dog from her.

543
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,430
This kind of dog is all over the place in our town.

544
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:15,900
Please wait for me a little bit.

545
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,340
Wait, excuse me!

546
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,110
Ahjumma, how can you do this?

547
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,770
Four hundred fifty thousand won?

548
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:25,390
Bom, stay out of this if you don't know what's going on.

549
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:28,950
Stay out of what? Did you lose your mind over money?

550
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:31,480
I guess this woman really lost her mind!

551
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:35,500
Forget about school. You learn basic manners first!

552
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,200
Go home now!

553
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:41,390
If you don't go, I'll charge her more money.

554
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:44,190
Seriously! It's so annoying.

555
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,330
That brat!

556
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:49,090
Seriously, that rude brat.

557
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,050
Dae Beom, why don't you just get angry at me?

558
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:03,800
You are driving me crazy right now.

559
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:08,360
Professor Lee called me a few days ago and begged me to arrange it.

560
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,720
Honestly, I don't understand why you do this.

561
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:15,000
What's wrong with you? That's a position people can't get even if they want to.

562
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,240
But... I like my life as it is now.

563
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:22,930
What's good about a part-time job in a library?

564
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:27,110
Also, you got a lot better lately.

565
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:32,940
I get it. I'm sorry about today.

566
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:36,110
I promise I'll let you know first if a meeting happens again.

567
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:37,890
But instead,

568
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:41,180
don't just say "no" and consider it one more time.

569
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:48,920
It's just too bad we missed the chance to dine in that Japanese restaurant.

570
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,220
I heard that place is amazing.

571
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:59,980
This is the paper that you wrote before.

572
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,530
The professor asked me to hand this to you.

573
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:04,180
I'll put it right here.

574
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:07,330
Hey! Don't get angry at me.

575
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:09,470
Don't get angry at me.

576
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,260
I'm sorry.

577
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:39,050
In fact...

578
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:44,160
I hesitated a bit when withdrawing the money.

579
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,510
I'm sorry.

580
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:58,890
Hello?

581
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:01,050
Yeo Reum, how are you?

582
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:03,850
I'm good. Why are you calling?

583
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:08,080
Hey, what's surprising about calling to check on my little sister?

584
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,400
Okay, give me one second.

585
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,930
- Is your wife next to you?
- What?

586
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:14,450
Yes.

587
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:18,280
By the way, Yeo Reum...

588
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:32,340
You took all of our mom's money and her house!

589
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:36,330
That ring is the only thing I have left from our mom.

590
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:40,750
Of course, I know. But you know, my son, Gyu Beom.

591
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:45,270
His friends study abroad or something every vacation.

592
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:46,930
But my Gyu Beom couldn't go, not even once.

593
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:48,970
Just tell her he's going to the Philippines!

594
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:52,240
I get it! I'm talking to her about it right now.

595
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:55,940
Is this your wife's idea?

596
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:58,880
Did she say to sell our mom's ring to send your son to the Philippines?

597
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,540
It's not like that. Yeo Reum.

598
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:06,140
Don't you also think it's sad for your nephew

599
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:09,140
to be discouraged as he never went to study abroad?

600
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:11,680
Oppa.

601
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,480
Do you know...

602
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,810
Do you even know how I'm doing right now?

603
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:20,320
Of course, I know! I know, but...

604
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,320
But it's since my family is tight on money right now.

605
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,660
Am I not your family?

Oh, my goodness! You are dropping the cash! Hey!

625

It's not you, but the alcohol you drank last night.

- There's no money!
- Did she lose her entire savings?

627
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:13,520
