- Okay, stop it.

What's going on?

161
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,450
Hello. We've met before at his store.

162
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,620
Oh, yes. Hello.

163
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:52,580
You don't have a rough idea of when it might have been, right?

164
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,590
Well, what time would it have been?

165
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,190
What do you want to see if you don't even know the time frame?

166
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:00,260
We can just go through the video and find out.

167
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,910
- Oh? Look over here.
- Oh!

168
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:06,350
This person over here.

169
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,690
It's you, right?

170
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,040
I think it's me.

171
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,100
But why were you crawling?

172
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,390
What is your situation? What's going on?

173
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:19,040
Hyung, obviously, she's drunk.

174
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,540
Oh, that's right.

175
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:25,790
Why did you want to withdraw cash when you were completely wasted?

176
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:29,320
What now? Oh, no! Look at her!

177
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,400
So are you talking about this black plastic bag?

178
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,690
I guess this is the bag!

179
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:38,410
You were holding it like a handbag so I thought it was a real bag.

180
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:42,220
It seems you had trouble getting the money.

181
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:47,180
Oh, you kept entering the wrong pin code, that's why.

182
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,040
I'm sorry...

183
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,520
Okay, let's see. Oh, my goodness.

184
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,420
I don't think she got the cash. Oh, did she fall? There's no one there.

185
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,610
Oh, she did fall. I was surprised.

186
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,300
This is so frustrating. Let's fast-forward.

187
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,660
Oh, my goodness.

188
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,660
Is she withdrawing the money or not?

189
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,130
I think she got the cash. Wait, let me do it.

190
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,250
- It's there!
- She got the money.

191
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,780
Why did you withdraw so much cash in the middle of the night?

192
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:21,540
You should have put it in your wallet, not in the plastic bag.

193
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,260
You didn't leave the money behind.

194
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,940
Oh, no. You have to pull the door, not climb on it.

195
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,860
This is so frustrating. Let's fast-forward.

196
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:34,340
That's it. After that, you... you just left.

197
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,900
Thank you for showing the recording.

198
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,790
I think you dropped it on your way home. Why don't you look for it?

199
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,550
Yes, I will.

200
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,590
- Wait, one second!
- What is it?

201
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,990
- What's this?
- What's flying?

202
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,120
Why don't you play it from here again?

203
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,120
What's going on?

204
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,010
- Something just flew by.
- Is that me?

205
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,210
- Who else would it be?
- She fell again.

206
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,360
Somebody's running toward her.

207
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:02,420
Oh? Isn't that long-haired person Dae Beom?

208
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:06,590
Why is he here?

209
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,320
He's picking up the cash

210
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,650
and not caring for the fallen person.

211
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:17,250
Look at her, relaxing because the test is over.

212
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,770
I wasn't sleeping. Hello, Yeo Reum.

213
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:22,030
How are you?

214
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:26,330
Mr. Librarian, can we talk for a second?

215
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,130
Yes, of course.

216
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,420
Wait, where are you two going?

217
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,290
Why don't you go back to sleep?

218
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:36,950
Where are you going?

219
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,370
Go back to sleep.

220
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,570
Why are you all going out without me?

221
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:46,000
We ran into each other last night, didn't we?

222
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,890
Yes, we did.

223
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:50,570
Let's drink something cold and refreshing while we talk.

224
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,000
Thank you.

225
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,690
This lady can't remember seeing you last night.

226
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,950
Is that so?

227
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:04,180
I'm just wondering about the black plastic bag I was holding last night.

228
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,850
Do you remember that?

229
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:08,340
Yes.

230
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,440
We just saw the CCTV recording at the bank,

231
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,140
and you took the plastic bag from the ground.

232
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:19,500
I carried that for you.

233
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,790
But why do you ask?

234
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:26,130
Can you tell the story in more detail?

235
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:29,000
She's panicking because she lost that plastic bag.

236
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,340
- What?
- Please tell us what happened.

237
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:41,030
Last night you fell in front of the bank.

238
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,210
It hurts...

239
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,540
Oh, my money!

240
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,410
Are you okay?

241
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,580
Mr. Librarian?

242
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,780
What brings you all the way here?

243
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,310
I'm taking care of this for you.

244
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,500
I'll give it back to you later.

245
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,850
I got a bit drunk.

246
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,640
I got a little bit drunk tonight.

247
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,010
- Are you okay?
- Oh, my.

248
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:15,260
Aigoo, my body!

249
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:19,650
Wait, I've seen this before.

250
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:20,950
Excuse me?

251
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,270
Where was it?

252
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:27,570
Oh, the library! The library!

253
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:31,860
Why do you appear whenever I'm drunk?

254
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,590
- I didn't do that.
- Oh, one!

255
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,900
- Excuse me?
- Oh, one!

256
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,810
♪ And two! Why do you appear in front of me? ♪

257
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:44,620
♪ Why do you keep appearing when I'm drunk? ♪

258
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,390
- All together now!
- Let's go, Guys.

259
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:49,530
♪ Why do you appear in front of me? ♪

260
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:53,170
♪ Why do you keep appearing when I'm drunk? ♪

261
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:58,860
♪ Blah blah something, I keep thinking of your face ♪

262
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,310
You are going home, right?

263
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:10,030
- My home?
- Yes.

264
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,650
Are you talking about the billiards?

265
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,350
Yes.

266
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,450
That's not my home.

267
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,670
Oh, that hurts.

268
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:28,570
Nothing really happened on the way home, right?

269
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:32,410
It's because my face was like this when I woke up.

270
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:34,100
Oh, about that.

271
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,350
Did you two fight last night?

272
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,040
Mr. Librarian.

273
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,050
What brings you here?

274
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,520
You didn't take this with you.

275
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,690
There was something I really wanted to ask you.

276
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,220
What is it?

277
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,960
Can I ask you?

278
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,830
Go ahead.

279
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:14,420
The night we slept together in the library...

280
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,240
Pardon?

281
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:21,540
What? Don't you remember that night?

282
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:25,600
- No, I didn't mean that.
- We slept together in the library!

283
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,890
- We didn't sleep together. We slept in separate rooms.
- Forget it!

284
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:32,730
That's not the point.

285
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:38,060
The next morning, did you hear it or not?

286
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,770
What would I have heard?

287
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:49,720
The sound... of my peeing.

288
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,240
I'm not quite sure what you're talking about.

289
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:57,190
You're pretending you didn't hear it.

290
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,280
It really hurts!

291
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,720
Why are you doing that to me?

292
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,570
Why do you keep pushing me?

293
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,390
It's because you almost fell to the ground.

294
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,990
You've been pushing me the whole night!

295
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:17,970
You didn't even hold me with your hands but used the plastic bag!

296
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:20,100
Am I too dirty for you to touch?

297
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,010
Or am I possessed by a ghost?

298
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:24,950
Look at you! You are avoiding me again.

299
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:29,740
Wow, let me just live my life.

300
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,810
I'll just quietly live alone!

301
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:36,540
Please just leave me alone!

302
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,900
Seriously, I'm so sad.

303
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,450
Right, I also don't know what I'm doing here right now.

304
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:45,910
Please, I beg of you!

305
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:49,230
Let me greet you like this.

306
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,900
It hurts!

307
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,220
I think I lost my nose!

308
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,250
No, your nose is still attached.

309
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,120
Oh, my nose!

310
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,340
You got a scratch on it.

311
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,510
Did you just avoid me?

312
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,410
I'm sorry.

313
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,900
You did avoid me.

314
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,880
Everyone really does hate me.

315
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,420
It's not like that, but...

316
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:35,480
It's fine. Today's my last day.

317
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,880
Hold on to me.

318
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,730
Please hold my hand.

319
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,980
By the way, how old are you?

320
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,150
I'm 28 years old.

321
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,970
Really?

322
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,100
We are the same age!

323
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,890
You are the same age as I am.

324
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:00,110
Come with me. The drinks are on me.

325
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,880
Hurry and follow me.

326
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,950
Hurry up!

We are here.

328
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,590
We are here! This is the place.

Pick everything you want to eat. I'll get it all for you!

I don't think we can do that right now.

Why not?

- Let's go!
- I'll get going now.

Oh, no!

No, I can't take that from you! No!

339

You need to take this with you!

340
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:01,070
So you just handed the plastic bag to me and left?

341
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,830
Yes.

342
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:10,130
It seems you dropped the plastic bag somewhere on your way home.

343

I'm sorry.

344
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,510
I should have escorted you all the way home.

No, it's okay.

Bye, Yeo Reum!

Thank goodness I begged Hyung Young Sam for help.

But how did you go out last night when you were tired from driving, Dae Beom?

356
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:08,070
I just went for a walk.

Dae Beom is still young.

But why does she get in trouble whenever she drinks?

359
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:18,040
I know. Alcohol is the source of every problem.

360
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,730
Would she drink again tonight after losing her entire savings?

361
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:22,710
I think she can never find that at all.

362

Did she lose her entire savings? How much was it?

- Fifty million won ($38,000)?
- No, not fifty million!

364
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,380
It's five million won.

365
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:34,550
"Five million won." Shouldn't she report that to the police?

366
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:37,310
What can the police do about it?

367

Now it's not due to me, but she can't live here anymore even if she wants to.

396

Didn't you see her?

Oh, you didn't see her.

But did you have the dried pollack soup?

00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:07,720
She called me this morning and asked how to make the soup.

thank you for the soup.

No, you don't have to.

00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:36,670
Let's go together! I'm really good at ramyeon.

487
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:38,550
- I said go away!
- Just try it once!

488
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,380
- Oh, it hurts!
- Oh, no!

489
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,450
Let's go together.

490
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:47,900
What happened to you?

491
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:51,610
Did you go out to look for Yeo Reum's money?

492
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:53,300
Yes.

493
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,940
Did you find it?

494
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,210
Yes.

495
00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:00,480
Really? Impressive, I thought it'd be impossible to find.

496
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,320
Did you just return from giving it to her?

497
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,850
Yes.

498
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:12,290
But... don't you think you're too involved in someone else's matter?

499
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,580
It's very unusual of you.

500
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,480
Noona.

501
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,320
I'm hungry.

502
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,530
Noona, this place is really cool.

503
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:23,830
It feels like a studio loft in New York.

504
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,510
"New York," as if.

505
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:28,310
Is your earlier injury okay?

506
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,730
I'm fine since I'm strong.

507
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:32,380
Should I make the ramyeon over there?

508
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,020
I'll make it.

509
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,600
No, it's okay! Let me make it for you.

510
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,940
You two don't even have to move a finger. Just stay right there.

511
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,040
You'll be really surprised when you try my ramyeon.

512
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,590
Are you cooking the ramyeon with your mouth?

513
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,920
- I'm making it with my hands.
- Seriously!

514
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,520
Why did he tag along?

515
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:59,960
Can I just call you "Bom"?

516
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,040
Yes.

517
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,250
I have something to tell you.

518
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,750
What is it?

519
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,440
Bom,

520
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:13,070
I'm sorry.

521
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,780
I'm really sorry.

522
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:17,610
What? Out of the blue?

523
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:19,130
Why are you sorry?

524
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:22,090
The reason I went to your house,

525
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:24,320
I was suspicious of you.

526
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:27,830
I'm really sorry.

527
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:30,680
Why do you apologize to me?

528
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,950
I was the one who was mean to you.

529
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:35,800
You also paid a lot due to me.

530
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,720
It's not like that.

531
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,820
I'll repay you from now on.

532
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:45,250
What's this? Are you saying you'll take revenge on me?

533
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,990
No, not at all.

534
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:49,950
- My goodness! Noona!
- Hey!

535
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:51,600
What's going on?

536
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,630
Noona, I really didn't do anything!

537
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,790
Oh, this!

538
00:34:55,790 --> 00:35:00,230
It's because the water pipe broke, but I just fixed it with duct tape.

539
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,010
Bom, what are you doing?

540
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:06,850
Get out of my way.

541
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:11,260
Unnie, I think you have to throw this out. The entire pipe has burst.

542
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,410
Is that so?

543
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,910
I'll go to Uncle Seong Min's place and get a new pipe.

544
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,660
- Wait for a bit.
- No, don't do that.

545
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,840
He and I decided I'd fix things like this myself.

546
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,500
What? That doesn't make sense.

547
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,520
Just wait. I'll get a new pipe from him.

548
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,340
Let me come with you.

549
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:29,940
Don't get in my way. Wipe the floor and look after the dog properly.

550
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,230
- Thank you for doing that!
- Noona!

551
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:42,910
What's your name?

552
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:45,700
Uncle!

553
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:50,490
Oh, y-you're here.

554
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:53,340
How can you do this?

555
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:56,350
I-I know.

556
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,830
I'm really sorry.

557
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:01,490
Yes, the billiard's pipes are completely broken, and we can't even use the water.

558
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:03,690
The sink is completely rotted.

559
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:07,300
Isn't it obvious this is something the landlord should fix?

560
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:12,120
Oh, is it about the pipe?

561
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,890
- Then what else?
- I'm really fine.

562
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:18,330
I'll fix it on my own. Can I have one pipe for the sink?

563
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:21,470
Yes! I should do it, of course!

564
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:27,100
I'm the one who should fix it. You two can go home first.

565
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,650
I'll pack the tools and come over.

566
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:30,490
Uncle, come quickly.

567
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:32,510
We were about to make ramyeon.

568
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,170
Okay, I'll come right away.

569
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:37,500
Yeo Reum, why don't you go first with Bom?

570
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,340
Let's go.

571
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,220
Bom!

572
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,870
Bom, can you come out for a second?

573
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:57,250
What is it?

574
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,630
Stop asking and come down here.

575
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,330
Who are you? Why don't you come down as well?

576
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:03,090
Okay!

577
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:09,590
Why are you bothering us to come downstairs?

578
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:13,150
Look who's here!

579
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,950
You are the boy I met in the library.

580
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:18,540
That's right. This is my son.

581
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,560
If you meet an adult, you should say, "Hello."

582
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,850
- Hello.
- Hi.

583
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:26,420
He wanted to see the billiard Noona so much.

584
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,180
Me?

585
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:30,600
What's up with you all of a sudden?

586
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:35,700
Anyway, I brought some stuff. Why don't we bring these upstairs together?

587
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,850
Hello, I'm Bom's classmate...

588
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:40,820
Yes, good to see you. You and I will carry heavy things.

589
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:43,640
Bom and Yeo Reum, you two can carry light things.

590
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:47,320
Also, Jun, you know what to do, right?

591
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,950
Are you sure you are giving these to me?

592
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:53,110
It's nothing. Yeo Reum, why don't you take this? It's light.

593
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:56,590
Uncle, you are giving these for free, right?

594
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:59,580
Then would I charge for this? Why don't you take this upstairs?

595
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,140
Are you giving all this stuff?

596
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,920
It's nothing much. Why don't you go upstairs?

597
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,450
Let's just go upstairs.

598
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,580
He can be a generous person.

599
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,940
No, you carry this big one with me.

600
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:11,970
You do the heavy lifting! Hold it here.

601
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:20,780
Geun Ho, what are you doing over there?

602
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:23,390
Come and eat dinner.

603
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,100
Geun Ho.

604
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:44,210
You really shouldn't go outside.

605
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:46,160
Do you understand?

606
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,900
Shall we put that next to the bed?

607
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:56,280
It's working fine now!

608
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,610
Thank you so much!

609
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:02,340
Bom! You are quite good at that.

610
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:06,810
I'm the only one to fix things like this in my family.

611
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:11,380
That's right, Bom.

612
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:15,300
The thing I asked you to do before for pocket money...

613
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:19,450
That's a secret to Yeo Reum, okay?

614
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:21,460
Why do you suddenly act like this?

615
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,320
Does she know some weakness of yours?

616
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,500
What weakness?

617
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:29,410
Do you...

618
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:32,270
Did you hear about something?

619
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,420
You did something wrong to her.

620
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,120
What about it?

621
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,090
Unnie! The water works now!

622
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:41,240
Did you fix it?

623
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,330
I didn't know you could do something like that!

624
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:47,130
Wow, Kim Bom! You are good at everything!

625
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:50,190
I knew you could fix it when you ripped off the duct tape.

626
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:52,220
You are like a mechanic.

627
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:55,180
Why is he so talkative?

628
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:58,360
The door downstairs doesn't lock well; I'll fix it.

629
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:11,410
- Please take this.
- No, it's okay.

630
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:13,020
But you gave me so much today.

631
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,320
One second!

632
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:20,650
There you go. It's strong now.

633
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:22,380
Please take this.

634
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:26,610
No, it's really okay. I also left you a chain lock upstairs.

635
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:29,600
You must lock the door well.

636
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:33,590
You know, we saw the horrific graffiti from before.

637
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:36,210
- Please take this.
- No, I'm good.

638
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:38,740
Just think of it as options that came with the house.

639
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,740
No, but you gave me so many things.

640
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:43,940
No, those are all used so don't worry.

641
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:48,420
Just use them well and return them when you move out.

642
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:51,640
Oh, that's right. Jun!

643
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:54,840
Yes, he's bringing it out with him.

644
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,800
I'm sorry.

645
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,600
Why are you apologizing?

646
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:13,400
He bought this for you with his piggy bank money.

647
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,970
Why are you doing all this for me today?

648
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:20,480
Well, the thing is, Yeo Reum...

649
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,520
What I'm about to tell you

650
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:28,400
is a bit embarrassing for me.

That boy likes to get a pastry every morning at the supermarket.

654
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:39,820
And he came out from the supermarket this morning as well.

655
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:43,100
And he picked up your money in the plastic bag.

656
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,120
Did he pick it up?

657
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:51,110
I know. But aren't you glad it's my son who picked it up?

658
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,820
Where did he pick it up?

659
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:56,420
Well, it was...

660
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,670
Right here.

661
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:59,450
"Right here"?

Wow, awesome!

663
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:11,420
He picked up that plastic bag on the street, and it was full of cash.

664
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:15,420
So he thought it was a gift from Heaven.

665

- He has watched one too many cartoons!
- Thank you!

666
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,710
But Mr. Librarian had it.

667
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:30,300
That's because he heard my father's public announcement

668
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,400
and figured what was going on.

669
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,610
He told me he got scared and ran to Dae Beom right away.

With that money, I went to the internet cafe, and...

671
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:43,120
If something like that happens, he should come to me, but why did he go to Dae Beom first?

672
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,160
I wanted to ask you something.

673
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:51,570
When Dae Beom handed this money to you,

674
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:54,250
did he mention Jun?

675
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:04,990
No, he didn't.

676
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:11,290
I want to ask you a favor.

677

I don't want others to know what I just told you.

I'm very grateful to you.

I'll get going now.

Wait.

683
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,510
It's not Jun's fault.

684
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:32,320
I'm the one who lost it.

685
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:37,660
Also, don't worry. I can't mention it to others since I'm embarrassed.

686

Uncle Seong Min did a good deed today.

Of course!

Oh, that's right. What's his name?

699
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:30,770
He doesn't have a name yet.

700
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:34,160
Really? Then let's make a name for him.

701
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,960
I actually have a name in mind.

702
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:41,230
- What is it?
- He has white fur.

703
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:44,460
So... what if we call him Gyeo Wool ("winter").

704
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,880
Bom, Yeo Reum, and Gyeo Wool (spring, summer, and winter, respectively).

- I love it!

- Yes!
- Do you like it?

707

I think it's weird! How about we call him "Damian"?

708
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:57,700
"Damian"? Damian, my foot. Just focus on eating pizza.

709

Where's Damian? Do you want some pizza, too?

710
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,700
No, don't give him pizza!

711
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,260
Damian shouldn't eat pizza.

- Did I?

713

- You called him "Damian"!

We decided on "Damian."

- It's Gyeo Wool.
- You also just called him "Damian."

I thought every human in this world hated me.

I don't remember everything, but one thing is clear.

745

It's the hatred.

746
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:20,500
I wanted to leave this place.

And I wanted all my money to disappear.

748
