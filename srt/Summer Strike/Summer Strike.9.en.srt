166
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,153
We're here now.

167
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,713
Thanks for the ride. Here.

168
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,940
Also, thank you for dinner.

169
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,113
Sure.

170
00:11:49,113 --> 00:11:51,963
It's so good to have you back, Dae Ho.

171
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:58,773
That's right. I met my mom.

172
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,793
She came to see me at the center. It was embarrassing.

173
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,473
How did it go?

174
00:12:07,473 --> 00:12:10,843
I think it's better you don't see your mom.

175
00:12:10,843 --> 00:12:13,883
It felt terrible.

176
00:12:13,883 --> 00:12:17,153
If they were going to do that, they shouldn't have had us.

177
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:21,263
It's fine. I don't care about it anymore.

178
00:12:21,263 --> 00:12:24,973
Okay. I just wanted to share this with you.

179
00:12:24,973 --> 00:12:29,423
It's not like I can talk to someone else about it.

180
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,303
Dae Ho, do you want to see Grandma before you go?

181
00:12:36,303 --> 00:12:40,713
No, not tonight. She cries whenever she sees me.

182
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,213
Go inside.

183
00:12:43,213 --> 00:12:44,283
Okay. Bye!

184
00:12:44,283 --> 00:12:46,603
- Good night.
- See you later!

185
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,686
You better listen to your grandmother, okay?

186
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,636
Okay.

187
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,820
Your handwriting is very pretty.

188
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:04,473
No, it's all crooked.

189
00:13:04,473 --> 00:13:09,020
What do you want to write first when you learn the Korean alphabet?

190
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,063
Kim Bom.

191
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,103
Kim Ha Neul.

192
00:13:14,103 --> 00:13:16,373
Kim Jung Hoon.

193
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:24,513
Yeo Reum, I guess you must be lonely since Bom is not coming to the library these days.

194
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:28,528
No, I'm good at hanging out by myself.

195
00:13:28,528 --> 00:13:33,532
But "I'm lonely and bored" is written on your face.

196
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,363
Yes, I'm a bit bored.

197
00:13:38,363 --> 00:13:40,759
It's okay.

198
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:46,390
It's okay to be bored, and it's okay to be busy.

199
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,603
It's all good.

200
00:13:48,603 --> 00:13:50,393
Really?

201
00:13:50,393 --> 00:13:54,393
Of course. That's human life.

202
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:00,465
Please continue to be friends

203
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:03,730
with our Bom and Ha Neul.

204
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,005
Of course, I will.

205
00:14:06,005 --> 00:14:10,735
Then do you have time tomorrow for dinner?

206
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,100
[Are you sleeping?]

207
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,840
Who's this?

208
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,630
[It's Dae Beom.]

209
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,753
Is it Dae Beom?

210
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:37,520
[Wow! Did you get a cellphone, Dae Beom?]

211
00:14:38,173 --> 00:14:41,433
[Yes, I got it today.]

212
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:45,873
[Is it your first cellphone in your life?]

213
00:14:45,873 --> 00:14:47,313
[Yes.]

214
00:14:47,313 --> 00:14:49,633
Really?

215
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,113
[What's that?]

216
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:00,533
[It's an "emoji." Find it by clicking face-shaped buttons at the bottom.]

217
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,673
Ta-da!

218
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,137
[You got used to it quickly!]

219
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,543
At age 17?

220
00:15:14,543 --> 00:15:17,403
[That was all I could do back then.]

221
00:15:17,403 --> 00:15:20,403
[I wish I could be good at studying as I have nothing else to do.]

222
00:15:20,403 --> 00:15:23,063
[I didn't mean it that way...]

223
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,963
Why isn't he replying?

224
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:33,609
[How was your childhood, Yeo Reum?]

225
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:38,975
[I didn't have anything special besides my name.]

226
00:15:41,467 --> 00:15:43,141
"Oh"?

227
00:15:43,141 --> 00:15:46,621
[What does this agreeing "Oh" mean?]

228
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:59,689
[It's been a while since I stayed up all night texting.]

229
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,303
[It's my first time.]

230
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,628
[But doesn't it hurt your wrists?]

231
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,213
Hello?

232
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:21,443
We could have called at the start.

233
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:26,283
It's good to hear your voice.

234
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,698
But you have to go to sleep now, don't you?

235
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,903
I jogged yesterday as well.

236
00:16:48,903 --> 00:16:51,503
I wore the sneakers you bought me.

237
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,533
It was hard at first, but I love it now.

238
00:16:58,533 --> 00:17:01,503
If I like something,

239
00:17:01,503 --> 00:17:05,233
I have my own rule to figure out if I truly like it or not.

240
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:06,513
What's that?

241
00:17:06,513 --> 00:17:12,473
That rule is whether or not I would do it on a deserted island.

242
00:17:12,473 --> 00:17:17,443
I think I'd be jogging every morning on a deserted island as well.

243
00:17:17,443 --> 00:17:19,473
Me, too.

244
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:26,883
But it's a bit harder today since I stayed up all night.

245
00:17:26,883 --> 00:17:28,773
I feel the same.

246
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,937
Yeo Reum, are you walking now?

247
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:41,813
How did you know? Do you see me from somewhere?

248
00:17:41,813 --> 00:17:45,673
No, it sounded like you were walking.

249
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,927
Wait one second.

250
00:17:52,927 --> 00:17:54,707
Hello?

251
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:06,368
Ta-da! It's the morning ocean in Angok.

252
00:18:07,723 --> 00:18:09,863
Can you hear the waves?

253
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,183
Isn't it pretty?

254
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:32,419
Yeo Reum, thank you so much.

255
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:54,090
You came in early. Do you want some coffee?

256
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:00,123
- Professor.
- Yes?

257
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,334
- Stand up now!
- Come on, I said get up!

258
00:19:09,334 --> 00:19:12,034
Seriously, darn it!

259
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:18,186
Hey, American Boy. Why are you alone today? Where's Kim Bom?

260
00:19:18,186 --> 00:19:19,966
You know Dae Ho is released.

261
00:19:19,966 --> 00:19:22,796
Hey, come here. I said to come here.

262
00:19:22,796 --> 00:19:24,940
Where do you think you're going?

263
00:19:25,906 --> 00:19:28,866
I guess Kim Bom got together with the ex-convict.

264
00:19:28,866 --> 00:19:31,446
Hey, don't talk about her like that.

265
00:19:31,446 --> 00:19:34,536
Oh my! I'm so scared.

266
00:19:34,536 --> 00:19:37,696
Do you want to hear something?

267
00:19:39,056 --> 00:19:40,846
Dae Ho is Kim Bom's pimp.

268
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,156
Do you know he went to prison for making her have sugar daddies (benefactors)?

269
00:19:43,156 --> 00:19:44,396
Poor American Boy.

270
00:19:44,396 --> 00:19:46,766
Be careful of that girl! You might lose everything.

271
00:19:46,766 --> 00:19:48,616
You might also go to prison due to her!

272
00:19:48,616 --> 00:19:51,476
You're crazy! That's hilarious!

273
00:19:51,476 --> 00:19:52,836
Hello?

274
00:19:52,836 --> 00:19:57,026
Unnie, guess what I have in my hand right now?

275
00:19:57,026 --> 00:19:59,056
- In your hand?
- Yes.

276
00:19:59,056 --> 00:20:02,306
Well... I think I smell raw fish from your hand.

277
00:20:02,306 --> 00:20:04,326
What? How did you know that?

278
00:20:04,326 --> 00:20:06,886
Wow, you are so good at this.

279
00:20:06,886 --> 00:20:09,206
You are on my palm (heart).

280
00:20:09,206 --> 00:20:10,716
Really?

281
00:20:10,716 --> 00:20:15,436
I called you to come over to my place and have raw fish together with my grandma.

282
00:20:15,436 --> 00:20:18,316
Yeo Reum! Can you come and take this out?

283
00:20:18,316 --> 00:20:19,976
Yes!

284
00:20:19,976 --> 00:20:23,820
What? Are you at my house right now?

285
00:20:24,446 --> 00:20:28,306
Now I know why Grandma asked me to get some raw fish today.

286
00:20:28,306 --> 00:20:30,686
Hurry home. I haven't had raw fish in a long time.

287
00:20:30,686 --> 00:20:32,346
Okay. Wait a little bit.

288
00:20:32,346 --> 00:20:34,466
- Come home safely!
- Okay.

289
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:36,376
Gyeo Wool, this is for you.

290
00:20:36,376 --> 00:20:38,506
Is it good?

291
00:20:39,686 --> 00:20:41,876
This is so good.

292
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:47,766
Grandma, your food really tastes the same as my mom's cooking.

293
00:20:47,766 --> 00:20:52,226
People swoon if they have my cooking.

294
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:53,910
I'll give you some.

295
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,046
It's so good.

296
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:03,186
Can you get me some more rice?

297
00:21:03,186 --> 00:21:04,686
- Grandma.
- Yes?

298
00:21:04,686 --> 00:21:06,806
Unnie wants more rice.

299
00:21:06,806 --> 00:21:09,926
- Hey!
- Do you want to eat more?

300
00:21:09,926 --> 00:21:11,496
No, I'll go get it.

301
00:21:11,496 --> 00:21:13,516
No, let me do it.

302
00:21:13,516 --> 00:21:17,616
Unnie, you might have a stomachache if you eat that much.

303
00:21:17,616 --> 00:21:20,406
But it's been a while since I had a home-cooked meal.

304
00:21:20,406 --> 00:21:23,286
Hey, Kim Ha Neul! Stop feeding Gyeo Wool. You might make him sick.

305
00:21:23,286 --> 00:21:25,846
- Focus on eating your food.
- Mind your business.

306
00:21:25,846 --> 00:21:28,536
Gyeo Wool is having a feast today!

307
00:21:28,536 --> 00:21:33,166
Can you do for me just a tiny bit of what you do for Gyeo Wool?

308
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,066
If you were as sweet as Gyeo Wool, I'd treat you the same. Right, Gyeo Wool?

309
00:21:36,066 --> 00:21:38,536
What? Do you want to die in my hands?

310
00:21:38,536 --> 00:21:41,936
- Just eat your food!
- You guys are very realistic siblings.

311
00:21:43,146 --> 00:21:46,076
Gyeo Wool, don't act like her.

312
00:21:46,076 --> 00:21:48,766
Thank you for the food!

313
00:21:49,546 --> 00:21:52,106
But what's this?

314
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:57,016
No way, Grandma.

315
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:59,486
You figured it out instantly. You're really good at this.

316
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:02,716
I asked you over today so you could have this.

317
00:22:02,716 --> 00:22:05,806
- I'm so excited!
- I made it from scratch. Have a drink.

318
00:22:05,806 --> 00:22:07,866
- Grandma, you have a glass first.
- No, no.

319
00:22:07,866 --> 00:22:10,926
She doesn't drink because she's sick of alcohol.

320
00:22:10,926 --> 00:22:13,446
Since Yeo Reum pours for me, I'll have a glass.

321
00:22:13,446 --> 00:22:16,486
- Go ahead and pour.
- Yes.

322
00:22:16,486 --> 00:22:19,596
What? I've never seen you drinking, Grandma.

323
00:22:19,596 --> 00:22:22,786
It's because I'm in a good mood today.

324
00:22:22,786 --> 00:22:26,706
It's nice that our house is bustling.

325
00:22:26,706 --> 00:22:29,756
Grandma, don't pour too much for her. She gets drunk really fast.

326
00:22:29,756 --> 00:22:32,643
I must taste it since Grandma poured it for me.

327
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:34,046
Grandma, let's do "cheers."

328
00:22:34,046 --> 00:22:35,936
- I want to do "cheers," too!
- Me, too!

329
00:22:35,936 --> 00:22:39,086
Cheers!

330
00:22:39,086 --> 00:22:41,296
Gyeo Wool, do you want this as well?

331
00:22:43,886 --> 00:22:47,246
Wow, this is so good!

332
00:22:47,246 --> 00:22:48,956
What does it taste like?

333
00:22:48,956 --> 00:22:51,516
How did you make this?

334
00:22:51,516 --> 00:22:54,056
It's top secret.

335
00:22:54,056 --> 00:22:57,835
- She said it's top secret.
- I'm taking this home with me!

336
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:00,806
Noona, did you look around for the house?

337
00:23:00,806 --> 00:23:04,656
I knew rent in Seoul was expensive, but I didn't know it's this expensive.

338
00:23:04,656 --> 00:23:07,606
How do people live here?

339
00:23:07,606 --> 00:23:10,686
Decent places with two bedrooms are ₩700,000-800,000 ($545-625) a month.

340
00:23:10,686 --> 00:23:12,966
But they all require maintenance fee separately.

341
00:23:14,346 --> 00:23:16,906
I did my best and worked hard until now.

342
00:23:16,906 --> 00:23:20,026
But I can't afford to rent a semi-basement suite in Seoul.

343
00:23:22,546 --> 00:23:27,416
Today, I felt less than mere dust in Seoul.

344
00:23:29,846 --> 00:23:32,816
Noona, shall we sit down a second?

345
00:23:32,816 --> 00:23:34,586
Shall we?

346
00:23:38,836 --> 00:23:41,576
Oh, my legs hurt. I walked all day.

347
00:23:41,576 --> 00:23:43,326
- I thought your legs might hurt.
- They do.

348
00:23:43,326 --> 00:23:47,086
If I knew it'd be this hard, I should have signed a contract, no matter the price.

349
00:23:54,486 --> 00:23:56,586
Noona, thank you.

350
00:23:59,256 --> 00:24:03,666
I always thought that way, but I couldn't say it until now.

351
00:24:04,996 --> 00:24:06,786
Sure.

352
00:24:10,236 --> 00:24:13,926
Whenever I had trouble, you always helped me first.

353
00:24:13,926 --> 00:24:16,386
Yes, I did.

354
00:24:16,386 --> 00:24:17,806
And I came here thanks to you.

355
00:24:17,806 --> 00:24:21,956
Okay, I get it. So stop it now.

356
00:24:21,956 --> 00:24:24,146
But, Noona...

357
00:24:25,076 --> 00:24:28,966
I'll return to Angok after finishing this work.

358
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:37,856
I think going back to Angok

359
00:24:37,856 --> 00:24:40,076
is right for me.

360
00:24:45,176 --> 00:24:49,026
Why are you suddenly talking about Angok?

361
00:24:50,086 --> 00:24:53,386
I already discussed this with Professor Lee.

362
00:24:54,386 --> 00:24:57,516
I told him that after this case,

363
00:24:57,516 --> 00:24:59,906
I'll go back home.

364
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:06,348
No, he said he wants to continue working on this project with you.

365
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:10,755
No, you can't.

366
00:25:10,755 --> 00:25:13,296
You can't go back. You must stay here.

367
00:25:17,836 --> 00:25:20,016
Noona,

368
00:25:21,496 --> 00:25:25,010
you were my old friend

369
00:25:25,836 --> 00:25:28,286
and my family a long time.

370
00:25:28,286 --> 00:25:31,866
So please trust me in this case,

371
00:25:31,866 --> 00:25:34,576
as you did until now.

372
00:25:35,846 --> 00:25:38,416
I don't think I can utter numbers

373
00:25:38,416 --> 00:25:42,666
for the rest of my life with people here.

374
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:48,736
Dae Beom, how can you make such a big decision like this?

375
00:25:48,736 --> 00:25:51,676
You should get your Ph.D. and become a professor.

376
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:54,416
Won't it be nice to study for life since you excel at it?

377
00:25:54,416 --> 00:25:57,236
What will you do in Angok?

378
00:25:57,236 --> 00:26:00,486
No, I'll pretend I didn't hear what you said.

379
00:26:00,486 --> 00:26:04,626
You may feel differently tomorrow so we'll discuss it later.

380
00:26:04,626 --> 00:26:09,886
Also, get a place where you can live comfortably.

381
00:26:11,856 --> 00:26:16,996
Now think of yourself first and don't worry about me.

382
00:26:18,626 --> 00:26:20,536
Are you speaking from your heart?

383
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:22,966
Yes.

384
00:26:33,136 --> 00:26:36,476
Do you realize it's the first time you've thanked me?

385
00:26:39,696 --> 00:26:42,746
But it made me feel horrible.

386
00:27:03,626 --> 00:27:05,836
Thank you.

387
00:27:20,226 --> 00:27:23,896
Hey, Bae Jun, play ball outside with your friends.

388
00:27:23,896 --> 00:27:25,396
I have no one to play with right now.

389
00:27:25,396 --> 00:27:27,476
Even if no one will play, take it outside.

390
00:27:27,476 --> 00:27:29,976
You're distracting me.

391
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:53,076
Jun!

392
00:27:53,076 --> 00:27:55,196
Put Hyung Dae Beom on the phone.

393
00:27:55,196 --> 00:27:57,576
This little brat! Say "hello" to me first.

394
00:27:57,576 --> 00:28:00,016
Hyung Dae Beom isn't here.

395
00:28:00,966 --> 00:28:05,440
You went to Seoul with him! Put him on the phone right now.

396
00:28:06,046 --> 00:28:10,796
I said he's not here. He went to work.

397
00:28:10,796 --> 00:28:13,756
Hey, who are you talking to on the phone?

398
00:28:13,756 --> 00:28:16,666
I don't know. She won't put Hyung on the phone.

399
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:23,856
Oh, Ji Young?

400
00:28:23,856 --> 00:28:27,346
It's Seong Min! What are you doing?

401
00:28:28,546 --> 00:28:30,396
Me? Nothing special.

402
00:28:30,396 --> 00:28:34,006
What are you doing? Why are you so drunk? Who are you with?

403
00:28:34,006 --> 00:28:38,516
I'm here... by myself.

404
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:40,556
Where's Dae Beom?

405
00:28:40,556 --> 00:28:45,256
Both you and your son... Why do you guys ask me where Dae Beom is?

406
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:48,076
Excuse me, Miss. Get out of the way.

407
00:28:48,076 --> 00:28:50,106
Did you rent this stairway?

408
00:28:50,106 --> 00:28:53,606
I don't have money to sign a lease.

409
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:55,386
I can't pay monthly rent right now.

410
00:28:55,386 --> 00:28:56,726
What are you saying?

411
00:28:56,726 --> 00:28:59,076
A woman should have a fine drinking habit!

412
00:28:59,076 --> 00:29:00,416
- Get out of my way.
- Hey, you!

413
00:29:00,416 --> 00:29:03,966
- What?
- Jo Ji Young, don't get into a fight.

414
00:29:03,966 --> 00:29:05,976
What did you just say to me?

415
00:29:05,976 --> 00:29:09,676
My getting drunk is one thing, but why mention I'm a woman?

416
00:29:09,676 --> 00:29:12,196
- I don't care about that. Just move.
- Sir!

417
00:29:12,196 --> 00:29:14,316
I'll call the police if you're like that!

418
00:29:14,316 --> 00:29:17,646
This is driving me crazy. Do you know where she is?

419
00:29:17,646 --> 00:29:19,216
I don't know.

420
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:21,126
Seriously! What do I do?

421
00:29:25,676 --> 00:29:30,137
I should have washed all bedding if I knew Yeo Reum would sleep over.

422
00:29:30,137 --> 00:29:31,956
It smells great!

423
00:29:31,956 --> 00:29:33,215
It smells earthy and nice.

424
00:29:33,215 --> 00:29:35,442
Unnie, you are totally drunk!

425
00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:38,339
I knew you drank a lot.

426
00:29:40,564 --> 00:29:46,344
Then I'll sleep next to Grandma tonight!

427
00:29:47,746 --> 00:29:51,096
My grandma will trade us and have you as her granddaughter.

428
00:29:51,096 --> 00:29:54,536
It's not trading but having one more.

429
00:29:54,536 --> 00:29:58,346
Then you are my younger sister from now on, Bom.

430
00:29:58,346 --> 00:30:00,426
- What?
- Come here.

431
00:30:00,426 --> 00:30:02,286
Unnie will give you a hug!

432
00:30:02,286 --> 00:30:05,566
Oh, seriously! Stop it!

433
00:30:05,566 --> 00:30:08,146
You shouldn't be loud at night. Quiet.

434
00:30:08,146 --> 00:30:11,306
It's cold at night so don't kick off your blankets.

435
00:30:11,306 --> 00:30:13,956
If you get thirsty, don't forget to drink some water.

436
00:30:13,956 --> 00:30:15,916
We got it. Grandma, why don't you lie down, too?

437
00:30:15,916 --> 00:30:18,746
Okay. I'll turn off the light.

438
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:23,416
Good night.

439
00:30:23,416 --> 00:30:28,126
Unnie, whenever I wouldn't go to bed, Grandma always told me Gomji would come out.

440
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:30,276
- "Gomji"?
- Yes.

441
00:30:30,276 --> 00:30:32,236
What's "Gomji?"

442
00:30:32,236 --> 00:30:35,046
I have no idea. Grandma, what is "Gomji?"

443
00:30:35,046 --> 00:30:38,736
Gomji will come out. All should sleep now.

444
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:41,006
"Gomji will come out!"

445
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:43,930
- "Gomji will come out."
- "Gomji will come out!"

446
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:45,456
Gomji will come out!

447
00:30:45,456 --> 00:30:48,706
Gomji will come out.

448
00:30:50,546 --> 00:30:54,096
Gomji, Gomji, Gomji.

449
00:30:54,096 --> 00:30:57,606
Stop it! What are you doing?

450
00:31:15,806 --> 00:31:18,616
What the heck am I thinking right now?

451
00:31:44,546 --> 00:31:46,986
- Oh, you surprised me.
- Oh!

452
00:31:46,986 --> 00:31:49,906
- What is it?
- It's Bae Seong Min!

453
00:31:51,053 --> 00:31:53,483
How did you come here?

454
00:31:53,483 --> 00:31:56,453
How can you go around drunk in Seoul City?

455
00:31:56,453 --> 00:31:58,663
How did you come all the way here?

456
00:31:58,663 --> 00:32:01,313
It's really surprising.

457
00:32:01,313 --> 00:32:04,793
Stop saying nonsense and check if this is the correct address for your dorm.

458
00:32:04,793 --> 00:32:08,730
You're amazing! Please give him applause!

459
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,420
Geez.

460
00:32:15,623 --> 00:32:17,838
Seong Min.

461
00:32:17,838 --> 00:32:20,368
I look stupid, don't I?

462
00:32:21,493 --> 00:32:24,623
I bet you can see everything.

463
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:29,805
You can probably tell how stupid I look right now.

464
00:32:31,326 --> 00:32:34,066
I don't understand myself as well.

465
00:32:37,283 --> 00:32:39,683
You can just keep your feelings for him.

466
00:32:42,433 --> 00:32:47,213
A person's heart is like a wild horse; you can't tame it.

467
00:32:47,213 --> 00:32:50,433
So just give in to your feelings.

468
00:32:50,433 --> 00:32:53,683
Also, you really don't have to worry about the other person's feelings.

469
00:32:53,683 --> 00:32:57,423
That's something you don't have to worry about.

470
00:33:00,203 --> 00:33:03,653
Unrequited love has its own advantages.

471
00:33:03,653 --> 00:33:06,843
No matter what the other person feels,

472
00:33:08,093 --> 00:33:10,953
just looking at his face will make you happy.

473
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:18,943
It's not an unrequited love.

474
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:23,893
I'm saying, "Don't hurt your feelings."

475
00:33:29,072 --> 00:33:32,462
All right. I'll be quiet.

476
00:33:39,563 --> 00:33:41,703
I'm so jealous of you, Bom.

477
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:45,473
You have such a wonderful grandmother.

478
00:33:45,473 --> 00:33:48,610
You became her granddaughter today.

479
00:33:49,153 --> 00:33:52,783
I hope you stay around a long time!

480
00:33:53,983 --> 00:33:56,063
I hope so, too.

481
00:33:56,063 --> 00:33:59,843
It would have been nice if Jae Hoon was here with us today.

482
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,535
"Jae Hoon"?

483
00:34:02,535 --> 00:34:05,203
Why would he come here?

484
00:34:05,203 --> 00:34:09,563
Do you think Jae Hoon will go to America when he graduates?

485

Okay.

650
00:45:59,833 --> 00:46:06,074
Then if it's okay, would you walk with me to the bus terminal?

651
00:46:06,074 --> 00:46:07,726
- No.
- Right, you need to go.

Didn't my running improve?

00:46:43,387 --> 00:46:46,127
Yes, really.

659
00:46:48,773 --> 00:46:51,680
Isn't it almost time for you to go?

Yes, it is.

I figured out something this time, thanks to you.

If I go to a deserted island,
