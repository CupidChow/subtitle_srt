No.

Unnie, before sleeping, there's a prayer I say while looking at the ceiling.

First, I think I need a lot of money.

What do you want to do with all that money?

17

I'm going to get an apartment for my grandma.

Yes.

I was sleeping with my parents, but I woke up alone in the middle of the night.

There was a thunderstorm, and it was raining heavily.

00:12:19,011 --> 00:12:24,041
A boy came to the library earlier and said that either you or Bom got injured.

167
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,961
I almost died running after him.

168
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:29,431
Is that so?

169
00:12:29,431 --> 00:12:33,861
But... it was Bom who got injured.

170
00:12:37,371 --> 00:12:39,781
- Ha Neul.
- Grandma.

171
00:12:39,781 --> 00:12:41,461
Come and sit here.

172
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:44,031
Grandma, can I talk to you for a second?

173
00:12:44,031 --> 00:12:46,471
Sure.

174
00:12:58,221 --> 00:13:03,141
If we say my sister did it alone, it's considered self-harm.

175
00:13:03,141 --> 00:13:06,671
And it won't be covered by insurance.

176
00:13:07,531 --> 00:13:11,801
Do you know how much it'll be without the insurance?

177
00:13:11,801 --> 00:13:15,221
With hospitalization fee of a week,

178
00:13:15,221 --> 00:13:17,231
it'll be more than ten million won ($7,600).

179
00:13:17,231 --> 00:13:19,671
"Ten million won"?

180
00:13:19,671 --> 00:13:21,651
What are you talking about it?

181
00:13:21,651 --> 00:13:25,491
Ha Neul, say it so I can understand.

182
00:13:25,491 --> 00:13:28,481
If we say Dad caused the injury,

183
00:13:28,481 --> 00:13:31,591
it's covered by insurance and less than two million won ($1,500).

184
00:13:31,591 --> 00:13:36,071
But... Dad will be arrested.

185
00:13:42,651 --> 00:13:44,441
Why don't we tell them I did it?

186
00:13:44,441 --> 00:13:48,391
Let's say I did it. I can get arrested instead.

187
00:13:48,391 --> 00:13:52,071
Grandma, how can we say you injured her? And who would believe it?

188
00:13:52,071 --> 00:13:55,051
Otherwise, your father will be arrested.

189
00:13:55,051 --> 00:13:58,281
That can't happen, okay?

190
00:13:58,281 --> 00:13:59,911
Ha Neul, please.

191
00:13:59,911 --> 00:14:02,681
Ha Neul. Ha Neul!

192
00:14:02,681 --> 00:14:04,511
Grandma.

193
00:14:10,361 --> 00:14:14,151
Guys! Don't play around. Put the books in place!

194
00:14:14,151 --> 00:14:16,981
Do you mean these books? Where?

195
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,041
Just put them anywhere!

196
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:24,161
You guys! Why are you throwing them on the ground? Stop it!

197
00:14:24,161 --> 00:14:26,642
Hey! What are you guys doing?

198
00:14:26,642 --> 00:14:29,882
All of you, come over here!

199
00:14:32,301 --> 00:14:33,311
Where's Dae Beom?

200
00:14:33,311 --> 00:14:35,291
Hyung? He went to the hospital.

201
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,753
"Hospital"? Why? When?

202
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:41,078
Noona Bom and Noona Yeo Reum got injured. Both Hyungs ran over there.

203
00:14:41,078 --> 00:14:42,613
Really?

204
00:14:42,613 --> 00:14:44,658
Where did she get injured? How badly?

205
00:14:44,658 --> 00:14:48,308
You shouldn't talk loudly in the library.

206
00:14:49,201 --> 00:14:51,171
Hurry and clean this up first.

207
00:14:51,171 --> 00:14:53,531
Don't leave and come over here.

208
00:14:53,531 --> 00:14:55,001
Guys, come over here.

209
00:14:55,001 --> 00:14:58,061
I can't help but speak loudly.

210
00:14:58,061 --> 00:15:00,241
Here you go.

211
00:15:00,241 --> 00:15:02,101
Hey, Guys!

212
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,201
Hey, Bom!

213
00:15:14,451 --> 00:15:15,921
Seong Min, you are here.

214
00:15:15,921 --> 00:15:18,821
Bom, what happened to you?

215
00:15:20,181 --> 00:15:21,781
Is she okay?

216
00:15:21,781 --> 00:15:24,881
The surgery went well; she will be okay.

217
00:15:27,364 --> 00:15:31,041
Why is it so hard to live?

218
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:34,611
Seriously! How can this happen?

219
00:15:34,611 --> 00:15:38,201
Seong Min, why are you crying?

220
00:15:38,201 --> 00:15:41,591
He has been very tenderhearted since young.

221
00:15:41,591 --> 00:15:44,101
Seong Min, it's okay.

222
00:15:44,101 --> 00:15:47,311
Bom's surgery went well; everything's fine.

223
00:15:48,321 --> 00:15:50,381
I'm so sorry,

224
00:15:50,381 --> 00:15:54,151
but after Bom eats dinner, I need to go to my house for a bit.

225
00:15:54,151 --> 00:15:57,951
I rushed here this morning so I didn't bring anything.

226
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,981
Can you stay with her until I come back?

227
00:15:59,981 --> 00:16:02,661
I'll stay here with her tonight.

228
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:06,621
No, you don't have to! I'm already grateful you were here until now.

229
00:16:06,621 --> 00:16:10,051
Grandma, then let me drive you home later.

230
00:16:10,051 --> 00:16:12,151
On the way to your place, I can drop off Yeo Reum.

231
00:16:12,151 --> 00:16:15,391
Can you do that? Thank you.

232
00:16:18,261 --> 00:16:20,941
It'll be uncomfortable for you to sleep in the hospital.

233
00:16:20,941 --> 00:16:22,831
It's okay.

234
00:16:22,831 --> 00:16:26,101
I should be there when Bom wakes up.

235
00:16:26,101 --> 00:16:29,461
Then I'll let you do so only tonight.

236
00:16:29,461 --> 00:16:33,021
Thank you so much.

237
00:16:33,021 --> 00:16:35,341
Thanks for the slippers as well.

238
00:16:35,341 --> 00:16:38,691
You are such a kindhearted young woman.

239
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:45,551
Please don't worry too much.

240
00:16:46,551 --> 00:16:49,361
I don't know what to do.

241
00:16:49,361 --> 00:16:53,051
Bom is my granddaughter.

242
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:56,981
And her dad is my son.

243
00:16:58,731 --> 00:17:01,141
How did this happen?

244
00:17:22,571 --> 00:17:25,791
Why are you sitting outside?

245
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,561
Are you hungry?

246
00:17:27,561 --> 00:17:29,611
Give me a minute.

247
00:17:29,611 --> 00:17:31,641
How is Bom?

248
00:17:31,641 --> 00:17:34,811
The surgery went well.

249
00:17:34,811 --> 00:17:37,601
- Mom.
- Yes?

250
00:17:37,601 --> 00:17:40,241
Can you send me to rehab?

251
00:17:41,231 --> 00:17:43,201
What?

252
00:17:43,201 --> 00:17:45,541
I want to quit drinking.

253
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,261
Good idea.

254
00:17:47,261 --> 00:17:49,851
Please stop drinking from now on.

255
00:17:49,851 --> 00:17:52,411
All will be fine if you quit drinking.

256
00:17:52,411 --> 00:17:55,351
- Seong Min.
- Yes?

257
00:17:55,351 --> 00:17:58,001
Can you take me to rehab?

258
00:17:58,001 --> 00:18:00,501
Hyung, you made a great decision.

259
00:18:00,501 --> 00:18:02,311
You've made a great choice.

260
00:18:02,311 --> 00:18:06,431
Okay, I get it. Let's eat first.

261
00:18:06,431 --> 00:18:08,401
You made a great decision.

262
00:18:08,401 --> 00:18:11,411
I'll look into rehab and everything.

263
00:18:11,411 --> 00:18:15,411
You can completely fix that these days.

264
00:18:15,411 --> 00:18:17,451
It's okay.

265
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:35,561
You must have been hungry.

266
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:39,951
You are a good dog.

267
00:18:39,951 --> 00:18:42,351
You didn't poop the whole day.

268
00:18:42,351 --> 00:18:44,881
Let's go for a walk after you eat.

269
00:18:50,511 --> 00:18:51,991
Mr. Librarian?

270
00:18:51,991 --> 00:18:55,101
I thought you were at the hospital.

271
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:58,961
Bom's grandmother will stay there tonight.

272
00:19:01,111 --> 00:19:03,721
I guess you were walking your dog.

273
00:19:03,721 --> 00:19:08,101
Yes, because Gyeo Wool was alone the whole day today.

274
00:19:08,101 --> 00:19:12,051
Is it Gyeo Wool, or Yeo Reum and Gyeo Wool?

275
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:15,671
Well, I didn't name the dog.

276
00:19:15,671 --> 00:19:18,151
Bom chose that name.

277
00:19:23,981 --> 00:19:28,281
Are you getting off work?

278
00:19:32,391 --> 00:19:35,081
I wanted to give these to you.

279
00:19:35,081 --> 00:19:36,401
What are these?

280
00:19:36,401 --> 00:19:39,991
I thought maybe you couldn't come to the library for a while.

281
00:19:42,361 --> 00:19:44,581
Thank you.

282
00:19:44,581 --> 00:19:48,371
Will you go see Bom every day from now on?

283
00:19:48,371 --> 00:19:50,951
Yes, I will.

284
00:19:55,761 --> 00:20:00,221
Then what if I take care of Gyeo Wool for the time being?

285
00:20:00,221 --> 00:20:01,371
Pardon?

286
00:20:01,371 --> 00:20:04,361
I'll let him stay in the library's front yard during the day.

287
00:20:04,361 --> 00:20:06,721
But still...

288
00:20:08,691 --> 00:20:13,401
But you can't take the dog to the hospital.

289
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,700
Come.

290
00:20:28,081 --> 00:20:29,451
Ahn Dae Beom!

291
00:20:29,451 --> 00:20:31,191
Professor.

292
00:20:31,191 --> 00:20:32,911
I came so late, right?

293
00:20:32,911 --> 00:20:35,341
What brings you all the way here, Professor?

294
00:20:35,341 --> 00:20:38,431
That lady told me your address. You are very cool.

295
00:20:38,431 --> 00:20:41,451
How can you live without a cell phone?

296
00:20:41,451 --> 00:20:44,781
Your house somehow looks like you.

297
00:20:44,781 --> 00:20:47,101
The plainness is similar.

298
00:20:49,031 --> 00:20:52,161
You also have a puppy!

299
00:20:52,161 --> 00:20:58,681
Aren't you curious why I want to see you so badly all of a sudden?

300
00:20:58,681 --> 00:21:00,921
Hawking radiation,

301
00:21:00,921 --> 00:21:02,961
Penrose singularity theorem,

302
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:07,111
isn't it cool to have a theory with your own name on it?

303
00:21:07,111 --> 00:21:08,371
- One second.
- Professor.

304
00:21:08,371 --> 00:21:10,451
Yes, give me one second.

305
00:21:14,651 --> 00:21:16,541
- Wait, Professor.
- One second.

306
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,161
Professor.

307
00:21:21,301 --> 00:21:24,891
This will be the first formula in Korea to become like that.

308
00:21:24,891 --> 00:21:26,751
You told me this is correct.

309
00:21:26,751 --> 00:21:29,440
And I thought this was wrong.

310
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,661
No, I thought it had to be wrong.

311
00:21:32,661 --> 00:21:34,721
Last month,

312
00:21:36,311 --> 00:21:39,061
a team of Dutch professors announced this.

313
00:21:39,061 --> 00:21:42,181
It shows you were right, and I was wrong.

314
00:21:43,461 --> 00:21:49,741
But they only partially proved it, not fully.

315
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:51,491
How does it sound?

316
00:21:51,491 --> 00:21:53,611
Why don't we work on it together?

317
00:21:53,611 --> 00:21:55,451
Let's surprise the world.

318
00:21:55,451 --> 00:21:57,451
Professor, I'm sorry, but...

319
00:21:57,451 --> 00:22:00,011
I get it. I get it.

320
00:22:00,011 --> 00:22:01,591
No need to answer right now.

321
00:22:01,591 --> 00:22:04,141
Take your time and think about it,

322
00:22:04,141 --> 00:22:07,211
since there is time while you're away.

323
00:22:07,211 --> 00:22:10,021
But read this when you get a chance.

324
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:14,971
Why do I have to do that?

325
00:22:14,971 --> 00:22:18,431
I won't do it. I'll never forgive him!

326
00:22:19,081 --> 00:22:20,931
But still, Bom.

327
00:22:20,931 --> 00:22:23,591
Please forgive him for me.

328
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:28,101
I'm going to tell them the truth!

329
00:22:28,921 --> 00:22:32,061
Bom, you can't do that. Then your father will be...

330
00:22:32,061 --> 00:22:35,831
No, I don't want to! Why do I have to do that?

331
00:22:35,831 --> 00:22:38,651
Bom, what if your wound opens up?

332
00:22:38,651 --> 00:22:42,531
Let him go to prison! Arrest him now!

333
00:22:42,531 --> 00:22:45,921
Seriously, it's not fair!

334
00:22:45,921 --> 00:22:48,211
Noona, how can you only think of yourself?

335
00:22:48,211 --> 00:22:50,161
How would Grandma feel if that happens to Dad?

336
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:53,641
So what? I don't care about anything anymore.

337
00:22:53,641 --> 00:22:57,051
You all go to h*ll! Why must I do that?

338
00:22:57,051 --> 00:22:58,721
Kim Bom!

339
00:22:58,721 --> 00:23:01,721
How can you say that in front of your grandmother?

340
00:23:14,731 --> 00:23:16,311
Please, drink this.

341
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:18,321
Thank you.

342
00:23:18,991 --> 00:23:22,161
She didn't mean anything by what she said.

343
00:23:22,161 --> 00:23:24,241
Of course, I know.

344
00:23:25,281 --> 00:23:28,081
I'm sorry,

345
00:23:28,081 --> 00:23:31,301
but can you come with me for a second right now?

346
00:23:31,301 --> 00:23:33,071
Yes, of course.

347
00:23:33,661 --> 00:23:36,481
Give me your paw! Oh, the puppy gave the paw to me!

348
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:40,031
Paw! Oh, the puppy does give you the paw!

349
00:23:40,031 --> 00:23:42,911
Are you guys bringing a dog to the library now?

350
00:23:42,911 --> 00:23:45,341
So what?

351
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:49,671
It's not about you being sulky, but you can't bring a dog to the library.

352
00:23:49,671 --> 00:23:52,061
- Cute little puppy!
- Stop bothering the puppy.

353
00:23:52,061 --> 00:23:53,431
- Let the dog go!
- No, I don't want to.

354
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:55,131
Are you taking good care of the puppy?

355
00:23:55,131 --> 00:23:56,811
Hyung, what's the puppy's name?

356
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:58,471
It's Gyeo Wool.

357
00:23:58,471 --> 00:24:00,231
Gyeo Wool!

358
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:01,761
Dae Beom, what's going on?

359
00:24:01,761 --> 00:24:04,781
I decided to take care of the dog for a while.

360
00:24:04,781 --> 00:24:06,571
- Did you?
- Isn't he eating well?

361
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:09,371
- Whose dog is it?
- You pat him gently.

362
00:24:09,371 --> 00:24:11,201
Isn't he cute?

363
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:14,621
He's so fluffy!

364
00:24:20,011 --> 00:24:23,321
Please fill out the form where I marked it.

365
00:24:24,961 --> 00:24:28,701
You can fill in places that I highlighted.

366
00:24:33,231 --> 00:24:35,041
It's hard to see it, isn't it?

367
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:36,941
I'll write it for you.

368
00:24:36,941 --> 00:24:39,441
Will you do that for me?

369
00:24:39,441 --> 00:24:42,121
There is a magnifying glass at the front desk.

370
00:24:42,121 --> 00:24:45,251
No, I'll write it for her.

371
00:24:45,941 --> 00:24:48,651
Jung Myeong Sook.

372
00:24:49,841 --> 00:24:53,311
How much loan can she get?

373
00:24:53,311 --> 00:24:55,561
Give me one second, please.

374
00:24:57,011 --> 00:24:59,521
What is this? Grandmother,

375
00:24:59,521 --> 00:25:03,321
why are you taking out another loan when you already have so much collateral loan?

376
00:25:03,321 --> 00:25:06,891
My son would have paid back all that before.

377
00:25:06,891 --> 00:25:08,791
It's not paid back at all!

378
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:11,361
With this house, you can't get any more loans.

379
00:25:11,361 --> 00:25:14,381
You already took out as much as you could.

380
00:25:22,891 --> 00:25:26,570
Yeo Reum owes you a lot.

381
00:25:28,551 --> 00:25:31,501
I suggested I'd take care of the dog.

382
00:25:33,681 --> 00:25:35,111
Really?

383
00:25:35,851 --> 00:25:40,071
I don't know where else I can borrow money.

384
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:42,301
I'll look into it as well.

385
00:25:42,301 --> 00:25:45,421
I'm so sorry to burden you.

386
00:25:45,421 --> 00:25:47,771
- No, it's okay.
- I promise, I only used this once.

387
00:25:47,771 --> 00:25:50,291
- It's basically a new product.
- Jae Hoon.

388
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:52,141
Wait one second. Hello.

389
00:25:52,141 --> 00:25:56,711
- Why are you out here?
- There are guests in there.

390
00:25:56,711 --> 00:25:58,251
Grandma.

391
00:25:58,251 --> 00:26:01,151
The doctor came by earlier today.

392
00:26:01,151 --> 00:26:04,931
And Bom told him that she got injured due to her own mistake.

393
00:26:04,931 --> 00:26:07,731
Oh, my baby. My poor baby!

394
00:26:07,731 --> 00:26:11,290
[Angok Hospital]

395
00:26:12,131 --> 00:26:15,371
I'm glad it's not worse than this.

396
00:26:15,371 --> 00:26:17,581
Here, please have some.

397
00:26:19,731 --> 00:26:21,241
Why don't you eat it?

398
00:26:21,241 --> 00:26:23,151
Here, hand that to me.

399
00:26:24,991 --> 00:26:26,891
You didn't have an appendectomy.

400
00:26:26,891 --> 00:26:29,951
Weren't you scared getting anesthesia?

401
00:26:29,951 --> 00:26:31,721
No.

402
00:26:31,721 --> 00:26:35,731
Did her father get into rehab without any issues?

403
00:26:35,731 --> 00:26:37,561
Oh, yes.

404
00:26:37,561 --> 00:26:41,211
What is she talking about? "Rehab"?

405
00:26:41,211 --> 00:26:42,691
Your dad...

406
00:26:42,691 --> 00:26:45,711
He never listened to me when I begged him to go to rehab.

407
00:26:45,711 --> 00:26:48,931
Why now? Did it freak him out this time?

408
00:26:48,931 --> 00:26:52,591
How can you say that about your own father?

409
00:26:53,761 --> 00:26:56,841
Oh, Hyungnim!

410
00:26:56,841 --> 00:26:58,891
How are you?

411
00:26:59,471 --> 00:27:00,911
Seong Min.

412
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:04,191
Don't worry. He went into rehab with no issues.

413
00:27:04,191 --> 00:27:05,911
Thank you.

414
00:27:05,911 --> 00:27:09,311
I always owe you so much. Thank you.

415
00:27:09,311 --> 00:27:12,721
Please don't say it. The government runs that place so don't worry about money.

416
00:27:12,721 --> 00:27:16,151
- Please don't worry.
- That's great.

417
00:27:19,021 --> 00:27:21,161
Bom.

418
00:27:21,161 --> 00:27:23,641
I'm sorry.

419
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:25,791
My poor baby.

420
00:27:28,831 --> 00:27:32,251
I'm so thankful and sorry to you.

421
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:36,511
Please calm down.

422
00:27:36,511 --> 00:27:41,071
Only good things will happen from now on.

423
00:27:49,021 --> 00:27:50,621
Unnie.

424
00:27:52,031 --> 00:27:53,441
Yes?

425
00:27:54,191 --> 00:27:58,041
You've seen everything about my life.

426
00:27:58,781 --> 00:28:00,701
I guess so.

427
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:04,751
It's terrible.

428
00:28:08,601 --> 00:28:12,291
I already saw it all so there is nothing to do.

429
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:16,441
I really didn't want you to see my dad.

430
00:28:21,061 --> 00:28:23,631
You asked me before

431
00:28:23,631 --> 00:28:26,421
of a time I want to return to.

432
00:28:33,246 --> 00:28:36,051
When I was young,

433
00:28:36,051 --> 00:28:40,051
Ha Neul and I counted down and waited for the day

434
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,741
when Dad would come home.

435
00:28:42,741 --> 00:28:44,330
- I'm home!
- Dad!

436
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,160
Dad!

437
00:28:47,352 --> 00:28:50,930
My dad worked in a different town

438
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:54,160
and came home once or twice a year.

439
00:28:54,741 --> 00:28:59,011
More than the holidays,

440
00:28:59,011 --> 00:29:01,501
even more than my birthday,

441
00:29:01,501 --> 00:29:04,021
I liked that day most.

442
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:14,991
Those b*stards!

443
00:29:14,991 --> 00:29:17,241
Do they think I'm a pushover?

444
00:29:17,241 --> 00:29:20,161
You are all dead now. Where is it?

445
00:29:20,751 --> 00:29:22,991
- What are you doing right now?
- I'll kill them all.

446
00:29:22,991 --> 00:29:24,591
What are you doing?

447
00:29:24,591 --> 00:29:26,221
What the heck are you doing, Dad?

448
00:29:26,221 --> 00:29:28,331
- Bom!
- Stop it!

449
00:29:28,331 --> 00:29:30,441
Let it go! Let go!

450
00:29:30,441 --> 00:29:34,691
I said, let go of this!

451
00:29:40,191 --> 00:29:44,191
I liked going to a comic book cafe with my dad.

452
00:29:47,071 --> 00:29:48,801
But...

453
00:29:49,911 --> 00:29:53,731
it's not because I liked reading comic books,

454
00:29:56,121 --> 00:29:58,171
but because...

455
00:29:59,691 --> 00:30:02,901
I liked holding hands with my dad on the way there.

456
00:30:34,681 --> 00:30:36,831
What the heck are you doing, you b*stard?

457
00:30:36,831 --> 00:30:38,451
Hurry and take her to the hospital!

458
00:30:38,451 --> 00:30:40,221
Put her on your back.

459
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:43,261
Oh, no! Ha Neul, you forgot your shoes!

460
00:30:43,261 --> 00:30:45,851
- That's how it was.
- Ha Neul, your shoes!

461
00:30:45,851 --> 00:30:49,561
My dad used to be like that.

462
00:30:56,831 --> 00:30:58,511
Bom.

463
00:31:00,381 --> 00:31:02,471
You have to get better soon.

464
00:31:02,471 --> 00:31:05,031
So you should eat well.

465
00:31:05,031 --> 00:31:07,391
What should I do about the hospital bill?

466
00:31:07,391 --> 00:31:10,771
You don't have to worry about that.

467
00:31:10,771 --> 00:31:14,531
Should I just tell them the truth?

468
00:31:14,531 --> 00:31:18,401
I have no idea what to do.

469
00:31:18,401 --> 00:31:21,921
It's so frustrating; it's driving me crazy.

470
00:31:46,801 --> 00:31:49,831
I'm talking about Bom, Kim Bom. You know, Jung Hoon's daughter.

471
00:31:49,831 --> 00:31:54,931
It's about her hospital bill. Why don't we talk about it over a meal this week?

472
00:31:54,931 --> 00:31:58,361
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

473
00:31:58,361 --> 00:32:02,481
I know he sold a piece of land recently, but this cheapskate...

474
00:32:02,481 --> 00:32:06,121
How can everyone here care less than an outsider?

475
00:32:06,121 --> 00:32:08,911
Let's see, who else is there?

476
00:32:12,511 --> 00:32:14,911
Well, I was wondering...

477
00:32:14,911 --> 00:32:19,881
Would it be possible for me to get the yearly rent back?

478
00:32:19,881 --> 00:32:23,771
What? Wh-Why do you ask about the yearly rent?

479
00:32:23,771 --> 00:32:27,031
I can move out immediately if you give me the money.

480
00:32:27,031 --> 00:32:31,931
You were quite stubborn when I tried to kick you out.

481
00:32:33,281 --> 00:32:37,331
Is it because of Bom's hospital bill?

482
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:39,561
No, it's not.

483
00:32:39,561 --> 00:32:42,111
I got it right.

484
00:32:43,101 --> 00:32:47,501
As for the yearly rent, I'd need to talk to my father.

485
00:32:47,501 --> 00:32:50,741
So let's talk about it tomorrow at the hospital.

486
00:32:50,741 --> 00:32:52,541
Okay.

487
00:32:52,541 --> 00:32:54,291
I'll look forward to a positive answer.

488
00:32:54,291 --> 00:32:56,111
All right.

489
00:32:56,111 --> 00:32:58,211
Thank you.

490
00:33:12,641 --> 00:33:16,610
Gyeo Wool! I'm here!

491
00:33:18,561 --> 00:33:20,751
Have you waited for me a long time?

492
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:23,051

He was asking if I would sell the building to him.

00:43:57,891 --> 00:44:00,741
Seriously! I can't see.

657
00:44:00,741 --> 00:44:02,231
Are you okay?

658
00:44:02,231 --> 00:44:04,191
Do you want me to kill you, Heo Jae Hoon?

659
00:44:04,191 --> 00:44:06,941
I think you need to wash your face.

660
00:44:07,861 --> 00:44:09,431
Can you see now?

661
00:44:09,431 --> 00:44:13,011
This is all from my store. Isn't it amazing?

662
00:44:13,011 --> 00:44:16,591
It's a rooftop party. How is it?

663
00:44:16,591 --> 00:44:19,031
Did you prepare all this on your own?

664
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,701
Of course! We did it all.

665
00:44:20,701 --> 00:44:24,941
We gathered earlier and prepared everything.

666
00:44:26,721 --> 00:44:28,931
By the way, what's in your hand?

667
00:44:28,931 --> 00:44:31,611
I bought fried chicken because I heard Unnie likes it.

668
00:44:31,611 --> 00:44:33,911
- Really?
- You can't eat fried chicken right now.

669
00:44:33,911 --> 00:44:37,141
You just got out of the hospital. You shouldn't eat fried things.

670
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:39,041
Why not eat what I cooked?

671
00:44:39,041 --> 00:44:40,681
What did you prepare?

672
00:44:40,681 --> 00:44:44,371
I made chicken noodle soup. In America, you eat that when you're sick.

673
00:44:44,371 --> 00:44:45,941
You were just discharged so have some.

674
00:44:45,941 --> 00:44:48,741
- If it's chicken, let's just eat fried chicken!
- No, it's not the same.

675
00:44:48,741 --> 00:44:50,961
- Let me eat that.
- Noona, you can't eat it, either. I'll throw it away.

676
00:44:50,961 --> 00:44:53,171
- None of us should eat this.
- No!

677
00:44:53,171 --> 00:44:54,561
Oh, no!

678
00:44:54,561 --> 00:44:57,741
What a crazy punk! You really can't do this.

679
00:44:57,741 --> 00:45:00,351
- I told you not to eat that!
- What a waste of food!

680
00:45:00,351 --> 00:45:02,731
Heo Jae Hoon!

681
00:45:29,311 --> 00:45:32,751
This is good for your liver so eat all of it.

682
00:45:32,751 --> 00:45:37,101
Seriously, Heo Jae Hoon. I'm tolerating you as today is a good day.

683
00:45:40,251 --> 00:45:42,491
- Unnie.
- Yes?

684
00:45:42,491 --> 00:45:45,971
Actually, I've never had something like this in my life.

685
00:45:45,971 --> 00:45:48,141
- Really?
- Yes.

686
00:45:49,001 --> 00:45:50,341
Actually, me, too.

687
00:45:50,341 --> 00:45:52,791
- Really?
- Yes.

688
00:45:54,211 --> 00:45:56,091
Well...

689
00:45:56,091 --> 00:45:58,331
Thank you, Unnie.

690
00:45:59,261 --> 00:46:03,581
I didn't do anything besides provide the space.

691
00:46:03,581 --> 00:46:07,091
I'll pay back everything, no matter what happens.

692
00:46:07,091 --> 00:46:11,681
My grandma also said she'd provide your kimchi forever.

693
00:46:15,381 --> 00:46:18,391
It really wasn't me.

694
00:46:19,341 --> 00:46:22,891
Coke for parties! Here you go!

695
00:46:22,891 --> 00:46:25,741
I thought it was him the whole time.

696
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:28,491
What? What is it?

697
00:46:28,491 --> 00:46:30,021
Does someone have a crush on me?

698
00:46:30,021 --> 00:46:31,481
I don't think it's him.

699
00:46:31,481 --> 00:46:33,791
Unnie, you aren't really pretending, are you?

700
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:36,931
- I'm really not the one.
- Why? Who has a crush on me?

701
00:46:36,931 --> 00:46:41,681
The chicken noodle soup is here!

702
00:46:43,781 --> 00:46:46,811
But when are they coming? The food is ready.

703
00:46:46,811 --> 00:46:49,601
- What? Who else is coming?
- Hyung Dae Beom.

704
00:46:49,601 --> 00:46:51,971
I told him we would have a party here tonight.

705
00:46:51,971 --> 00:46:54,871
What are you talking about? Dae Beom went to Seoul with Ji Young today.

706
00:46:54,871 --> 00:46:57,901
Really? He should have come here instead.

707
00:46:57,901 --> 00:47:02,661
I know. Dae Beom and Ji Young go around together all the time.

708
00:47:02,661 --> 00:47:07,331
Honestly, I'm a better driver than Dae Beom. Don't you agree?

709
00:47:07,331 --> 00:47:09,901
But why are you asking me that?

710
00:47:11,101 --> 00:47:14,011
Hey, so is this the soup you mentioned?

711
00:47:14,011 --> 00:47:15,471
Yes, the chicken noodle soup.

712
00:47:15,471 --> 00:47:16,911
It looks a bit odd.

713
00:47:16,911 --> 00:47:20,591
Isn't it like Korean chicken soup with Kalguksu (hand-cut) noodles?

714
00:47:20,591 --> 00:47:24,821
He's right! Isn't this basically the same except for pasta noodles?

715
00:47:24,821 --> 00:47:26,680
Okay, I'll just throw this away as well.

716
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,860
No!

717
00:47:29,561 --> 00:47:31,371
Dae Beom.

718
00:47:31,371 --> 00:47:35,711
I still don't know much about you.

719
00:47:37,381 --> 00:47:39,461
What are you talking about?

720
00:47:40,491 --> 00:47:43,091
How was your interview? Did it go well?

721
00:47:43,091 --> 00:47:46,181
No, my interview is not important right now.

722
00:47:46,181 --> 00:47:51,151
I thought you were a different person when you were solving the equation with the professor.

723
00:47:51,151 --> 00:47:53,261
You are not someone to stay in Angok.

724
00:47:53,261 --> 00:47:57,571
I'm totally an Angok person.

725
00:47:57,571 --> 00:47:59,521
My surname is even "Ahn."

726
00:48:00,271 --> 00:48:04,521
I sometimes looked down on you.

727
00:48:04,521 --> 00:48:07,901
I'm very ashamed of myself for doing that.

728
00:48:07,901 --> 00:48:10,531
But that's why I like you.

729
00:48:10,531 --> 00:48:13,731
Hey, don't make fun of me.

730
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:21,741
I'm so full!

731
00:48:21,741 --> 00:48:23,341
This food is very good!

732
00:48:23,341 --> 00:48:24,941
Heo Jae Hoon, it's tastier than I thought.

733
00:48:24,941 --> 00:48:28,061
- I said it's good.
- I agree now.

734
00:48:28,061 --> 00:48:29,521
- Shall we clean up?
- Yes, let's do it.

735
00:48:29,521 --> 00:48:31,001
Wait, stop!

736
00:48:31,001 --> 00:48:33,871
Everyone is full so we must digest, right?

737
00:48:33,871 --> 00:48:35,831
Yes, we need to digest it!

738
00:48:35,831 --> 00:48:37,311
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

739
00:48:37,311 --> 00:48:39,241
- Really?
- It's party time!

740
00:48:39,241 --> 00:48:42,531
I guess the two prepared something.

741
00:48:46,071 --> 00:48:48,221
What is he doing?

742
00:48:48,221 --> 00:48:50,651
- A round of applause, please!
- It's crazy.

743
00:48:50,651 --> 00:48:53,511
One, two, three. Let's go!

744
00:48:54,651 --> 00:48:57,211
You're a good dancer! No, I'm okay.

745
00:48:57,211 --> 00:48:59,231
You should go onstage, too!

746
00:48:59,231 --> 00:49:01,781
Then let's dance together.

747
00:49:03,881 --> 00:49:06,871
This is a present for you!

748
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:10,041
It's so pretty!

749
00:49:13,821 --> 00:49:16,451
- Unnie.
- Yes?

750
00:49:16,451 --> 00:49:18,301
Thank you.

751
00:49:18,301 --> 00:49:20,631
I told you. It's not me.

752
00:49:21,301 --> 00:49:26,281
Thanks to you, I like the present a little bit.

753
00:49:27,291 --> 00:49:29,331
Really?

754
00:49:29,331 --> 00:49:30,881
Yes.

755
00:49:32,891 --> 00:49:35,311
What are you doing over there? Come here!

756

♫ Will everyone still fall away? ♫

757
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:52,590
♫ I fall in love. Should I try hard not to? ♫

♫ Everyone knows I'm in love ♫

759

♫ Could you let me know? ♫

760

[Summer Strike]

766
00:50:43,435 --> 00:50:45,991
Shall we meet in front of the library daily and go jogging?

767
00:50:45,991 --> 00:50:48,186
- Shall we go to a movie?
- And fried chicken and beer?

768
00:50:48,186 --> 00:50:49,833
Noona, that hurts.

769
00:50:49,833 --> 00:50:52,508
I feel like I'm getting hurt by you as well.

770
00:50:52,508 --> 00:50:55,656
Trauma isn't easily forgotten; the body is smarter than you think.
[I know you're the one who killed Seon Ah.]

771
00:50:55,656 --> 00:50:56,631
Dae Beom!

772
00:50:56,631 --> 00:50:59,741
He tried his best to endure with all his strength.

773
00:50:59,741 --> 00:51:01,721
But that all collapsed today.

774
00:51:01,721 --> 00:51:04,481
Can you take responsibility for Dae Beom's life?

775
00:51:04,481 --> 00:51:06,141
I can do it.

776
00:51:06,141 --> 00:51:09,653
For you, it might be just a summer fling in a beach town,

777
00:51:09,653 --> 00:51:12,383
but my relationship with Dae Beom is different.
