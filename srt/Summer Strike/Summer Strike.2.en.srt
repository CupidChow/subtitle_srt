But is she a nice person?

166
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:44,632
Yes, she looks like a very sincere person.

167
00:14:44,632 --> 00:14:49,542
But what if she hears about the rumor later?

168
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:11,263
Those areas like Yang Yang boomed since young people moved there!

169
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:15,846
You know how much their rentals and land prices rose.

170

Hey, Brat! Where the heck did you go? You were supposed to look after the store.

I just went to Hyung Chang Soo's place for a minute.

What brings you here, Sir?

173
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,989
I just had to talk to your father about something.

174
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:34,114
Seong Min, I don't think we can sell that building to Chang Soo.

175
00:16:34,114 --> 00:16:37,649
My goodness! Father!

176
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:40,034
Are you out of your mind?

177
00:16:40,034 --> 00:16:43,209
I'm on my way back from persuading Hyung Chang Soo.

178
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:46,281
He'll sign the contract this week and already prepared the deposit.

179
00:16:46,281 --> 00:16:48,008
That's right, the contract!

180
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:52,013
We haven't signed the contract yet! So if the owner changes his mind, then it won't happen.

181
00:16:52,013 --> 00:16:54,573
He's right. You need a signed contract to have legal effect.

182

Please stay out of this, Ahjussi!

183
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:02,570
After listening to Mr. Kwak, I realized it would be a huge loss if I sold it at that price.

184
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:06,652
Father, do you remember how long that building has been empty?

185
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:10,197
Why don't you go over there with Mr. Kwak right now?

186
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:14,250
- Go where?
- Go to the billiards and sign the contract.

187
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,930
I heard a good fridge came out in the town market so I must get it.

- Look over there!
- What?

194
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,903
My goodness! W-Who are you?

195
00:17:40,903 --> 00:17:44,278
I'm here to see the room to rent. Who are you?

Seriously!

199

Hey! How can you get a tenant when you said we could come in and measure the space?

200
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:01,160
No, it's not like that. I also just found out about this.

Let's talk outside. Shall we?

Talk about what? Just say it right here!

203
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,280
Chang Soo, there's a customer here so...

204
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,210
- What? A customer?
- Sister!

205

There's nothing to worry about! Let's go outside.

No, I'm also surprised!

Are you okay?

I bet you are startled.

- Stop pushing me! I'll walk on my own.

Hey, who's that woman?

216
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,604
What do you mean by a customer? Why?

217
00:18:40,604 --> 00:18:44,370
Is your father selling the building to that woman for a few more bucks?

218
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:47,250
Listen, that woman is here to see the space to rent.

219
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,620
Do you think it makes sense? That's why I'm saying don't worry!

220
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:53,800
But why did you put the space for rent without our permission?

221
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,120
Do you think that makes any sense?

222

I never put the room for rent. And I'm not planning to do so!

My father did all this! So I'm saying...

Why are they shouting so much?

No, no, not at all!

You say you are moving here, but do you even know what kind of place this is?

244
00:20:06,482 --> 00:20:08,692
This building has been empty for twenty years.

245
00:20:08,692 --> 00:20:10,419
Why do you think that is?

"For twenty years"?

Will you really act like this? It's all settled with your father already.

- You said she's going to rent the room!
- What's going on?

249

It's of no concern.

250

What do you mean, of no concern?

251
00:20:24,109 --> 00:20:27,040
- A person died in here before.
- What?

252
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,463
Can you live in a place where someone died? I could never do that!

Well, it's completely up to you.

- What did you just say?
- ₩50,000?

269
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,280
Why would I show you this space if it didn't have that advantage?

270
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,170
Wait, do you think that price makes sense right now?

271

Take care.

Excuse me.

324

Thank you for telling me that story first.

325
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:54,920
If I had heard it later, it would have been scarier.

326
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:58,030
Whatever.

327
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:01,980
If something breaks down, you fix it on your own.

328
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:07,020
If you can't live there anymore, move out anytime. Okay?

329
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,560
Yes.

330
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,840
I got a place to live.

331
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:20,710
After quitting my job,

332
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:24,650
I lay in bed for two whole days.

333
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,488
I was afraid.

334
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:33,320
I didn't know what to do at all.

335
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:42,420
So first, I decided to leave Seoul.

336
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:46,800
Because this city is overwhelming for a jobless person like me.

337
00:26:00,545 --> 00:26:05,960
I threw out my ex-boyfriend's stuff that I couldn't touch until then.

338
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:16,600
And I decided to keep only things that fit in one backpack.

339
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:22,610
When I started organizing stuff, I realized how much I had bought.

340
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:25,990
I thoughtlessly bought mugs that were pretty,

341
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:29,810
plus dishes I used only once for the housewarming party.

342
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,840
Clothes I didn't even know existed after buying them,

343
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,950
and cheap shoes I kept buying as habit from shop stalls,

344
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:46,640
I picked one of each category that I absolutely needed.

345
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,840
The competition was fiercer than a big company's interview.

346
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:56,090
Things I didn't need were instantly sold when I put them in the online market.

347
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:03,070
Goodbye.

348
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:05,950
Goodbye to my six-pyeong (215 sq ft) life.

349

I guess he can't speak.

489
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:33,320
But why didn't you wake me up?

490
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,170
Dae Beom, I'll head out first.

491

Clean up and go, okay?

Thank you. See you tomorrow!

494
00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:00,290
You must have tried to wake me.

495
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,710
You should have some sleep.

[If you want to read some books, you can go to the far right by the window.]

Mr. Librarian?

Oh, it hurts.

Wait, Mr. Librarian.

505
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:20,530
I don't think you have to roll any further.

506
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:28,050
I just wanted to give this back to you.

507

That's what I was going to do.

508

I'll use this until the morning and give it back to you.

Good night.

I'm sorry, but...

511
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:58,060
Where can I find the restroom?

512
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:11,490
[The restroom is outside of the doors.]

513
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:17,900
Why did he give me water to drink when the restroom was outside locked doors?

514
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,780
Now I think of it, he didn't drink and just gave it to me.

515
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:23,480
No, no. Let's not think about it.

516

Let's not even think about wanting to go to the bathroom.

517

It's almost that time.

00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:07,550
It's almost 8 o'clock.

519
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:10,780
Let's hold it in a little more.

520
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:18,120
Just a bit more...

521
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:21,920
Please.

522
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:36,280
I can't let my guard down at the very end.

523
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,440
I shouldn't run.

524
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:41,480
Nothing can stop this if it starts.

What is he doing?

Your bag.

Tell me!

00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:10,426
How much did she drink for her to fall asleep in the library?

You two. Why did you stay here overnight with her?

You can't even speak in front of a stranger.

Why don't you go home for a shower? Also, take this home with you.

My mom said she made some ginseng extract.

That's how my mom is pursuing you.

Of course, he would have heard everything.
