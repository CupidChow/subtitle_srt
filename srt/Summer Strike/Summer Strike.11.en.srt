00:18:30,436 --> 00:18:32,246
No.

172
00:18:34,016 --> 00:18:37,586
That puts me in an awkward position.

173
00:18:37,586 --> 00:18:40,566
I somehow got into a position

174
00:18:40,566 --> 00:18:44,396
where I took over this building.

175
00:18:44,396 --> 00:18:49,326
So I'd like you to vacate this place now.

176
00:18:53,056 --> 00:18:56,016
I'll pay back your yearly rent in full.

177
00:18:56,016 --> 00:18:59,120
Or I can find a better place

178
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,170
that's affordable for you around here.

179
00:19:07,366 --> 00:19:09,706
Dae Beom, how were you lately?

180
00:19:09,706 --> 00:19:11,766
I'm okay.

181
00:19:17,696 --> 00:19:23,016
Ji Young! I haven't seen Dae Beom since yesterday.

182
00:19:23,016 --> 00:19:24,376
Do you know where he went?

183
00:19:24,376 --> 00:19:26,206
Dae Beom went to Angok.

184
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,526
"Angok"?

185
00:19:28,526 --> 00:19:30,626
That punk, seriously...

186
00:19:30,626 --> 00:19:33,526
Did he go see a movie again or something?

187
00:19:36,106 --> 00:19:40,846
Professor, Dae Beom won't return here anymore.

188
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:44,506
Also, I'll tell Dae Beom the truth.

189
00:19:44,506 --> 00:19:48,326
"The truth?" What truth?

190
00:19:49,496 --> 00:19:53,966
I also want Dae Beom to go back to school.

191
00:19:53,966 --> 00:19:58,076
But not because he got caught in a trap set by someone.

192
00:19:58,076 --> 00:20:01,356
I want him to make a judgment for himself.

193
00:20:01,356 --> 00:20:04,336
Jo Ji Young, listen.

194
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:06,880
Ahn Dae Beom and the Netherlands professor are competing.

195
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,800
Do you even know what this means?

196
00:20:09,806 --> 00:20:11,686
But, Professor,

197
00:20:11,686 --> 00:20:17,256
aren't you embarrassed to be carried on the back of an Angok village boy?

198
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:23,496
If you don't have enough talent, give up your ambition.

199
00:20:23,496 --> 00:20:25,796
Then it puts us all at ease.

200
00:20:25,796 --> 00:20:27,666
I'll be going now.

201
00:20:43,396 --> 00:20:47,176
Hello.

202
00:20:47,176 --> 00:20:49,276
Please come inside, Dae Beom.

203
00:20:53,676 --> 00:20:56,176
Thank you for coming today.

204
00:20:56,176 --> 00:20:58,896
But what brings you here?

205
00:20:58,896 --> 00:21:01,636
I have something to ask you.

206
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:02,746
Okay.

207
00:21:02,746 --> 00:21:09,876
Why was Geun Ho not wearing his glasses on that day?

208
00:21:09,876 --> 00:21:12,906
Oh, the glasses.

209
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,476
A few days before that incident happened,

210
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:21,256
my son went outside and lost his glasses.

211
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,866
We should have gotten him a new pair of glasses.

212
00:21:26,096 --> 00:21:29,796
Geun Ho has very bad eyesight, right?

213
00:21:29,796 --> 00:21:32,206
It's not just that level.

214
00:21:32,206 --> 00:21:37,246
His astigmatism is very bad so he can't walk well without glasses.

215
00:21:37,976 --> 00:21:39,736
I told you this before!

216
00:21:39,736 --> 00:21:43,036
How could he write the graffiti without glasses?

217
00:21:43,766 --> 00:21:48,520
Does anyone else know that Geun Ho

218
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,260
wrote graffiti at the billiards before?

219
00:21:52,606 --> 00:21:54,466
How can we tell anyone that?

220
00:21:54,466 --> 00:21:58,526
The word would spread to Mr. Bae instantly if anyone knew it.

221
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:04,006
Then would any incident cause grudges from someone?

222
00:22:04,006 --> 00:22:05,886
"Grudges"?

223
00:22:05,886 --> 00:22:10,166
He's inside his room all the time drawing.

224
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:13,016
So how could he get grudges from others?

225
00:22:13,886 --> 00:22:17,736
The graffiti inside the billiard room was really not written by my son.

226
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:21,706
He doesn't even know the word "tramp" written inside there!

227
00:22:21,706 --> 00:22:25,236
Look at what my son wrote in his room.

228
00:22:25,236 --> 00:22:27,746
He's really not the culprit!

229
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,390
Geez.

230
00:22:31,006 --> 00:22:34,346
Why are you crying before guests?

231
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:39,116
I'm crying as it's infuriating!

232
00:22:39,116 --> 00:22:42,876
He can't express his feelings well and understand what others say.

233
00:22:42,876 --> 00:22:48,556
So I can't even sleep when I think they interrogate him in jail.

234
00:22:49,976 --> 00:22:53,416
Dae Beom, look with your own eyes.

235
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:56,496
You tell me if my son will write such a horrible thing.

236
00:23:10,816 --> 00:23:16,366
[Run away, Seon Ah]

237
00:23:24,106 --> 00:23:27,916
[Seon Ah, run away]

238
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:30,246
I'm just wondering.

239
00:23:31,626 --> 00:23:33,846
But do you know what this means next to the writing?

240
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:35,986
[Seon Ah, run away ▲▲ㄱㅣㄹ]

241
00:23:35,986 --> 00:23:40,706
We don't know what it means, either. He's been writing that since young.

242
00:23:40,706 --> 00:23:46,356
Children like him write or say the same thing repeatedly.

243
00:23:46,356 --> 00:23:49,666
I doubt there's a special meaning. He just keeps drawing it.

244
00:23:49,666 --> 00:23:52,416
Can I take a picture of it?

245
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:55,386
Oh, yes. Please, go ahead.

246
00:24:00,376 --> 00:24:03,426
[Seon Ah, run away ▲▲ㄱㅣㄹ]

247
00:24:03,426 --> 00:24:07,576
Listen to these boys. How can you steal a motorcycle when you should study at school?

248
00:24:07,576 --> 00:24:10,256
- Geun Ho, look at me.
- We didn't steal it!

249
00:24:10,256 --> 00:24:13,686
Here. It's your new pair of glasses.

250
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:16,216
- You must have been uncomfortable until now.
- Did you steal it or not?

251
00:24:16,216 --> 00:24:18,526
I said we didn't steal it!

252
00:24:18,526 --> 00:24:21,486
We just borrowed it.

253
00:24:21,486 --> 00:24:23,806
Did you want to ask Geun Ho something ?

254
00:24:26,646 --> 00:24:31,136
Hey, put your phone away before I take it from you.

255
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:34,376
Well, Geun Ho.

256
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:40,866
What does this mean?

257
00:24:45,866 --> 00:24:47,746
Geun Ho.

258
00:24:47,746 --> 00:24:51,746
Can you just tell us what this means?

259
00:24:56,954 --> 00:25:00,936
It's okay. You can tell them. It's okay.

260
00:25:00,936 --> 00:25:03,826
I heard you started writing this long ago.

261
00:25:03,826 --> 00:25:05,776
What does it mean?

262
00:25:05,776 --> 00:25:10,206
What's wrong, Geun Ho? It's okay for you to tell them.

263
00:25:10,206 --> 00:25:15,516
Then can you tell me why you wrote, "Run away or you'll get killed," on the billiard before?

264
00:25:16,716 --> 00:25:19,946
Geun Ho, it's okay. Please calm down.

265
00:25:19,946 --> 00:25:22,886
You didn't do anything to Grandma, right?

266
00:25:23,426 --> 00:25:25,306
It's okay.

267
00:25:25,306 --> 00:25:27,566
- Are you okay?
- It's all right. It's okay!

268
00:25:27,566 --> 00:25:30,406
Geun Ho, it's okay. Let's calm down.

269
00:25:30,406 --> 00:25:32,316
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

270
00:25:32,316 --> 00:25:35,736
It's okay. Please calm down.

271
00:25:35,736 --> 00:25:38,506
I'm so sorry.

272
00:25:38,506 --> 00:25:41,866
- What are you doing this weekend?
- I don't know.

273
00:25:41,866 --> 00:25:44,206
Then let's hang out together all day.

274
00:25:44,206 --> 00:25:47,066
I'll plan the entire day.

275
00:25:48,076 --> 00:25:50,546
I'm so jealous of your innocent, bright face.

276
00:25:50,546 --> 00:25:52,866
Really?

277
00:25:52,866 --> 00:25:55,966
That's not true. I have so many worries.

278
00:25:55,966 --> 00:25:58,336
Have you worries?

279
00:25:59,276 --> 00:26:04,466
I'll tell you all my worries the day we hang out so you must listen to them.

280
00:26:05,386 --> 00:26:07,436
Sure.

281
00:26:07,436 --> 00:26:09,506
Then let's hang out tomorrow.

282
00:26:09,506 --> 00:26:11,046
Don't you have work tomorrow?

283
00:26:11,046 --> 00:26:12,976
They want me to take time off.

284
00:26:12,976 --> 00:26:15,136
Also, the meal is on me tomorrow.

285
00:26:15,136 --> 00:26:16,966
It's okay. Let me pay for you.

286
00:26:16,966 --> 00:26:19,656
How much did you make anyway?

287
00:26:19,656 --> 00:26:21,826
That's not what I meant.

288
00:26:21,826 --> 00:26:24,306
What I'm trying to say is...

289
00:26:24,306 --> 00:26:27,636
It doesn't feel right to spend on me when you work hard to earn.

290
00:26:27,636 --> 00:26:31,446
It's fine. Just say what you want to say.

291
00:26:31,446 --> 00:26:34,696
Your charm is that you are tactless.

292
00:26:35,946 --> 00:26:39,346
Really? Is that my charm?

293
00:26:39,346 --> 00:26:41,606
Is there anything else?

294
00:26:41,606 --> 00:26:43,866
What else?

295
00:26:47,766 --> 00:26:54,566
What was the first graffiti that Geun Ho wrote?

296
00:26:57,846 --> 00:27:00,176
The first one was,

297
00:27:00,876 --> 00:27:03,926
"Run away or you'll get killed."

298
00:27:09,766 --> 00:27:11,826
What was the next one?

299
00:27:11,826 --> 00:27:13,876
The second one was,

300
00:27:13,876 --> 00:27:19,076
"You killed Seon Ah. I saw that."

301
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:22,836
Oh, I'm sorry.

302
00:27:25,536 --> 00:27:27,466
It's okay.

303
00:27:29,866 --> 00:27:32,386
[Run away or you'll get killed.]
[You killed Seon Ah. I saw that.]

[Seon Ah ▲▲ㄱㅣㄹ]

305
00:27:39,016 --> 00:27:42,756
Do you think it's all related?

306
00:27:43,646 --> 00:27:45,666
I'm not sure.

307
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:52,546
I don't know if it's okay for me to say this,

308
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:55,556
but Geun Ho's mom told me

309
00:27:55,556 --> 00:28:01,766
that Geun Ho had feelings for your sister back then.

310
00:28:03,746 --> 00:28:09,746
And he started to write those things after your sister passed away.

311
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:13,966
She said Geun Ho kept writing "Run away"

312
00:28:13,966 --> 00:28:18,116
because he thought I was your sister.

313
00:28:18,116 --> 00:28:22,926
Seeing him keep writing "Run away" or "I saw it,"

314
00:28:22,926 --> 00:28:26,996
it really felt like he was telling me to run from someone.

Wow, there's food!

00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:09,940
It's great. I'm hungry.

325
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:14,026
I didn't prepare much. Give me a second.

326
00:29:14,026 --> 00:29:16,646
Don't we have an extra spoon?

- Here is a spoon for you.
- Thank you for the jacket.

332
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:36,936
Thank you for making him say thanks to me.

333
00:29:36,936 --> 00:29:40,766
But what brings you here without a call?

334
00:29:40,766 --> 00:29:42,666
Me?

335
00:29:44,106 --> 00:29:46,776
I came since I missed Angok.

336
00:29:48,576 --> 00:29:51,276
It's weird how a person feels.

337
00:29:51,276 --> 00:29:52,596
What about it?

338
00:29:52,596 --> 00:29:56,146
While here, I really wanted to go to Seoul.

339
00:29:56,146 --> 00:29:59,536
But after staying in Seoul a few days, I miss here.

340
00:29:59,536 --> 00:30:02,956
You change your mind so easily.

341
00:30:04,606 --> 00:30:06,206
Seong Min.

342
00:30:06,206 --> 00:30:08,426
Should I not go to Seoul?

343
00:30:10,486 --> 00:30:12,506
I mean,

344
00:30:13,166 --> 00:30:17,966
it's not bad to live here and go through highs and lows together, is it?

345
00:30:22,186 --> 00:30:25,506
Hey, it wasn't that long since you moved to Seoul.

346
00:30:25,506 --> 00:30:29,166
You'll forget this place when you go through many things there.

347
00:30:30,266 --> 00:30:32,736
Do you want me to move to Seoul?

348
00:30:37,236 --> 00:30:40,996
What are you two doing? Talk about that outside.

349
00:30:40,996 --> 00:30:43,816
It's not something like that!

350
00:30:43,816 --> 00:30:45,876
Don't misunderstand. And look at her.

351
00:30:45,876 --> 00:30:48,016
Are you out of your mind?

352
00:30:48,016 --> 00:30:51,526
How can you say that when you wanted to pass the test so badly before?

353
00:30:51,526 --> 00:30:55,316
You have to go to Seoul. If you are not here,

354
00:30:55,316 --> 00:30:57,946
I don't get scolded so it's good for me.

355
00:30:57,946 --> 00:31:00,036
You say things you don't mean.

356
00:31:06,816 --> 00:31:08,976
Hello?

357
00:31:08,976 --> 00:31:10,406
What?

358
00:31:11,386 --> 00:31:14,166
Can't my dad go instead of me?

359
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:17,596
Okay, I get it. Yes.

360
00:31:18,846 --> 00:31:20,536
What's wrong?

361
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:25,016
What a bad timing!

362
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:29,366
You two enjoy the food. I'll come back real quick.

363
00:31:31,086 --> 00:31:34,096
- Listen to her well, Jun.
- Okay.

364
00:31:36,256 --> 00:31:38,766
Look at this!

365
00:31:38,766 --> 00:31:42,506
How could my son have written this?

366
00:31:42,506 --> 00:31:45,196
He's in jail right now!

367
00:31:45,196 --> 00:31:48,706
I told you my Geun Ho didn't do anything. Why don't you trust me?

368
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:52,206
Of course, I trust your words! I mean it.

369
00:31:52,206 --> 00:31:54,026
Also, you, Mu Cheol.

370
00:31:54,026 --> 00:31:56,296
Go to the police station and report this right now.

371
00:31:56,296 --> 00:31:58,476
Yes, I'll report it right away.

372
00:31:58,476 --> 00:32:01,576
And release my Geun Ho right now.

373
00:32:01,576 --> 00:32:02,926
She's right.

374
00:32:02,926 --> 00:32:06,566
But Geun Ho entering was filmed in the surveillance camera.

375
00:32:06,566 --> 00:32:09,036
We must look into that. So for now--

376
00:32:09,036 --> 00:32:11,026
Look into what?

377
00:32:11,026 --> 00:32:14,936
By the way, what does this mean?

378
00:32:14,936 --> 00:32:17,406
Two triangles are here.

379
00:32:17,406 --> 00:32:21,540
And does that say "road?" Is it a code or something?

380
00:32:22,526 --> 00:32:24,536
Hello.

381
00:32:24,536 --> 00:32:27,156
- Hello.
- Hello.

382
00:32:27,156 --> 00:32:32,266
Yeo Reum, what should we do? Someone made a mess again.

383
00:32:33,476 --> 00:32:37,640
Is this building really cursed, like my father said?

384
00:32:38,396 --> 00:32:42,996
Mu Cheol. Is there anything recorded on that surveillance camera?

385
00:32:42,996 --> 00:32:44,876
Right, the surveillance camera.

386
00:32:44,876 --> 00:32:46,726
Yes, take a look.

387
00:32:46,726 --> 00:32:48,516
If you had it, you should have showed it first!

388
00:32:48,516 --> 00:32:50,666
- Let's see.
- Here.

389
00:32:54,136 --> 00:32:56,596
There's a guy.

390
00:32:56,596 --> 00:32:59,796
But how can you identify that person with this footage?

391
00:32:59,796 --> 00:33:02,406
Do you have a video of his face?

392
00:33:02,406 --> 00:33:06,386
The surveillance camera only shows from above so the face isn't showing.

393
00:33:06,386 --> 00:33:09,016
Can't we zoom into this video?

394
00:33:15,006 --> 00:33:19,176
Since we did this many times, now I have the hang of it.

395
00:33:19,776 --> 00:33:21,306
I'm sorry.

396
00:33:21,306 --> 00:33:24,906
What? Why are you sorry?

397
00:33:26,356 --> 00:33:28,626
Oh, that's right.

398
00:33:28,626 --> 00:33:33,861
I think you have to find another place to live as this building might be sold soon.

399
00:33:33,861 --> 00:33:36,136
I heard about that.

400
00:33:36,136 --> 00:33:39,426
What? Did you already hear it?

401
00:33:39,426 --> 00:33:43,966
Can I ask you something?

402
00:33:43,966 --> 00:33:45,586
Of course.

403
00:33:52,006 --> 00:33:53,856
Have a great day.

404
00:33:56,896 --> 00:33:58,786
Kim Dae Ho.

405
00:34:00,036 --> 00:34:03,476
Did you become a bakery boy after leaving prison?

406
00:34:15,246 --> 00:34:17,706
I wish I could hang out like this every day.

407
00:34:17,706 --> 00:34:21,326
We can do that. Let's hang out every day like now.

408
00:34:21,326 --> 00:34:25,316
We'll be in our senior year soon. You get yourself together.

409
00:34:25,316 --> 00:34:27,686
Okay, Noona.

410
00:34:29,136 --> 00:34:31,046
Then what were your worries?

411
00:34:31,046 --> 00:34:32,796
What is it?

412
00:34:35,426 --> 00:34:37,376
Tell me.

413
00:34:38,106 --> 00:34:40,336
It kind of sorted out.

414
00:34:40,336 --> 00:34:42,446
What's that?

415
00:34:43,526 --> 00:34:44,466
- No.
- Eat it!

416
00:34:44,466 --> 00:34:46,596
I don't want to!

417
00:34:47,236 --> 00:34:48,966
Seriously! Let me go to the restroom.

418
00:34:48,966 --> 00:34:52,676
- Why don't you eat this before you go?
- You eat it!

419
00:35:04,676 --> 00:35:07,426
This rude b*stard.

420
00:35:07,426 --> 00:35:10,646
You should come to me first to say hello if you got out of prison.

421
00:35:10,646 --> 00:35:13,016
Do we have to find you?

422
00:35:14,206 --> 00:35:16,006
Are you laughing?

423
00:35:16,006 --> 00:35:18,446
Don't bother me, and just go.

424
00:35:18,446 --> 00:35:20,416
Unless you will pay my hourly wage.

425
00:35:20,416 --> 00:35:24,396
This darn b*stard is so rude since he thinks he knows how to fight.

426
00:35:24,396 --> 00:35:27,566
Hey, do you know who we are?

427
00:35:29,046 --> 00:35:32,856
Do you guys all learn together how to bully and say, "Do you know who I am?"

428
00:35:32,856 --> 00:35:35,266
This darn b*stard—

429
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:39,986
Hey, you. Don't spread a weird rumor about Bom.

430
00:35:39,986 --> 00:35:41,336
Please don't.

431
00:35:41,336 --> 00:35:43,376
Look at this punk.

432
00:35:43,376 --> 00:35:44,776
Is that a threat?

433
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:47,666
I didn't threaten anyone. I'm asking a favor.

434
00:35:47,666 --> 00:35:50,206
What? A favor? You son of a—

435
00:35:54,266 --> 00:35:56,886
How dare you try to act up, you b*stard!

436
00:35:56,886 --> 00:35:59,086
- Hyung!
- Ha Neul, it's fine.

437
00:35:59,086 --> 00:36:01,846
Hyung, please don't fight.

438
00:36:01,846 --> 00:36:03,806
Do you think I'm a child? Hey guys, take Ha Neul with you.

439
00:36:03,806 --> 00:36:07,776
Hyung, let's go together. Let's go together right now!

440
00:36:07,776 --> 00:36:09,546
You shouldn't get involved in it.

441
00:36:09,546 --> 00:36:11,316
Let this go.

442
00:36:11,316 --> 00:36:13,766
I'll just let you hit me.

443
00:36:13,766 --> 00:36:17,466
So just hit a few times and go. Okay?

444
00:36:20,186 --> 00:36:21,986
Noona.

445
00:36:31,006 --> 00:36:33,296
Jae Hoon, I think I must go now.

446
00:36:33,296 --> 00:36:36,026
- Where are you going?
- I'll tell you later. I'll get going.

447
00:36:36,026 --> 00:36:37,496
Wait, Bom!

448
00:36:37,496 --> 00:36:39,676
I guess alcoholics' children are friends with each other.

449
00:36:39,676 --> 00:36:43,886
Those beggars are busy finding people to mooch off.

450
00:36:44,906 --> 00:36:49,406
You are right! Look how Kim Bom leeches off that American boy.

451
00:36:50,656 --> 00:36:52,996
I'll let you go if you take back what you just said.

452
00:36:52,996 --> 00:36:55,506
What are you talking about, you b*stard?

453
00:36:59,006 --> 00:37:01,536
Wait. I have something to say as well.

454
00:37:01,536 --> 00:37:04,846
Jae Hoon, I'm in a hurry. Can we talk later?

455
00:37:04,846 --> 00:37:07,296
Why do I always come second?

456
00:37:07,296 --> 00:37:10,186
Are you going to Dae Ho again?

457
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,476
What?

458
00:37:11,476 --> 00:37:15,136
You did that before, too. You made a plan with me,

459
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:17,516
but you were with Dae Ho.

460
00:37:17,516 --> 00:37:21,286
I saw you riding Dae Ho's motorcycle that day.

461
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:24,136
You should have told me then if you saw me.

462
00:37:24,136 --> 00:37:26,096
Why are you telling me now, making me a bad person?

463
00:37:26,096 --> 00:37:28,226
I called you, but you said you had something urgent.

464
00:37:28,226 --> 00:37:31,536
Then must I explain every detail to you?

465
00:37:32,566 --> 00:37:34,686
Don't go to him today.

466
00:37:36,506 --> 00:37:38,036
Jae Hoon, I'm really sorry.

467
00:37:38,036 --> 00:37:41,216
I'll explain it all to you later. I'm really in a hurry right now.

468
00:37:41,216 --> 00:37:43,936
Dae Ho only has me.

469
00:37:43,936 --> 00:37:45,126
What?

470
00:37:45,126 --> 00:37:48,246
If Dae Ho makes trouble again, his life is really over.

471
00:37:48,246 --> 00:37:50,506
I have only you, too.

472
00:37:52,316 --> 00:37:54,366
I might go back to America.

473
00:37:54,366 --> 00:37:56,046
What?

474
00:37:56,046 --> 00:37:58,816
Why are you saying that now?

475
00:37:58,816 --> 00:38:02,326
Are you doing this on purpose?

476
00:38:02,326 --> 00:38:04,976
Okay, let's discuss that tomorrow as well.

477
00:38:04,976 --> 00:38:08,906
You can return there if you want to. I'll go now.

478
00:38:08,906 --> 00:38:11,126
I told you, I'm in a hurry!

479
00:38:11,126 --> 00:38:12,926
You don't know about anything.

480
00:38:12,926 --> 00:38:16,726
You have your parents, but we don't have anything!

481
00:38:16,726 --> 00:38:20,886
You know my situation; why are you saying it like that?

482
00:38:20,886 --> 00:38:22,676
I'm also having a hard time.

483
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:24,736
Lee Jae Hoon.

484
00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:27,646
For us, life is walking on thin ice daily.

485
00:38:27,646 --> 00:38:31,546
If we take one wrong step, all is over!

486
00:38:31,546 --> 00:38:34,586
Why do you keep calling you and Dae Ho "we"?

487
00:38:35,756 --> 00:38:38,126
Because we are different from you.

488
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:43,146
Do you know how intimidated I was when I went to your house?

489
00:38:43,146 --> 00:38:47,876
You have no idea how much it hurts my pride when you pay for everything!

490
00:38:47,876 --> 00:38:51,946
What can I do about it?

491
00:38:53,126 --> 00:38:55,256
I'm the only one who has feelings in this relationship.

492
00:38:55,256 --> 00:38:57,276
I know that, but...

493
00:38:57,276 --> 00:39:02,066
It's hard for me to endure anymore that you always push me aside.

494
00:39:04,466 --> 00:39:06,876
Then do what you want.

495
00:39:06,876 --> 00:39:09,466
I never asked you to like me.

496
00:39:17,476 --> 00:39:20,006
Hey, run!

497
00:39:22,816 --> 00:39:24,246
Hyung, Hyung!

498
00:39:24,246 --> 00:39:27,166
Please hold back. Can you do that for me?

499
00:39:27,166 --> 00:39:29,556
You b*stard!

500
00:39:32,426 --> 00:39:34,826
You darn b*stard!

501
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:38,956
Hyung, please!

502
00:39:47,126 --> 00:39:48,996
Hey! Let this go!

503
00:39:48,996 --> 00:39:52,490
Hey, stop it!

504
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:54,520
Stop!

505
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,026
- Come here.
- Let go of this!

506
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:59,286
I told you to let go of me!

507
00:39:59,896 --> 00:40:01,916
This darn—

508
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:11,266
Hey, Kim Dae Ho. Kim Dae Ho!

509
00:40:11,266 --> 00:40:13,016
What are you doing right now?

510
00:40:13,016 --> 00:40:15,096
Get out of my way. I said get out of my way!

511
00:40:15,096 --> 00:40:17,836
Get yourself together, Kim Bom!

512
00:40:20,006 --> 00:40:22,236
You weren't here today, okay?

513
00:40:25,926 --> 00:40:29,386
Hey, cops are coming!

514
00:40:30,116 --> 00:40:32,416
Aren't you embarrassed you got hit by a girl?

515
00:40:32,416 --> 00:40:34,986
So just say I'm the only one who hit you guys.

516
00:40:41,756 --> 00:40:44,426
Hey, Boy! Stop it!

517
00:40:44,426 --> 00:40:47,536
- Hey, what are you doing?
- You b*stard.

518
00:40:47,536 --> 00:40:49,406
Stay where you are. Stay still!

519
00:40:49,406 --> 00:40:53,056
Let this go. I said let me go!

520
00:40:53,056 --> 00:40:56,806
- Are you okay?
- Stay still.

521
00:40:56,806 --> 00:40:59,996
Are you okay? Stand up now.

522
00:40:59,996 --> 00:41:01,966
Get in the car now.

523
00:41:20,446 --> 00:41:23,916
They started the fight first! What I'm saying is right!

524
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:25,736
- Why aren't you saying anything?
- Okay, we'll talk at the police station.

525
00:41:25,736 --> 00:41:27,516
Kim Dae Ho!

526
00:41:27,516 --> 00:41:29,576
But why must he go to the police when others started the fight?

527
00:41:29,576 --> 00:41:31,406
- Bom.
- Come this way, please.

528
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:33,116
I don't regret anything.

529
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:35,936
I will beat up all bad guys from now on!

530
00:41:35,936 --> 00:41:37,496
You are an idiot.

531
00:41:37,496 --> 00:41:42,206
Why did you do that? Why?

532
00:41:42,206 --> 00:41:43,986
Why?

533
00:41:54,806 --> 00:41:58,256
Hey, who are you?

534
00:42:05,316 --> 00:42:06,656
[I know you are the murderer.]

535
00:42:06,656 --> 00:42:08,556
Stop there!
[I know you are the murderer.]

536
00:43:15,996 --> 00:43:18,026
Stop there!

537
00:43:26,446 --> 00:43:28,386
What's the deal with you?

538
00:43:28,386 --> 00:43:30,316
Who are you?

539
00:43:53,976 --> 00:43:56,366
The young lady from the billiard?

540
00:43:58,106 --> 00:44:01,346
What the heck are you doing right now?

541
00:44:01,976 --> 00:44:03,956
I just wanted to know.

542
00:44:03,956 --> 00:44:05,446
About what?

543
00:44:05,446 --> 00:44:09,636
I wanted to know who was so interested in Geun Ho's graffiti.

544
00:44:39,616 --> 00:44:42,176
Why did you crawl back in here?

545
00:44:52,216 --> 00:44:54,036
Ahn Dae Beom.

546
00:44:55,206 --> 00:44:56,926
Is it you?

547
00:45:00,726 --> 00:45:02,936
You know what this means, right?

548
00:45:02,936 --> 00:45:05,206
It's Angok Middle School.

549
00:45:14,766 --> 00:45:22,026
[Kwak Mu]

550
00:45:27,106 --> 00:45:31,796
[Kwak Mu Cheol]

551
00:45:31,796 --> 00:45:34,786
Angok Middle School, Kwak Mu Cheol.

552
00:45:39,226 --> 00:45:41,456
You killed her, didn't you?

553
00:45:43,606 --> 00:45:45,566
You killed my sister.

554
00:45:50,656 --> 00:45:54,786
[Kwak Mu Cheol]

555
00:45:54,786 --> 00:45:59,816
[Seon Ah]

556
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:26,506
[Summer Strike]

557
00:46:26,506 --> 00:46:29,486
You killed Grandma as well to cover up the murder of Seon Ah!

558
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:30,816
Stop saying gibberish!

559
00:46:30,816 --> 00:46:33,086
It's not me! It's not me!

560
00:46:33,086 --> 00:46:35,456
- Taxi 3866, stop the car now!
- Please keep driving.

561
00:46:35,456 --> 00:46:37,086
It's all over for you guys.

562
00:46:37,086 --> 00:46:40,116
You got deceived by this woman! You wait and see. I won't sit back.

563
00:46:40,116 --> 00:46:44,116
Now everyone will know about this. All will know that your son is a murderer!

564
00:46:44,116 --> 00:46:46,836
You know others' recording without their consent has no legal effect, right?

565
00:46:46,836 --> 00:46:48,946
Please help us. Please.

566
00:46:48,946 --> 00:46:50,516
Bom!

567
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:51,966
I miss my grandmother.

568
00:46:51,966 --> 00:46:55,056
I was wrong. I'm sorry.
