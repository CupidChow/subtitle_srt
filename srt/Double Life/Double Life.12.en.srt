Episode 12

5
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,720
Isn't it 23?

6
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,280
So,

7
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,840
you're interested in my prey?

8
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,919
Since we're colleagues,

9
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,200
you may give him a slash.

10
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:11,880
12.

11
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,840
I'm not kidding.

12
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,320
Funny.

13
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,120
I don't want to hurt you.

14
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,320
Don't push me.

15
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,880
Seriously?

16
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,920
I have enough time,

17
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,440
so let's have fun.

18
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,239
I wronged her.

19
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,880
Let's go to see Yun Shang.

20
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,440
Yes.

21
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,080
23.

22
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,799
You didn't make any progress.

23
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,080
It's been so long,

24
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,400
I expected

25
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,000
that you'd please me longer.

26
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,000
But you are so disappointing.

27
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,440
Well,

28
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,600
I have to finish you

29
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,600
and then

30
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,480
Wu Luan.

31
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:02,920
Here.

32
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,959
Eat one.

33
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,560
12.

34
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,719
Don't blame me.

35
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,320
I'll let nobody hurt Wu Ruan.

36
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,920
I don't like you

37
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,640
because you're bloodthirsty.

38
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,719
But you must

39
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,820
have become this because of the Pavilion.

40
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,080
I hope you can

41
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,120
live in a good family in the next life.

42
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,880
To think Yun Shang spent a whole day

43
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,400
to protect me.

44
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,800
If the Drizzle Pavilion notices it,

45
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,080
she will be doomed.

46
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,520
How long can this matter be kept?

47
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,820
Just take one step at a time.

48
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,520
How could an assassin

49
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,440
lose his own weapon?

50
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,560
23.

51
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,039
You know

52
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,480
where 12 is?

53
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,320
It's your business,

54
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,920
why did you ask me?

55
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,400
What's your business today?

56
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,280
Assassin 01 used

57
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,120
to be Master's favorite.

58
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,840
But he was executed by Master

59
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,799
for killing a colleague.

60
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,680
Each of the Pavilion stabbed him once

61
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,720
till he bled out.

62
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,320
I'm in no mood for stories,

63
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,920
not to mention an outworn one.

64
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,280
Really?

65
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,200
Yun Shang.

66
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,320
Where did you go

67
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,880
last night?

68
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,320
Yun Shang.

69
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,680
Yun Shang.

70
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,240
I've kept looking for you.

71
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,240
Yun Shang.

72
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,599
I missed you.

73
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,200
This is not a place for you.

74
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,920
Lord.

75
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,000
I made it so clear in the letter.

76
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,660
We're people of different worlds.

77
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,120
Why do you

78
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,800
look for me?

79
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,880
Because I saw you

80
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,800
last night.

81
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,680
You saw me

82
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,920
last night?

83
