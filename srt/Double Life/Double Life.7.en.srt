Episode 7

5
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,599
Nobody knows what will happen tomorrow.

6
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,240
Just like I don't know

7
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,480
how long this pleasure could last.

8
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,720
Just enjoy the present.

9
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,680
A sneak attack?

10
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,760
I won't lose.

11
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,040
You'll pay for it.

12
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,359
Where's that red thread?

13
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,680
It's a disease I've had since I was a kid.

14
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,800
It appears from time to time.

15
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,080
So my red thread did work.

16
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,200
You have to keep wearing it.

17
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:09,840
OK.

18
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,320
Lord.

19
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,440
You are summoned

20
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,000
by His Majesty.

21
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:17,719
All right.

22
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:18,960
I see.

23
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,240
Wait for me at home.

24
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,920
Greetings,

25
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,039
Your Majesty.

26
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,280
Your Majesty.

27
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,000
There are no outsiders around,

28
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,080
so there's no need to stand on ceremony.

29
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,159
As you wish.

30
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,160
Sister,

31
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,880
have you put on weight?

32
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:17,840
You

33
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,280
are getting naughtier.

34
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,039
Your Majesty.

35
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,280
I'll tell the servants to prepare some snacks.

36
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,080
Don't horse around.

37
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,080
Understood.

38
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,520
I didn't judge you wrong.

39
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,880
It's less than a month since you arrived,

40
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,360
you've used the Drizzle Pavilion

41
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,440
to get rid of Prince Pingxi, my malady.

42
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,680
You're flattering me.

43
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,760
It

44
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,160
was just a fluke.

45
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,680
Don't be so modest.

46
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,080
If you hadn't planned to do it at the banquet,

47
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,600
it

48
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,200
wouldn't have been done so smoothly.

49
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,640
Your Majesty.

50
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,680
I keep the assassin of the Drizzle Pavilion around me.

51
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,599
Since she failed last night,

52
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,039
it would be harder

53
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,200
for her to do it.

54
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,480
So I decided to give her

55
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,640
a push.

56
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,080
We all know Prince Ping's ambition.

57
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,480
If he dies,

58
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,640
my problem will be solved.

59
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,200
But I've called you here

60
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,160
to find out

61
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,840
the person behind the Drizzle Pavilion.

62
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,000
As a private organization,

63
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,479
the Pavilion killed so many officials.

64
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,080
I believe it must be related to the courtiers.

65
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,640
I want to abolish that nominal agency

66
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,479
to fill the treasury

67
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,680
and help the people.

68
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,480
Why is it so hard?

69
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,920
Wu Luan.

70
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,680
You should look

71
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,000
into it quickly.

72
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,160
As you wish.

73
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,840
According to that assassin,

74
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,799
there were many birchleaf pear trees

75
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,800
around the place where they were trained as kids.

76
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,320
My sister and I

77
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,120
could barely talk with each other.

78
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,239
But if we had any chance,

79
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,200
we went to the birchleaf pear woods

80
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,120
to smell the fragrance.

81
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,680
The plant is only growing in the capital.

82
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,000
So I suspect

83
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,600
that its headquarters

84
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,240
is in the suburbs of the capital.

85
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,840
But I still need more time

86
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,240
to locate it.

87
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:40,640
Your Majesty.

88
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,840
I've also found its liaison.

89
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,640
Ling Jiu.

90
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,040
Lord.

91
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,640
Does someone

92
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,880
raise birds here?

93
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,439
It's alright.

94
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,520
The more, the better.

95
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,640
But she was so cautious

96
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,880
that I found nothing

97
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,480
though I followed her several times.

98
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,640
Is there any other progress?

99
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,760
When I

100
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,080
bought the fireworks for the birthday feast,

101
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,560
I found that the Radiance Shop

102
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,480
might be connected to the Pavilion.

103
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,080
We may trace it.

104
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,600
Very well.

105
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,080
In that case,

106
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,640
I will issue a public edict for you

107
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,360
on the excuse

108
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,600
of investigating Pingxi's case

109
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,199
to stir up that stagnant water.

110
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,360
I want to see who will get so impatient

111
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,800
and show up.

112
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,160
Understood.

113
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,480
By the way,

114
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,760
have you got rid

115
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,400
of that assassin?

116
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,560
Don't worry.

117
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,760
That assassin was useless

118
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,480
to me already.

119
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,000
I

120
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,280
handled her last night.

121
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,480
Good.

122
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,680
Since you'll make a radical investigation,

123
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,720
you shall not be got on.

124
00:09:59,360 --> 00:09:59,760
Understand?

125
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,280
I was going to grant this to you.

126
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,439
It's a shame.

127
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,079
Miss.

128
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,880
Just leave it to me.

129
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,280
You don't have to do it.

130
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,960
I want to cook for him in person.

131
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,160
Didn't he

132
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,160
cook for me

133
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,480
last time?

134
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,040
Have you got rid

135
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,680
of that assassin?

136
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,080
Don't worry.

137
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,520
I

138
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,840
handled her last night.
