Episode 6

5
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,880
Thank you.

6
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,000
You're welcome.

7
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,600
Please go inside.

8
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,399
Prince.

9
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,160
Since it's your birthday today,

10
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,000
I am here to congratulate you.

11
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,280
Wish you always happiness

12
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,000
and a long life.

13
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,200
Your arrival

14
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,000
honors me, Lord.

15
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,960
Make yourself at home.

16
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,000
Please.

17
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,280
Prince.

18
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,360
Prime Minister Gu.

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,600
I came to celebrate your birthday.

20
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,759
Men and women will be separated

21
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,000
during the feast.

22
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,560
I know the women

23
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,600
of the capital so well.

24
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,359
If they say something nasty,

25
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,600
just ignore it.

26
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,900
We can watch the fireworks

27
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,320
when the dinner is over.

28
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,200
Don't worry.

29
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,400
I know what to do.

30
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,200
See you later.

31
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,799
Prime Minister Gu.

32
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,400
Lord Wu.

33
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,160
How are you doing?

34
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,800
Thank you.

35
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm good.

36
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,320
How are you doing?

37
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,200
Have you seen the "canary" Lord Wu keeps?

38
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,000
It seems to be her.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
His Majesty is said to plan to marry a woman to that idiot Lord.

40
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,800
You're among the candidates.

41
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,239
Right, Weiru?

42
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,720
Keep me from the gossip.

43
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,200
I won't marry that moron.

44
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,000
That is her.

45
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:07,760
Look.

46
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,920
You

47
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,800
are attractive indeed.

48
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,640
You know how to make a scene?

49
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,679
What?

50
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,200
The empress will marry a girl to her stupid brother.

51
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,200
I am Gu Weiru

52
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,800
daughter of the Prime Minister, Gu Pingzhang.

53
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,800
It seems

54
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,400
I can't avoid it this time.

55
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,760
I don't like Wu Yuan.

56
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,320
If you and he really love each other,

57
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,280
you have

58
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,240
to hold onto him firmly

59
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,800
in case he marries another woman.

60
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,400
Miss Gu.

61
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,120
If there

62
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,160
is anything I can do for you,

63
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,400
feel free to tell me.

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,200
As long as you can help me not to marry that idiot,

65
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,200
we will

66
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,599
be good friends.

67
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,000
Understand?

68
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:39,960
Come.

69
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,400
Keep up.

70
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,400
Come.

71
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,599
I know the best place.

72
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,480
Let me take you there.

73
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,560
Take a look.

74
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,240
Look.

75
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,120
You like it?

76
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,200
If you haven't watched enough,

77
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,200
I'll let off fireworks

78
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,400
simply for you at home.

79
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,520
OK.

80
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,400
Lord.

81
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,800
Prime Minister Gu wants to drink with you.

82
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,320
I see.

83
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,320
I need to go now.

84
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,280
Be right back.

85
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,240
I'll be waiting.

86
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,920
Maybe tomorrow

87
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:00,960
you and me

88
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,280
will be strangers.

89
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,200
Easy, everyone.

90
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,200
Take this way.

91
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,880
Take it easy.

92
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,680
This way.

93
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,760
Yun Shang?

94
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:54,960
Lord.

95
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,000
Let's go.

96
00:07:59,400 --> 00:07:59,840
That way.

97
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,320
Lord.

98
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,320
Be careful.

99
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,320
Go there.

100
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:11,680
Hurry.

101
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,120
Lord.

102
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,120
Be careful.

103
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,320
Hurry.

104
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,680
Evacuate the crowd!

105
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,200
Be careful, Lord.

106
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,520
Lord.

107
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,599
Lord!

108
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,280
Lord!

109
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,480
Lord!

110
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:07,920
Guards.

111
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,000
Lock down the mansion

112
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,079
Yun Shang.

113
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,000
Yun Shang.

114
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,000
Yun Shang.
