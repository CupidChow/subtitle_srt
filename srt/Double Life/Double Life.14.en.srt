Episode 14

5
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,440
Your Majesty.

6
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,080
I heard that Lord Wu Ruan

7
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,039
has been

8
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,080
spending all the days

9
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,839
with a prostitute

10
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,840
and doesn't go home.

11
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,200
I heard about it, too.

12
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,720
How could he do it after being granted a marriage

13
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,480
with Prime Minister Gu's daughter?

14
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,160
Your Majesty.

15
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,679
I condemn him, too.

16
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,880
Prime Minister Gu is an amiable man,

17
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,600
but he should not be bullied.

18
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,620
Prime Minister.

19
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,520
Your Majesty.

20
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,600
What

21
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,640
is your opinion?

22
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,120
How

23
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,320
do I deserve

24
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,160
to be supported by so many colleagues?

25
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,280
I

26
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,920
thank you for that.

27
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,280
But I want our country to be peaceful

28
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,679
and our people to be joyful.

29
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,160
The last thing

30
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,120
I want to see is you being worried about it.

31
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,360
How about

32
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,760
letting me do the bad thing?

33
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,080
I'm begging Your Majesty

34
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,240
to

35
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,880
rescind your order.

36
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,280
Since you said so,

37
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,640
I agree

38
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,079
to reconsider it

39
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,799
carefully.

40
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,160
Thank you.

41
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,840
Is it proper to peek at them?

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,280
I don't know

43
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,040
an ordinary couple's life.

44
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,520
So we just take a look

45
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,560
at their life,

46
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,280
all right?

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,040
Darling.

48
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:28,720
Here.

49
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,200
I washed the grapes for you.

50
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,160
See if they're sweet.

51
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,240
Is it sweet?

52
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,120
Yes?

53
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,840
What's up?

54
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,400
So the ordinary couple

55
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,440
feed each other when they eat.

56
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,520
Then

57
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,079
why don't you feed me next time?

58
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,160
Look at them now.

59
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,480
This is the way you peel scallion?

60
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,720
You can't damn do anything well.

61
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,160
You still want to learn from them?

62
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,559
Come on.

63
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,480
Let me beat you.

64
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,520
No.

65
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,280
Darling, I was wrong.

66
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:09,920
I was wrong.

67
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,959
Stop dodging, I'll punch you.

68
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,200
I won't learn it.

69
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,600
Didn't you insist just now?

70
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,880
What is it?

71
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,719
His Majesty was furious

72
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,600
and wanted to see you.

73
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,680
People are gossiping about you and Miss Yun Shang.

74
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,960
Mr. Gu even asked to cancel the marriage this morning,

75
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,880
so His Majesty lost his temper.

76
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,760
Isn't it a good thing?

77
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,080
You freaked me out.

78
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,240
Yun Shang.

79
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,560
When I come back,

80
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,480
let us celebrate

81
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,760
our new life.

82
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,680
Wait for me.

83
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,080
Let's go.

84
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:01,880
Dad.

85
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,720
Weiyu.

86
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,400
You asked to cancel the marriage?

87
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,480
Wu Ruan's reputation

88
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,560
is totally ruined,

89
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,720
so I won't marry my daughter to him.

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,080
You didn't ask me

91
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,640
before planning to marry me to him

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,760
and you didn't tell me either when you cancelled it.

93
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,680
You really care about me?

94
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,760
I did it for your sake,

95
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,120
why are you dissatisfied?

96
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,039
Weiru,

97
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,080
marriage

98
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,440
should be arranged by parents

99
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,760
and the matchmaker.

100
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,719
Was I wrong to do it

101
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,640
for you?

102
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,000
Besides, don't you also think

103
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,840
Wu Ruan isn't your cup of tea?

104
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,040
You just don't get it.

105
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,520
Weiru.

106
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,240
Wu Ruan.

107
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,120
Did you do it on purpose?

108
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,599
When I didn't agree to cancel your marriage,

109
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,680
you went

110
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,240
to fool around

111
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,159
with a prostitute

112
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,120
which caused many rumors.

113
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,920
So Gu Pingzhang

114
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,560
and others

115
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,280
urged me to cancel your marriage.

116
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,680
I did do it on purpose.

117
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,480
You...

118
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,720
So I can sound out Lord Gu's intention.

119
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,820
I'm sure Gu Pingzhang is suspicious.

120
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,400
Why are you so sure?

121
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,600
Your Majesty.

122
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,640
Think about it.

123
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,480
All the young masters

124
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,600
of marriageable age in the capital

125
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,560
have many women,

126
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,960
so how can Gu Pingzhang really care about that?

127
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,680
Go on.

128
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,080
It's just

129
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,640
I need one thing to prove it.

130
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:53,880
I'm asking

131
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,080
to hire assassins from the Drizzle Pavilion again.

132
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,280
This time,

133
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,400
let them kill Gu Pingzhang

134
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,719
and me.

135
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,000
Then I can keep acting as bait.

136
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,080
What's more,

137
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,880
if Gu Pingzhang really has connections with them,

138
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,280
he will take action.

139
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,880
Wu Ruan.

140
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,840
You're taking a perilous move.

141
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,760
Be safe.

142
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,320
You may leave.

143
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

144
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,560
I think

145
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,200
Wu Ruan behaved strangely today.

146
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,280
Check out the woman around him.

147
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,080
I need to know

148
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,520
if they are just fooling around

149
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,640
or falling in love.

150
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,359
Yes.

151
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,160
The Viridian Store.

152
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,280
That is nice.

153
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,799
You like that hairpin?

154
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:42,719
Didn't you want to be an ordinary husband?

155
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,480
Why are you spending money freely?

156
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,000
What did you just call me?

157
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,079
Say it again.

158
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,320
What did I just say?

159
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,319
I said nothing.

160
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,120
Come on.

161
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,800
Sugar-coated haws.

162
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,540
Do you eat husband...

163
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,760
No, the sugar-coated haws?

164
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,120
Yes.

165
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,600
Sugar-coated haws.

166
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,320
Sir.

167
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,800
Is it fresh?

168
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,560
Certainly.

169
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,199
Sir.

170
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,120
Want one?

171
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,599
Is it sweet?

172
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
Of course, it is.

173
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,080
I'll have one.

174
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,440
You want this?

175
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:24,880
All right.

176
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,240
Thank you.

177
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,360
How about playing a game?

178
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:29,920
A game?

179
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,000
All right.

180
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,959
If you can keep staying

181
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,640
with me tonight,

182
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,719
when we go home, I may call you

183
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,480
darling.

184
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,320
So?

185
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,240
It's not hard.

186
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,040
Prepare

187
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,600
to call me darling.

188
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,480
Now

189
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,400
we can't be separated.

190
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,840
And I can also feed you this.

191
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,959
Wu Ruan didn't kill the assassin of the Drizzle Pavilion

192
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,280
and has kept her around.

193
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,920
The woman should die.

194
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,400
I'll do it now.

195
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,319
No.

196
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,320
