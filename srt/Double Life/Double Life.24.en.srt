Episode 24

5
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,560
It seems there is a slim hope

6
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,320
of finding the cure.

7
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,760
Gu Pingzhang

8
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,000
died?

9
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,960
Gu Pingzhang?

10
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,320
Gu Pingzhang?

11
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:26,920
Impossible.

12
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,960
There must be a cure.

13
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,240
I won't...

14
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,160
I won't let Yun Shang die.

15
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,720
I won't.

16
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,360
I've promised Yun Shang

17
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,120
a happy

18
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,720
and free life.

19
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:40,799
Now

20
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,040
I can't even save her life.

21
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,000
Yun Shang,

22
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,960
I'll save your life

23
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,240
even if it will cost my life.

24
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,560
Wu Ruan.

25
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,840
If one of us must die,

26
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,159
it should be me.

27
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,240
We'll marry the day after tomorrow?

28
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,040
Right.

29
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,680
Sis,

30
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,320
I thought it was just a casual remark.

31
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,840
It's too fast.

32
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,960
Yes, Miss Yun Shang.

33
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,920
It's so abrupt

34
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,360
that I'm not prepared.

35
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:44,960
What?

36
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,960
I can make a comment,

37
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,159
but what do you mean?

38
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,560
You don't want to marry me?

39
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,600
That's not what I mean.

40
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,919
I just think

41
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,640
it's too sudden.

42
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,159
Not at all.

43
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,520
So many things happened recently,

44
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,599
just take your marriage as a lucky charm.

45
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,360
Unless

46
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,240
you don't love Yun Luo.

47
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:11,960
Come on.

48
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,560
Lord.

49
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,240
How do I

50
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,960
answer that question?

51
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,920
Can't you man up?

52
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,560
Look,

53
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,360
I can express my affection directly.

54
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,400
Wu Ziqi.

55
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,760
I love you,

56
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,120
do you love me or not?

57
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,920
I...

58
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,560
Well...

59
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,719
I love you.

60
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:34,920
Problem solved.

61
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,360
I'll be relieved

62
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,560
when you get married.

63
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,040
Sis, why did you say that?

64
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,560
Why are you not relieved now?

65
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,960
Certainly,

66
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,159
you always disturb our affectionate life,

67
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,000
so we have to drive you out.

68
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,760
Sis, did you hear what he said?

69
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,200
He didn't say it wrong.

70
00:06:59,160 --> 00:06:59,920
All right.

71
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,800
It's settled.

72
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,560
We need to start

73
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,560
to prepare for it now.

74
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,159
You want to use yourself as bait

75
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,160
to draw the killers including 04

76
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,200
and blow up the mansion?

77
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,960
It's too dangerous.

78
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,760
Do you have to do that?

79
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,960
04 will come after Yun Shang,

80
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,760
and His Majesty won't

81
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,120
let her go, either

82
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,159
So I have to destroy the mansion

83
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,760
to get rid of those killers

84
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,320
and to make His Majesty

85
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,720
believe that Yun Shang

86
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,120
no longer exists.

87
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,080
Then

88
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,560
about Miss Yun Shang's Portent,

89
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,920
are you going to...

90
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,160
Don't worry.

91
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,960
I've made a plan.

92
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,760
Understood.

93
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,640
I'll make the arrangement now.

94
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,440
Be careful.

95
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,520
Move it left a bit.

96
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,160
Upward a bit.

97
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,719
Come here.

98
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,360
Be careful.
