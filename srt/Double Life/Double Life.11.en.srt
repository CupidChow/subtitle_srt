Episode 11

5
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:39,640
Excuse me.

6
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,000
The Emperor's brother-in-law had a big accident.

7
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,039
What happened?

8
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,759
He was wounded yesterday.

9
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:45,839
Is it serious?

10
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,120
How come I know that?

11
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,880
12.

12
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,520
Someone hired 12 to kill Wu Luan.

13
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,920
Did I get him into trouble?

14
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,280
To think it's 12.

15
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,440
Master.

16
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,760
Please let me go.

17
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,840
Just spare my pathetic life.

18
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,760
I'm begging you.

19
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,240
Please have mercy.

20
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,440
Eat one.

21
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,040
One jujube

22
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,360
for one head.

23
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,880
Since you've eaten two,

24
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,440
return one to me.

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,360
Give one back to me.

26
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,800
I'm sorry, Lord.

27
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,200
I knew the men of the Drizzle Pavilion would take action,

28
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,240
but I was careless and let you get wounded.

29
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,400
Don't worry.

30
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,760
Just a scratch.

31
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,240
I'll be fine in a few days.

32
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,480
To think their people took action so fast.

33
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,720
We can't take them lightly.

34
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:45,840
Yes.

35
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,799
Yun Shang?

36
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,000
Why did she come before I went to see her?

37
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,800
Was she the one sent to kill me?

38
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,800
Wu Luan.

39
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,159
I heard you were wounded

40
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,520
and came to see you.

41
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,000
Where is your lover?

42
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,800
What lover?

43
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,080
There is no one.

44
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,240
Come on.

45
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,960
Why are you so shy?

46
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,039
Stop pretending.

47
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,960
Even a dog could tell you love her.

48
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,840
So

49
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,400
you could tell it, too?

50
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,039
Are you suggesting that I'm a dog?

51
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,080
Sorry.

52
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,960
I didn't know the wound was there.

53
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,440
I...

54
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,080
Does it work?

55
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,200
Forget it...

56
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,040
You sound pretty strong.

57
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,080
So you have a good body.

58
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,520
It seems you are alright.

59
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,280
What else do you want to happen to me?

60
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,679
Be grateful.

61
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,280
I've sneaked out

62
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,760
without telling my father.

63
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,080
He

64
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,320
forbids you to see me?

65
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,360
Yes.

66
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,120
He used

67
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,800
to urge me to develop feelings for you.

68
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,280
Now he doesn't let me come here

69
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,680
when you were wounded.

70
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,280
The man

71
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,560
is getting old,

72
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,640
and I have no idea what he thinks.

73
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,160
All right.

74
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,360
Thank you for your kindness.

75
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,599
I appreciate it.

76
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,800
 I'll treat you to a meal next time.

77
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,520
Really?

78
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,200
It's a deal then.

79
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,400
Lord.

80
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,400
I have sent Miss Gu to her home.

81
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,080
I didn't spend so much time with Gu Weiru

82
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,040
in vain.

83
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,200
Gu Pingzhang is suspicious.

84
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,040
Tell our men to keep watching his mansion

85
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,919
strictly.

86
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,400
Yes.

87
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,800
Miss Yun...

88
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,560
Is still here.

89
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,560
Maybe

90
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,280
she's waiting for a chance to kill me.

91
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,960
Isn't it 23?

92
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:31,840
So,

93
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,360
you're interested in my prey?

94
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,560
Since we're colleagues,

95
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,880
I'll let you give him a slash.
