Episode 22

5
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,160
Your Majesty.

6
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,400
Your Majesty.

7
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,640
I have concealed one thing.

8
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,440
It's the assassin of the Drizzle Pavilion,

9
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,960
I didn't kill her.

10
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,759
You speak the truth at last.

11
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,000
Your Majesty.

12
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,600
When I bought their assassins

13
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,160
to kill Gu Pingzhang and me,

14
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,960
they ordered the assassin around me

15
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,560
to kill me.

16
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,679
Last night,

17
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,640
they sent another man to kill me.

18
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,720
Since the Pavilion abandoned her,

19
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,760
that means

20
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,560
they didn't want to kill Gu Pingzhang.

21
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,440
I kept her around me

22
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,560
to get the information about the Pavilion.

23
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,000
Now it's confirmed.

24
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,560
Your Majesty,

25
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,040
please give me the order

26
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,960
to arrest Gu Pingzhang now.

27
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,560
You have it.

28
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,800
Just keep this in your mind,

29
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,960
I only

30
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,440
trust someone

31
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,920
once.

32
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,320
23 and 24 thought they could get away,

33
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,560
I let them eat the One Mind already.

34
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,200
04.

35
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,360
Remember,

36
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,360
if you kill one of them,

37
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,560
the other will die, too.

38
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,480
I will see it done.

39
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,120
Since 23

40
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,359
and 24 betrayed us,

41
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,440
it's no longer safe here.

42
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,520
Pack up

43
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,560
and leave here immediately.

44
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,840
Yes.

45
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,840
9.

46
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,800
We were just over ten

47
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,920
when we first met.

48
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,560
You were upset when you knew

49
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,720
my rank was higher than you.

50
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,440
Master let me teach you moves,

51
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,560
and you clawed me

52
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,039
like a cat.

53
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,919
So our story started

54
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,159
and I fell in love with you then.

55
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,160
Well,

56
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,000
I have never seen

57
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,040
even one who has the same temper.

58
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,360
But what I loved was your temper.

59
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,360
You quarreled with Master for me.

60
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,560
Fearing that he might punish you,

61
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,840
I said something to make you mad.

62
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,160
Think about it now,

63
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,400
I was such a fool.

64
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,000
I love you so much,

65
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,000
but what I said were all bad words.

66
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,560
9.

67
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,719
I'm so regretful.

68
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,560
I didn't want to be Thousand-Man Slayer

69
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,440
I just wanted to be with you.

70
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,880
The killers of the Pavilion

71
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,159
have no idea about

72
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,880
what they are living for.

73
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,200
Now they have to kill each other.

74
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,240
Ridiculous.

75
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,840
Absurd.

76
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,719
9.

77
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,240
Wait for me.

78
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,440
When I kill them

79
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,400
to avenge you,

80
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,760
I'll come to your company.

81
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:46,180
"Grave of My Wife"

82
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,460
Residence of Lord

83
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,680
Though Wu Ruan won't kill me,

84
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,560
the Pavilion will send another guy

85
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,719
to kill me.

86
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,760
I am a dying person,

87
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,280
if I

88
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,240
implicate Wu Ruan...

89
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,200
Wu Ziqi and Brother went to the palace.

90
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,360
You call Wu Ruan

91
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,840
Brother?

92
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,239
I'm not blind.

93
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,120
You risked your life saving him

94
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,880
and he did the same thing last night.

95
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,680
If I couldn't see it

96
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,400
after all that you did,

97
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,919
I don't deserve to be your sister.

98
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,640
Wu Ruan is a kind man.

99
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,640
He doesn't even care about my past.

100
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,960
I was going to tell him my identity,

101
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,919
but he didn't care at all.

102
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,160
Anyway,

103
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,600
since 04 ran away,

104
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,360
the Pavilion will come after us.

105
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,799
What to do?

106
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,240
I was thinking about it, too.

107
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,760
We need to remind Wu Ruan.

108
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,760
There will be more assassins from the Pavilion,

109
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,159
so we need more men.

110
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:27,920
Yes.

111
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,040
Do it.

112
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,500
"I'll be back soon to kill you"

113
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,580
"Dacheng Tailors"

114
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,320
Stop searching.

115
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,320
It should be a clue sent by Yun Shang.

116
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,240
Look into the address on it later.

117
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,600
Where is the address?

118
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,719
Take a good look.

119
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,360
What is this paper?

120
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,160
It's from Dacheng Tailors on the west side.

121
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,960
If I am right,

122
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,760
the lair of the Pavilion should be there.

123
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,760
Understand.

124
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,800
All right then,

125
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,520
we should take action, too.

126
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,560
A moment, Prime Minister.

127
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,760
Huh?

128
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,080
Lord Wu.

129
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,560
What are you doing

130
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,960
at night?

131
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,160
Come with me

132
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,760
and you will know why.
