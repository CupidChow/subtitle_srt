Episode 1

5
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:48,600
Lord.

6
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,000
You were tailed when you were on the street

7
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
with Miss Yun last night.

8
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,600
She

9
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,839
tried that man

10
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,039
who was not strong.

11
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,480
So he wasn't from the Drizzle Pavilion.

12
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,640
But I haven't found out

13
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,440
who sent him.

14
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,840
Make it clear soon.

15
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,079
It's not safe here, either.

16
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,600
We shall go back.

17
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,040
Yun Shang.

18
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,040
Are you alright?

19
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,520
Keep him alive.

20
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,160
Yes.

21
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,239
Are you hurt?

22
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,400
I'm fine.

23
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,920
It's too dangerous here.

24
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,800
We must hurry back to my mansion.

25
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,440
Yun Shang.

26
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,799
His Majesty 

27
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,560
has cancelled my marriage with Gu Weiru.

28
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,520
I promise

29
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,000
I will marry you.

30
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,400
I know

31
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,320
you don't care about glory or wealth.

32
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,400
I promise

33
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,360
that I only love you in my life.

34
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,679
No matter what your past 

35
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,880
and the future are,

36
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,880
I will

37
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,799
share your worries.

38
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,280
Wu Luan, an idiot,

39
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,400
is impressive.

40
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,200
Someone paid so much to kill him,

41
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,440
but he survived 12.

42
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,920
I gave 

43
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,400
the Mooncleaver to 12 

44
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,479
on his first mission.

45
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,840
To think now...

46
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,200
I suspect

47
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,240
it was related to 23.

48
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,280
Better kill her by mistake

49
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,840
than let her go by mistake.

50
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,120
Pay attention to 23.

51
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,520
Yes.

52
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,280
Master.

53
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,880
We've received a deal to kill Wu Luan again

54
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,120
and this time

55
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,920
the buyer added a trade.

56
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,040
He wants

57
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,560
to kill Wu as well as Prime Minister,

58
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,440
Gu Pingzhang.

59
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,800
The price he offers is thrice of last time.

60
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,800
Get away.

61
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,760
Yes.

62
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,200
To think someone tries to kill me.

63
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,400
Interesting.

64
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,280
Come.

65
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,120
Welcome back.

66
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,040
Go to take a rest.

67
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,440
I have some business.

68
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,600
OK.

69
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,080
I'll be waiting at home.

70
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,760
09.

71
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,240
Show yourself.

72
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,720
When did you begin to like jujubes?

73
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,960
23.

74
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,000
Here's a mission for you.

75
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,640
Eat the Portent first.

76
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,440
Why is it

77
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,880
different from before?

78
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,360
Many people of the Pavilion died recently.

79
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,640
You know it.

80
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,000
This is life-saving medicine.

81
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,599
12 failed his mission.

82
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,000
You must not let Master down.

83
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,680
The Prime Minister.

84
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,320
Gu Pingzhang?

85
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,319
24.

86
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,000
You've joined us for many years.

87
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,920
You did well in the small mission before.

88
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,280
You can be a formal assassin now.

89
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,800
Thank you.

90
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,680
Can you

91
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,240
kill Wu Luan?

92
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,000
I will see it done.
