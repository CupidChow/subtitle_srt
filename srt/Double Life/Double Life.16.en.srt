Episode 16

5
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,560
Are you sure you can

6
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,520
kill Wu Ruan?

7
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,200
I will see it done

8
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,160
as you wish.

9
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,280
24.

10
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,600
Before you leave,

11
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,400
you should

12
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,440
eat the Portent first.

13
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,960
Why does it seem different?

14
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,480
It's your first formal mission,

15
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,280
so

16
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,920
Master told me to add one thing

17
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,880
to keep your life.

18
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,480
I don't understand it.

19
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,160
Why did you let me add the One Mind

20
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,079
to the sisters' Portents?

21
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,880
You're afraid that 23 will betray you,

22
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,880
so you're using it to control her?

23
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,680
But it's the kid's first mission,

24
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,079
if she is too green

25
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,680
to accomplish it,

26
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,280
her sister will die with her.

27
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,680
We have

28
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,000
lost several assassins already.

29
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,720
Well,

30
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,280
23 is no longer obedient

31
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,560
as before,

32
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,560
so I have to be vigilant.

33
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,280
If she is still loyal to me,

34
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,200
once 24

35
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,880
is in trouble,

36
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,679
she will help her.

37
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,520
Then

38
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,399
they'll all be safe.

39
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,120
Master.

40
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,160
What a wise move!

41
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,480
Wu Ziqi,

42
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,480
so?

43
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:27,880
He confessed.

44
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,640
He said...

45
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,080
Who?

46
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,880
He was sent by the Empress

47
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,560
to kill Miss Yun Shang.

48
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,360
Why did you come here?

49
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,960
Leave us.

50
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:12,880
Sister,

51
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,560
I didn't expect

52
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,880
it was you who wanted to kill me.

53
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,640
Wu Ruan.

54
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,280
What are you talking about?

55
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,599
How did I want you dead?

56
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,600
My target was just that bitch.

57
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,880
So you've admitted

58
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,760
that you sent those killers?

59
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:35,800
I...

60
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,320
Right.

61
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,280
I sent them.

62
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,080
Wu Ruan.

63
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,280
I did it for you.

64
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,760
You're supposed to have a promising future.

65
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,040
It took me

66
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,400
so much effort to ask His Majesty

67
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,960
to marry Gu Weiru to you.

68
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,480
Look at what you did!

69
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,520
You refused

70
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,280
because of that infamous prostitute.

71
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,280
Sister.

72
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,200
Don't talk about her in that way.

73
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,440
She has a name,

74
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,360
Yun Shang.

75
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,260
I dare not mention her

76
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,880
to His Majesty in case she'll be implicated.

77
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,820
But you're my family

78
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,159
who I don't want to lie to.

79
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,320
She

80
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,560
is my only love.

81
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,840
I don't care about her past

82
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,880
or future,

83
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,760
I

84
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,080
will only love her.

85
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,240
Wu Ruan.

86
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,280
Are you bewitched?

87
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,480
She's the best girl I've ever seen,

88
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,599
so

89
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,000
I will do my best to keep her safe.

90
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,960
If you try to kill her again,

91
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,280
I will

92
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,480
be the one to die.

93
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,000
It seems

94
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,360
His Majesty no longer trusts me.

95
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,120
If I can solve the case of the Drizzle Pavilion,

96
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,280
he may let me go because

97
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,640
of my contributions and my sister,

98
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,400
but he will definitely kill Yun Shang.

99
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,440
So I gotta find a way out for her right now.

100
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,680
The Birchleaf Pear Cakes,

101
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,080
and the Jujube and Flos Sophorae Cakes.

102
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,080
They should be all the things

103
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,280
I have to buy for Miss Yun Shang.

104
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,840
The Birchleaf Pear Cakes,

105
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,039
and the Jujube and Flos Sophorae Cakes.

106
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,840
What are you doing here, lass?

107
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,660
Here are ten coins.

108
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,760
Buy something to eat.

109
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,840
Take them,

110
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:57,760
well,

111
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,719
you can't beg here.

112
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,520
No.

113
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,540
What are you doing here

114
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,840
if you don't want the money?

115
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,440
Waiting for Lord Wu.

116
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,800
Why are you looking for him?

117
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,240
To get more money?

118
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,540
To kill him.

119
