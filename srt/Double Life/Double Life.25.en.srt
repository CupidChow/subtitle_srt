Episode 25

5
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,240
Sis.

6
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,080
To think

7
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,720
my sis

8
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,200
is going to marry.

9
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,480
Time passed so fast.

10
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,560
I lost out

11
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,320
because I didn't see your wedding.

12
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,640
When mine is done,

13
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,840
you two need to hold one wedding more.

14
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,880
All right.

15
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:37,920
Sis.

16
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,080
Does that Portent on your arm not matter?

17
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,920
Didn't I tell you?

18
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,160
The Pavilion was destroyed.

19
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,359
Of course, I'm alright.

20
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,440
It just looks scary.

21
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,720
Maybe

22
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,080
it will disappear later.

23
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,200
Really?

24
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:51,840
Yes.

25
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,480
All right then.

26
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,000
When you get married,

27
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,400
I can leave without worries.

28
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,000
Yun Shang.

29
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,560
There you are.

30
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,640
I've been looking for you.

31
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,640
Come with me.

32
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,960
I've got good stuff for you.

33
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,800
What good stuff?

34
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,360
I have to prepare for my sister's wedding.

35
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,359
It's their wedding, not ours.

36
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,280
Besides, there are many servants here.

37
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:23,840
Let's go.

38
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,080
Leave the business

39
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,360
to the others.

40
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,080
Let's go.

41
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:38,760
Come.

42
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,280
Be careful.

43
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,560
Come.

44
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,160
Sit here.

45
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,840
Be careful.

46
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,880
Sh.

47
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:29,880
How's that?

48
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,800
The fireworks are only for you.

49
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,320
I like it.

50
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,320
I love it.

51
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,120
There's more.

52
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,680
Look at this.

53
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,800
It is

54
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,320
a symbol of us?

55
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:29,760
Yes.

56
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,479
It's a precious hairpin.

57
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,560
I've named it

58
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,000
Yunluan Hairpin.

59
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,560
Yunluan Hairpin?

60
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,240
Yun Shang and Wu Luan

61
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,280
are in love forever.

62
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,640
In this life or the next,

63
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,840
we will always be together.

64
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,200
Yun Shang.

65
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,560
You're gorgeous.

66
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,240
Salute Heaven and Earth.

67
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,959
Salute the parents.

68
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,400
Salute each other.
