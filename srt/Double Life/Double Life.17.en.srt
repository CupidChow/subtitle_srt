Episode 17

5
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,240
Are you paid to come

6
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,039
to get the information here?

7
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,120
No.

8
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,520
You're a proud lass.

9
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,440
It's fine even if you have an ulterior motive.

10
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,280
Well,

11
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,479
how much you are paid?

12
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,480
I'll double it.

13
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,880
I can also give you some new clothes

14
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,360
and food.

15
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,080
Then tell me

16
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,600
who sent you, all right?

17
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,520
I told you

18
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,479
nobody.

19
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,160
Let me fetch you some food.

20
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,440
Just stay here.

21
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,440
Schmuck.

22
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,640
Recently,

23
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,120
some followed me,

24
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,240
some committed suicide,

25
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,840
but they were not from the Pavilion.

26
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,400
Now

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,560
I have received a new mission.

28
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,239
All those things are odd.

29
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,240
Yun Luo?

30
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,799
Sister?

31
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,760
You're here.

32
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,680
How did you...

33
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,360
Miss Yun.

34
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,840
You know each other?

35
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,160
Why did you suddenly come here?

36
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,040
I was supposed to perform a task a few months later,

37
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,720
but several members died recently.

38
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,920
So Master let me start work in advance.

39
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,360
You're still too young

40
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,440
to finish a job.

41
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,280
Don't underestimate me,

42
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,840
I'm 19 already.

43
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,720
Besides,

44
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,680
the rest people are good-for-nothing,

45
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,160
none of them is my match.

46
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,760
What is your mission then?

47
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
What are you looking at?

48
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,320
Lord.

49
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,400
Miss Yun's sister has arrived.

50
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,600
She's right inside.

51
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,479
Yun Shang's sister?

52
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,920
Isn't she a killer of the Drizzle Pavilion?

53
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,720
She said she'd kill you.

54
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,520
Anyway,

55
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,800
don't be scared.

56
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,240
She's just a small kid,

57
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,240
I can squish her with one hand.

58
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,960
This

59
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,840
is your mission?

60
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,640
This mission

61
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,599
is said to be much harder than the previous one.

62
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,080
I can take this chance

63
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,040
to see if I can finish this challenge.

64
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,719
You're still young,

65
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,360
don't always talk about killing.

66
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,719
We've grown up in the Pavilion.

67
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,800
To survive,

68
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,280
we had to train hard every day

69
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,559
to be the top assassins

70
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,120
because we had no choice.

71
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,880
But Yun Luo,

72
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,160
I have taken all the sufferings.

73
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,320
You don't have to follow in my footsteps.

74
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,560
You

75
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,400
don't want me to be a killer?

76
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,120
We have been through much

77
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,120
since our childhood.

78
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,240
Now you have left the Pavilion,

79
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,080
I will try

80
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,320
to keep you safe.

81
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,880
Since you don't want me to kill,

82
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,800
I can do as you say,

83
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,600
but

84
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,520
I have eaten the Protent.

85
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,520
Why don't you

86
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,320
let me finish this task first?

87
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:42,880
Don't worry.

88
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,680
I'll take care of it.

89
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,520
Yun Shang.

90
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,760
My job.

91
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,280
Let me kill him first.

92
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,640
Don't talk too much

93
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,840
and be my good sister.

94
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:58,920
Yun Shang.

95
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,240
You went to the Palace in the morning?

96
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,600
Have you eaten?

97
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,360
Not yet.

98
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,040
I've been waiting for you.

99
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,840
This is your sister?

100
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:19,960
How to address her?

101
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,320
Yun Luo.

102
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:22,719
Yun Luo.

103
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,360
This is Lord Wu Luan.

104
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,480
Wu Ziqi told me

105
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,039
he picked you up at the gate.

106
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,960
Where are you from?

107
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,280
The village.

108
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,840
To look for my sister.

109
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,480
OK.

110
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,520
Since you're Yun Shang's sister,

111
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,440
you're my sister, too.

112
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,160
Yun Luo.

113
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,160
Just settle down here.

114
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,320
Wu Ziqi.

115
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,080
Tell Mister Feng

116
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,440
to give Yun Luo a chamber.

117
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,280
Yes.

118
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,880
What do you want to eat?

119
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,000
Anything.

120
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,800
So Yun Shang's mission

121
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,680
is to kill Gu Pingzhang.

122
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,680
But Lord,

123
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,560
Yun Luo's mission is to kill you.

124
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,440
How to deal with her?

125
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,159
Yun Shang cares for her sister so much.

126
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,919
If she doesn't try to kill me,

127
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,960
don't go after her.

128
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,920
Try to be nice.

129
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,520
OK.

130
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,200
Since you said so,

131
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,520
I know what to do.

132
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,760
Considering her small body,

133
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,439
she can't be too strong.

134
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,760
Don't underestimate her.

135
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,400
Which killer of the Pavilion

136
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,720
is easy to handle?

137
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,599
OK.

138
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,319
I'll try to probe her mind.
