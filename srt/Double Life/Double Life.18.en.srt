Episode 18

5
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,480
Burglar.

6
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,200
Isn't he that guy?

7
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,240
So weak.

8
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,799
You're wounded.

9
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,480
Is there an assassin?

10
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,440
No. I just fell

11
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,600
Good night, Lord.

12
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,400
Wu Ziqi.

13
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,680
Where are you going at night

14
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,320
instead of sleeping?

15
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,520
To practice to grow stronger.

16
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,120
23 did well in her mission.

17
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:24,920
Here's her reward.

18
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,120
What is that?

19
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,600
I have no idea.

20
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,600
It's Soul-replacing.

21
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,200
Once another eats it,

22
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,480
your Portent will be transferred to him.

23
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,680
Take it, Yun Shang.

24
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,239
If you do well,

25
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,519
you'll all be rewarded.

26
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:49,760
Yun Luo.

27
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,080
Sister.

28
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,000
I didn't ask you yesterday.

29
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,820
What exactly between you and that dead meat...

30
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,640
What dead meat?

31
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,440
My mission target.

32
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,040
Since he'll die anyway,

33
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,400
isn't he dead meat?

34
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,080
He has a name,

35
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,000
Wu Ruan.

36
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,599
Fine. Wu Ruan.

37
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,000
What exactly is your relationship with him?

38
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,400
You want him to be your husband?

39
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,000
He is a dying man.

40
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,440
Yun Luo.

41
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,120
That's why I called you here.

42
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,320
You just left the Pavilion

43
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,039
and don't know how vicious the world is.

44
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,000
I don't want you

45
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,400
to be a killing tool of the Pavilion.

46
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,200
I know how

47
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,720
to expel your Portent.

48
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,600
You know it?

49
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,520
Yes.

50
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,920
If there is a way,

51
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,520
why don't you expel yours first?

52
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,680
You need it better than me.

53
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,200
I can't

54
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,240
do it alone

55
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,520
because it needs two people.

56
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,960
So, let me

57
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,440
take care of yours

58
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,080
and I can deal with mine later.

59
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,719
Really?

60
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,000
All right.

61
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,040
What do you need me to do?

62
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,040
No matter what happens

63
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,359
or what you'll see later,

64
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,919
do not panic.

65
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,240
When I eat this,

66
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,400
hold my hand tightly

67
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,200
and don't let go.

68
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,160
Yun Luo.

69
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,800
Do you get me?

70
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,280
Yes.

71
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,000
Sister.

72
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,840
Sister.

73
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,800
Sister.

74
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,440
Sister.

75
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,480
Sister.

76
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,440
Sister.

77
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,280
Sister.

78
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,479
What's wrong, sister?

79
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,400
Yun Shang.

80
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:40,919
Yun Shang.

81
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,080
Yun Shang.

82
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,200
What have you done to her?

83
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,320
She's your sister.

84
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,120
I don't know.

85
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,800
I did nothing.

86
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,000
She said she could cure me.

87
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,040
I didn't expect she'd...

88
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:36,599
She won't die

89
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,719
and she will wake up.

90
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,840
Let me prescribe to condition her body.

91
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,280
Thank you. This way, Doc. Wang.

92
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,600
Her condition...

93
00:08:59,520 --> 00:08:59,920
Do you...

94
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,240
Do your villagers

95
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,319
know how to cure her?

96
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,000
I don't know what she ate.

97
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,520
I never

98
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,240
saw it before.

99
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,280
Is there no way at all?
