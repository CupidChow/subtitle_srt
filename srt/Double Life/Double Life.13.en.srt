Episode 13

5
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:36,960
Lord.

6
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,480
I made it so clear in the letter.

7
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,000
We're people of different worlds.

8
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,440
Why must you

9
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,960
look for me?

10
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,880
Because I saw you

11
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,760
last night.

12
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,800
You saw me

13
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,840
last night?

14
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,280
Yes.

15
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,039
I saw you in the dream last night.

16
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,120
You're wounded,

17
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,920
you needn't bother to come here.

18
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,480
Where's Wu Ziqi?

19
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,600
I sent him back

20
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,120
so he wouldn't disturb us.

21
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,520
Why don't you go back to your mansion?

22
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,920
This house is too humble

23
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,680
for a noble like you.

24
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:30,560
Look,

25
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,960
since you've said it's a humble place

26
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,520
and nobody takes care of you.

27
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,160
Why don't you

28
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,920
go back with me?

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,520
Please go easy on me.

30
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,800
Since I decided to leave there,

31
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,880
I won't go back.

32
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,000
Fine.

33
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,600
If you don't go back with me,

34
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,400
I'm staying here.

35
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,720
For what purpose?

36
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,400
We're not

37
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,240
engaged

38
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,880
or married.

39
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,320
I'll marry you.

40
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,840
Anyway,

41
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,000
I stay.

42
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:32,800
Miss.

43
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,720
Want some vegetables?

44
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,320
This is?

45
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,600
I'm her husband.

46
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,320
I'm her husband.

47
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,359
Husband.

48
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,320
Nice.

49
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,680
Wu Luan.

50
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,600
We need to talk.

51
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,160
OK.

52
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:17,880
Wu Luan.

53
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,799
You're kind to me,

54
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,200
and I appreciate it.

55
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,240
The days I spent at your mansion

56
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,120
were the happiest time I ever had.

57
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,320
So thank you,

58
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,880
I mean it.

59
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,520
But there is

60
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,080
no future

61
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,520
for us.

62
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,160
You are the Emperor's brother-in-law,

63
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,000
but I...

64
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,599
I know myself well,

65
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,719
so I dare not

66
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,280
to be greedy.

67
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,160
Since you think you're happy with me,

68
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,720
why don't you ask for more?

69
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,719
Yun Shang.

70
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,320
I promise

71
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,840
that if you reach out,

72
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,600
the happiness will be in your hands firmly.

73
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,280
Thank you for your favor,

74
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,400
but the gap between us

75
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,320
is like the Milky Way

76
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,720
in the sky.

77
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,720
So, Lord,

78
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,280
please leave here

79
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,719
and don't come

80
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,680
to see me again.

81
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,520
Your wife

82
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,520
should be like Miss Gu.

83
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,520
Now

84
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,120
there's no distance between us.

85
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,520
Yun Shang.

86
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,320
I know you have many doubts.

87
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,160
If you feel insecure,

88
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,520
I'll try to reassure you.

89
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,719
Like I said,

90
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,880
you're the only love in my life.

91
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,640
If you don't want to go back,

92
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,640
well,

93
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,599
I'll stay with you,

94
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,760
living a simple life

95
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,599
forever.

96
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,640
If you want to go back with me,

97
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,240
I can promise you

98
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,680
a smooth life.

99
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,799
If you still don't believe it,

100
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,880
I can swear.
