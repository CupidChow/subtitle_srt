Episode 10

5
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,740
"Opened Personally by Wu Luan"

6
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,000
Help!

7
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,320
His Lordship is kidnapped.

8
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,720
Let me go.

9
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,320
Stay away.

10
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,520
I'll give you two options.

11
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,900
Either you go to tell His Majesty

12
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,620
that you don't want to marry me and you will

13
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,520
cancel the marriage.

14
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,480
That's what I'm going to do.

15
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,320
Or I tie you up like this and take you

16
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,320
to the Palace

17
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,440
so you may tell him.

18
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,760
Let me go.

19
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,280
I am going to cancel it.

20
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,359
It's pointless to say anything.

21
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,120
I am such an irrational person.

22
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,000
So you'll suffer if you marry me.

23
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,520
Make your choice now.

24
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,920
You mad woman.

25
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,320
I was going to cancel the marriage,

26
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,359
why did you tie me up?

27
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,000
You mean it?

28
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,900
If my guards hadn't left for business today,

29
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,400
how could I have been set up by you?

30
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,080
Curse if you want.

31
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,720
As long as you can persuade His Majesty to cancel it,

32
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,320
you may

33
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,720
scold or beat me as you like.

34
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,119
You're the best person, Lord.

35
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,080
When you get it done,

36
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,800
tell me whatever you want

37
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,320
and we will

38
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,520
be the people closer than a family.

39
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:47,820
Hall of Imperial Utterances

40
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:49,920
Halt.

41
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,679
Don't you know who I am?

42
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,520
Why do you stop me?

43
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,519
Lord, you're the one we have to stop.

44
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,360
His Majesty

45
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,400
ordered that you're not allowed in

46
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,040
if you come recently.

47
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,040
Let me in then.

48
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,480
I'm the daughter of the Prime Minister,

49
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,320
Gu Weiru.

50
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,480
His Majesty also ordered

51
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,320
that he won't see you, either.

52
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,739
Residence of Duke Guojiu

53
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:29,880
Yun Shang.

54
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,640
Yun Shang.

55
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,260
Since you're marrying a good woman,

56
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,040
it's pointless for me to stay.

57
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,640
May you have a bright future

58
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,880
and a happy marriage.

59
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,720
Please don't think about me again.

60
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:02,960
Lord.

61
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,320
Lord.

62
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,400
As you anticipated,

63
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,520
the person behind

64
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,400
tried to kill Sun Miao

65
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,200
on the way to exile

66
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,800
I tried to catch up with him,

67
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,000
but the assassin of the Drizzle Pavilion killed him first.

68
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,120
Su Miao

69
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,280
is dead.

70
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,400
Anyway,

71
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,560
there's something strange.

72
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,800
A businessman surnamed Wang here

73
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,120
cheered for it when he knew

74
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,320
Sun Miao was exiled.

75
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,000
I looked into it,

76
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,280
and it's said

77
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,200
that his only son was killed

78
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,800
by Sun Miao at a brothel

79
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,120
because they all wanted the same girl.

80
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,680
The Wangs

81
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,480
couldn't sue him,

82
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,720
so the case remains unsettled.

83
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,800
I followed that clue

84
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,120
and found out that the one who helped Sun Miao

85
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,280
was Prime Minister Gu Pingzhang.

86
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,880
I see.

87
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,040
I will investigate the relations

88
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,920
between them.

89
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,640
Yun Shang ran away from home.

90
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,840
Look for her.

91
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,040
Yes.

92
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,920
The Emperor's Daily Life.

93
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,680
Before he passed away,

94
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,820
the late Emperor summoned the senior courtiers.

95
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,880
Prince Pingxi and the Prime Minister Gu Pingzhang

96
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,600
seemed

97
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,120
to have quarreled.

98
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,320
Gu Pingzhang never offended anyone casually,

99
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,120
how could he quarrel with Prince Pingxi?

100
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,200
Was that a thing he could do?

101
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,840
And what did they quarrel about

102
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,599
at that special moment?

103
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,880
It was obscured intentionally.

104
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,400
Your Majesty.

105
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,840
When I read the official historians' records,

106
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,920
I found that his late Majesty

107
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,920
summoned the courtiers before he passed away.

108
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,920
Prime Minister Gu and Prince Pingxi

109
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,400
had a quarrel secretly.

110
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,520
What's more,

111
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,520
Su Miao killed a man at a brothel half a year ago

112
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,520
and he was helped out by Prime Minister Gu.

113
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,320
Since two people's deaths

114
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,039
were connected to him,

115
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,200
there must be something fishy.

116
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,520
Keep tracking it,

117
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,520
I want to see if Gu is related to the Drizzle Pavilion

118
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,360
Yes.

119
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,880
Your Majesty.

120
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,040
About my marriage with Miss Gu...

121
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,840
Wu Luan.

122
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,080
I know what you are up to.

123
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,640
If you do find something,

124
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,840
I won't let you be implicated by them.

125
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,080
Thank you.

126
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,600
Anyway, Your Majesty,

127
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,320
since there's little progress on investigating the Pavilion,

128
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:40,520
I have an idea.

129
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,280
I want to hire an assassin

130
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,320
to kill myself.

131
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:51,720
Lord.

132
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,000
I've found Miss Yun Shang.

133
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,480
Let's go.

134
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,320
Lord.

135
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:15,680
Lord.

136
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,479
Go.
