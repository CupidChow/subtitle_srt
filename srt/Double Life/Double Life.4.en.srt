Episode 4

5
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:35,800
Yes.

6
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,560
Understood, Lord.

7
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,520
Easy.

8
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,160
Lord wants

9
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,600
the Zui Xiang Restaurant's pig knuckle,

10
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,720
the Chun Jiang Restaurant's tea cake,

11
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,000
and Dong Xing Restaurant's Nu Er Hong Wine.

12
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,640
Buy them.

13
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,440
All right.

14
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,600
Send a man.

15
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:01,560
OK.

16
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:02,960
Keep an eye on them.

17
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:03,640
OK.

18
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,119
Let's go.

19
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,420
Residence of Prince Pingxi

20
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,000
Coming.

21
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:19,760
Here you are.

22
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,600
Hold it.

23
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,320
Watch while you are walking.

24
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,800
In this special period,

25
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,620
check for poison before serving.

26
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,400
You.

27
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,519
Come to try it.

28
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,480
It's poisoned.

29
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,560
Who dared do this?

30
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,200
Guards.

31
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,720
Lock down the mansion.

32
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,880
The mansion is strictly guarded

33
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,120
What can I do?

34
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,980
"Five days left."

35
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,240
Yun Shang.

36
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,359
It's such a chaotic era.

37
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,280
An assassin went to Prince Pingxi's mansion again.

38
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,079
His Majesty let me take care of

39
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,960
his birthday banquet to soothe him.

40
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,800
Look,

41
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,360
isn't it such a trouble?

42
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,400
Whose birthday banquet

43
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,520
did you just say?

44
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,360
Jiang Zhong, Prince Pingxi.

45
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:34,880
Come on.

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,440
You don't know that man?

47
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,560
The man those soldiers said was almost killed

48
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,040
when we first met.

49
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,040
Oh.

50
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,120
That rings a bell.

51
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,040
But I have no idea how to hold the banquet.

52
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,560
His Majesty told me

53
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,920
to hold it economically and grandly,

54
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,120
luxuriously and not vulgarly.

55
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,680
He won't show up

56
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,359
but just sends some gifts,

57
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,880
and leaves everything to me.

58
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,360
What should I do?

59
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,000
I have a suggestion.

60
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,880
What's it?

61
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,880
I suggest

62
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,080
we let off glittering fireworks

63
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,800
at the birthday banquet. 

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
In that case,

65
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,479
all the people of the capital may appreciate it,

66
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,320
and so does His Majesty.

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,800
Then

68
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,200
the banquet will be economical

69
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,320
and grand,

70
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,400
luxurious and not vulgar.

71
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,200
Nice suggestion.

72
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,760
However,

73
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,280
it took months

74
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,599
to buy fireworks in the past.

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,800
Now

76
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,320
there are just a couple of days left.

77
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,720
Easy.

78
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,960
I know a nice store out of the city

79
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,919
named the Radiance Shop.

80
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,039
There will be plenty

81
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,080
of goods.

82
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,200
Very well.

83
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,719
Tomorrow,

84
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,560
let's go

85
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,960
to the Radiance Shop.

86
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,000
A man

87
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,360
was selling ratsbane on the street.

88
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Someone asked

89
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,000
how to use it.

90
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,200
The man answered,

91
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,160
"Catch the rat

92
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,080
and apply it

93
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,599
to its mouth,

94
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,160
then it will die."

95
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,200
You're attractive when you smile.

96
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,560
You should smile more.

97
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,600
I have many jokes.

98
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Let me tell you another one.

99
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,480
Well,

100
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,560
an old man

101
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,200
wore a winter hat in summer.

102
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:35,960
What

103
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,880
do you want?

104
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,560
They are rich.

105
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,200
Yes.

106
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,000
That's enough.

107
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,400
Don't touch here.

108
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,200
Let's drink.

109
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,400
Don't move.

110
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,120
You hide it so secretly.

111
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,400
Heroes,

112
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,800
this is not a good place for you.

113
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,400
How about I give you some money

114
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,800
so you can have a good life?

115
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,720
Shut up.

116
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,800
Why do you keep talking crap?

117
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,320
I can chop you, you clear?

118
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,239
The old man wore a winter hat.

119
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,280
And?

120
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,159
The old man wore a winter hat.

121
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,960
And

122
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,400
he fanned while walking.

123
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,320
He kept fanning.

124
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,320
"So hot.

125
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,920
I'm lucky to have this hat,

126
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,160
or I'll be baked."

127
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:20,960
Not...

128
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,719
not funny?

129
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,040
Can you promise us a good life

130
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,920
with such money?

131
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,920
The woman is good-looking.

132
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,640
Well,

133
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,159
we can enjoy her.

134
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,800
Don't move.

135
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,080
Those bandits are nobodies, 

136
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,000
but if I fight them,

137
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,080
Wu Luan will know my identity.

138
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,960
I need another way.

139
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,520
We can sell her to a brothel afterward

140
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,680
to get some money.

141
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,840
Bah!

142
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,000
Huh?

143
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,640
Take the money if you want,

144
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,200
why do you bully a girl?

145
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,560
Beat him.

146
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:38,280
Harder!

147
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,659
If you wanna die,

148
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,079
then we'll do you a favor.

149
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,440
That joke

150
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,680
was so funny.

151
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,760
He is somebody.

152
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,560
If you kill him,

153
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,960
you'll never have a peaceful life.

154
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,920
Why don't you keep him alive

155
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,080
and ask his family for more silver?

156
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,120
With the silver,

157
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,240
you may

158
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,120
have any kind of pretty girls

159
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,240
as you want.

160
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,000
The lad is interesting.

161
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,920
Keep him.

162
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,440
He may live,

163
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,560
but we need more money.

164
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,079
OK.

165
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,760
How much do you want?

166
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,520
50,000 taels of silver.

167
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,079
No.

168
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,120
Gold.

169
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,160
If we are not paid,

170
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,360
I will sell both

171
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,760
of you to the brothel.

172
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,240
OK.

173
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,959
I'll write to my family.

174
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,240
Don't stop.

175
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,200
Keep saying.

176
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,560
Hero,

177
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,920
I have told you all the jokes.

178
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,840
There are no more.

179
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,640
This is not good.

180
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,640
Wu Yuan keeps bleeding,

181
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,240
he can't hold on for long.

182
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,920
Brother,

183
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,120
is he fooling us?

184
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,240
It's been so long

185
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,520
and there is no news at all.

186
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,240
Keep thinking.

187
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,120
I'm sure we are fooled.

188
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:28,840
That's enough.

189
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,160
Let me chop him.
