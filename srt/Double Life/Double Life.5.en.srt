Episode 5

5
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,920
Brother,

6
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,040
is he fooling us?

7
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,280
It's been so long

8
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,720
and there is no news at all.

9
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,480
Keep thinking.

10
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,320
I'm sure we are fooled.

11
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,240
That's enough.

12
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,480
Let me kill him.

13
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,320
Brother.

14
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:01,919
I didn't mean it.

15
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,480
Hurry.

16
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:33,920
Hurry.

17
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,519
This way.

18
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,720
This way.

19
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,239
This way.

20
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,400
Go.

21
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,360
Save His Lordship.

22
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:46,960
Hurry.

23
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,280
He's in there.

24
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,480
Lord.

25
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,320
Are you alright?

26
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:56,800
Where did you hurt?

27
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,320
How are you holding up?

28
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,840
I'm fine.

29
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,280
I need to look for Yun Shang.

30
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,000
Be careful.

31
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,800
Yun Shang.

32
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,040
Yun Shang.

33
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,560
Are you alright?

34
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,960
I'm alright.

35
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,880
You?

36
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,840
I'm fine.

37
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,800
Let me take you home.

38
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,720
To think she exposed herself

39
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,560
to save me.

40
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,760
You

41
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,440
are the first man who has entered this chamber.

42
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,159
Mister.

43
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,920
Have this drink

44
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,600
and I

45
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,200
will be yours.

46
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,239
It's just

47
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,159
I don't drink in this way.

48
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,160
Wu Ziqi.

49
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:58,760
Lord?

50
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:19,960
What are you waiting for?

51
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,719
Go get her.

52
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,120
Yes.

53
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,160
Go.

54
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,799
It never occurs to me

55
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,159
that it takes us no effort to find her.

56
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,520
Let's go.

57
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,080
We have kind of

58
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,159
risked our lives together.

59
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,760
Tell me what you want,

60
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,840
and I'll see it done.

61
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,640
Anything will do?

62
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,560
Of course.

63
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,640
Actually,

64
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,280
my hope is quite simple.

65
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,160
I just want to watch the fireworks.

66
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,480
I haven't

67
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,000
seen it carefully once yet.

68
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,840
What I saw

69
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,760
was the others' wonderful life.

70
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,880
So

71
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,960
if you show me once,

72
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,440
I'll be satisfied.

73
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,440
That's easy.

74
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,200
We happen to hold a birthday banquet for Prince Pingxi.

75
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:08,920
I'll take you there

76
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,360
by then.

77
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,960
Thank you.

78
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,920
What's this?

79
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,000
It's a disease

80
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,479
I've had since I was a kid.

81
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,280
It appears from time to time.

82
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,320
Forget it.

83
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,280
I was seriously ill too as a boy

84
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,920
and couldn't be cured.

85
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,080
My mother was so anxious

86
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,280
that she went to pray to the gods.

87
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,080
A monk gave her

88
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,320
this red thread.

89
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,640
It was marvelous

90
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,040
that I recovered

91
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,400
after I put it on.

92
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,280
Let me help you to wear it

93
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,640
and you

94
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,880
will be fine, too.

95
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,280
The Radiance Shop.

96
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,520
Can such a humble place

97
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,280
provide the goods I need?

98
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,559
This shop is different.

99
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:35,760
If it shows all the goods,

100
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,760
what if a fire breaks out?

101
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,360
Mister,

102
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,000
you can choose goods

103
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,880
on this.

104
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,360
This.

105
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,360
This.

106
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:49,959
This.

107
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,600
And...

108
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,160
Forget it.

109
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,320
Give me three

110
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,760
for each of them.

111
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,600
What do you think?

112
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,160
It's your call.

113
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:03,959
Sent them

114
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,800
to Prince Pingxi's mansion three days later.

115
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,920
All right, Mister.

116
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,960
Shall we go?
