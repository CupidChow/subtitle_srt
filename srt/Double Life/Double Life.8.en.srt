Episode 8

5
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,760
Have you got rid

6
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,360
of that assassin?

7
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:43,940
Lord.

8
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,480
Mister Feng said

9
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,880
Ms. Yun Shang has cooked for you

10
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,640
and is waiting for you.

11
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,080
Not now.

12
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,080
Let's go to the Radiance Shop

13
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,240
to catch its owner.

14
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:10,759
Lord.

15
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,240
Nobody is here.

16
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,400
Since nobody's here,

17
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,080
why don't you blow it up?

18
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,560
Run, Lord.

19
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,959
Look, Lord.

20
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,600
Nobody is here.

21
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,480
Since nobody's here,

22
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,280
why don't you blow it up?

23
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,960
It makes me annoyed to see those fireworks.

24
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,200
Understood.

25
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,280
I'll set them off.

26
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,760
Go ahead.

27
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,840
Run away afterward

28
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,160
in case you get hurt.

29
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:42,959
OK.

30
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,640
Run, Lord.

31
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,480
Take him away.

32
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,160
Yes.

33
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,800
I'm just a fireworks seller.

34
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,080
Why do you catch me?

35
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,680
Move.

36
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:05,880
Stop nagging.

37
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,680
Be gentle.

38
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,040
Guys,

39
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,040
I'm innocent.

40
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,480
I'm really innocent.

41
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,680
Listen to me.

42
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,160
I know nothing.

43
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,600
Move.

44
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,480
Why is the red line on him

45
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,960
stretching to the chest?

46
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,600
Lord.

47
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,680
I found the same red line

48
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,360
on the arm of Assassin 18 as Yun Shang's.

49
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,440
What's more,

50
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,960
the red line keeps extending upward.

51
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,800
It goes up from the left wrist

52
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,960
to the heart.

53
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,880
It seems to be nearer to the heart.

54
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,799
Has it reached the heart?

55
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,880
So it's like what I guessed.

56
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,680
If the people of the Drizzle Pavilion fail,

57
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,280
the red line

58
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,520
will take their life.

59
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,440
Interrogate the owner of the Radiance Shop.

60
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,040
Yes.

61
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,440
Lord.

62
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,480
Did he confess?

63
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,880
I just threw the assassin's body in front of him

64
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,960
and said nothing yet,

65
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,000
he confessed at once.

66
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,880
The owner of his shop

67
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,260
is General Sun Miao of the Capital Garrison.

68
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,880
How dare Sun Miao

69
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,360
get into influence peddling?

70
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,159
Take our men to arrest him now.

71
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,160
Yes.

72
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,600
Your job is done,

73
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,880
why are you still here?

74
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,560
It's the safest place.

75
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,120
At least,

76
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,280
I'll leave when they stop searching.

77
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,000
What's your business?

78
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,560
Did Master agree to let Yun Luo be with me?

79
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,360
18 failed his mission

80
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,120
and died.

81
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,080
Someone is looking into the Pavilion.

82
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,360
So it's not safe in the capital,

83
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,800
you'd better leave here and hide up

84
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,760
for a while.

85
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,680
How is Yun Luo?

86
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,680
Just take care of yourself.

87
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,160
Yun Luo.

88
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,560
Are you alright?

89
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:42,800
24.

90
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,360
You're brutal even to your colleagues?

91
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,480
I can go out to kill people.

92
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,880
Master.

93
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,080
It's confirmed that 18 was killed by the Portent.

94
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,880
I was followed many times.

95
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,400
Something seems off.

96
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,680
24

97
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,880
is a good fighter.

98
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,960
She seems to be more capable than her sister.

99
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,600
Master.

100
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,240
You gave 23 the word

101
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,880
that you'd let 24 follow her

102
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,960
if she could kill Prince Pingxi.

103
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,600
I have changed my mind.
