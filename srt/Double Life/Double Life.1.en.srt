Episode 1

5
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,440
Keep up.

6
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,840
Over there.

7
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,920
Don't let him get away.

8
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,039
Go.

9
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,399
This way.

10
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,480
Stop.

11
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,440
Hurry.

12
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,800
He's there.

13
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,640
Stop. Go.

14
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,920
Come on.

15
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:58,800
Go.

16
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,320
Catch up.

17
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,679
Split up.

18
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,080
Go.

19
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,280
Hurry.

20
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,720
You,

21
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,840
go check there.

22
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,320
Yes.

23
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:40,840
This way.

24
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,600
Come.

25
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,520
This way.

26
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,040
Hurry.

27
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,600
I...

28
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,359
Step aside.

29
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,920
The capital government

30
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,720
is chasing an assassin.

31
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,040
Clear off.

32
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,920
Alas.

33
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,280
All the celebrities of the capital are here?

34
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,400
Yun Shang.

35
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,880
So many people,

36
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,520
which one to pick?

37
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,320
Mistress Ho.

38
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,799
Didn't you agree

39
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,400
to let me

40
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,600
make the choice?

41
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,880
Certainly.

42
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,359
As long as you agree to do business.

43
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:45,960
All right.

44
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,000
Take your time.

45
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,280
I'm out.

46
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,040
It's less than ten days since the task was assigned.

47
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,040
Now it has grown to here.

48
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,920
Within 20 days,

49
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,040
your Portent

50
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,239
will spread rapidly.

51
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,440
From here

52
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,240
to there

53
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,200
and then your heart.

54
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,080
Bang.

55
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,800
Don't need to remind me.

56
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,719
I know the time

57
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,760
and I'll do it tonight.

58
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm not here to urge you,

59
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,600
but to remind you

60
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,200
that Prince Pingxi isn't like those rabbles.

61
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,680
To assassinate him is not easier than to kill the Emperor.

62
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,240
Tonight, he will entertain Gu Pingzhang, the Prime Minister,

63
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,599
but it's not a good chance to do it.

64
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,360
His mansion is always strictly guarded,

65
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,960
so I only stand a chance on a feast.

66
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,320
There will be a grand opening ceremony tonight.

67
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,719
Nobody will suspect me.

68
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,280
I know you want to finish the job quickly

69
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,680
and ask Master

70
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,960
to let your sister go.

71
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,280
But if you lose your life,

72
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,000
how do you save her?

73
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,640
Humph.

74
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,440
I've finished 98 tasks.

75
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,320
This time

76
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,120
I will see it done, too.

77
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,480
As you know,

78
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,560
nobody idles in the Drizzle Pavilion.

79
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,960
You should leave.

80
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,200
I'm going down to pick a man.

81
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,480
What kind of a man

82
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,840
can you pick with your poor taste?

83
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,440
A pretty

84
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,240
idiot.

85
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,480
There's no place I can't go in the capital.

86
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,480
Take the money.

87
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,240
Come on.

88
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,640
I must get the courtesan today.

89
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,240
Someone's giving out money upstairs.

90
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,800
Let's go.

91
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,840
Let's take the money.

92
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,840
I've got it.

93
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,000
How do you like the capital?

94
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,200
I mean no offense,

95
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,400
isn't it more luxury than your Shanxi?

96
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,120
Mister Wu.

97
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,160
A new courtesan comes here tonight.

98
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,200
A courtesan?

99
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,920
In Shanxi,

100
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,440
all the girls there

101
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,600
are all mine,

102
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,919
let alone a courtesan.

103
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,760
A rich idler

104
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,440
from another place.

105
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,360
It shall be you.

106
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:37,880
Come on.

107
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,840
Have a good fight

108
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,400
with my General Cyclone.

109
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,080
It's the courtesan.

110
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,560
Come on.

111
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,719
Mister.

112
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,280
I'm here. Look at me.

113
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,600
Over here.

114
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,520
Watch this way.

115
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,800
Come on.

116
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,640
Bite it.

117
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,240
Go.

118
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,600
Lady, come to my home.

119
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,080
Throw it to me.

120
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,800
Go. Bite its leg.

121
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,719
Come on.

122
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,800
Bite it.

123
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,080
I won.

124
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,760
Who's that guy?

125
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,920
Why did he get it?

126
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,920
She threw it to him.

127
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,680
Although

128
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,280
I live in a brothel,

129
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,680
you

130
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,439
are the first man who has entered this chamber.

131
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,640
So tonight

132
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,560
is equivalent to my wedding night.

133
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,880
Please be gentle to me.

134
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,319
Mister.

135
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,240
Have this drink

136
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,000
and I

137
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,600
will be yours.

138
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,640
Ah.

139
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,280
I am Wu Luan

140
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,080
and am invited to this Daintysleeve Pavilion for a drink

141
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,480
instead of having fun.

142
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,240
I didn't expect

143
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,040
you'd be in such a good mood.

144
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,960
Could you tell me the name?

145
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,120
If you want to know,

146
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,400
have this cross-cupped wine with me

147
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,120
and I'll tell you.

148
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,960
Are you shy?

149
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,160
Me?

150
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,400
Yes.

151
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,800
I'm shy?

152
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,959
It's just

153
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,360
I don't drink in this way.

154
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,160
So tell me

155
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,000
your way.

156
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,480
Like this.

157
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,560
Now

158
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,079
could you tell me your name?

159
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,320
Yun Shang.

160
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,680
Yun Shang?

161
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,200
Her robe is made of clouds, her face is as pretty as flowers.

162
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,560
I'm sure that is the origin

163
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,560
of your name.

164
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,719
No.

165
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,680
She died young because of the soul reaper,

166
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,920
she will only have peace by taking one life.

167
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,360
The Shang in my name

168
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,560
means dying young.

169
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,959
Oh.

170
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,880
That's a special name.

171
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,600
It doesn't sound

172
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,839
like a name for a lady in this place.

173
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:31,959
Lady,

174
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,400
are you a member here?

175
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,120
You look

176
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,880
like a noble lady.

177
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,120
You can still drink so much like before, Lord.

178
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,360
Lord Gu.

179
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,120
No need to walk me out.

180
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,200
I admit my defeat.

181
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:16,800
Lord Gu.

182
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,440
We never got drunk before.

183
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,319
Lord Gu. Watch the stairs.

184
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,680
Are you alright?

185
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,880
Don't see me out.

186
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,680
I am drunk already.

187
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,800
Lord Gu.

188
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,400
Please.

189
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,640
No need to walk me out.

190
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,840
How do I deserve this?

191
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,480
I'll ask a servant to send you.

192
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,840
That's not necessary.

193
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,440
I have my own servants.

194
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,760
Let's continue another day.

195
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,520
Have a good drink again.

196
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,280
Lord Gu.

197
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,560
I will go to visit you.

198
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,560
Close the gate.

199
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:55,880
My Lord.

200
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,760
I'm sure that cunning Gu Pingzhang

201
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,560
faked stumbling

202
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,719
just now.

203
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,719
I will get what I want

204
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,560
now that I've come to the capital.

205
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,640
That old fox refused to help you,

206
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,319
he will be a thorn in the flesh.

207
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,160
Assassin!

208
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,720
Protect His Lordship.

209
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,439
Catch her.

210
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,320
Hurry.

211
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:40,880
Go.

212
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,600
Arrest her.

213
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,240
What are you waiting for?

214
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,840
Go get her.

215
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,280
Yes.

216
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,520
Go.

217
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,880
He has woken up so soon.

218
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,160
I won't go back.

219
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,520
I won't go back.

220
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,959
No. I won't go back.

221
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,199
I...

222
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:50,840
Step aside.

223
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,400
The capital government

224
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,199
is chasing an assassin.

225
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,520
Clear off.

226
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,439
It's His Majesty's brother-in-law.

227
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,800
Assume I've never been here.

228
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:06,760
Let's go.

229
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:13,920
You...

230
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,720
are the Emperor's brother-in-law?
