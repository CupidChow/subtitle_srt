Episode 20

5
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,399
So,

6
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,080
still want to pick on me?

7
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,680
Now you can't get away.

8
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,039
Show me what you can do.

9
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:02,960
What?

10
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,800
Don't you have a sense of morality?

11
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,320
You've spent the whole day beating Wu Ziqi?

12
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,240
Yun Luo.

13
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,480
This place

14
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,280
is not like the Drizzle Pavilion,

15
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,480
and Wu Ziqi isn't your sparring partner.

16
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,280
Why did you keep badgering him?

17
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,240
I'm not taking him as the sparring partner.

18
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,280
Then what do you take him as?

19
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,079
A funny

20
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,000
thing.

21
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,519
He is not a thing,

22
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,840
but a friend.

23
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,200
So that is a friend?

24
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:09,880
Yes.

25
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,480
Since you enjoy having fun with Wu Ziqi,

26
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,120
you shouldn't always beat him

27
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:14,960
or

28
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,600
he'll be scared away.

29
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,480
He will be scared away?

30
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,280
Yes.

31
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,240
Fair enough.

32
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,840
He's so weak.

33
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,200
All right.

34
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,679
I'll try to hit him slighter.

35
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,440
You

36
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,480
spare your effort.

37
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,840
You can't get

38
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,080
what you want from me.

39
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,840
I am losing my patience.

40
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,520
You have no patience?

41
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,480
Then why don't you kill me?

42
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,679
Kill you?

43
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:17,680
Move.

44
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,279
Keep up.

45
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,240
How dare you threaten me with my family?

46
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,720
So base.

47
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,520
Base?

48
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,480
Am I baser than you people of the Drizzle Pavilion?

49
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,679
Can you remember how many people you've killed?

50
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,440
You'd better give up.

51
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,400
I'll tell you nothing.

52
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,280
How to expel the Portent?

53
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,280
If you tell me,

54
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,280
I may consider letting your son go.

55
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,920
The Portent

56
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,480
is made of the target's hair

57
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,000
and the poison

58
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,640
in a secret way.

59
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,200
The assassin must kill the target within 30 days

60
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,200
after he takes it,

61
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,920
or

62
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,520
he'll die.

63
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,480
Die?

64
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,200
Only the Soul-replacing can transfer it

65
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,000
onto

66
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,480
a scapegoat.

67
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,640
Then give it to me.

68
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,920
How can Master let me

69
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,440
take such a crucial thing?

70
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,040
Can you make it now?

71
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,160
It will only

72
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,920
take a few days to make a Portent,

73
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,919
but

74
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,040
the Soul-replacing

75
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,719
takes

76
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,040
100 days.

77
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,280
You agreed to let my son go.

78
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,039
You agreed to let my son go.

79
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,640
Let him go.

80
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,640
Father.

81
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,720
Darling.

82
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,120
Father.

83
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,680
I have confirmed

84
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,919
that Lord Wu's men took the miracle doctor away.

85
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,680
Wu Ruan.

86
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,680
I underestimated him.

87
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,680
I was supposed

88
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,280
to know when someone paid

89
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,840
for his life.

90
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,680
It seems I can't

91
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,600
keep Wu Ruan alive.

92
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,880
Summon Thousand-Man Slayer.

93
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:48,920
Master.

94
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,640
09, 04.

95
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,920
You'll go to Lord Wu's mansion tonight.

96
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,640
Whether it's 23

97
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,640
or 24,

98
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,480
kill them all.

99
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,880
Yes.

100
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,199
What?

101
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,520
Dare not go home because of that cat's scratch?

102
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,960
Cat?

103
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,760
Yun Luo is a tiger.

104
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,660
By the way,

105
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,040
how did the interrogation go?

106
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,280
The doctor's medicine is in the Pavilion.

107
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,200
So

108
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,920
we need to locate it as soon as possible.

109
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,280
Don't be too nervous.

110
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,440
I have

111
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,200
checked all the Birchleaf Pear woods around

112
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,280
except for the one in the western suburb.

113
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,079
Give me seven days and I'll get it done.

114
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,660
I'm afraid it's too late.

115
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,319
You're late.

116
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,000
You finish talking?

117
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,160
Lord, go now.

118
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:45,880
Go?

119
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,240
You can't.
