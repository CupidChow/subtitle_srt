Episode 19

5
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,079
How could you be so stupid?

6
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,680
You transferred the poison

7
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,880
to yourself without telling me.

8
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,480
You are right

9
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,120
to think for Yun Luo.

10
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,960
But what shall I do if something happens

11
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,880
to you?

12
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,080
Yun Shang.

13
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,200
You've come to.

14
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,600
Don't move.

15
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,880
I'll call an imperial physician here

16
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,480
to see if you are alright.

17
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,520
What do you want to eat

18
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,080
and drink?

19
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:44,799
Steamed buns?

20
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,600
Porridge?

21
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,400
I'm fine.

22
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,640
Don't worry.

23
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,360
I was so scared.

24
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,000
Lord.

25
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,760
As you ordered,

26
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,560
I caught a physician of the Pavilion.

27
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,960
According to him,

28
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,680
Miss Yun transferred the mission

29
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,960
of killing you to herself.

30
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,880
Just as I guessed.

31
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,880
She wants to kill herself

32
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,400
to avoid getting us into trouble.

33
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,760
I'll interrogate that physician.

34
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,800
You stay to keep them safe.

35
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:49,920
At present,

36
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,080
their safety matters.

37
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,360
Yes.

38
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,560
You

39
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,760
make the Portent, right?

40
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,360
What are you doing?

41
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,719
What are you doing?

42
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,960
Watching us?

43
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,880
I'm protecting you.

44
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,280
With your poor skills?

45
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,200
Your skills are poor.

46
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,400
Let's fight if you dare.

47
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,640
Bring it on.

48
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,240
Come here.

49
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:44,840
Stop.

50
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,080
How could she

51
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,960
hit one's crotch?

52
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,440
I was lucky to dodge her swiftly.

53
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,680
Yun Luo isn't a kitten

54
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,040
but a little tiger.

55
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,880
I need to practice harder

56
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,880
before His Lordship thinks I'm useless.

57
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,760
It's such a boring place.

58
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,560
Wu Ziqi may practice with me.

59
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,679
Let me find him to kill time.

60
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,479
Yun Luo. I know it's you.

61
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,040
That's not funny.

62
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,359
You should pretend not to know.

63
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,880
A hero shouldn't sneak up on others.

64
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,360
I'm a girl,

65
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,240
not a hero.

66
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,920
Besides,

67
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,960
I won.

68
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,640
A man shouldn't fight a girl.

69
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,080
A man shouldn't chicken out.

70
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,480
A long plan is to endure present hardships for the future.

71
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,479
You ran away after losing?

72
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,280
Just wait.

73
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,560
There is no escaping.

74
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,079
It hurts.

75
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,039
I'm so bored.

76
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,679
Come and fight me.

77
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,199
Ouch.

78
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,280
I have business with His Lordship.

79
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,000
Just come.

80
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,520
You smashed my bowl!

81
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,680
I'll fight you to the end!
