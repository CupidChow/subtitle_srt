Episode 23

5
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,920
Why

6
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,920
did he leave so fast

7
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,040
and wasn't back yet?

8
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,280
You agreed to chat with me.

9
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,200
Why do you always think about him?

10
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,560
No.

11
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,680
Let's chat.

12
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,920
What to talk about?

13
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,400
Yun Luo.

14
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,520
Tell me,

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,040
do you like this ordinary life?

16
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,920
Of course.

17
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,080
Though we both were in the Pavilion,

18
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,400
it was so hard to talk with you.

19
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,600
It wasn't as free then as it is now.

20
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,519
I can see you anytime

21
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,440
and beat Wu Ziqi as I want.

22
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,160
Haven't you two

23
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,560
become so intimate?

24
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,720
Why do you still want to beat him?

25
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,480
It's also a way to show my love.

26
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,680
So it's love now?

27
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,200
Anyway,

28
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,760
I think he is a nice guy.

29
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,240
Tell me then,

30
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,240
if

31
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,880
I let you marry your love,

32
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,280
will you?

33
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,040
Indeed I love him

34
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,840
and can fight him every day if I marry him,

35
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,400
but...

36
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,880
Anyway, it shall be done quickly.

37
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,359
People often in a precarious situation like us

38
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,079
don't know what will happen tomorrow.

39
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,640
We shall waste no time.

40
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,280
I will try to find a way

41
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,840
to let you

42
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,560
have a peaceful life when you are married.

43
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,399
I have no idea what you are talking about.

44
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,040
The Drizzle Pavilion?

45
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,280
Never heard of it.

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,800
It's fine.

47
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,000
It doesn't matter if you confess or not.

48
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,400
The proof

49
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,720
is right here.

50
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,839
As for the witnesses,

51
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,920
we've brought back many people from the Pavilion.

52
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,160
I'm sure

53
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,560
someone will confess.

54
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,320
By the way,

55
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,960
my men

56
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,120
have been to your mansion.

57
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,320
Leave us.

58
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,520
Yes.

59
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,000
Your Majesty.

60
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,880
Gu Pingzhang confessed.

61
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,120
The late Emperor was a Buddhist,

62
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,640
and Gu profited from the rituals.

63
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,320
In the past years,

64
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,560
he earned much illegal silver through that way.

65
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,400
When you took the throne,

66
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,880
you cut fees for religious uses.

67
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,000
So they took risks

68
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,520
to kill the officials you sent

69
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,040
and fabricated a tale

70
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,520
that officials died from offending the gods.

71
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,440
As such, they could get away.

72
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,920
That was monstrous.

73
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,480
How could Gu Pingzhang do those treacherous things?

74
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,440
Your Majesty.

75
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,120
The money embezzled

76
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,240
by Gu Pingzhang was countless.

77
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,760
My men

78
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,440
has been digging the money in his yard

79
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,920
since last night.

80
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,120
That traitor

81
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,080
shall not be forgiven.

82
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,640
What about the Drizzle Pavilion?

83
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,840
Is Gu its master?

84
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,719
Did he raise so many assassins

85
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,720
to rebel?

86
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,520
Gu is the master of the Pavilion.

87
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,920
But he said

88
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,760
that he built it

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,400
to do murder business

90
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,800
and to get rid of his enemies

91
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,080
and those who hindered him from making money.

92
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,640
Gu Pingzhang had no intention to rebel?

93
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,400
To consolidate his post,

94
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,720
Gu was even forced to fawn over Prince Pingxi.

95
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,720
Then Pingxi was satisfied.

96
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,600
When he came back this time,

97
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,200
he asked Gu to pay for his rebellion,

98
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,040
which was against Gu's will.

99
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,000
So he took the risk

100
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,680
and used the Pavilion

101
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,200
to kill Pingxi.

102
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,599
Then shouldn't I thank him

103
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,640
for favoring embezzlement instead?

104
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:39,800
All right.

105
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm tired.

106
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,359
You may leave.

107
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,400
I need to deliberate on it.

108
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,960
If you'll excuse me.

109
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,320
Impossible.

110
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,800
How could there be no cure?

111
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm already in this situation,

112
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,400
why should I lie?

113
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,320
Let me beg His Majesty

114
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,120
to spare Gu Weiru's life.

115
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,120
Don't you care about her most?

116
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,080
If you give me the cure,

117
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,120
I'll intercede for her.

118
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,320
Deal?

119
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,080
Weiru.

120
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,159
I'm sorry.

121
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,520
Wu Luan.

122
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,640
Just give up.

123
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,640
There is

124
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,280
no more Soul-replacing.

125
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,600
I gave Yun Shang

126
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,319
the last one of it.

127
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,480
Now,

128
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,880
unless you die,

129
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,640
or there will be no cure

130
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,680
for Yun Shang's Portent.

131
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,280
Nobody can cure her.

132
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,680
Impossible.

133
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,040
There should be a cure.

134
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,600
You lied.

135
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,440
Since

136
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,319
I'm going to die,

137
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,680
you all

138
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,199
shall be buried with me.
