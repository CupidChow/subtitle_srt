Episode 2

5
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,360
Prince Pingxi was assassinated

6
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,360
as he got to the capital.

7
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,080
We are in charge of the security here,

8
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,300
so we must investigate it.

9
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,160
We heard the assassin come here,

10
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,119
and we followed her here.

11
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,160
That's why we disturbed you.

12
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,679
My Lord,

13
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,640
please forgive us.

14
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,640
Assassination?

15
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,600
For what purpose?

16
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,960
Was it done

17
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,760
by a person or a ghost?

18
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,080
I have no idea.

19
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,720
If I did,

20
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,120
I wouldn't disturb you again.

21
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,600
I'm not interested in

22
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,720
his assassination.

23
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,880
I just know

24
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,000
you scared Miss Yun Shang.

25
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,680
You should see her dark circles,

26
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,040
which are too heavy to cover.

27
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,080
Sir.

28
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,620
Check carefully,

29
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,620
including each corner.

30
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,280
Yes.

31
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,799
Check there.

32
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,440
Yes.

33
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,560
I want to ask Ms. Yun a few questions.

34
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:49,900
OK.

35
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,760
Ask right here.

36
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,880
Right.

37
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,400
How long

38
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,840
have you been here?

39
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,560
Three years.

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,720
Miss Yun.

41
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,440
Can I check your chamber?

42
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,160
Well...

43
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,620
What are you doing?

44
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:22,900
You stand there!

45
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,240
Don't you understand it?

46
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,320
I spent the whole night with her.

47
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,760
How can I not know

48
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,600
if she's fishy?

49
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,119
You're a man,

50
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,800
you don't even know hymen blood?

51
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,720
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:48,799
Congrats, Lord.

53
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,800
I'll take my leave.

54
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,920
The assassin must be here.

55
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,000
Check each person you see

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,480
and find her by all means.

57
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,960
It seems I can't stay here.

58
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,799
My Lord,

59
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,640
if you'll recall me occasionally in the future,

60
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,200
pour out a libation for me.

61
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,920
I will be grateful

62
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,760
to you

63
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,440
in the afterworld.

64
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,320
Why do you want to kill yourself?

65
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,240
I used to be the daughter of a decent family

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,760
but I was reduced to living here.

67
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,719
If you leave here,

68
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,480
the madam will sell me another man,

69
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,260
so I'd rather die.

70
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,400
I'm a responsible man,

71
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,160
let me buy you freedom.

72
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,880
Let me.

73
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,880
Be careful.

74
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,720
Easy.

75
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,020
Residence of Duke

76
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,400
Come.

77
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,260
Thank you, Lord.

78
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,560
Lord.

79
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:28,599
She...

80
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,039
Lord.

81
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,760
You brought her here from Shanxi?

82
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,200
Yes.

83
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,560
Prepare for her accommodation.

84
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,600
Yes.

85
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,200
Nice room.

86
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,520
It's my first time to see...

87
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:32,840
... it.

88
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,960
Are you going to climb out

89
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,040
or have you just climbed in?

90
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,640
Please don't make fun of me.

91
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,200
It's similar to my chamber when I was a child.

92
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,200
I used to sit by the window

93
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,260
with my younger sister on both sides

94
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,200
like this.

95
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,480
But now...

96
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,820
You have a younger sister?

97
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:03,920
Yes.

98
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,160
But

99
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,520
there

100
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,800
is nothing fancy outside.

101
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,520
You're right.

102
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,280
I just became sensitive

103
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,760
when I recalled the past.

104
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,240
I'm sorry to let you see this.

105
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,520
It's fine.

106
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,520
Come down here.

107
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,120
I

108
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,920
don't like

109
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,719
to be pinned down.

110
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,400
You really spent three years at the Daintysleeve Pavilion?

111
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:45,959
Yes.

112
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:46,760
Lord.

113
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,600
This is not right.

114
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,520
Three years...

115
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,560
This is all you have got in three years?

116
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,520
Impressive.

117
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,600
The rest were meaningless,

118
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,040
so I didn't take them.

119
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:19,640
Well,

120
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,480
where are you from?

121
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,800
A humble place.

122
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,560
I'm afraid

123
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,660
you didn't hear of it.

124
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,760
How do you know that

125
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,720
I don't know?

126
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,160
I'm well-educated, so I'm sure I've heard of it.

127
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:32,640
Tell me.

128
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,080
Yangzhou.

129
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,000
A small county in Yangzhou,

130
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,319
Hanjiang.

131
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,720
I told you I'm well-educated.

132
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,240
I do know that place.

133
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,400
Awesome.

134
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,839
Speak louder when you praise me.

135
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,840
Lord, you're the most impressive man in this world.

136
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,760
Come.

137
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,640
I've come

138
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,120
to tell you something.

139
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,240
Though you were taken out

140
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,560
from that... Pavilion by me,

141
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,520
you don't seem to be a frivolous girl.

142
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,540
So when Mister Feng asked

143
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,280
if you were a concubine I brought from Shanxi,

144
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,080
I said yes.

145
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,439
I didn't want others

146
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,120
to gossip about you

147
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,400
so that you'll have a peaceful life.

148
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,440
Thank you for your consideration.

149
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,540
Bear it in mind,

150
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,080
and don't let slip.

151
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,320
I have to go.

152
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,079
See you.

153
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,400
Too many questions.

154
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,520
He may know something.

155
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,000
Hanjiang?

156
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,560
Lord.

157
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,280
Can you tell me

158
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,839
how should I explain her to others?

159
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,160
You know where Hanjiang is?

160
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,040
Lord.

161
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,840
Does someone raise birds here?

162
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,720
Let it go.

163
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,640
The more, the better.
