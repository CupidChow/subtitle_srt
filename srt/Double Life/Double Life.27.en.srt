Episode 27

5
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,680
After so many shows I put on,

6
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,199
it's just a hairpin.

7
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,840
Fine.

8
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,840
It's over

9
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,040
between us.

10
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,000
Still don't have the heart to kill me?

11
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,880
There are explosives in the yard.

12
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,040
Jump into the river when they explode

13
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,600
and you may get out.

14
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,280
Yun Shang.

15
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,640
Remember.

16
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,600
You haven't killed me,

17
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,480
I am just sick of living.

18
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,280
So don't pay with your life.

19
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,800
I need you to live well

20
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,120
and forget me.

21
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,440
Your Majesty.

22
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,239
Lord Wu's mansion was blown up.

23
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,240
We searched the whole place

24
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,399
and found nobody alive.

25
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,560
They all...

26
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,440
all...

27
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,599
We couldn't identify which one was Lord Wu.

28
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,039
Wu Luan.

29
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,840
Wu Luan.

30
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,000
Wu Luan.

31
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,000
My dear brother!

32
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,480
Ziqi.

33
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,240
I'm here to see you.

34
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,800
How are you doing?

35
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,400
This is a ludicrous world.

36
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,440
I was going to take my life after watching you

37
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,160
marry Yun Luo.

38
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,080
I didn't expect I got you killed

39
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,159
while I survived.

40
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,160
Yun Shang.

41
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,240
I'm sorry

42
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,840
for the harsh words I said.

43
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,120
I have been looking for you

44
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,960
for so long.

45
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,960
I promised to keep you safe,

46
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,840
but I couldn't keep my word.

47
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,840
I still don't believe you have passed away.

48
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,680
You're hiding up, right?

49
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,840
We agreed

50
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,560
that Yun Shang and Wu Luan

51
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,200
would be in love forever.

52
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,760
In this life or the next,

53
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,880
we will always be together,

54
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,360
won't we?

55
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,800
Mister Feng?

56
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,440
Lord.

57
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,600
Lord.

58
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,840
You finally wake up.

59
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,640
Be careful.

60
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,920
Easy.

61
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,760
I'm still alive?

62
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:34,679
It was Wu Ziqi.

63
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,280
He knew you were determined to die.

64
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:39,480
So

65
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,959
on his wedding day,

66
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,760
he told me

67
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,240
to put Breath-hold Pill

68
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,560
into your tea.

69
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,280
It's just

70
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,280
its efficacy was too strong,

71
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,839
so you have been

72
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,440
in a coma for three months.

73
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,800
Where is Yun Shang?

74
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,079
Yun Shang.

75
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,400
Yun Shang...
