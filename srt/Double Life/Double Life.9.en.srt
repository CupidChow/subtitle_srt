Episode 9

5
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:47,600
Don't move.

6
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,759
Let me take a good look at you.

7
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,360
I was too busy to come back recently.

8
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,920
What did you do?

9
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,040
I made good food,

10
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,080
but

11
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,560
you didn't come back.

12
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,240
Weren't they wasted?

13
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,400
No.

14
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,560
I ate them up.

15
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,960
That means

16
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,760
I ate them, too.

17
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,520
Now I'm free.

18
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,760
Let me take you out.

19
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,000
The Royal Hall.

20
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,480
It looks just so-so.

21
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:41,920
Yunshang.

22
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,399
Let me take you

23
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,360
to see the world.

24
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:45,960
OK.

25
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,360
So,

26
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,320
if you want to eat, drink

27
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,160
or play something,

28
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,160
feel free to tell me.

29
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,240
That

30
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,680
will be too many.

31
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,679
Are you sure

32
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,120
you want to hear it?

33
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,160
Of course.

34
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,280
Loong.

35
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,240
Mouse.

36
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,720
Congratulations.

37
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,960
You've won a mouse.

38
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,560
Can you make it?

39
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,120
It's been dozens of times

40
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,360
and you haven't won a loong.

41
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,680
Let me do it.

42
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,040
Hang on.

43
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,040
Who says I can't do it?

44
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,160
I certainly can.

45
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,760
Come on.

46
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,760
Don't laugh, Yun Shang.

47
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,960
I will win that loong for you.

48
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,920
Again.

49
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,600
I

50
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,200
will

51
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,839
win

52
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,440
that

53
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,040
loong.

54
00:03:59,400 --> 00:03:59,760
Loong.

55
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,360
Yun Shang, I've made it.

56
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,680
Take this.

57
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,240
Come on.

58
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,440
Mister.

59
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,840
You haven't paid.

60
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:37,880
Here.

61
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,160
Thank you.

62
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,920
I'm innocent.

63
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,040
You know who I am?

64
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,280
I need to see His Majesty.

65
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,479
I need to see His Majesty.

66
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,719
I need to see His Majesty.

67
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,640
Shut up.

68
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,120
Sun Miao.

69
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,760
Things are different now.

70
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,840
So you'd better be quiet

71
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,280
and eat your steamed bun.

72
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,160
Steamed bun?

73
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:39,960
Move.

74
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,320
By the grace of Heaven, the Emperor hereby decrees.

75
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,040
General Sun Miao

76
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,840
committed influence peddling

77
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,640
and murdered Prince Pingxi.

78
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,240
Sun is exiled to the border

79
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,719
as an ordinary man

80
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,920
for good. Issued by His Majesty.

81
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,320
Are you sure someone is behind Sun Miao?

82
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,200
Your Majesty.

83
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,240
It's suspicious for Sun Miao

84
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,360
to confess suddenly.

85
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,680
I'm sure there must be others behind.

86
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,760
If they want to kill him,

87
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,720
they will do it on the way Sun Miao is exiled.

88
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,520
You found clues

89
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,440
about the Drizzle Pavilion quickly.

90
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,479
I'm very pleased.

91
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,400
So I decided to grant you a marriage

92
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,760
as the reward.

93
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,080
I'm going back to tell your sister,

94
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,560
I'm sure she'll be glad for you.

95
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,280
Your Majesty.

96
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,320
Bullshit.

97
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,520
Bullshit.

98
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,640
The Prime Minister's daughter is pretty and wise?

99
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,560
Totally Bullshit...

100
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,320
It's a good thing.

101
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,680
Since His Majesty

102
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,960
grants you a girl of your same status,

103
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,720
it will be helpful to you in the Court.

104
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,120
What kind of good thing is it?

105
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,520
It's a punishment.

106
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,640
I want nobody

107
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,320
but you.

108
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,240
Lord.

109
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,840
Calm down.

110
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,720
You can't defy the Emperor.

111
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,720
Your anger

112
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,960
can only hurt yourself.

113
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:43,839
Why are you not angry at all?

114
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,080
I'm going to marry another woman,

115
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,240
why don't you care at all?

116
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,760
You don't have to vent the anger on me.

117
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,080
I didn't

118
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,320
issue the imperial edict.

119
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,280
So there's no need

120
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,040
to be mad at me.

121
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,800
As an ordinary woman,

122
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,760
can I

123
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,760
stand against the Emperor for you?

124
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,480
I'm sorry.

125
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,760
It's not personal.

126
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,120
I hate the thing.

127
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,199
No.

128
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,560
I need to make it clear with His Majesty tomorrow.

129
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,760
Alas.

130
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,440
Why do we always do tedious work?

131
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,760
Tell me about it.

132
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:45,959
Eat now.

133
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,160
We have a long way to go.

134
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,760
Eat more.

135
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,960
I'm so tired.

136
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,760
Sir, I'm hungry.

137
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,240
Please give me something to eat.

138
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,600
You want to eat?

139
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,680
No way.

140
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,439
Let me take a bite.

141
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,560
Have you come to my rescue?

142
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,560
No, to take your life.
