Episode 26

5
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,399
Salute each other.

6
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,359
Yun...

7
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,359
Yun Luo.

8
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,880
Yun...

9
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,440
Luo.

10
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,480
Guards.

11
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,240
We're from the same family,

12
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,040
why didn't you invite me?

13
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,159
Do you like

14
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,680
this great gift?

15
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,240
I will kill you.

16
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,039
Do you think you can survive by killing me?

17
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,160
Both of you

18
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,160
will die today.

19
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,520
What do you mean?

20
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:33,760
Yun Luo.

21
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,600
What do I mean?

22
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:37,880
Fine.

23
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,320
I can tell you.

24
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,840
You and 24

25
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,160
were fed the One Mind already.

26
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,120
You know what that is?

27
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,599
Today,

28
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,320
if either of you dies,

29
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,720
the other will follow.

30
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,320
Aren't you reluctant to kill that man?

31
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,640
Won't you give up your life

32
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,120
to keep his?

33
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,160
How can there be such a good thing?

34
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,840
You kill my love,

35
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,520
so you must suffer utterly for that.

36
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,240
23.

37
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,120
If you don't kill the man you love the most,

38
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,760
24 will die with you.

39
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,760
Sister

40
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,840
and man.

41
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,520
I want to see what your choice is.

42
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,320
9.

43
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,680
The man she loves the most?

44
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,960
Isn't that funny?

45
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,960
I never loved you

46
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,359
from the very beginning.

47
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,360
You're just my pawn.

48
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,360
What did you say?

49
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,039
Whatever your choice is,

50
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,240
you

51
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,120
and you

52
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,680
should all die.

53
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,640
A bunch of fools.

54
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:36,120
Anyway, your show about killing each other

55
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,480
is my favorite.

56
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,640
Wu Ruan.

57
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,520
Yun Shang.

58
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,240
You really think I'm in love with you?

59
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,319
So naive.

60
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,480
When I first met you at the Daintysleeve Pavilion,

61
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,160
I knew you were an assassin from the Drizzle Pavilion.

62
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,439
I took you home

63
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,040
so I could get its information from you.

64
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,080
Are you telling me that deliberately?

65
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,360
Do you think I'll believe it?

66
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,720
When we just met,

67
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,280
why did I redeem you from the brothel

68
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,360
so casually?

69
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,360
Ever thought about it?

70
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,520
How could I

71
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,640
find out that the Radiance Shop was suspicious?

72
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,800
Ever thought about it?

73
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,640
And Prince Pingxi.

74
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,360
When you wanted to kill him,

75
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,719
I took you to his birthday banquet.

76
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,660
Ever thought about the reason?

77
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,480
You took a hit for me

78
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,959
while facing the kidnappers.

79
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,160
It's true

80
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,520
But I did so

81
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,960
to gain your trust more.

82
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,480
You don't have to say so to change my mind.

83
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,160
I can feel your affection

84
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,319
during these days.

85
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,320
So I won't believe

86
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:19,840
every word

87
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,160
you speak now.

88
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,760
Though we all hid our secrets,

89
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,480
I know you.

90
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,360
Know me?

91
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,040
Haven't you been taking me as an idiot?

92
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,560
What do you know about me?

93
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,040
This man right now

94
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,520
is the real me.

95
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,839
Got it?

96
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,160
I was just playing a game with you,

97
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,960
but you meant it

98
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,640
and killed 12 for me.

99
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,840
So funny.

100
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,240
But listen up, I paid him

101
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,560
to kill me.

102
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,080
What did you say?

103
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,319
Wu Ruan.

104
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,959
Don't be kidding me.

105
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,280
You are so surprised.

106
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,240
I didn't just pay for it

107
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,240
but did it twice.

108
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,920
The second time included Gu Pingzhang.

109
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,960
Otherwise,

110
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,600
how could your Pavilion come to me easily?

111
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,660
You.

112
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,959
You thought he took the initiative to kill you?

113
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,319
No.

114
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,480
I lured him here.

115
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,959
You are all dummies.

116
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,040
Wu Ruan.

117
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,000
I love you wholeheartedly,

118
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,120
how could you do this to me?

119
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,839
I don't buy it.

120
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,719
Since you had got what you wanted,

121
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,540
why did you go to look for me,

122
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,360
bring me back,

123
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,960
and would marry me?

124
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,120
The reason was quite simple.

125
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,920
I didn't love you,

126
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,120
but I hated Gu Pingzhang's daughter more,

127
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,079
so I used you to cancel my marriage with her.

128
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,520
As for why I brought you back.

129
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,540
It was just my deal with the Pavilion.

130
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,160
I wanted to see

131
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,320
if you received the quest to kill me.

132
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,640
What about this?

133
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,760
Yun Shang and Wu Ruan

134
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,480
are in love forever.

135
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,439
This life or the next,

136
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,660
we will always be together.

137
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,920
What do you think?

138
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,640
After so many shows

139
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,920
I put on,

140
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,480
it's just a hairpin.

141
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,160
Fine.

142
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,040
Very well.

143
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,600
There is no love

144
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,760
between you and me now.
