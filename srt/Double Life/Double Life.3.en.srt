Episode 3

5
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,640
Did you hear it?

6
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,440
A while ago,

7
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,640
many officials died from offending gods.

8
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,560
Did Prince Pingxi make the same mistake?

9
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,040
Bah!

10
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,840
Nothing is a taboo.

11
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,480
Those who died were petty local officials,

12
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,760
this is the capital.

13
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,040
Don't scare us.

14
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,240
Stop talking.

15
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,280
Sir.

16
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,040
So, any luck?

17
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,039
No.

18
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,039
Anyway,

19
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,240
I still think Yunshang from the Daintysleeve Pavilion is fishy.

20
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,240
Only her window

21
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,039
is close to the rear lance there.

22
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,480
Keep a close eye on Lord Wu's mansion.

23
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,720
Always be vigilant.

24
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,880
Consider it done.

25
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,240
Let's go.

26
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,280
That's your pretty idiot.

27
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,480
Of all the ordinary people,

28
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,600
you've chosen the Emperor's brother-in-law.

29
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,760
Are you sure you're not exposed?

30
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,880
I just came

31
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,480
to tell you

32
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,000
that I've moved into his mansion,

33
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,000
not to listen to your sneers.

34
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,079
I warned you before

35
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,080
that it wasn't a good day to do it.

36
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,920
Since you alarmed the target,

37
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,079
it will be harder for you to take action.

38
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,960
None of your business.

39
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,080
There are ten days left anyway.

40
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,600
Yun Shang?

41
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,320
Why are you here in a thin dress?

42
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,920
No response?

43
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,239
Is she

44
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,520
sleepwalking?

45
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,920
She is sleepwalking.

46
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,160
I heard that a sleepwalking person shouldn't be woken up,

47
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,000
but shall be fed with an insect.

48
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,440
It's a shame I've just caught this General Cyclone.

49
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,720
Anyway.

50
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,320
Her safety matters.

51
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,640
Sorry for this.

52
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,800
Why am I here?

53
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,120
Lord, why are you here, too?

54
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,840
Did I sleepwalk again?

55
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,680
Lord.

56
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,920
Did I hurt you?

57
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,440
Why did bad things happen each time I saw you?

58
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,359
Someone was almost killed last time.

59
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,480
I lost things this time.

60
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,240
I've had such a disease since I was a child.

61
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,560
I'm so sorry

62
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,520
for bothering you.

63
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,680
Lord.

64
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,719
It's so late. What brings you here?

65
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,239
To catch crickets.

66
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,920
Look,

67
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,280
the best crickets

68
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,080
all live near

69
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,039
graves in the fields.

70
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,120
Since you're here too,

71
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,280
join me to catch them.

72
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,760
Let's go.

73
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,640
You...

74
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,080
I'll kill you one day.

75
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,720
What?

76
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,120
Nothing.

77
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,360
Lord.

78
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,359
It's so creepy at night.

79
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:23,860
I don't want to play here.

80
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,840
Why don't we go back?

81
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,680
Huh?

82
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,480
Isn't it

83
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,640
so funny?

84
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,719
Didn't you do this in childhood?

85
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,520
No.

86
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,440
No?

87
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,440
Then tell me

88
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,640
what you played.

89
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,720
Climb up.

90
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,960
If you cry,

91
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,719
you will be given more whips.

92
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,919
I didn't have time to play

93
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,479
and had to study

94
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,120
and learn manners

95
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,440
all day.

96
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,560
What?

97
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,320
You don't even

98
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,480
have one thing?

99
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,000
Don't you have a younger sister?

100
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,000
There should be happy memories between you two.

101
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,200
Sister, what's wrong?

102
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,280
I'm fine.

103
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,320
Sit up.

104
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,520
I have something tasty for you.

105
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,719
It's the Birchleaf Pear Cake I've saved for you.

106
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,000
So yummy.

107
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,599
Eat it.

108
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,719
Though we can't go out to play,

109
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,280
you can assume that we are

110
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,719
in birchleaf pear woods

111
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,960
and are playing there

112
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,080
as you eat the cake.

113
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,240
It's so yummy.

114
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,040
Yun Luo.

115
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,440
I could smell the fragrance of flowers.

116
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,439
My sister and I

117
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,040
could barely talk with each other.

118
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,280
But if we had any chance,

119
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,640
we went to the birchleaf pear woods

120
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,640
to smell the fragrance.

121
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,280
Did you eat Birchleaf Pear Cake?

122
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,880
It is

123
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,959
a tasty snack.

124
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,640
I didn't.

125
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,360
But if you want to eat it,

126
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,439
I'll make it for you.

127
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,080
A gentleman shall not enter the kitchen.

128
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,840
Why don't you

129
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,360
stop him?

130
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,760
What if the outsiders judge him?

131
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,199
He's no gentleman.

132
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,160
Is it proper to talk about him like that?

133
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,160
It's his words.

134
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,800
It is his call.

135
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:27,760
All right.

136
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,199
Here's the Birchleaf Pear Cake.

137
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,599
Take a bite.

138
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,520
A recipe from the chef of the Cui Xiang Restaurant.

139
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,160
If that's not right,

140
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,079
I'll send others to kill him.

141
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,319
Here.

142
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,199
So?

143
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,040
It tastes like the one I ate before.

144
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,000
Good. Then eat more.

145
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,040
Don't mind its appearance.

146
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,800
Assume it's crushed.

147
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,920
Thank you, Lord.

148
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,320
It's the best thing

149
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,640
I've ever eaten these years.

150
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,800
I'm always gifted

151
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,800
at the useless business.

152
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,400
There are many pear flowers left,

153
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,439
don't waste them.

154
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,880
Let me cook this time.

155
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,719
Let's do it together.

156
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,839
OK.

157
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,520
It's for you.
