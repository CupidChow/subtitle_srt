Episode 21

5
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,000
23.

6
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,840
That's so bold of you.

7
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,000
Are you in love with that idiot?

8
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,640
You won't talk about that for no reason.

9
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,480
What on earth

10
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,800
is your business?

11
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,080
I'm the only one who can bully him,

12
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,600
not you.

13
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,480
24.

14
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,560
Let me kill you first.

15
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,880
Yun Shang.

16
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,560
9.

17
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,000
9.

18
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,800
9.

19
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,280
Hang in there, 9.

20
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,840
Stop, 04.

21
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,880
Stop.

22
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,160
Stop.

23
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,400
This is enough.

24
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,600
Aren't you always smart

25
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,840
Haven't you said there is no love?

26
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,159
Why did you cover for me?

27
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,719
04.

28
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,000
Listen to me,

29
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,599
or there will be no more chance.

30
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,000
In fact, I...

31
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,400
I have been...

32
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,080
9.

33
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,760
9.

34
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,200
9.

35
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,520
Here.

36
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,800
Easy.

37
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,200
Let me drink it myself.

38
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,000
You're wounded, too.

39
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,480
Be careful.

40
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,479
I'm alright.

41
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,520
I have to see you drink more.

42
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,920
I was so scared last night.

43
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,960
Where are Wu Ziqi and Yun Luo?

44
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,000
How are they?

45
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,800
Don't worry.

46
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,800
They're fine.

47
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,000
After risking their life together,

48
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,600
they can't be more intimate now.

49
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,360
Thank you for saving me last night.

50
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,760
No sweat.

51
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,240
But why did you say

52
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,960
only you could pick on me

53
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,080
and the others couldn't?

54
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,840
Was I wrong?

55
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,239
You want to be picked on by the others?

56
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,000
Yes, you're right.

57
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,360
I won't be picked on by the others.

58
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,760
Now we're talking.

59
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,000
How's your wound?

60
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,960
It's fine.

61
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,799
You

62
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,400
saw me fight the others.

63
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,840
Do you have any questions?

64
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,520
Come on.

65
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,280
It broke my heart to see them bully you.

66
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,960
How dare they

67
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,400
hurt my woman?

68
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,599
Aren't you curious

69
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,960
why I can do martial arts?

70
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,000
Why should I?

71
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,200
Yun Luo can fight, too.

72
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,799
It seems you're stronger.

73
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,320
Anyway,

74
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,480
no matter how skilled you are,

75
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,960
I don't want you to fight again.

76
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,600
Even if you kill or cripple them,

77
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,800
I still think you are bullied.

78
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,400
In fact,

79
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,880
I want

80
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,400
to tell you something.

81
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,800
My wound hurts.

82
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:28,760
What's wrong?

83
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,240
It hurts so much?

84
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,079
Let me see it.

85
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,680
Remember what I told you before?

86
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,440
You're the only love in my life.

87
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,400
I don't care about your past

88
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
and future

89
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,800
and I will share 

90
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,480
your worries.

91
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,480
I certainly remember it.

92
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,360
Since I said so,

93
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,000
it counted before,

94
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,040
it counts now

95
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,000
and it

96
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,200
will always count.
