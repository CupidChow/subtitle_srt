180

- I can't take this.
- Impossible.

181
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,770
- No, I can't.
- Whoa!

182
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:12,850
- Hey.
- Stop.

183
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,880

184
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,040
Type.

185
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,110
That was R-rated, man.

186
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,980
You're not naive, man.

187
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,260

you're free for your friends.

188
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,470

I need your help as well.

190
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,540
With what?

191
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,890
I'm buying Fah a gift for his graduation,

192
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,820
so I want you guys to help me get things done.
There's a lot on the list.

193
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,400
What's your plan?

194
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:56,130
As I don't get to see him often,

195
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,100
I'm thinking about making a watch.

196
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:02,550
So we're going to
a watchmaking workshop, right?

197
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:03,470
Yeah.

198
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,460
Have you looked it up? Should we call them?

199
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,600
I have, so...

200
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,170
let's give them a call.

201
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,170
Hello, are you open today?

202
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,940
We're closed today.

203
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:17,310
Oh,

204
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,540
you're closed?

205
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,010
Failed.

206
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:23,040
Okay, thank you.

207
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,160
Hey, it's okay.

208
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,580
There are still more places.

209
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,780
Yeah, right.

210
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:34,720
What?

211
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,740
Hello, Fah.

212
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,500
Where are you?

213
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,430
At the college.

214
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:46,310
Good, I'm almost there.

215
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,170
What? Where are you going?

216
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,110
The college.

217
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,770
What, you're coming here?

218
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:53,710
Yeah.

219
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,540
The work finished early,

220
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,040
so I changed my return flight.

221
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,570
Aren't you happy?

222
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,440
I miss you so badly.

223
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,150
Uh...

224
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,520
Teerak?

225
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,110
Hello?

226
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:06,990
Yes?

227
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,120
I'm happy, obviously.

228
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,750
Where in the college are you?

229
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,830
I'm at my faculty.

230
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,530
Alright, I'll be there soon.

231
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,470
Yeah, see you.

232
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,580
Lee, your brother's madly in love.

233
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,050
He's coming, but we've got nothing.

234
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,410
Then...

235
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:35,080
we'll go get them for you, right?

236
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:36,900
Right.

237
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,090
Just tell us what you need.

238
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,060
Okay, thanks a lot, guys.

239
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,520
What do I need?

240
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,060
I think I need this.

241
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,180
What is it?

242
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,150
Here.

243
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,380
I still miss you.

244
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,650
I don't feel like working yet.

245
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,120
You can come by in the morning.

246
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,320
You need to work now, okay?

247
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,030
Your Sky needs you.

248
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,460
But I need you.

249
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,490
Come on, let's go to your room.

250
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,530
You can't. My family might come down.

251
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,540
I'm too shy.

252
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,670
Go and do your work, Fah.

253
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,610
Bye-bye.

254
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,590

- Why are you smiling?
- Whoa.

259

No, I'm doing nothing.

260
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,850
I'm not buying Fah anything.

261
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,820
You're getting him something?

262
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,390
Not telling me?

263
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,700
Tell me now.

264
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,570
If you don't, I will...

265
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,730
Tell me.

266
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:38,510
I'm making something for his graduation gift.

267
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,480
- I see.
- However,

268
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,290
don't tell him, please.

269
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,330
I won't.

270
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,280
I haven't seen him since we graduated.

271
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,420
Well...

272
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:52,330
Are you going to surprise me
with something as well?

273
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:55,830
If you're not, I'll be upset.

274
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:56,760
I'm not.

275
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:59,700
What? You're not even hesitant?

276
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,840
Well, you always know what I'm doing,

277
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,930
so I'm not gonna give you any surprises.

278
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,430
Gosh.

279
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,400
I should've pretended I didn't know.

280
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,869
Did you go out with Dom?

281
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,069
Why are you back so late?

282
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,920
I had a meal with my colleagues.

283
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,150
It was a welcoming dinner.

284
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,180
I see.

285
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,550
Are you tired? I can give you a massage.

- Yeah.

287

Do your job, bro.

290

When I get my salary, I'll give you some.

291
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,510
For real? How much are you giving me?

292
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,350
Nine baht.

293
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:35,830
Wow, that's a lot.

294
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,200
You can get some snacks.

Wow, I can get lots of snacks with that.

There.

What's the hurry? Is it for someone?

302
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,800
My only one.

303
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,200
Right, Fah.

304
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,310
When will Dad stop telling you
to go to Hong Kong?

305
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,100
It looks exhausting.

I'm still okay.

You are.

308
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,750
What about Rak?

309
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:27,860
I'm worried about him.

310
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,550
Don't be.

Let me ask you something.

313

Why Teerak?

Why are you asking this now?

315

Just give me the answer.

316
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,670
Your question should've been,

317

Why nobody else but Teerak?

He's my source of happiness.

Yes, good boy.

370
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,780
Well,

371
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,050
me and a bow.

372
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,220
For you.

00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:23,860
Yes.

376
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,670
I'm only yours.

377
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,800
I love you.

378
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,380
I love you, too, my love.

379
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,860
Do you want to unwrap your gift right now?

380
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:52,590
Where should I start?

381
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,520
Take it easy.

382
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,790
Your gift's not going anywhere.

383
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,600
Make sure you can catch me.

384
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,700
Are you ready, my gift?

385
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,650
I am.

386
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,270
[Love]

387
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,640
Happy one-year
and eight-month anniversary.

388
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:10,610
Do you like it, my baby?

389
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:15,650
I do, but...

390
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:19,860
how can I take this? It's very expensive.

391
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:23,530
Don't think too much about it.
I really want you to have it.

392
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,360
How about this?

393
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,900
Whenever you're ready,
I'll transfer the ownership to you.

394
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,430
You can just drive it for now.

395
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,000
Let's say...

396
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,620
you're borrowing my car.

397
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:43,980
Alright, I'll gradually pay it off then.

398
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,780
But I think...

399
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,410
Let's do that, Fah.

400
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:52,170
When I get a job and pay this car off,

401
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,150
you can transfer it to me.

402
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,060
Okay.

403
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:06,150
Thank you.

404
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:08,170
I knew it.

405
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:10,300
You must be celebrating our anniversary
every month, right?

406
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,100
Should I...

407
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:13,770
do it every day?

408
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:15,230
Stop it right there.

409
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:19,290
I just want you to be happy every day.

410
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:22,620
Come here.

411
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:34,430
Right, Fah.

412
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:36,830
Can I drive the car now?

413
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:37,830
Yeah.

414
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,830
There's a place I want to show you.

415
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:41,630
Where is it?

416
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,010
It's a secret.

417
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,010
Give me some time, though.

418
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,330
Let me get changed.

419
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,380
Okay.

420
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:04,620
Whoa.

421
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,080
When did you do all of this?

422
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,700
You've been with me all day, though.

423
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:11,220
You love giving me surprises.

424
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,110
It's my turn to give you one as well,

425
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:16,630
so I asked my friends to decorate
this place the way I pictured it.

426
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:18,430
Do you like it?

427
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,730
Yes, thank you.

428
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:26,340
Since you gave me a surprise,

429
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,990
let me show you mine.

430
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:43,800
I want you by my side for the rest of my life.

431
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,030
Can I hold a place in your heart?

432
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,280
Fah...

433
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,470
Congrats.

434
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,340
Congratulations.

435
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,110
Congrats, bro.

436
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:12,580
Happy for you.

437
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,580
- Congrats, bro.
- Congratulations.

438
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:15,550
Teerak.

439
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:18,920
Wait, hold on.

440
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,390
Does that mean...

441
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:23,620
Punlee, Type, and Joy...

442
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:26,360
You've helped with both of our surprises?

443
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:30,840
Of course, it makes me happy
to see people in love.

444
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,590
So that means...

445
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:38,240
you already knew I had a surprise for you?

446
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,070
Aw, I'm sorry.

447
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,750
Don't be upset.

448
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,850
Exactly, that's just how he is,

449
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,170
giving off that over-the-top vibe.

450
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,760
- Yeah.
- Right.

451
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:52,580
Everyone wants to be part of this surprise
with you guys.

452
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:55,920
You can't get married too early, though.

453
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:58,190
Let's say that's a promise ring.

454
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,960
I know, Babe.

455
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:04,460
Good.

456
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,800
Congrats.

457
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,199
- Let's hug.
- Right, a hug.

458
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,400
- Congrats, bro.
- I'm happy for you.

459
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,370
Congrats.

460
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:13,940
- It's been long.
- Fantastic.

461
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:14,940
- Congrats.
- Big congrats.

462
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,320
- Congrats.
- You're incredible.

463
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,010
Don't leave me, okay?

464
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:20,080
Yeah.

465
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:23,800
- Cheers to our bar.
- Can I have a hug, too?

466
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,280
Give me a hug, please.

467
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,409
Come on, Fah and everyone.

468
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:28,850
Let's hug.

469
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:29,520
Oh?

470
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:31,360
- Hug the team, too.
- Fantastic.

471
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,690
I'm just kidding.

472
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:36,870
Kiss him!

473
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:40,270
- Kiss him.
- Kiss him!

474
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,699
- Kiss him.
- Kiss him.

475
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:45,949
- Kiss him!
- Kiss him.

476
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,300
Kiss him. Kiss him!

477
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:13,580
- Hello.
- Hi.

478
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,560
We're about to present to you
our last special show

479
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,730
from us, Your Sky Series.

480
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:19,100
I want this show

481
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,400
to be something we all remember together.

482
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,380
Let's check it out!

483
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,270
Let's go.

484
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:35,580
♫It's impossible to express how much I love you,♫

485
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:40,420
♫Because my love for you
is as vast as the ocean blue♫

486
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:45,220
♫Every day, every night,
all I can think about is missing you♫

487
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:49,660
♫Trust me, trust me, my love,
there's no need to prove♫

488
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,740
♫I may not get to articulate feelings on my part♫

489
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:54,380
♫Like a song of a quiet person with a pure heart♫

490
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,900
♫This heartfelt feeling, it's hard to impart♫

491
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,220
♫To define it, I just don't know where to start♫

492
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,420
♫Baby, you're my sky♫

493
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:04,060
♫And let me be your sky♫

494
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,620
♫That's all I know, having only you by my side♫

495

♫You're my only one,♫

♫I'll claim you as mine, if that's fine♫

503
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:26,340
♫I hope this is enough to clarify♫

♫Whatever you are,
it's exceptional, as you're extraordinary♫

515
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:00,130
♫You make me fall in love,♫

516
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:02,530
♫Making me think of only you, honey♫

Sorry.

559
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:54,720
Which one should I talk about?

560
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:56,340
That one.

561
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,190
[A little bit confused]

562
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,460
You know what I'll do, right?

563
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:02,420
Remember?

564
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,460
I'll tickle you to death!

Where are you going?

566

Where are you going?

00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,620
Stand still. It'll take a second.

568
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:12,500
Here you go.

569
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:14,680
- Cut!
- You don't get tickled?

00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,820
I actually do.

That way.

Here, give it a try.

Use both of your hands,
and you'll look more skilled.

Like an expert, right?
[Suddenly becomes a pro!]

580

Pick it up a little.

00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,290
What's this watch for?

582
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:42,540
It's for my boyfriend.

I don't feel like working yet.
[Having a sweet moment!]

00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:54,180
You can come by in the morning.

00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,940
You need to go to the bar now, okay?

590
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,030
Your Sky needs you.
[Don't want to work anymore]

591

Go.

592
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:02,820
- Bye-bye.
- Come on.

You're getting him something?

Tell me now!

595
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:09,320
Tell me.

596

- Babe, come here.
- Okay.

600

Clear your name.

601
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:21,880
Why did you do that to him?

602
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:22,680
What did I do?

603
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:24,310
Why did you trick him into coming here?

604
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:26,120
Yeah, why did you do that?

605
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:27,770
What? You don't like this?

606
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,340
I wanted you to be happy.

607
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:33,520
- I was taking you to give your partner a gift.
- Really?

608
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:36,050
The real question is,
why didn't you realize she was lying?

609
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,450
You look so good.

610
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:41,630

- I was gonna ask
- Hurry up.

626

- This is enough.
- Keep talking.

628
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,900

Sorry.

665

If that was it, I would've said it myself.

666

- I couldn't see you.
- How come you did that for me?

667
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:50,650
It'd been too long.

I'm gonna eavesdrop like this,
but when they wanna talk to me...

You can't see it.

673
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:07,710
They're not gonna film it.
