I think you need to help him.

4

If he does this by himself,

5
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,850
he won't last long before getting caught.

- Giving him flowers will be romantic.

as we're in different majors.

120

I...

184
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,340
I have feelings for you.

185
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,880
It started when we were freshmen,

186
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,140
but I'm not sure if you...

187
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,460
I'm in a relationship.

188
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,530
I know.

189
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,770
I know that.

190
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,680
I'm not going to mess with you guys.

191
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,130
I just wanted to tell you how I feel.

192
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,610
Good? Is it enough?

193
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,920
Should I get you some more?

194
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,760
I'm good. I'm already so stuffed.

195
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,080
You're the cutest, my baby.

196
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,420
Fah,

197
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,160
why don't you come in? It's raining.

198
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,520
Do you want to tell me anything?

199
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:43,030
That friend of yours...
He likes you, doesn't he?

200
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:49,150
Did you hear Inn and me talking?

201
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,290
I followed you, so I heard it.

202
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,850
Yes.

203
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,520
He likes me,

204
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,080
but we talked.

205
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,230
He even told me we're an adorable couple.

206
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,530
I have feelings for you.

207
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,100
It started when we were freshmen,

208
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,530
but I'm not sure if you...

209
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,810
I'm in a relationship.

210
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,010
I know.

211
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,810
I know that.

212
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,280
I'm not going to mess with you guys.

213
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,030
Thanks.

214
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,190
You're one of my good friends.

215
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,480
So, does Muenfah treat you nicely?

216
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,240
Yeah, I love him so much.

217
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,090
I get that.

218
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,240
I'm happy for you.

219
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,560
You two are so adorable together.

220
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,810
Thanks.

221
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:01,920
I meant to tell you that as well.

222
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:07,930
If you feel uncomfortable,
you can let me know.

223
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,600
I'm jealous.

224
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,880
You were way too adorable,
so I didn't know how to act.

225
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,800
A combo set of sorry kisses.

226
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,840
Are you good now?

227
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,620
Well...

228
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,400
My boyfriend is so cute,

229
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,080
how do I stop myself from getting jealous?

230
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,360
Give it to me. I'll hold it for you.

231
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,570
It's okay to be jealous. I understand.

232
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,960
I also know...

233
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,080
that my guy's kinda hot.

234
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,070
So...

235
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,780
We need to communicate if there's a problem.

236
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,800
Yeah, understood.

237
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,760
Anyway...

238
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,450
I wanna know this.

239
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,880
Who's hotter: me or Inn?

240
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,589
It's you!

241
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,829
I like it when you're jealous. It's cute.

242
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:24,710
I also like it when your jealousy
makes you call me your baby.

243
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,230
You do?

244
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,240
Yeah, I like every name you call me.

245
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,160
So...

246
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,720
Can I have a kiss from my baby?

247
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,520
Should we go inside?

248
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,640
- Okay.
- We'll get sick.

249
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,520
I heard Fah was feeling jealous of you.

250
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,220
Yeah,

251
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,630
and it was bad.

252
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,430
If you're that curious, just join us.

253
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,660
- Okay.
- Right.

254
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,400
So, tell me about it.

255
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,680
What do you mean
he was jealous of you so badly?

256
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,240
He told me someone was hitting on you.

257
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,280
Yeah, it was Inn.

258
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,360
- What?
- What?

259
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,560
Inn?

260
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,760
We ran into him at a shabu-shabu place,

261
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,900
so we shared a table.

262
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,400
He then confessed his feelings to me.

263
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,680
I knew it. Something was off.

264
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,120
How was Muenfah, though?

265
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,120
Was he okay?

266
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,530
Well,

267
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,660
I told him I'm in a relationship.

268
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,530
And Muenfah was...

269
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,400
jealous.

270
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,920
He was jealous but not unreasonable, right?

271
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,400
We talked it all through,

272
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,880
and it's all cleared up now.

273
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,220
You did?

274
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,130
- Right.
- Okay.

275
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,030
That's good.

276
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,640
Muenfah's such a green flag.

277
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,640
He's my idol.

278
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:50,250
Yeah, I want a boyfriend like him.

279
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,680
You?

280
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,720
You wish.

281
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,080
Shut it.

282
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,920
You want some of this?

283
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,060
You must be

284
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,760
very stressed lately, right?

285
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,190
Yeah, I am.

286
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,860
I need to finish my project.

287
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,100
Don't worry, my Sea.

288
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,600
You're the best, my Sky.

289
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,580
You can do it. Trust me.

290
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,220
So...

291
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:33,720
when my movie releases,

292
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,590
you need to come watch it, okay?

293
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,290
Of course.

294
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:38,720
I'll be there for you.

295
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,720
So...

296
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,640
you got this!

297
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:45,400
- Thanks, my Sea.
- Yep.

298
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,800
Fah, I have an idea.

299
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,320
I'll take you somewhere to unwind.

300
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,080
- To unwind?
- Yeah.

301
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,380
I want to look after you, too.

302
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,900
Let's go on a trip.

303
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,120
I'll take care of everything.

304
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,000
You can just wait for it.

305
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,050
Okay.

306
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,280
I'll look forward to your getaway.

307
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,000
Okay.

308
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,240
Let's go.

309
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,970
- Over there?
- Yeah.

310
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,000
Why are we going there?

311
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,720
Ghlai.

312
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,910
Yes, how can I help you?

313
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,140
Well,

314
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:31,320
I DMed you on Insta, but you didn't answer.

315
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,840
So, I wanted to get your contact instead.

316
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,560
Oh, Lee.

317
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,080
You look so nice today.

318
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,400
Just nice,

319
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:08,720
or nicer than that jerk?

320
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,350
Outstandingly nicer.

321
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,730
I don't know how to respond to that.

322
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,550
You're freaking cute.

323
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,560
I am every day.

324
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,300
That's right.

325
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,030
You're always cute.

326
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,110
So...

327
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,800
let's celebrate your birthday.

328
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,640
How did you know it was my birthday?

329
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,090
So, how did you know it was my birthday?

330
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,100
That's a secret.

331
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,430
And...

332
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,870
Why are you peeling so many shrimp?

333
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,880
I think that's enough.

334
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,970
No, I'm not done yet.

335
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:08,380
Eighteen, nineteen, twenty.

336
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,210
This is the last one.

337
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:13,490
Why twenty-one?

338
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,810
It's your age.

339
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,680
Lee, I'm sorry

340
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,390
I haven't been talking to you much recently.

341
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,560
I haven't finished studying for my exams.

342
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,560
That's alright.

343
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,400
You've been getting a lot of attention lately.

344
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,670
From whom?

345
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,850
Come on, a lot of people.

346
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,080
They're even flirting with you
on Insta comments.

347
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:55,820
I haven't read them.

348
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,790
If someone tries to pick you up
right in front of me,

349
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,490
what should I do?

350
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,920
No one can peel shrimp for you
better than I can, though.

351
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,040
Can I have another gift for my birthday?

352
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,760
Of course you can.

353
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,950
What if...

354
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,640
I want us to be more than just...

355
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,850
friends?

356
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,200
If you don't say anything,

357
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:45,610
I'll take it as our talking stage, okay?

358
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,100
With that status,

359
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,720
my heart's beating so fast.

360
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,890
Feel it if you don't believe me.

361
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:27,450
Wait, I haven't cleaned my hands.

362
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,440
Let me clean yours.

363
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,400
Fah, where do you think we should go?

364
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,080
How about Ko Racha?

365
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,640
I kinda wanna go to the sea.

366
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:20,790
Sure.

367
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:23,360
How about...

368
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,200
Railay Beach?

369
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,160
This one is also stunning.

370
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,680
Mm, that's nice.

371
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,320
Or the Emerald Cave? Do you know it?

372
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,720
It's the greenish water.

373
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,680
Choui Fong Tea Plantation?

374
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,640
Where should we go?

375
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,060
I'll find the hotel, too.

376
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:48,840
Or they'll be fully booked.

377
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,040
I'm fine with anything.

378
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,120
You can decide.

379
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,480
Prasat Hin Pan Yot?

380
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:55,920
Mm.

381
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:57,240
I'm okay with that.

382
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,350
How about...

383
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,940
Phu Lom Lo?

384
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,530
Hello.

385
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:26,280
Hello, Real. It's Yam.

386
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,630
Oh, what is it?

387
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,000
Are you going to the reunion party?

388
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:33,040
Next month, on the 8th.

389
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,310
The 8th?

390
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,600
I don't think I can make it.

391
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,410
We're having a graduation film screening,

392
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,200
so I'll probably be busy all week.

393
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,500
Oh...

394
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:44,320
when is that happening?

395
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,040
You didn't invite me, though.

396
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,890
Fine, I'll invite you. It's on the 11th.

397
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,750
I'll take that as an invitation, then.

398
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,330
See you.

399
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,790
Alright.

400
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:17,740
What's wrong?

401
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,960
Look at that face.

402
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,050
Why didn't you pick up my call?

403
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,690
Why did I need to?
I was already at your door.

404
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:28,700
Let's eat.

405
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,880
What's this?

406
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,150
You said, "Let's eat."

407
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,360
The noodles, not my lips!

408
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,140
I'll eat more than just your lips.

409
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,440
No, I quit.

410
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:02,530
Hey.

411
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,720
No, come on.

412
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:08,460
Hey.

413
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,370
Hey!

414
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,440
What? Why?

415
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,300
Fine.

416
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,240
What? You want a fight?

417
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,680
Wanna do this, huh?

418
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:26,850
Hey, stop.

419
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,330
What?

420
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:29,560
I like this.

421
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,560
You do?

422
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:43,200
Hey!

423
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,850
Let's do it for real now.

424
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:16,550
Fah.

425
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,220
Here's the plan for the trip.

426
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,070
Here.

427
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,190
I wanna take you to see
some gorgeous mountain views

428
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,790
so that you can relax.

429
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,160
[Our Travel Route to Khao Yai National Park]

430
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,520
Whoa...

431
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,400
This is such a lovely-looking travel route.

432
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:35,160
Have you booked a place to stay?

433
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,990
I'm working on it. I've seen reviews of one.

434
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,260
Let me book it real quick.

435
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:49,090
Hello, I'd like to book
a room for this weekend stay, please.

436
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,510
Is there a room available?

437
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,970
We're very sorry,

438
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:56,380
the rooms have all been fully booked
for this weekend.

439
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,240
What about next month?

440
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,720
They're also fully booked.

441
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,570
They're all booked?

442
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,190
We're very sorry about that.

443
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,820
Are you interested in a weekday stay?

444
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,860
That's okay.

445
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,200
We're not available on weekdays.

446
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,880
Okay. We're sorry for the inconvenience.

447
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,540
Thank you.

448
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:29,380
They're fully booked until next month, Fah.

449
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,210
Don't be sad, okay?

450
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:34,710
We don't have to go there, honestly.

451
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:38,580
Just having you by my side

452
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:49,460
makes me happy enough.

453
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:53,630
I just wanna treat you

454
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:57,000
like what you've been doing for me.

455
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:01,470
Who says that you haven't done any of that?

456
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,920
Isn't just being together,

457
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:10,550
asking me

458
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,960
if I want anything,

459
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,420
if I'm tired,

460
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,570
and worrying about me,

461
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:21,160
considered taking care of me?

462
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:26,290
But that's...

463
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,800
Thank you

464
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,570
for taking care of me.

465
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,570
Moreover, don't worry.

466
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,580
I'll take care of you as well.

467
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,600
My Sky of my Sea is the best.

468
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,770
That tickles, Fah.

469
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:02,810
Can't I give you a smooch?

470
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,370
You can, but...

471
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,170
Let me do the same for you.

472
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,760
You're such a lovely partner.

473
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,440
You deserve a treat, right?

474
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,380
Huh?

475
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,680
What treat?

476
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:11,320
You want this, don't you?

477
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,880
How do you know?

478
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:15,800
This one's for you. Nom!

479
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,710
Isn't it tasty?

480
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,820
Here, let me feed you this.

481
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:24,650
Nom...

482
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:29,139
Can I try the salmon steak?

483
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:31,560
Uh-huh. Let me get you some.

484
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:33,860
Oh, watch for the bones.

485
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:36,530
Here you go.

486
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,400
Nom!

487
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,960
- Fah, would you like to try this?
- Yeah.

488
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,400
- Would you like to try this?
- Nope.

489
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:54,520
Choo-choo! Choo-choo!

490
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,560
What?

491
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,600
It's amazing.

492
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,240
It's still hot, too.

493
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:08,590
Here.

494
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,320
Can you stay here tonight?

495
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,320
Sure!

496
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,530
Fah! Someone's calling!

497
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:52,000
Can you answer it for me, Teerak?

498
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,380
Hello?

499
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,050
Fah, this is Yam.

500
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,990
Uh...

501
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,850
Please give me a moment.

502
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,350
Is that Lee? It's me, Yam.

503
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:16,230
It's not.
Let me give the phone to Fah real quick.

504
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,560
Hello?

505
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,560
Fah, it's Yam.

506
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,040
Who is that?

507
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,450
Hello?

508
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,820
How are you? Are you doing well?

509
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,690
What is it?

510
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:47,040
I'm inviting you to the reunion party.

511
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,080
It's on the eighth.

512
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,240
I can't come. I'm busy.

513
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:57,240
Is it because you're working on
the same project as Real?

514
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,370
Mm.

515
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:02,780
Well, I'm looking forward to
seeing the finished project.

516
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:07,950
You're coming to see it?

517
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,650
Yes, I miss you, Fah.

518
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:13,490
What about you?
Do you miss this ex-lover of yours?

519
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,270
Teerak.

520
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,920
Are you mad at me?

521
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,570
Teerak.

522
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,170
Fah, I'm feeling a bit bad,

523
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,070
and I don't want to feel this way.

524
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:39,960
What should I do?

525
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,810
What is it that you're feeling?

526
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,430
I'm possessive of you, Fah.

527
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,440
Even though I know that

528
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:54,690
you're not going anywhere,

529
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:58,920
I'm still possessive and jealous.

530
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:06,100
Thank you for being honest with me.

531
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,500
Do you remember that

532
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:10,900
you once told me that

533
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:14,510
if we feel uncomfortable
or if there's a problem,

534
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,210
we need to communicate?

535
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,250
I don't wanna act childish.

536
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,790
- But...
- That's okay, Teerak.

537
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:31,120
It's my turn to speak my mind.

538
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,160
I understand why you felt that way.

539
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,760
It's natural to feel that way.

540
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,070
Still, I can assure you that

541
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,100
I will forever be yours, Teerak.

542
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,410
I now understand what you felt on that day.

543
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:57,950
On that day?

544
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,500
Back at that restaurant,

545
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:04,640
you felt uneasy about Inn, right?

546
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,200
This time, I felt the same way about Yam

547
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,970
despite not knowing her at all.

548
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:19,350
It's true that I once dated Yam,

549
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,020
but we broke up a long time ago.

550
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:31,330
But she invited you to the reunion party.

551
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:32,400
Yet, I decided not to go there.

552
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,270
Do you wanna go, though?

553
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,030
I don't wanna do anything
that makes you feel uncomfortable.

554
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:49,570
It's only you who I wanna spend time with.

555
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,960
Since we're always together,

556
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,840
You won't get tired of me, right?

557
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:00,310
I won't.

558
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,680
I can simply
spend the rest of my life with you.

559
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,550
But...

560
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,440
Tomorrow,

561
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,960
I have to go home.

562
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:17,330
Why, though?

563
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,170
You're still upset with me?

564
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,360
Nope.

565
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,520
I just wanna work on my assignment.

566
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:33,250
You can work on it here.

567
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:37,460
I'm afraid that
I won't get it done here, Fah.

568
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:41,460
If that's the case, I'll drive you home, okay?

569
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,660
Can I have a hug before you go back home?

570
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,240
Once we finished the production,
I had no exams.

571
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,760
No exams or classes?

572
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,900
I had classes, but...

573
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,600
It was the beginning of the semester,
so I didn't have to do much.

574
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,840
But when a new production started...

575
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,810
I have exams.

576
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:01,070
Exams and projects.

577
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:02,110
- Good.
- Yeah.

578
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:04,150
Cause I have a midterm exam next week.

579
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,290
Okay, turn a bit and smile.

580
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:18,570
Look at him before saying hi.

581
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:19,870
Again, Inn and Noh.
[Root for them!]

582
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:20,710
Walk in again.

583
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:24,070
And action.

584
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:29,290
Look at him, smile, and say... "Sure."

585
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:31,260
- "Mm, sure."
- That's it.

586
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,170
Do you get it?

587
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:33,500
Yes, I get it.

588
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:34,970
Have some, Teerak.
[It's good]

589
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:37,050
You'll try to be the first.

590
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:38,860
They're setting up the next scene,

591
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,170
so I'm waiting right here.
[Chose the right spot]

592
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:42,690
- Yes?
- What did you say?

593
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,130
I'm not eating this alone.

594
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:46,810
I've got my boss.

595
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:48,750
Yeah, a bad boy.

596
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:51,400
Oh, Teerak.

597
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,420
Oh, Noh and Inn.
[Do I look cool, guys?]

598
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:53,880
I'm chewing air.

599
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:56,810
Nothing in my mouth.

600
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:58,690
[He's wanted]

601
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:05,690
♫Is it okay...♫

602
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:07,010
This won't work. The audio...

603
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:09,100
You know why?

604
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,230
Cause there's James.

605
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:12,070
He's always like this.
[Always loud]

606
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,390
Gems, focus on your script.

607
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:15,460
Stop talking to the camera.

608
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,670
- Inn and Noh.
- Okay.

609
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:18,530
Your dialogue, come on!

610
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:20,310
- Inn and Noh!
- Oh, Teerak.

611
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:24,550
Oh...

612
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,320
[Possessive gaze]

613
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:37,330
Okay, let's do a full scene practice.

614
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:38,210
Take your phone away.

615
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:39,610
Good.

616
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:41,230
Okay.

617
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:41,780
Good?

618
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:43,810
Great. Nice.
[Auau teases Save again]

619
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:46,010
No, I quit.

620
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:49,940
What? Hey!

621
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:55,110
Cut.

622
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:06,410
[Practicing first]

623
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:12,140
Ghlai's line's next.

624
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:14,070
Oh...
[Dropped something]

625
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:20,700
On your cheek.

626
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:24,560
[The rain came unexpectedly...]

627
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,760
[Some changes must be made to the script]

628
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:32,970
Dolly, cut two; take two.

629
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:34,010
Thomas, turn this way.

630
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:34,950
Oh, I didn't see him.

631
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,400
Sorry, bro.

632
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:38,400
Nice.

633
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,390
[Having a romantic moment]

634
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:41,470
Ready, set.

635
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:42,000
Hey!

636
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,360
[Got caught]

637
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,000
And action.

638
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,740
Cut.

639
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:55,640
Since we're always together...

640
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,320
[Does this help with the memorization?]

641
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:03,480
I just wanna work on my assignment.

642
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,520
[Motorcycle noise]

643
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:10,000
Hug him tight. Nice.

644
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:11,390
Spin around.

645
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:12,960
Hug him tight and spin.

646
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:15,170
That's good.

647
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:16,480
That's it. So easy.

648
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,320
I won't hear the dialogues.

649
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:20,040
Can you show me how to do Tai Chi?

650
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:32,520
This isn't working.

651
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,510
Gosh...

652
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:34,480
Jeez.

653
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:38,560
[What do I do?]

654
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:42,340
That's not true. I saw you.

655
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:43,840
He told us...

656
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,020
we had to dance.

657
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:47,480
What kind of dance?

658
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,910
He said Kong must do the Tai Chi dance.

659
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,280
- Do you know what it is?
- No.

660
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,980
- So I don't know how.
- So you're Thai

661
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,560
and chichi.

662
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,820
The card says that

663
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:11,690
at some point in time,
your partner will be pulled away.

664
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:13,450
I need to fly to Hong Kong.

665
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:14,960
I might have to be there kinda often, too.

666
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,460
Be sure to treat each other with love.

667
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,990
Congratulations to you, Fah.

668
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:21,900
Thank you.

669
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:24,140
I got you another gift, too.

670
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,520
However,

671
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,200
it's in your room.

672
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,110
A gift for you, Fah.

673
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:30,580
Me and a bow.
