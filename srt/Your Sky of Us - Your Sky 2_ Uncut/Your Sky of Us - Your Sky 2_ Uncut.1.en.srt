- Exactly, yes.

- We did.
- So we got you snacks.

175

What do you mean?

180
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,820
Like, going on trips

181

or throwing birthday parties.

182
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,120
We mean...

there's a new coffee shop around here.

184
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,570
It's also a bakery, so it has cakes.

185
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,210
- Told you we couldn't have left it to them.
- And there's a promotion...

186

- They'll ruin this.
- for birthdays.

187
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,310
- Exactly.
- Right!

188
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,810
- That's right.
- And there's a promotion for birthdays,

189
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,430
- so if you're throwing a birthday party...
- Yeah, something like that.

191
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,170
Come on.

192
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,000
Guys!

193
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,800
- Oh.
- Whoa, snacks.

194
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,870
You bought them?

195
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,610
That's nice. So our kids can enjoy them.

196
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,130
Right, have some.

197
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,880
- Whoa.
- There are so many.

198
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,120
This one's good.

199
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,760
What are you doing? Why's everyone here?

200
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,930
Right.

201
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,620
What are you guys doing?

202
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,150
Do you guys have any hidden agendas?

203
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,230
Teerak,

204
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,730
let's talk over there.

205
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,940
Talk?

206
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,320
Yeah, that's right.

207
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,390
Come on, have some snacks.

208
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,860
- Eat up, guys.
- Try this.

209
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,660
This is amazing.

210
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,320
- It's my favorite.
- Wow, that's a lot.

211
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,840
- This one. It's healthy.
- Try this one.

212
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,080
I won't eat any.

213
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,140
Guys.

214
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:13,910
What?

215
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:17,390
We're going to the cinema, aren't we?

216
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,740
- Oh!
- That's right!

217
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,680
- It's almost time.
- Yeah.

218
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,050
- We gotta go.
- I don't have a watch.

219
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,280
- It's okay.
- Yeah.

220
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:22,780
It's time.

221
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,110
- It's time.
- Let's go.

222
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,200
- Eat up, guys.
- Enjoy.

223
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,080
- Don't leave. Stay right here.
- Have some.

224
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,810
- Come on.
- Enjoy them.

225
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,810
You think they're acting weird?

226
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,400
All of them are.

227
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,890
I need to find out.

228
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,090
What are you looking at?

229
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:51,760
I'll find out.

230
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,040
Using my brain.

231
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,080
Do it. Ask him.

232
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,720
Is something wrong?

233
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,510
Nothing.

234
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,350
I was just...

235
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,960
thinking.

236
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,960
What were you thinking?

237
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Teerak, on your...

238
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,160
What do you want to eat today?

239
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,360
What about you?

240
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,400
Anything you want.

241
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,430
You're spoiling me again.

242
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,640
That'll make me end up spoiled.

243
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,000
It's okay.

244
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,800
I want my boyfriend to get everything...

245
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,720
he wants.

246
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,470
You know what?

247
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,920
Today,

248
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,200
Joy asked me something.

249
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,400
What was it?

250
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,980
She asked

251
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,600
if we'd ever fought.

252
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,730
As I tried to think of it,

253
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,730
since we never fight,

254
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:27,940
I can't even picture...

255
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,750
how it would be.

256
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,360
Neither can I.

257
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,760
However, in the future,

258
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,950
if anything bothers you,

259
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,340
let me know.

260
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,600
We can always talk.

261
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,160
What are you looking at?

262
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,160
Oh, Teerak...

263
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,300
Nothing.

264
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,840
Did you want to tell me anything?

265
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,980
Well...

266
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:11,960
Ask him!

267
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,640
Nothing.

268
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,650
Let's go grab a meal.

269
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,080
Sure, so...

270
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,640
let me spoil you this time.

271
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,480
Okay.

272
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,760
For someone so smart,

273
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:48,150
he's so dumb about love.

274
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,840
Say goodbye to the cool guy.

275
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,960
I think you need to help him.

276
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,240
If he does this by himself,

277
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,320
he won't last long before getting caught.

278
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,590
Yeah, I'll do it.

279
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,390
Babe, I got you some milk.

280
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,330
Thanks.

281
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,570
Wait, Teerak.

282
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,440
Come here.

283
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:25,970
Well...

284
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,940
I want your opinion on something.

285
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,320
What is it?

286
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,920
I want to surprise Dom.

287
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,560
A surprise for what occasion?

288
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,160
For...

289
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:41,860
For...

290
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,160
our anniversary.

291
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,840
Didn't you guys

292
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,840
just celebrate your latest anniversary?

293
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,530
Oh, right.

294
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:54,920
No, I mean...

295
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,360
It's not just an anniversary.

296
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,420
It's just...

297
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,610
It's the anniversary

298
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,610
of the first time

299
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,620
we held hands.

300
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,890
- What?
- Yeah.

301
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,620
Well, Teerak,

302
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,330
that feeling still stays with me.

303
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,910
It made my heart feel whole.

304
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,520
So we made this...

305
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,890
our special day every year.

306
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,560
- Something like that.
- I see.

307
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,630
Yeah, that's why.

308
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:25,660
Do you have any ideas for the surprise?

309
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,960
Like, having a meal, watching a movie,

310
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,470
spending time together, diving,

311
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,070
cooking, or meditating.

312
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,310
I think...

313
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,080
to make it romantic,

314
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,760
how about...

315
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,650
giving him flowers?

316
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:51,730
- Alright.
- That will be romantic.

317
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,110
Right.

318
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,710
So you like flowers?

319
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,600
What?

320
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:57,160
I mean...

321
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,300
Dom must like them, too.

322
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,170
That's nice. What else?

323
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,800
Anything else you like? No,

324
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,410
I meant, anything else Dom might like?

325
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,310
I think...

326
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,859
How about balloons?

327
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,410
I think he'll like that.

328
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,859
Wow, you're so thoughtful.

329
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,369
If Dom knew,

330
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,319
he'd be over the moon.

331
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,859
Right, I think so.

332
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,900
Here.

333
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:27,680
He told me

334
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,720
anything is okay

335
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,780
when it comes from your loved one.

336
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,640
Flowers, balloons,

337
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,640
or any surprises.

338
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:36,740
Right.

339
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,160
I'll book a restaurant for my surprise.

340
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,430
Gosh, Mr. Madly In Love.

341
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,320
You're not worried anymore?

342
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:45,810
Yeah.

343
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:48,430
About his birthday surprise,

344
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,500
keep it under wraps.

345
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,120
Don't let him know.

346
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,560
Well, I didn't hear anything.

347
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:18,680
Shit!

348
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,110
Go!

349
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:21,880
- Babe, your bag.
- My bag.

350
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:31,590
Hello, Type.

351
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,320
I got something.

352
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,090
Meet me at the slide room.

353
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:36,480
Just tell me now!

354
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,630
I can't! It won't be as fun.

355
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,330
Gosh!

356
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,810
Wait up.

357
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,120
Babe and Dom, keep an eye on the first floor.

358
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,320
You two, come with me.

359
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,550
Joy, hear me out!

360
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,080
Joy!

361
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,120
Shit.

362
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,790
It won't end with her.

363
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,490
Stop it. Don't say that.

364
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,520
It's meant to be a secret!

365
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,010
Joy, we're friends, aren't we?

366
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,180
Joy,

367
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:28,950
please.

368
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,800
Muenfah's planning a birthday surprise
for Teerak!

369
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,840
- Shit!
- Keep it under wraps.

370
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,920
Don't tell anyone.

371
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,840
Got it.

372
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,280
Let's find Teerak!

373
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,820
Teerak.

374
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:12,990
Teerak?

375
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,780
- Gosh, get them!
- Oh, okay.

376
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,330
Don't come any closer.

377
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,260
This way.

378
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,240
- Hey!
- Hi!

379
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:38,700
Come on.

380
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,780
You got caught? What an idiot.

381
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,000
- I'm leaving.
- Hey!

382
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,680
You're an idiot, too.

383
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:08,820
What are you doing here?

384
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,510
Lee, help me!

385
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,200
Ghlai, help me.

386
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:17,170
I've got something to tell you.

387
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,400
What is it?

388
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,470
Muenfah's planning a birthday surprise
for Teerak!

389
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,150
We're over.

390
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,790
Hey, Lee just texted me

391
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,520
that he's dealt with them.

392
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,990
Teerak won't know about this.

393
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,880
That's good. Otherwise, we'd really be over.

394
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,920
Yeah.

395
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,490
There she is.

396
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,520
Someone you should be scared of.

397
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,040
- Hello.
- Hello.

398
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,020
How's everything?

399
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,290
Today,

400
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:12,280
we've got two plots to propose.

401
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,920
Here's the first one, Professor.

402
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,640
We want to work on a teen story

403
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,980
that focuses on dreams and desires

404
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,530
that clash with family expectations,

405
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,840
where the teens must fight
for what they want.

406
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,170
It's an interesting idea,

407
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,760
but isn't it such a common one?

408
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,060
You might need to present

409
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,650
and convey it differently.

410
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,580
Actually,

411
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,870
we're planning to focus on the main character

412
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,260
and his background,

413
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,060
exploring why he has that dream

414
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,520
and why he needs to fight for it.

415
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:46,980
Okay.

416
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,760
That's nice. Any more ideas?

417
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,960
Yes, Professor.

418
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,900
Let me see.

419
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:56,990
We want to tell...

420
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:59,950
the love story of the LGBTQ+ community,

421
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:01,960
highlighting the differences

422
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,980
between the Baby Boomer generation and Gen Z

423
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,000
in today's evolving world.

424
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:09,100
Viewers will get to see LGBTQ+ love
in all its forms,

425
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,240
including the struggles

426
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,680
and how to address them.

427
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,440
I actually think

428
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,160
the second one is good.

429
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:21,010
Also, I think...

430
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:23,030
if you could tell stories

431
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,820
that highlight

432
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:25,950
how LGBTQ+ couples

433
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:28,620
face and handle challenges,

434
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,540
just like any other couple,

435
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,560
it would help viewers
connect with the experience.

436
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,760
So we'll go with the second one.

437
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,870
Sure, the next time we meet,

438
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:39,590
present me with your posters
and mood and tone guides.

439
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:40,550
- Yes.
- Okay.

440
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,280
Alright, so that's it.

441
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,320
You all can leave.

442
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,370
- Thank you, Professor.
- Thank you.

443
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:48,790
We're safe now.

444
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,210
Alright, let's go home.

445
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:51,850
Come on.

446
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:33,360
Saggy Cheeks, you're a celeb now.

447
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,350
Someone's reviewed your art toy.

448
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,150
A celeb?

449
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,390
Yeah.

450
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,560
You need to put it up for sale now.

451
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,960
I actually want to do that,

452
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,010
but...

453
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:48,540
I don't know where to start.

454
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,660
How about...

455
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,210
consulting an expert on this?

456
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,150
I have an idea.

457
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,450
My dad once mentioned that

458
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:05,000
he knows someone!

459
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,760
Go for it. I'm on your side.

460
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,850
- Hi, Dad.
- Yes, dear.

461
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,360
What are you doing?

462
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,730
Watching a Chinese series on iQIYI.

463
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,410
It's going viral, Dad.

464
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,520
So how's everything? Studying hard?

465
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,760
Well...

466
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,840
Yeah.

467
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,480
How about you? Busy at work?

468
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,440
Well, I'm tired, but it's normal.

469
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,640
Right,

470
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,760
your birthday is coming soon.

471
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:49,000
What do you want for this year's birthday?

472
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,620
I don't want anything.

473
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:56,570
I just want to be with you, Mom,

474
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:59,440
Babe, Grandpa, Fah, and my friends.

475
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,480
That's all I need to feel happy.

476
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,960
You're becoming so clever
and smooth with your words!

477
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,180
That's nice.

478
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,340
So how are things with Muenfah?

479
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,240
We're doing well.

480
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,370
He's so kind, and he treats me so well.

481
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:14,990
Well, I'm glad to know

482
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,290
that you're happy.

483
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,160
I'm really happy,

484
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,040
and I want the same for you.

485
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,760
Have you eaten?

486
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,160
Should I make an omelet?

487
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,410
Why do you need to?

488
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:28,410
Mom must have cooked something for me.

489
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,770
Why? What's wrong?

490
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:34,110
I think she's mad at you, though.

491
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,060
What?

492
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,680
What do you mean? She's mad?

493
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,560
When?

494
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,400
She's probably upset.

495
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,330
Seriously?

496
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,320
What...

497
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,760
A smile?

498
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,240
You're joking?

499
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,120
Nope.

500
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,310
You dare to lie to me?

501
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,390
I didn't lie.

502
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:52,360
You know what you'll get, huh?

503
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,720
Remember what I did when you were a kid?

504
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,000
I'll tickle you to death!

505
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,920
Don't you dare run!

506
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,560
Stay right there.

507
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,440
It'll take just a second.

508
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,870
Fah,

509
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,800
Dad just asked me

510
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,130
what I wanted for my birthday.

511
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,480
I told him

512
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,160
I'd be happy to be with everyone.

513
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,790
So where are you leaving for work?

514
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,660
- I...
- Fah, the flowers...

515
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,480
It's Teerak.

516
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,750
Fah, was that Punlee?

517
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,720
Yes.

518
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,520
I think he's on a call with...

519
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,370
Ghlai. That's why he's loud.

520
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:58,660
I see.

521
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:01,180
So, hurry and go to work.

522
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,310
Drive safely, okay?

523
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,530
Don't go home late, or I'll be worried.

524
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:06,580
Okay.

525
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,100
I'm now preparing...

526
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,060
Some document.

527
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,510
I'll be home soon.

528
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,200
Okay.

529
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,820
Enjoy your work.

530
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,790
You can do this.

531
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,860
Bye-bye.

532
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,860
Okay.

533
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,400
Sorry, didn't know he was on the call.

534
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,190
I was gonna ask

535
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,430
if you'd really want more flowers.

536
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,400
This is enough.

537
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,400
Yeah, it's more than enough.

538
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,820
No need to order more of them,

539
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,840
or it'll become a flower shop instead.

540
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,810
Exactly. You're right.

541
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:47,840
Oops.

542
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,610
Gosh.

543
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,010
Fine.

544
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,620
Are we almost done now?

545
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,310
Anything I can help with?

546
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,070
Well...

547
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,600
Just a little more touch with some balloons.

548
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,110
I don't want it to look so empty.

549
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,880
There's not much left.

550
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,790
Thanks.

551
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,080
So...

552
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,200
I'll help you with that.

553
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,540
What?

554
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,680
Yeah, it's your job.

555
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:35,860
Fah, you ordered more?

556
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,640
Yeah.

557
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,560
Have you told Babe

558
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,120
when to take Teerak here?

559
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,010
Yeah.

560
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:44,330
Great. Now, come help me.

561
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,360
What are you watching?

562
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,320
A series.

563
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,690
Are you going out?

564
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:13,990
Yeah.

565
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,430
Well...

566
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:17,810
Dom's at a party with his friends.

567
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,280
I'm worried that...

568
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,030
he won't be able to get home if he's drunk,

569
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,640
so I'll pick him up.

570
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,600
Can you come with me?

571
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,790
Sure.

572
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:28,110
But do you need to...

573
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:30,240
dress up just to pick him up?

574
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,370
Well...

575
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,850
Of course.

576
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:34,720
I'll meet his friends, too,

577
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,560
- so I need to dress up.
- I see.

578
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,770
Come on, let's go.

579
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:38,750
Wait.

580
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:41,480
You can't wear this.

581
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,570
You can't.

582
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,480
Go change.

583
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:46,640
Do I need to change, too?
Just to pick Dom up?

584
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,860
Well...

585
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,540
The place's fancy.

586
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,700
We'll need to enter it, too.

587
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:54,570
- Okay.
- Go.

588
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,070
Here's yours.

589
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,760
- Hurry.
- Okay.

590
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,920
Why are you letting me take the lead?

591
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:36,610
Oh, well...

592
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,630
I'm shy.

593
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:39,950
I don't wanna lead the way.

594
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,960
Come on, we'll be late for midnight.

595
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,000
What?

596
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,700
Why does it have to be at midnight?

597
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,030
It's nothing. Just go.

598
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,690
Come on. We'll be late.

599
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,830
Come here.

600
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,000
What's this?

601
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,040
Come on, go.

602
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,170
"To my Sea."

603
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,110
Babe!

604
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:11,740
♫Happy birthday to you♫

605
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,180
♫Happy birthday to you♫

606
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:23,980
♫Happy birthday, happy birthday♫

607
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:29,120
♫Happy birthday to...♫

608
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,440
Teerak, my love.

609
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,500
Make a wish.

610
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,320
I wish you endless happiness,
lots of smiles,

611
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:03,190
the chance to do what you love,

612
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:06,830
and to stay this vibrant forever.

613
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,360
I'll always be right beside you.

614
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,520
Thank you so much, Fah.

615
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,719
I love you.

616
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,179
That's why

617
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,179
Babe was acting weird.

618
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,270
So...

619
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:32,360
it was your plan?

620
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,239
Yes, I planned all of this.

621
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,980
Teerak,

622
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,520
Fah was stressing out.

623
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,719
He's been racking his brain
trying to figure out what to get you.

624
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,920
I'll like whatever you give me

625
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,960
cause I love you.

626
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,710
- Aw.
- Aw.

627
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,340
You're the best, my love.

628
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,360
Alright, before we can't take any more love,

629
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,050
let's party!

630
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:09,040
Here, I'll be the first.

631
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,040
- Thanks.
- Happy birthday.

632
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,040
- Wishing you lots of happiness.
- Thanks.

633
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,880
Cheers!

634
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,050
Come on in.

635
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,670
Thanks, Babe.

636
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:09,900
I know. Happy birthday to you again.

637
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:10,970
Thank you.

638
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,000
- I'm going to bed.
- Okie.

639
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,320
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

640
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,080
Thank you so much, Fah.

641
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,500
Today has brought me so much joy.

642
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,490
Mm.

643
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,480
I'm glad you liked it.

644
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,000
I didn't just like it,

645
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,000
but I loved it!

646
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:32,720
Love you, too.

647
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,640
Thank you for coming into this world
so I could love you.

648
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:41,510
Fah,

649
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:43,250
so...

650
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,880
can you...

651
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,160
sleep with me?

652
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,040
I mean,

653
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,280
can you stay the night here?

654
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,680
Oh...

655
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,600
I didn't bring any pajamas, though.

656
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,760
You're so adorable!

657
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,640
And do you adore me?

658
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:16,190
So much!

659
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,810
Stop that, Fah!

660
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,960
It's not right.

661
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:43,240
Yeah, let it stay that way.

662
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,470
Let's go to sleep.

663
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:53,750
Goodnight, my Sky.

664
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,400
Goodnight, my Sea.

665
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,170
Teerak,

666
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:02,530
why are you so far away?

667
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:03,590
Come here.

668
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:09,880
Fah.

669
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,680
Yes?

670
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,680
Shall we do something?

671
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,870
What do you wanna do?

672
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,560
I...

673
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,480
I wanna watch a series.

674
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,030
Okay, let's watch one.

675
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,420
What do you wanna watch?

676
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,370
Should we pick one together?

677
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,640
You like watching series?

678
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,990
Yes.

679
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,770
With this app,

680
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:38,600
I can spend all day at home.

681
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,400
What genre do you feel like watching?

682
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,380
A comedy or something more romantic?

683
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,320
Well, you can choose one.

684
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,040
Let's go with this one, then.

685
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:58,760
"Your Sky Series."

686
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,290
- Let's watch it now.
- Okay.

687
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,420
- Whoa.
- Wow.

688
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,780
He looks familiar.

689
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,620
Look at that.

690
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,550
- Why...
- He's pretty clumsy.

691
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:24,120
Exactly, he was so careless.

692
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,360
I'm going to the set.

693
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,770
Why are you only here now?

694
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:38,590
Cause I was in a class.

695
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,390
I just ran from my college.

696
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,730
My real university.

697
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:44,460
To Teerak's.

698
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,520
And action!

699
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,620
Aw, I'm missing Type.

700
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,830
Three, two, one.

701
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:54,690
There you go!

702
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:57,860
- Right, I'd do the same.
- If he was mine,

703
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,960
I'd do the same.

704
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,640
Go.

705
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,960
There. Move back.

706
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,900
We can't see you.
[Doing their best]

707
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,190
One, two, three, get up.

708
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,870
Like you're sick of him.

709
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,020
What are you looking at?

710
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:20,890
Oh, Teerak.

711
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:25,610
Fah!

712
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,690
No, I don't like it.

713
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:30,200
Are you a frog?

714
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,770
Oh, you're recording?

715
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:38,670
- Yes.
- I had no idea.

716
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,240
A hot Americano, please.

717
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,280
A hot one.

718
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,080
Can you write something on the cup?

719
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,790
My Sky, you can do it!

720
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:47,390
Capitalize the 'S,' and draw two clouds

721
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:48,880
with 14 hearts.

722
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:54,650
Do it yourself.

723
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:56,420
- What?
- I'll make your coffee.

724
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,870
[I can see you teasing him!]

725
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,440
[You won't stop?!]

726
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,600
Try asking him indirectly.

727
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,170
Right.

728
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,520
[That's too fast!]

729
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,480
I'll go ask him.

730
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:24,550
Well, I didn't hear anything.

731
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,240
Go!

732
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,620
Get her!

733
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,660
Babe, your bag.

734
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:35,490
My bag.

735
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,260
Where are they now?

736
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,520
[Don't go just yet!!]

737
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,040
[Too late]

738
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,800
[These kids are having fun]

739
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:53,010
Hey!

740
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:58,390
Gosh, get them!

741
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,260
You're an idiot, too.

742
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,160
- One more time.
- One more.

743
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,210
You're joking around.

744
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,770
Oh, sorry.

745
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:18,800
- My foundation's on it.
- It's on the camera.

746
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:19,920
What?

747
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:21,470
I'm ready!

748
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,320
[They're just doing their thing]

749
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:32,040
I just checked it. It's priceless.

750
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,360
- Whoa.
- You're holding it tightly.

751
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,320
- The Dead Demon Consuming Seal.
- Right.

752
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:38,530
No, it's...

753
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:41,080
the beans in Jack and the Beanstalk.

754
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:41,990
- For real?
- Yeah.

755
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:43,210
It's what he plants.

756
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:47,250
- Flowers?
- No.

757
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:49,170
Give her a hug.

758
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:52,430
Right, and then everyone else.

759
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:55,620
Do this until he gets everything.

760
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:58,030
It's for you.
[Will he ever get it?]

761
00:43:58,070 --> 00:43:59,080
Alright.

762
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:03,950
[Playing hard...]

763
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:09,100
♫Happy birthday, happy birthday♫

764
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:11,680
Then you guys in the back, come over here.

765
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:18,920
♫Happy birthday to you♫

766
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,380
Alright, when you sing the song,

767
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:24,150
- leave the last line to...
- Thomas.

768
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:25,580
Right. Now try.

769
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:29,800
♫Happy birthday to...♫

770
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,480
♫You♫

771
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,210
Fah, I forgot to tell you.

772
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,570
They're Inn and Noh, my friends.

773
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:49,770
- Hi.
- Hi.

774
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:52,370
Have some, Teerak. It's good.

775
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:53,410
Thanks.

776
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,760
I heard Fah was feeling jealous of you.

777
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,980
Yeah,

778
00:44:57,190 --> 00:44:58,270
and it was bad.

779
00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:00,650
You're the sweetest, my love.

780
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,300
That friend of yours...

781
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,570
He likes you, doesn't he?

782
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:10,230
You've been getting a lot of attention lately.

783
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:12,620
If someone tries to pick you up
right in front of me,

784
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:14,230
what should I do?

785
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,080
Let's eat.
