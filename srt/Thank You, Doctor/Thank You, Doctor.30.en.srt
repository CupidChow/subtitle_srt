4
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,800
Slowly.

5
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,720
Dr. Xiao. You're back.

6
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,240
How are you doing?

7
00:02:05,679 --> 00:02:06,679
I'm fine now.

8
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,690
Ma'am, are there any new symptoms lately?

9
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,280
No.

10
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,720
I'm just here for my prescription.

11
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,440
Okay. Take a deep breath.

12
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,840
Take a deep breath again.

13
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,039
How much is her dosage of Furosemide?

14
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:56,160
40mg, intravenous injection.

15
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,130
There's no problem with the dosage.

16
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,600
Ma'am.

17
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:03,319
Your breathing sounds are low in your right lung.

18
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:04,799
And there are moist rales.

19
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:06,799
I suggest getting an X-ray to examine it.

20
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:07,840
X-ray?

21
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:10,280
Don't do it then.

22
00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:13,199
- There are moist rales? - Yes.

23
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,239
I had them in my previous checkups too.

24
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:16,400
It's not a big deal.

25
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,639
It's more reassuring to get it checked out.

26
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,680
Am I right?

27
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,960
It's fine.

28
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,600
After the injection,

29
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,960
I have to cook for my eldest grandson at home.

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
By the way, Dr. Jiang,

31
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,919
is it okay to get my injection on this arm today?

32
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,720
My arm is swollen. It hurts.

33
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,239
It's Ms. Jiang.

34
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,239
Wait here. I'll get you the medicine.

35
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,840
Dr. Jiang is great with injections.

36
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,560
She's so fast and precise.

37
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,720
Lie down.

38
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,960
Wait for the doctor.

39
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,759
Lie down.

40
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,840
- Okay. - Here.

41
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,400
I think she should get an X-ray done.

42
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,079
Do you think there are problems?

43
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,079
I think...

44
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:07,120
the moist rales in her right lung don't seem all right.

45
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,479
But she's not willing to be examined.

46
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,639
I know.

47
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,160
Why don't you try again?

48
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:13,079
She trusts you, so she might do as you say.

49
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,639
Okay. I'll talk to her.

50
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,799
Ma'am, the test results are out.

51
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:28,639
Is everything okay?

52
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:30,479
There's a slight problem.

53
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:32,639
From the X-ray,

54
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,319
there's a moderate amount of pleural effusion...

55
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,759
in your right chest cavity.

56
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,770
Effusion?

57
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:40,650
This never happened when I had my checkups before.

58
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,960
Is it serious?

59
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,400
It's too early to tell.

60
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,080
It might be caused by heart failure.

61
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,080
Pleural effusion is very bad for your breathing.

62
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,439
So I would suggest an invasive procedure.

63
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,999
We'll use a syringe to remove the effusion...

64
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,280
and get it examined.

65
00:04:56,359 --> 00:04:57,359
Wait.

66
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,770
You mean you'll stick a needle...

67
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,679
into my lung?

68
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:03,879
You can put it that way.

69
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:05,400
But don't be afraid.

70
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,650
It's a very simple procedure.

71
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,239
It's still a surgery even if it's simple.

72
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:11,799
Sticking a needle into my lung...

73
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:13,239
will have an impact on my health.

74
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:14,600
It's very bad for my body.

75
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:17,239
Besides, I'm breathing fine and I'm not panting.

76
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,479
I'm fine. I won't do it.

77
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:20,210
- Ma'am. - Please calm down first.

78
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:21,960
Ma'am.

79
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,650
It's not good to have pleural effusion in the body.

80
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:29,919
Ms. Jiang, what do you think?

81
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,720
I think there's not a lot of pleural effusion.

82
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:35,479
Although it isn't a lot, it's still not good.

83
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:37,650
At her age,

84
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,080
it's still better to get it checked out.

85
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,160
I think Dr. Bai is right.

86
00:05:46,999 --> 00:05:48,559
Ma'am. Look.

87
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,400
Both doctors have said that an examination is necessary.

88
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,559
Dr. Jiang.

89
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:57,280
Do I really have to do this surgery?

90
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,720
It's not surgery.

91
00:05:58,999 --> 00:06:01,520
It's an invasive procedure.

92
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:04,280
By doing this, we can eliminate some issues.

93
00:06:04,359 --> 00:06:06,160
We can rest our minds.

94
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,039
And so can you, right?

95
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,520
All right then.

96
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:17,119
Please have her sign the consent form.

97
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,720
Ma'am, I'll arrange it for you right away.

98
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,999
Lie down and wait.

99
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,080
Here.

100
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,239
We could opt for conservative management.

101
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,960
Do you still think there's no need to run a test...

102
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,200
because there's not much effusion?

103
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:34,600
Mrs. Zhang has been in poor health.

104
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:37,600
Collecting the effusion might impact her health.

105
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,919
Besides, the effusion hasn't affected her daily life.

106
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,879
I think it's not worth getting a test for it.

107
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,640
You have a point.

108
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,960
But for someone her age,

109
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,960
it's still more reassuring...

110
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:49,119
to collect some effusion to run a test.

111
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,200
I still have my reservations.

112
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,479
Of course.

113
00:06:55,559 --> 00:06:57,280
Did you have a good rest these past few days?

114
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,080
You have to take good care of your health.

115
00:07:03,359 --> 00:07:05,640
If you didn't get enough rest, you can get more time off.

116
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:08,280
I'll get back to work.

117
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:18,160
Her oxygen saturation is only at 80.

118
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:19,679
Increase oxygen flow.

119
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,200
Doctor, I...

120
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:24,559
I...

121
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,119
I can't breathe.

122
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:27,320
It's okay.

123
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,879
It hurts. I'm in so much pain.

124
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:31,239
I'm in pain.

125
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,679
Right-sided pneumothorax.

126
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:38,999
Prepare for thoracocentesis...

127
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:41,239
- and closed drainage. - It will be fine.

128
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:42,799
The doctor will take care of it.

129
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,039
It will be okay.

130
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,720
Ma'am, you have a pneumothorax.

131
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,960
There are signs of respiratory failure.

132
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:50,039
Later, I'll insert a tube into your chest.

133
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,879
Once the gas is out, you'll be fine.

134
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:52,879
Don't panic.

135
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:54,439
Don't panic. It's okay.

136
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,999
- The doctor will treat you now. - Here, disinfect it.

137
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,720
What's wrong with me?

138
00:07:59,119 --> 00:08:00,840
I only came to the hospital...

139
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:02,520
to get an injection.

140
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,960
Lidocaine.

141
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:13,359
Doctor.

142
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:14,559
Contact the Radiology Department.

143
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,760
Prepare for a bedside X-ray.

144
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,840
Okay.

145
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:18,479
Ma'am.

146
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:19,720
It's time for the shot.

147
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,280
This might hurt a bit. Hang in there.

148
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,280
Dr. Xiao. Please give me a hand.

149
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,479
We shouldn't have done thoracocentesis on her.

150
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,280
The pneumothorax might be caused by rupture of a pneumatocele.

151
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,359
The thoracocentesis was done in a good spot.

152
00:08:49,439 --> 00:08:51,239
So it probably didn't cause it.

153
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,840
You don't know. She has always been weak.

154
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:56,359
We shouldn't have done that procedure on her.

155
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,159
Let's wait for the results.

156
00:09:01,119 --> 00:09:03,479
We found cancer cells in her pleuritic culture-medium.

157
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,320
No way.

158
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:07,279
Her lungs were fine.

159
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:10,080
How can it be lung cancer?

160
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,080
She's in the highest lung cancer incidence rate age group.

161
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,560
Dr. Bai.

162
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,600
You were right to insist on examining her.

163
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:21,999
It's important to treat the disease.

164
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:24,399
But the quality of the patient's life also matters.

165
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,960
You both looked at it from the patient's perspective...

166
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,519
and put yourself in their shoes.

167
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,239
That's something I should learn from you.

168
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:39,119
Right now, I think one of us should tell her.

169
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,639
Ms. Jiang, you should do it.

170
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,840
She trusts you more.

171
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200
Okay.

172
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,440
Ma'am.

173
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,279
The test results are out.

174
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,399
It doesn't look good.

175
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,080
I...

176
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:01,359
It's okay.

177
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,960
We're here for you.

178
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,320
Okay?

179
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,720
We'll cooperate with the doctor.

180
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,080
I'll contact your family.

181
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:11,239
Okay?

182
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:14,639
Relax.

183
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,159
Good girl.

184
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:30,159
Your family isn't here?

185
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,879
They went out to eat.

186
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:37,119
How are you feeling?

187
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,840
I feel much better.

188
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,200
Does your wound still hurt?

189
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:44,560
It hurt a little when I woke up.

190
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,279
I'm fine now.

191
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:49,359
Aren't you busy? Why did you come here?

192
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,690
I'm busy.

193
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:51,930
I have to visit you even if I'm busy.

194
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:54,720
Why? You don't want me to come?

195
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:59,279
I don't want you...

196
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,720
to see me like this.

197
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,159
Even so, I have to be here.

198
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,960
I'm your attending physician.

199
00:11:09,359 --> 00:11:10,359
Yes.

200
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,159
Who knew...

201
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,479
I would be treated by you?

202
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:21,119
How many years has it been?

203
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:22,560
Five years and three months.

204
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:26,999
I can't even remember.

205
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,920
You just had surgery.

206
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,159
You need more rest.

207
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:34,600
Come on. Talk less.

208
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,440
I'll lay the bed down for you.

209
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,399
- What are you doing? - Mom.

210
00:11:38,479 --> 00:11:39,600
The patient needs more rest.

211
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,999
I'm lowering the bed for her.

212
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,440
Good timing.

213
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,879
Let's go over the post-surgery reminders.

214
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,119
Didn't we go over it before?

215
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:47,239
Let's go over it again in case we missed anything.

216
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:48,999
The patient is pregnant.

217
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,040
You have to be extra careful.

218
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,080
- Dad! - Dear, what's wrong?

219
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:00,519
His blood gas analysis is normal.

220
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,960
According to the ECG,

221
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,119
III leads and Q waves,

222
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:05,519
V4 to V6, ST depression.

223
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,040
Hold on. Wait.

224
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,399
I don't understand a word you're saying.

225
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:11,759
Just tell me the illness that my husband has.

226
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:13,800
Yes. What's wrong with me?

227
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,759
Simply put, it's angina pectoris.

228
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:19,040
- Is it a heart attack? - I've never had a heart attack.

229
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,320
- That's right. - Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

230
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,759
Angina is not a heart attack in the traditional sense.

231
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:25,879
It's a common cardiovascular disease.

232
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,680
Aggressive antiplatelet treatment. Coronary vasodilators.

233
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:30,879
Okay.

234
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,159
Come in.

235
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,920
Dr. Xu.

236
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:55,359
How is Xiao Jing's father-in-law?

237
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:56,639
Is there any improvement?

238
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,040
Not really.

239
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,560
He also has subxiphoid pain and back pain.

240
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,920
It's getting worse.

241
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:04,399
It has been three hours.

242
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,320
It can't be.

243
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:09,200
Does it hurt here? Here?

244
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,119
- I'm in pain. - Does it still hurt?

245
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,159
Didn't you hear him moan?

246
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,399
Ma'am, don't panic.

247
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:15,680
How can I not panic?

248
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,279
It has been so long. Why does it hurt even more?

249
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,960
Some medicines take longer to work.

250
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,279
There might even be complications.

251
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,879
Don't defend him. I think he did it on purpose.

252
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:26,639
Why are you looking at me?

253
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,720
Do you think I don't know what you're thinking?

254
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,639
- With my daughter-in-law... - That's enough.

255
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,639
If you interrupt my treatment again, I'll ask you to leave.

256
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,440
It hurts.

257
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:41,119
Check the ECG again.

258
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,759
Run tests for myocardial enzymes and troponin.

259
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:45,239
- Come to me with the results. - Okay.

260
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,720
Why are you leaving?

261
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,800
Ma'am. Let's run some tests first.

262
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,479
What kind of a doctor is he?

263
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,600
Why are you looking at me like that?

264
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:15,159
My confession failed.

265
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,560
Check out a patient for me.

266
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,040
Come on.

267
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,159
- Dr. Xu. - What's going on?

268
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:27,200
Harsh breathing sounds in both lungs.

269
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,479
No moist rales.

270
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:30,920
Abdominal distention. Positive intermediate upper abdominal pain.

271
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,239
No rebound tenderness and muscle tension.

272
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,519
Is that all you've got?

273
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,519
What kind of a doctor are you?

274
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,840
You even have to rely on others.

275
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,040
We've double-checked the ECG.

276
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,040
The results are the same.

277
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,759
Sinus bradycardia.

278
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:45,320
III leads, Q waves. V4 to V6, ST depression.

279
00:14:45,359 --> 00:14:46,720
No acute myocardial infarction.

280
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,999
Are his ST wave patterns normal?

281
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:49,159
No.

282
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,440
Did you run the myocardial enzymes test?

283
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:51,840
Yes. It's negative.

284
00:14:52,119 --> 00:14:53,960
I also checked for troponin. It's negative too.

285
00:14:56,119 --> 00:14:57,560
Let's do an ultrasound first.

286
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,560
An ultrasound?

287
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,999
He has subxiphoid pain. There's no need for an ultrasound.

288
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,920
Subxiphoid pain might not be a heart problem.

289
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,800
Cholecystitis or gallstones...

290
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,999
have the same symptoms with biliary colic.

291
00:15:06,359 --> 00:15:09,040
So it's the gallbladder. Acute cholecystitis?

292
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,279
It could be acute cholecystitis triggered...

293
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:11,359
biliary-cardiac syndrome.

294
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,999
Chen Zhi. Do an ultrasound to confirm it.

295
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:16,159
Okay.

296
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,600
The gallbladder is enlarged.

297
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,999
It's definitely the biliary-cardiac syndrome.

298
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,119
What's wrong with him? It's not a heart disease either.

299
00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:33,279
Which one is more serious?

300
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,040
The biliary-cardiac syndrome is caused by a biliary disorder.

301
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,239
Insufficient blood supply to the coronary artery...

302
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,879
causes arrhythmia and abnormal readings on ECG.

303
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:40,920
It's a clinical syndrome.

304
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:43,320
This illness is a secondary disease.

305
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,279
But if you treat the biliary disease,

306
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:47,119
heart-related symptoms will also go away.

307
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,600
It's not a serious illness.

308
00:15:49,119 --> 00:15:50,159
As for the follow-up treatment,

309
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,680
I'll leave it to these two doctors.

310
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:53,560
I'll get going.

311
00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:55,479
- Doctor! - Let's go.

312
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,560
Don't go.

313
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,159
Doctor, wait.

314
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:04,119
I think you're much better than that Dr. Xu.

315
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,399
From now on, I want you to treat my husband.

316
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:08,040
- Okay? - Ma'am, you're mistaken.

317
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,479
I read about it in a book.

318
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,320
The biliary-cardiac syndrome is hard to diagnose before surgery.

319
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,560
The symptoms are very similar to coronary heart disease.

320
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,080
Most of the time,

321
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,200
we can only confirm the diagnosis during the surgery...

322
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,680
or after an effective biliary treatment...

323
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,680
when symptoms of heart disease disappear.

324
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,840
Why was this doctor able to tell...

325
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,279
whether it was biliary-cardiac syndrome or not?

326
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:29,200
In the end, you're just not skilled enough.

327
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:34,080
The two of them are indeed beneath me.

328
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,920
Then don't decline.

329
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,279
From now on, I'll let you treat my husband.

330
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,320
No problem.

331
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:41,359
I was a cardiac surgeon.

332
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:42,600
There's no patient I can't treat.

333
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,800
That's good to hear.

334
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:46,080
But come to think of it, I think it's quite a pity.

335
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:47,840
There was this surgery.

336
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,040
I accidentally left the scalpel in the patient's stomach.

337
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,600
Otherwise, I'd be the acting chief of Cardiac Surgery now.

338
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,519
What a pity.

339
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,040
It's such a shame.

340
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:04,399
What you said just now...

341
00:17:04,639 --> 00:17:06,920
scared the old lady into zoning out for the rest of the day.

342
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,720
Thank you.

343
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,920
Don't mention it.

344
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,840
I didn't do it to help you.

345
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:14,119
I just didn't want to get myself in trouble.

346
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,519
But that old lady isn't someone to be messed with.

347
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,720
Xiao Jing must have a hard time...

348
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,519
with this kind of mother-in-law.

349
00:17:24,399 --> 00:17:25,399
By the way,

350
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,119
how are things with you and Xiao Yan lately?

351
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,119
Mind your own business.

352
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,080
You sound mad.

353
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,959
Were you turned down after confessing to her?

354
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,679
Do I look like the type of person who would confess first?

355
00:17:42,879 --> 00:17:44,399
You do. You're exactly the type.

356
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:48,010
Tell me.

357
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,719
How did you confess your love and how did you get rejected?

358
00:17:51,719 --> 00:17:53,010
Go away. Stay there.

359
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,320
Tell me quickly.

360
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,010
Listen...

361
00:18:00,399 --> 00:18:01,490
To win a woman over,

362
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:04,010
you must be shameless and keep pestering her.

363
00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:06,010
Don't be afraid of setbacks and failures.

364
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,320
You're backing down after getting rejected once.

365
00:18:10,879 --> 00:18:12,399
I think you're worse than Chen Zhi.

366
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,679
That's the spirit.

367
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,199
Bai Zhu. Where are you going in such a hurry?

368
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,280
- I'm busy. - I just discovered...

369
00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:33,399
a Cantonese restaurant with really high reviews.

370
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,399
- Do you want to go with me? - I don't like Cantonese food.

371
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,800
Why are you here?

372
00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:42,879
Bai Zhu just went out.

373
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:44,679
I just saw him.

374
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,119
Where is he going? He was in such a hurry.

375
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,919
I even said I'd treat him to a Michelin Cantonese restaurant.

376
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,199
He said he wasn't interested.

377
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,679
He even said he didn't like Cantonese food.

378
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:54,080
Bai Zhu doesn't like it, but I do.

379
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,679
Let's go. Where is it? Take me there.

380
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,040
Sure. I'll go if you're buying.

381
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,770
Why don't you take Bai Zhu there?

382
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,490
Cantonese cuisine can't be compared to barbecue.

383
00:19:03,879 --> 00:19:04,879
Hang on.

384
00:19:04,879 --> 00:19:07,719
You still haven't told me where Bai Zhu is going.

385
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:09,119
How would I know?

386
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:10,359
I'm not a mind reader.

387
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,600
No, you're not.

388
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:13,399
You're a lame advisor.

389
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:17,199
I know even if you don't tell me.

390
00:19:17,719 --> 00:19:18,800
I saw everything.

391
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,600
Xiao Yan just clocked out.

392
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:22,679
Bai Zhu must have gone to look for her.

393
00:19:26,639 --> 00:19:28,199
Fine. Since you're so devoted,

394
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,840
I'll tell you some good news.

395
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,159
What good news do you have?

396
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:34,490
Bai Zhu confessed to Xiao Yan.

397
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,080
But she turned him down.

398
00:19:40,199 --> 00:19:41,320
When did that happen?

399
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,560
Hang on. What did Bai Zhu say?

400
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,919
I don't know the details.

401
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:46,959
You can ask Bai Zhu.

402
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,919
I'll treat you to a feast in two days.

403
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:57,959
There's no time like the present, Zheng Ya Jie.

404
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:02,679
In two days.

405
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,040
Xiao Yan!

406
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,399
I have something to ask you.

407
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:11,770
Go ahead.

408
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:12,919
I know something is on your mind.

409
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:14,919
You don't have to tell me your secrets.

410
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,359
But you should at least tell me why you turned me down, right?

411
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,199
At least, that will ease my mind.

412
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,280
I don't have any secrets.

413
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,199
That's just an excuse.

414
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,080
I turned you down...

415
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,560
because you're not my type.

416
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:30,359
What type am I?

417
00:20:31,879 --> 00:20:34,520
You're a puppy that smells like sweet custard.

418
00:20:38,199 --> 00:20:39,199
I'm not.

419
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,250
No, I'm not!

420
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:49,919
What does she mean?

421
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,199
(Tian's Barbecue)

422
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,280
That's enough.

423
00:21:05,719 --> 00:21:07,010
You just got rejected again, that's all.

424
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:08,119
Do you have to be like this?

425
00:21:08,439 --> 00:21:09,439
Let me ask you.

426
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,320
Do I look like a puppy?

427
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:15,919
Was that what Dr. Xiao said?

428
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,560
You do look like one.

429
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,840
Do I?

430
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,010
No.

431
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,080
How am I like one? Tell me.

432
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:26,159
Tell me.

433
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:28,959
I know.

434
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,159
In the eyes of a puppy,

435
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,159
everyone is a puppy.

436
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,490
Am I right?

437
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,010
You're a dog.

438
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,159
Fine, let's not judge each other.

439
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,359
We're both dogs.

440
00:21:39,719 --> 00:21:41,250
What's wrong with liking someone?

441
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,719
When will you let go of your stupid pride?

442
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:54,399
I will...

443
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,010
never...

444
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,199
This is so embarrassing.

445
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,199
Hey.

446
00:22:07,399 --> 00:22:08,399
Hey.

447
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,159
Dad. What has gotten into you?

448
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,439
Why are you back so late?

449
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:19,679
What happened to Dad?

450
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:22,080
He threw up in my car after drinking too much.

451
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,439
Come on, help him inside.

452
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,840
I'm carrying you. You're so heavy.

453
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:29,800
My goodness. My back is about to break.

454
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,520
Why did my dad drink so much today?

455
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,639
He doesn't usually drink.

456
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,719
You don't know your dad.

457
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,359
It's not that he doesn't drink. It's just that he's not sad enough.

458
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:42,119
All right.

459
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,280
I'm leaving.

460
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,399
Teach him a lesson when he wakes up tomorrow.

461
00:22:46,879 --> 00:22:48,639
Does he have to be so dramatic for getting dumped?

462
00:22:48,879 --> 00:22:49,879
That's not manly at all.

463
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,760
Mr. Xu, you haven't told me how my dad got dumped.

464
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,119
You're the puppy.

465
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Wash the dishes after you're done eating.

466
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
You're an adult. Don't be shy.

467
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:23,679
What's the patient's condition?

468
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,879
Pulmonary cystic fibrosis.

469
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:26,520
No breath sounds in the right lung. She's tachycardic.

470
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:28,080
Blood pressure, 122 over 66.

471
00:23:28,639 --> 00:23:29,760
Blood oxygen, 86 percent.

472
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,560
How are you feeling?

473
00:23:32,399 --> 00:23:34,000
I can't breathe.

474
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,919
Dr. Xiao. This is my patient.

475
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,359
Dr. Xiao treated this patient in the past.

476
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,760
I'm the one who admitted her.

477
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,240
Yi Yi, what happened?

478
00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:43,280
Mom took me grocery shopping.

479
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,560
She couldn't breathe all of a sudden.

480
00:23:45,879 --> 00:23:46,879
Get her a chest X-ray.

481
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:47,959
- Okay. - Do a CT scan.

482
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,040
You...

483
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:50,119
Did you hear me?

484
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,040
Dr. Xiao.

485
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,320
Has your condition worsened since you were discharged last time?

486
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,760
Mom has already been to the ICU twice.

487
00:24:02,879 --> 00:24:05,719
People's Hospital near where we live...

488
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,679
have already moved up my lung transplant...

489
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:10,439
to the top of the waiting list.

490
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:13,080
But there isn't any matching donor.

491
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,560
This patient has a pneumothorax in her right lung.

492
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,840
The sounds of air-filled blisters are worse on the left.

493
00:24:15,879 --> 00:24:16,919
Prepare a 16mm chest tube.

494
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,280
We can't use the chest tube. It's too invasive.

495
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,439
We should use a pigtail catheter.

496
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,639
Dr. Xiao. Let me remind you again.

497
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,840
She's my patient.

498
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,560
The condition of her lungs is not looking good.

499
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,560
Go now.

500
00:24:27,959 --> 00:24:29,800
Will I make it this time?

501
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:33,679
You're in critical condition now.

502
00:24:34,199 --> 00:24:36,679
Ms. Xiao. Please save my mom.

503
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,840
Don't worry.

504
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,040
We'll do our best.

505
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,040
I'll give you a heads-up.

506
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:44,760
You'll feel some pain later.

507
00:24:44,959 --> 00:24:46,159
But just bear with it.

508
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:47,159
Dr. Bai.

509
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:53,719
Tell the lab to hurry up.

510
00:24:53,719 --> 00:24:54,919
Ask them to run Fu Mu Yao's tests first.

511
00:24:58,719 --> 00:25:01,480
She was Dr. Xiao's patient.

512
00:25:01,719 --> 00:25:03,159
But he insists on taking over.

513
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,080
He's such a show-off.

514
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:07,000
Dr. Bai is also a great doctor.

515
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,840
Dr. Xiao.

516
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:12,399
Why does he seem to be treating you differently now?

517
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
He seems quite harsh.

518
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,600
Let's get back to work.

519
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Okay.

520
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,560
I have good news.

521
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,560
People's Hospital found a lung donor in Nanjing.

522
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,760
It's a perfect match for you.

523
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:30,639
The hospital has arranged for the lungs to be flown over.

524
00:25:30,879 --> 00:25:32,719
It will be here in a little over two hours.

525
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,240
That's great, Mom.

526
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,480
With a lung donor, you'll get new lungs.

527
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,439
Yes, finally.

528
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,480
Inform Dr. Zhang of Thoracic Surgery to prepare for the surgery.

529
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,919
- Okay. - Chen Zhi.

530
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,399
Get ready to administer ECMO for the patient.

531
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:47,199
- ECMO? - That's right.

532
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:48,919
The patient's oxygen level is so low.

533
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:51,000
This will help increase her oxygen saturation.

534
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,959
It will take two hours for the lungs to arrive.

535
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,199
Then the surgery will take at least four hours.

536
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,639
In the meantime, we need to ensure the patient's oxygen supply.

537
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,119
- Okay. - Wait a minute.

538
00:25:58,879 --> 00:26:00,119
Dr. Bai, let's have a word.

539
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:12,240
Why are you putting her on ECMO?

540
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,159
Didn't you hear what I just said?

541
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:15,520
Yes, I did.

542
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,800
Her oxygen pressure is low.

543
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:18,000
And it keeps dropping.

544
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:19,399
But have you thought about this?

545
00:26:19,439 --> 00:26:21,679
Once she's on ECMO, there's a chance of infection.

546
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,000
What happens then?

547
00:26:24,199 --> 00:26:25,919
She'll lose her chance at a lung transplant.

548
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,240
I won't let her get infected.

549
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,760
Lungs can only remain viable within 12 hours.

550
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,919
If she gets infected before the lungs arrive,

551
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,280
what then?

552
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,520
Not only are the new lungs not viable,

553
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,199
but there will also be issues with her own lungs.

554
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,879
- She might even die. - I'll say this again.

555
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:39,840
I won't let her get infected.

556
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:46,719
Dr. Bai. Will you still use ECMO?

557
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,919
Of course. Apply for it.

558
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:54,600
Sir. My mom's transplant will go well, right?

559
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,040
Don't worry. It will go well.

560
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,040
I also think it's a bit risky to put her on ECMO now.

561
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,560
Are you affected by Xiao Yan?

562
00:27:11,719 --> 00:27:12,959
If the patient gets infected,

563
00:27:12,959 --> 00:27:14,000
what are you going to do?

564
00:27:14,719 --> 00:27:16,480
As long as I'm here, she won't get infected.

565
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,600
Look at you. You're like this again.

566
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,399
It's time you get a woman to teach you a lesson.

567
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,600
Leave it to me.

568
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,320
You're from the lab. Why do you keep coming to the ER?

569
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,320
Doesn't your supervisor care at all?

570
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,040
Our supervisor always cares about us and encourages us.

571
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,840
He often encourages me to interact more often...

572
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,119
with colleagues in other departments.

573
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:37,119
Especially Bai Zhu from the ER?

574
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,280
That's right.

575
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,000
Bai Zhu. I made these macarons myself.

576
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,040
You must be tired from work.

577
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,359
Why don't you try some?

578
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,600
Is your name Bai Zhu?

579
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,600
I can change my name for the macarons.

580
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,359
Don't defile Bai Zhu's lovely name.

581
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:56,359
Bai Zhu, try one.

582
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,560
I'm not hungry.

583
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:00,280
This is...

584
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,359
From now on, please work hard when we're at work.

585
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,480
Don't run around.

586
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,119
I just wanted to bring you some food.

587
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,199
He's so stern and just.

588
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:10,719
Look at him.

589
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,840
You might get diarrhea.

590
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:30,439
This is the latest test result.

591
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,080
What's wrong?

592
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,240
Mom's liver function test values keeps rising.

593
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,480
Does that mean it's bad?

594
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:02,800
Your mom is now in an early stage of liver failure.

595
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Can my mom still get new lungs?

596
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:10,879
We'll do our best.

597
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:11,919
Okay?

598
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,719
I want my mom to have new lungs.

599
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,399
She will. Don't cry.

600
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,080
Dr. Bai.

601
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,240
If you turn off the ECMO now,

602
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,639
her liver failure may still be controlled.

603
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,159
What this patient needs now is the oxygen provided by ECMO.

604
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:32,320
If we turn it off now,

605
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,520
it's very likely that she won't last until the lungs get here.

606
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:36,639
- Dr. Bai. - How many times should I say it?

607
00:29:36,879 --> 00:29:38,399
I'm Fu Mu Yao's attending physician.

608
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,280
But you can't put a patient's life at stake.

609
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,199
Do you think I'll put her life at stake?

610
00:29:42,199 --> 00:29:44,520
She's in a very bad condition right now.

611
00:29:44,719 --> 00:29:46,679
There's still time if you turn off the ECMO now.

612
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:49,159
If anything goes wrong, I'll be responsible for it.

613
00:29:57,439 --> 00:29:58,480
What's going on?

614
00:29:58,639 --> 00:30:00,879
Please save my mom.

615
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,280
Yi Yi, trust me.

616
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:05,639
Your mom will be fine.

617
00:30:05,879 --> 00:30:07,679
Listen to me and wait outside for a while.

618
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,800
Let's go.

619
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:15,359
Coagulopathy.

620
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,840
Her liver is failing. It's really bad.

621
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,520
Plus, we gave her an anticoagulant.

622
00:30:20,639 --> 00:30:22,159
It damaged her blood coagulation ability.

623
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:23,879
Chen Zhi. Contact the blood bank immediately.

624
00:30:23,879 --> 00:30:25,439
Request fresh frozen plasma and platelets for her.

625
00:30:25,439 --> 00:30:27,719
- Okay. - Her platelets are down to 50.

626
00:30:27,719 --> 00:30:28,800
At this rate,

627
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,520
she won't be qualified for a lung transplant.

628
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,879
But if we turn off the ECMO now, she'll die.

629
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,320
If you didn't insist on hooking her unto ECMO,

630
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,679
this wouldn't have happened.

631
00:30:37,639 --> 00:30:40,439
Bai Zhu, I know you have a problem with Dr. Xiao.

632
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,760
But we're talking about a patient's life here.

633
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,679
First of all, I have nothing against Dr. Xiao.

634
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,480
Second, if you're questioning my work ethic,

635
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,719
then you're insulting me.

636
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,080
Dr. Bai.

637
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,800
- Turn it off. - Do you really want her to die?

638
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:57,240
What are you waiting for? Call the blood bank.

639
00:30:58,359 --> 00:30:59,399
Dr. Xiao.

640
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:12,119
It's that arrogant Bai Zhu's fault.

641
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:14,399
It's fine if he's arrogant.

642
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,560
Now, even Chen Zhi is becoming just like him.

643
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:18,359
It's so annoying.

644
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:21,280
Come on. Chen Zhi is so nice to you.

645
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,399
Nice?

646
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,800
Do you know how it feels to suffocate?

647
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,240
That's me right now.

648
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:28,840
Don't take him for granted.

649
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,760
That's easy for you to say.

650
00:31:33,199 --> 00:31:34,959
Do you know how bad it is?

651
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:38,040
Every morning and night, to and from work,

652
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:42,000
he drives that shabby, small rental car and waits for me.

653
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:43,520
If I don't get in,

654
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,520
he sticks to me like glue.

655
00:31:45,879 --> 00:31:46,879
How nice is that?

656
00:31:46,959 --> 00:31:48,080
At least you won't have to squeeze into the subway.

657
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:49,719
That isn't all.

658
00:31:50,639 --> 00:31:53,280
He gives me a morning call every day.

659
00:31:53,639 --> 00:31:56,119
If I turn off my phone, he would call me on the landline.

660
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:58,439
If I unplug the landline, he would even call my mom.

661
00:31:59,199 --> 00:32:00,359
That's a bit too much.

662
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,800
When we're at work,

663
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,240
he'll come clinging to me for no reason.

664
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,240
He says he wants to help me.

665
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,959
Actually, he just makes a mess of my work.

666
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:12,719
If I finally get to sit and take a break,

667
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:14,719
he'll come over...

668
00:32:14,879 --> 00:32:17,560
with jasmine and Malva nut tea for me.

669
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:18,959
He doesn't care whether I like it or not.

670
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,520
Chen Zhi means well.

671
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:21,760
Give me a break.

672
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,359
I drank his Malva nut tea three times...

673
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,760
and had diarrhea twice.

674
00:32:26,959 --> 00:32:28,959
Maybe the formula isn't reliable.

675
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,959
But he did it with good intentions.

676
00:32:32,639 --> 00:32:35,000
Overall, Chen Zhi is a good man.

677
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,280
Do you like him?

678
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:40,399
Why don't I play Cupid?

679
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,320
No, you can keep him.

680
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,359
Ms. Xiao.

681
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,199
I'm a little scared.

682
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:03,439
Yi Yi, don't be scared. It's okay.

683
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,000
My dad thinks that my mom can't be cured.

684
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,080
So he doesn't want us anymore.

685
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,439
I only have my mom now.

686
00:33:11,439 --> 00:33:12,760
I don't have a dad.

687
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,280
I don't want anything to happen to my mom.

688
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,040
Nothing will happen to her.

689
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,520
Don't you still have me and Mr. Bai?

690
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,119
There are so many doctors here.

691
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,159
We also have such advanced equipment.

692
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,320
Your mom will be fine.

693
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:29,320
Will my mom recover...

694
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,040
after she gets the new lungs?

695
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:32,359
Of course.

696
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,679
What if the lungs can't be sent here?

697
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,240
Then can I give my mom one of my lungs?

698
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,480
You're such a good girl.

699
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:47,199
But you have something more important to do right now.

700
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,800
You have to wait until your mom wakes up.

701
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,480
And I'm sure the new lungs will be sent here.

702
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,639
Okay? Trust us.

703
00:33:54,639 --> 00:33:56,959
My mom is a good mother.

704
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,639
Even if she doesn't tell me, I'm aware of it.

705
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,320
She cried every day because of the pain.

706
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,359
But she still insisted on cooking for me,

707
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:07,320
doing the laundry, and taking care of me.

708
00:34:07,439 --> 00:34:09,520
I don't want Mom to be tired.

709
00:34:10,959 --> 00:34:14,719
Ms. Xiao, I know how to do my own laundry now.

710
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,600
I want to learn how to cook.

711
00:34:18,439 --> 00:34:21,359
My mom wouldn't let me. She said it was dangerous to cook.

712
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,919
When I grow up...

713
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,800
and turn 10 years old,

714
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,159
I'll be able to cook for my mom.

715
00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:33,080
When you grow up, you can cook for your mom.

716
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,319
She will be okay.

717
00:34:37,319 --> 00:34:38,319
Don't worry.

718
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,119
Get me bed two's medical record.

719
00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:50,960
People's Hospital contacted me.

720
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,440
The lungs will be here in 10 minutes.

721
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,319
The pulmonary artery has been severed.

722
00:34:54,319 --> 00:34:55,319
Clamp.

723
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:00,889
Scissors.

724
00:35:05,319 --> 00:35:07,639
Bronchial tube disengaged. Clamp.

725
00:35:12,799 --> 00:35:14,000
I'm removing the lungs.

726
00:35:14,369 --> 00:35:15,369
Hold the heart rate.

727
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,040
- Okay. - Donor lungs.

728
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,040
Here.

729
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:39,679
Mom, you have new lungs now.

730
00:35:39,889 --> 00:35:40,889
Yes.

731
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:44,000
I made you worry about me.

732
00:35:44,279 --> 00:35:45,960
When you recover,

733
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,600
I want to make you a bowl of porridge.

734
00:35:48,409 --> 00:35:49,409
Okay.

735
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:52,279
I have to get better soon.

736
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,889
I want to drink your porridge as soon as possible.

737
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,080
How is it? Do you feel better?

738
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,560
I feel a lot better.

739
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,440
That's good.

740
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,719
Thank you.

741
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,369
Thank you, sir.

742
00:36:13,409 --> 00:36:14,409
Yes.

743
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:15,839
Bai Zhu.

744
00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:17,639
Come to the office with me.

745
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,119
Xiao Yan, you too.

746
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,000
I heard about the arguments you had...

747
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,639
regarding your work lately.

748
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:35,929
It was just an exchange of professional opinions.

749
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,080
It's normal.

750
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:38,960
Besides,

751
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,639
those patients were all treated appropriately, right?

752
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:42,960
I'm not just talking about the recent patients.

753
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,719
I don't want anything...

754
00:36:46,369 --> 00:36:47,600
to interfere with our work.

755
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,369
Especially the personal relationships between doctors.

756
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:53,960
Keep this in mind.

757
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,239
At any time,

758
00:36:55,759 --> 00:36:56,960
we are doctors...

759
00:36:57,409 --> 00:36:58,929
who treat and save lives.

760
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:00,560
Dr. Lu, don't worry.

761
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:03,040
I won't let anything affect my work.

762
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,560
Me neither.

763
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:19,369
Dr. Xiao.

764
00:37:20,799 --> 00:37:21,799
Thank you.

765
00:37:21,799 --> 00:37:24,040
I didn't insist on using ECMO just to go against you.

766
00:37:24,279 --> 00:37:25,679
It was my professional judgment.

767
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,119
You're always so confident despite the circumstances.

768
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:32,759
I trust you.

769
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,119
And I know...

770
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:40,440
that we're just colleagues.

771
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,719
So in the future,

772
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,409
I'll make sure not to cross the line.

773
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,839
I'll get back to work.

774
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,319
Such great comradery.

775
00:37:58,799 --> 00:37:59,929
Have you made up?

776
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:02,239
When did we even have a fight?

777
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:05,119
There must have been a plot twist.

778
00:38:05,799 --> 00:38:07,119
Did she agree to go out with you?

779
00:38:08,929 --> 00:38:11,409
Dr. Bai, Dr. Lu asked you to go to the EICU.

780
00:38:11,409 --> 00:38:13,000
- What's going on? - There's a patient with leukemia...

781
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,279
who was transferred here.

782
00:38:14,279 --> 00:38:15,560
I hear it's terminal.

783
00:38:15,759 --> 00:38:17,440
They have yet to find him a matching bone marrow.

784
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,159
So Dr. Lu asked for you.

785
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:21,409
Okay, I'll go there later.

786
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:30,929
This leukemia patient hasn't found a suitable donor.

787
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:32,409
Does he not have any children?

788
00:38:33,929 --> 00:38:35,040
He has a daughter.

789
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,159
She's not a match.

790
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,199
His son refuses to come here.

791
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,560
Sir.

792
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,409
Are you feeling better today?

793
00:38:47,799 --> 00:38:48,799
Yes, I am.

794
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,000
Sir, it's best if your son gives it a try.

795
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:54,480
There's a high success rate between fathers and sons.

796
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:58,600
That's not necessary, doctor.

797
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,639
I don't want to suffer anymore.

798
00:39:01,929 --> 00:39:05,000
Haven't I suffered enough in my life?

799
00:39:07,279 --> 00:39:08,719
- Ming Jun. - Dad.

800
00:39:08,889 --> 00:39:10,000
We've brought him here.

801
00:39:14,279 --> 00:39:15,839
Ming Jun. Calm down.

802
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:16,929
Slow down.

803
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,080
Xiao Rui.

804
00:39:18,409 --> 00:39:19,520
You're here.

805
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,080
Who is this?

806
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:22,839
My dad's son.

807
00:39:24,409 --> 00:39:25,480
Here's what.

808
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,409
The patient is now in a critical condition.

809
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,080
We need to find him suitable bone marrow for a transplant.

810
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,409
If you agree, I can arrange for a bone marrow compatibility test.

811
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:35,279
Doctor.

812
00:39:35,279 --> 00:39:36,520
That's not necessary.

813
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:37,839
Dad.

814
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:39,409
Xiao Rui is already here.

815
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,119
Xiao Rui.

816
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:46,679
I'm just happy that you're here.

817
00:39:49,409 --> 00:39:50,600
You've lost weight.

818
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:53,409
You look more like your mom.

819
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:55,369
Don't talk about my mom.

820
00:39:57,319 --> 00:39:59,080
I'm sorry about your mom.

821
00:39:59,319 --> 00:40:01,560
I told you to stop. Are you deaf?

822
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,639
How dare you talk like that?

823
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:04,839
Please, this is a hospital ward.

824
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,279
Talk nicely.

825
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,000
I'm holding a shareholder's meeting later.

826
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,639
Make the arrangements for the compatibility test.

827
00:40:16,369 --> 00:40:17,679
- I'll arrange it. - Okay.

828
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:21,759
Xiao Rui.

829
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,119
Drop the act.

830
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:24,369
What did you say?

831
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,520
All right.

832
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:27,159
Let's all calm down.

833
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,889
Sir, we'll make the arrangements now.

834
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:31,839
Just contact my assistant if anything comes up.

835
00:40:36,799 --> 00:40:37,889
What's wrong with him?

836
00:40:38,279 --> 00:40:39,799
Doesn't he have any manners?

837
00:40:39,889 --> 00:40:41,000
Xin Xin.

838
00:40:41,759 --> 00:40:44,159
He's your brother. Don't say that.

839
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:46,679
Why isn't my bone marrow a match?

840
00:40:49,799 --> 00:40:50,889
We don't have much time.

841
00:40:50,889 --> 00:40:52,639
I'll arrange for you to get tested as soon as possible.

842
00:40:52,839 --> 00:40:53,960
If you're a match,

843
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,319
we'll give you some medicine before the surgery.

844
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,889
It's to boost the growth of hematopoietic stem cells...

845
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:00,929
to prepare your body for the bone marrow donation.

846
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,759
To do so, you'll have to be hospitalized for some time.

847
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:06,440
- How long? - It depends on our consultation...

848
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,199
with the hematologist.

849
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:09,719
I want the exact time.

850
00:41:10,279 --> 00:41:11,560
I'll tell them to hurry.

851
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:13,319
Thank you.

852
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:16,199
You can make arrangements for the compatibility test.

853
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:22,759
Okay.

854
00:41:22,759 --> 00:41:24,000
Wait here.

855
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,279
A nurse will take you there.

856
00:41:28,929 --> 00:41:31,000
Mr. Su, you're going to Switzerland in two days.

857
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:32,759
Nothing is postponed.

858
00:41:33,759 --> 00:41:35,679
Your son is a match.

859
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,639
Ming Jun, you can be saved.

860
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:42,480
I've already told him to get admitted soon...

861
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:43,679
to prepare for the transplant.

862
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,600
Thank you.

863
00:41:47,409 --> 00:41:48,409
Xiao Rui.

864
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:49,839
It's a match.

865
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,719
Xiao Rui.

866
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,159
If you're not willing...

867
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,199
He is willing.

868
00:41:57,279 --> 00:41:58,929
- Isn't that right, Xiao Rui? - That's right, Dad.

869
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,679
When you get better, we'll visit Tianya Haijiao.

870
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:04,239
That's right.

871
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:06,409
I don't want to.

872
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:10,600
Because you don't deserve it.

873
00:42:13,369 --> 00:42:14,480
Xiao Rui.

874
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,600
You can't do this.

875
00:42:15,889 --> 00:42:17,639
Your dad will die.

876
00:42:17,889 --> 00:42:19,409
When he abandoned me and my mom,

877
00:42:19,409 --> 00:42:20,799
- he should have died then. - Shut up.

878
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,319
He's your biological father. How could you say that?

879
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,600
Xiao Rui, I'm begging you.

880
00:42:25,759 --> 00:42:26,960
Save your dad.

881
00:42:27,159 --> 00:42:29,239
I'm begging you, okay?

882
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,440
Su Ming Jun.

883
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,839
You have to pay for what you did.

884
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:53,319
Xiao Rui!

885
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,199
Can I have a word with you?

886
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,279
I apologize to you.

887
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,480
Mom.

888
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:01,929
You didn't do anything wrong.

889
00:43:02,409 --> 00:43:03,520
You don't need to apologize.

890
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,119
Su Rui. Are you crazy?

891
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:09,929
Your mom was the one who thought my dad was incompetent...

892
00:43:09,929 --> 00:43:10,929
and that he couldn't make a lot of money.

893
00:43:10,929 --> 00:43:12,239
So she cheated on him with her own supervisor.

894
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:14,159
You're a man. Would you be okay with that?

895
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:15,560
- I... - What are you doing?

896
00:43:16,409 --> 00:43:17,520
This is a hospital.
