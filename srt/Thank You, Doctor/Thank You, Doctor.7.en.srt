-Xiao Li, find Zhang Ronggui's medication records.
-Okay.

17
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:54,400
Doctor Xiao, Zhang Guirong's inspection report came out.

18
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,080
Pulmonary embolism. Thrombolysis is required as soon as possible.

19
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,780
Okay.

20
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,830
Doctor.

21
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,590
Just don't cause him any more suffering.

22
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,720
Let him leave us peacefully.

23
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,560
The patient still has a chance of survival.

24
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,250
You are the doctor, you understand more than I do.

25
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,010
He is already not okay.

26
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,650
This whole treatment process is causing him to suffer.

27
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,580
Just let him leave us with dignity.

28
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,360
How about this, we will first have the patient undergo thrombolysis drug treatment.

29
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,880
Afterwards, we will wait for Da Hai

30
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,120
and you can discuss this again.

Old Zhang

32
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,550
Don't worry, let go.

33
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,570
O...

34
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,120

35
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:26,070
Okay.

36
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,950
Okay.

37
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,950
I promise you.

38
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,410
I promise you.

39
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,180
Every time we run into this type of patient who wants to give up on treatment

40
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,440
I really want to to convince them to keep trying.

41
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,780
To the family, this is their life's hardest choice.

42
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:03,520
Can I trouble two doctors to keep giving Lao Zhang treatment?

43
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,980

Ventricular fibrillation. Prepare to defibrillate.

one ml of epinephrine.

58
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:15,100
Charing complete. Step back.

59
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,360
He is still not very stable. We need to monitor him.

60
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:28,440
We lost his heartbeat. Let me.

61
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,950
You need to save him.

62
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,330
We will do our best.

63
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:25,330
Doctor Xiao, it has already been thirty minutes.

64
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,630
Auntie, you need to prepare yourself.

65
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:36,210
In most situations, when we do CPR for thirty minutes

66
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:40,840
and the patient still hasn't been revived, they can't maintain their blood pressure

67
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,200
-so we can declare the time of death.
-Doesn't he still have a heartbeat?

68
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,360
This is because we are giving him CPR.

69
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,920
Once we stop, his heartbeat will go away.

70
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,180
Then you can't stop.

71
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,800
-You need to save him.
-Let's try again.

72
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,570
-In a bit, go check on Bed Three again and make sure they don't have any problems.
-Doctor Bai

73
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,380
-What?
-Zhang Guirong is not okay.

74
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,980
Doctor Xiao is trying to rescue him. She has been giving him CPR for forty minutes.

75
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,210
Doctor Xiao, I'm here.

76
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:12,440
Forty minutes.

77
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,990
According to Zhang Guirong's physical condition

78
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,880
under normal conditions, thirty minutes without reviving means that he can't maintain his blood pressure.

79
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,670
-You can announce the death.
-Doctor Xiao doesn't want to give up.

80
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:24,700
Such a long time, it's been too long since his brain has gotten oxygen.

81
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,180
There's no way to save him.

82
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,110
Doctor, you can't stop.

83
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,940
Save him! I'm begging you!

84
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,570
-You can't stop!
-Auntie. Auntie Li. Don't be like this.

85
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:45,950
-Auntie Li. I have really done all I can. My condolences.
-I'm begging you!

86
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,240
Auntie Li, Doctor Xiao has already done all she can.

87
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,800
I'm begging you.

88
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,120
Look, he has a heartbeat again!

89
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,350
Doctor Bai.

90
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,050
How is he?

91
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,520
He has a rib fracture.

92
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:20,040
CPR breaking ribs is the most common complication.

93
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,510
Teacher Zhang is old

94
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,990
so it's easier to break them.

95
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:01,270
The patient has no was to recover his heartbeat.

96
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,160
Time of death

97
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,360
October 12th, 2018

98
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,110
0:02.

99
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,080
The person who died, Zhang Guirong.

100
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,930
Cut off the ECG.

101
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,480
Start a death notice, Tang Hua.

102
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,390
Okay.

<i>[First Aid Room]</i>

105
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,080
Teacher Bai, in the situation like Zhang Gui Rong's just now,

106
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,640
there was not need to do more CPR, right?

107
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,210
It was impossible to save him.

108
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,320
Medically speaking, that's true.

109
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,360
But beyond medical science, there are still many possibilities.

110
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:36,240
As long as there's one sliver of hope, as doctors, we cannot give up.

111
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,450
Do you know what our rescue just now meant to Zhang Gui Rong

112
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,570
and his family?

113
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:52,590
But death is part of life.

114
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:57,120
When medical science is powerless, we must also learn to accept death.

115
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,870
True, and that's also what I thought previously.

116
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:09,200
But if your family member, your most beloved person, who is facing death,

117
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,720
will you do everything you can to save them,

118
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,940
or simply say, let's give up

119
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,080
because death of part of life?

120
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,380
In fact, the rescue effort we did just now was uncessary toward the patient's condition,

121
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,520
and it's even somewhat cruel.

122
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:40,580
But to the patient himself and to his family, it was necessary.

123
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:56,830
in the face of death, we doctors don't arren't qualified to say "give up."

124
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,630
Grandfather! Grandfather...

125
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,740
Doctor, how is my grandfather?

126
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:16,290
The patient has just passed away. My condolences.

127
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:24,840
My grandfather was really good to me when he was alive.

128
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,930
Grandfather... Grandfather...

Enter.

131
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,800
Dr. Bai, Zhang Gui Rong was...

132
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:57,010
Dr. Xiao, if you have any doubts about about my clinical treatment just now, or,

133
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,070
there is anything that violates medical ethics,

134
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,960
you can go and report on me anytime.

135
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,090
I came to thank you.

136
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:13,100
Thank you for completing for me that last rescue effort.

137
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,930
Dr. Xiao, you are too courteous.

138
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:28,900
It was actually what you taught me.

139
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,530
I'm the one who should say thanks.

140
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:38,720
Then... I need to go make the rounds.

141
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,040
Oh yes.

142
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:49,430
The coffeemaking machine is right there. Help yourself if you want to drink coffee.

143
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,880
I'm innocent, police officers. You're arresting the wrong guy.

144
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,190
What happened?

145
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,990
Gathering people to gamble.

146
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,710
He had it coming.

147
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,150
All the organs in the patient's body already failed.

148
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:20,060
The pulmonary embolism triggered cardiac arrest

149
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,040
You performed nearly 40 minutes of CPR.

150
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,270
Spontaneous circulation never resumed.

151
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:30,750
As a former heart surgeon, didn't you know what that meant?

152
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:35,090
When CPR has been performed over 30 minutes, if the patient still hasn't resumed spontenous circulation,

153
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:38,400
the ultimate chance of success is reduce to lower than one percent.

154
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,220
After a long period of rescue, even if the patient resumed spontenous circulation,

155
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,750
it is also likely for the patient to die from organ failure,

156
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,670
or remain in a vegetative state.

157
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,410
So what were you doing last night?

158
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:51,390
You even fractures three ribs from the pressing.

159
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:54,410
Dean, you really can't blame Dr. Bai on this incident.

160
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:57,550
If you blame anyone, blame me. I am the patient's attending physician.

161
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,540
You've learned to take cover?

162
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,060
What? You think this is a military medal?

163
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,980
It's up for grabs?

164
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,670
After consideration, the hospital's commission has decided

165
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,910
to issue a criticism report on the two of you.

166

[Criticism Regarding Drs. Bai Zhu and Xiao Yan During Patient Rescue]</i>

168
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:47,580
Going forward, I think everyone should learn a cautionary lesson from this incident.

A full hospital report.

You're good, Bai Zhu, under fire again. Why isn't there a photo?

172
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,660
Why criticize our Dr. Xiao?

173
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,440
We weren't the ones that insisted on the rescue?

174
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,260
It's time. Let's go.

175

Bed No. 7 needs to get a CT scan.

176
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,970
Strange, this smells a lot like a conspiracy.

177
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:26,860
This reminds me of something. When we were younger it was everyone's dream

178
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:31,030
to have their name associated with prettiest girl in school.

179
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:34,640
If we can't both share the glory, I might as well take you down with me.

180
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,710
What is the phrase again?

181
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,610
Unrequited young love.

182
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,420
Get lost.

183
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,440
You came at the right time, I wanted to ask you something.

184
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,490
Go ahead.

185
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:09,750
I can understand that Zhang Gui Rong was already prepared for death.

186
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:14,730
He couldn't do anything, except lay there in pain, kept alive by medicines and machines.

187
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:18,430
Maybe for him, his only reason for living

188
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,680
was to leave some money for Zhang Da Hai.

189
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,740
Maybe that was the last act of love, from an old man to his grandson.

190
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,840
But, when I was a medical student

191
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,440
both our teachers and the course

192
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,200
told us that we should respect the patient's wishes.

193
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,650
I've never doubted it.

194
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,560
But today, looking at Zhang Gui Rong's case,

195
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,700
it made me doubt myself.

196
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,720
What shows the greatest respect to life, or to death?

197
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,560
Is it respecting the patient's wishes? Or respecting life and death themselves?

198
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,610
The ethics of life and death are extremely complicated.

199
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,920
It's hard to say what is right or wrong.

200
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,170
And hard to say what is the right course of action

201
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,130
to show the greatest respect to life and death.

202
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:05,410
All we can do, is to trust medicine, to trust rationality.

203
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:11,220
As for Zhang Gui Rong, anyone's wishes can't become our basis for judgement.

204
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,400
As doctors, we have one standard.

205
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:18,530
As long as the patient's heart is still beating, we must try our best until the end.

206
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:21,150
You're selling your ideas again.

207
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,600
There's a great barbecue restaurant on Zhong Shan road.

208
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,160
As an apology for dragging you down and getting you punished, I'll buy you a meal.

209
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,580
Sounds pretty good.

210
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,490
Then it's on.

211

Oh, I invited Xu Yi Ran, Chen Zhi and the others.

- Teacher Wu, isn't it? - Hello.

00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:59,720
I was Zhi Yuan's teacher when he was a child.

223
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,620
You were his fiancee?

224
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,840
Zhi Yuan was so young, how did he...?

225
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,550
An accident.

226
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,970
I remember in fourth grade,

227
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:17,390
I asked each classmate what they wanted to be when they grew up.

228
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:20,380
Zhi Yuan was the first to raise his hand and say

229
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,720
he wanted to become a doctor when he grew up.

230
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,480
He wanted to help all the patients in the world get better.

231
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,060
He already achieved his goal.

232
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:34,380
He was one of the best doctors at Doctors Without Borders.

233
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,610
How wonderful that must have been.

234

So this time you came to see me because...?

235
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,650
You see.

236
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:46,450
Zhi Yuan told me that when he was younger, himself, his parents and his grandmother

237
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:49,290
lived in a place called 'Smoke Alley'.

238
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:54,380
He said that he wanted to take me there.

239
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:58,320
So I wanted to ask you if you know where this 'Smoke Alley' is?

240
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,730
Smoke Alley...?

241
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:06,070
I don't think there is anywhere near our school called Smoke Alley.

242
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:09,460
Did Zhi Yuan say anything else about it?

243
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,950
He just told me the name Smoke Alley.

244
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:19,260
At that time, it was always his father who took him home from school.

245
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,680
I remember they lived quite far away,

246
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,000
but I don't know where exactly.

247
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:30,970
Why don't you see if you can get in contact with his classmates from back then.

248
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,420
Maybe one of them will know.

249
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:36,610
I think I know the contact information for a few of them. Why don't I ask them

250
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:38,680
and see if they know anything about it.

251

The doctors spoke up for you, you think you have backup now, is that it?

317
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:57,350
You're even happy about it.

318
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:00,340
Let me tell you, I've had it up to here with you.

319
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,210
If you take it too far one day

320
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:03,920
no matter whether you poo or wee on your bed

321
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,960
there will be no-one to clean you up.

322
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:09,050
Drink some water, here.

323
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:13,390
Slowly. Drink first and then pee, ok?

324
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:17,480
Did you do it on purpose?

325
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,540
Did you do it on purpose?

326
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:25,300
<i>[Nurse Station]</i> 
 - Give this to the Director.

327
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,050
Here.

328
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:34,280
Head Nurse, why have we seen so many unfilial children and grandchildren.

329
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:37,870
It's not easy to deal with people with Alzheimer.

330
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:40,340
They don't do what you tell them, but you can't do anything about it.

331
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:43,560
But his attitude was really off. That is own father.

332
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,620
It looks like he's has this disease for a long time.

333
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,840
Alzheimer's is really hard on the family.

334
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,420
He's not like a son. He's like a 'white-eyed wolf'.  (TN: This describes an ungrateful person)

335
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:56,720
We just said goodbye to that Zhang Da Hai and now in comes...what was his name?

336
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,620
Cheng Wei Liang? What he's doing is evil, not good. (TN: Wei Liang means 'good person'.)

337
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:05,680
I thought we stood for values in our society.

338
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,890
Why are there so many unfilial children and grandchildren?

339
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,760
You aren't him.

340
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,540
You can't understand what he is going through.

341
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,950
Every family has their own issues to deal with.

342
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:17,610
Head Nurse, you've been married for so long.

343
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:19,490
Why did you never have children?

344
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:21,500
Because of your job?

345
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,180
I'm going to the ward.

346
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,930
You sound a bit husky, drink more water.

347
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:29,720
Head Nurse!

348
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:40,870
From the lab results and X-ray it looks like it's pneumonia.

349
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:42,570
It's quite serious.

350
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:46,660
It could very easily lead to acute respiratory failure. He should be moved to the EICU.

351
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,950
It's that bad?

352
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:52,390
Severe pneumonia can lead to multiple organ failure.

353
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:55,510
It's safer to move him to the EICU. But the costs are higher.

354
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:58,320
That's no problem. No matter how expensive, he needs to be treated.

355
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,950
Thank you, Doctor.

356
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,800
Wei Jie.

357
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,170
Wei Xiu.

358
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:15,410
Quiet now. Those two are busy, they can't come and see you.

359
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:17,510
Wei Jie.

360
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,740
Wei Xiu.

361
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:25,080
No matter how good I am to you, you can still only think about my two siblings.

362
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,620
Wei Jie.

363
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,980
Wei Xiu.

364
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:36,050
- Alright, I'll go and call them. 
 - Wei Jie.

365
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:38,250
You stay there. Don't move, you hear me?

366
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,480
Wei Jie.

367
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,650
Wei Xiu.

368
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:47,180
Hi, brother. Our dad is ill.

369
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,530
Last night we came to Tongshan Hospital.

370
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:54,870
It's quite serious. He's staying in...the EICU.

371
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:58,870
The doctor said it's pneumonia and there's a chance of respiratory failure.

372
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,720
What do you mean it's my fault?

373
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,390
If you think I'm doing a bad job, you take care of him!

374
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:07,320
If you're busy don't start nagging me.

375
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:11,240
Dad wants to see you and Wei Xiu, get over here as soon as you can.

376
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,770
Cheng Guo Dong, it's time for your medicine.

377
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:14,480
I won't take them.

378
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,660
- You have to. 
 - I won't.

379
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:21,370
Look, you are still coughing. If you take this medicine

380
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:23,890
we can get you better. Here they are.

381
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:25,760
I won't take them!

382
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:29,730
- What's wrong? 
- The patient won't take his medicine.

383
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:32,220
No, no!

384
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,120
- You can't take this tube out. - I won't take the medicine.

385
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,360
- Why not? 
 - I won't take it.

386
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,730
Let me try.

387
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:41,710
Taking medicine will help you get better. Alright?

388
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,490
I won't take them, I won't.

389
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:47,980
This medicine is sweet, it's not bitter.

390
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:51,160
- Sweet? 
 - Yes, really. Why don't you have a try?

391
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:54,320
Slowly now.

392
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,440
That's it. Here.

393
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,490
Go away.

394
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:01,220
- What are you doing? Are you ok? 
 - It's bitter.

395
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,910
- I'm fine.
 - I'll find his relatives.

396
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:05,120
- No, no, no! 
 - I'll find his relatives.

397
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,270
- I won't eat them. 
 - Ok, ok. No medicine.

398
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:11,180
You really think I am calling you for money?

399
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,610
Wei Xiu, do you even have a conscience?

400
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:17,120
Have I ever asked you or Wei Jie for money when dad was ill?

401
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,090
Let me tell you. This time

402
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:23,080
no matter how much dad's treatment costs, I won't ask you for any money.

403
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,210
Yes, I meant it.

404
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:28,250
Let me ask you. Dad is ill and he wants to see you and Wei Jie. Will you come?

405
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,830
If you are coming, make it quick. Stop wasting my time.

406
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,240
- Excuse me. 
  - Yes, nurse?

407
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,420
The patient is refusing to take his medicine.

408
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,090
He's really trying to torture me.

409
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,670
This way.

410
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:45,020
It's alright, you don't have to take it.

411
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:48,680
- Doctor. Is my father refusing to take his medicine?

412
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,790
We've already tried several times.

413
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:54,610
This happens a lot.

414
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,830
Let me have a go, you can go about your business.

415
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:59,620
Then we'll leave you to it. Don't let me take out the tube.

416
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,120
Alright.

417
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:07,120
Thank you, Doctor.

418
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:14,710
Doctor Xiao. Let's wait.

419
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:17,700
I don't like the relative's attitude.

420
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,330
Take your medicine, dad.

421
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:22,740
I won't.

422
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,240
How can you get better if you don't take your medicine? Here, open wide.

423
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,010
I won't take it.

424
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:27,900
- Stay still, dad. 
 - I won't take it.

425
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,330
- Dad, you have to. 
 - I won't!

426
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:32,190
Dad, why are you making things so hard? The doctor said you need to take them as soon as possible.

427
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,380
- Listen to me! 
 - I won't!

428
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,710
Didn't I tell you to stay still?

429
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:40,320
What are you doing?

430
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,550
Does it hurt?

431
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:02,150
It hurts.

432
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:05,330
- What happened? 
 - His son hit him.

433
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,160
Why?

434
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,720
Give him his medicine. Where are you going?

435
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,450
- Doctor Xiao. 
- Leave him alone. I just saw him crying.

436
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:16,380
He still has the cheek to cry? His cheek is swelling already!

437
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,900
Give him his medicine.

438
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,290
Cheng Guo Dong, it's time for your medicine.

439
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:22,850
Xiao Lin, once you have given him his medicine

440
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:25,750
- go and get an ice pack for his face. 
 - Yes.

441
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,920
This is your medicine.

442
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,920
What are you doing? You're calling the police?

443
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,350
You are calling the police because of that patient?

444
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,460
He is mistreating the elderly.

445
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,180
The police need to be involved.

446
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:52,200
I know you spent a long time working abroad. It's not wrong to call the police in this situation.

447
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,030
But you might not really understand the patient's family situation.

448
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:59,270
Why don't we carry on observing him first?

449
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,970
Come with me.

450
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,660
You haven't been working here for long.

451
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:14,230
Slowly you will come to realize, once you've worked here for a while

452
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,970
you can tell not only what's wrong with the patient,

453
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:19,380
but also how to read the situation.

454
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:24,100
Look here, at this family. You can see who is the filial one.

455
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,790
Who talks, and who actively helps.

456
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:30,730
In time, you'll become a half-decent fortune teller.

457
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,160
I understand what you are saying.

458
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:40,070
As a doctor, I can really understand what it is like

459
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:42,010
caring for a patient with Alzheimer's for a long time.

460
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:45,010
It's exceptionally hard.

461
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:49,450
We can see how hard things are for you.

462
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:52,610
But no matter what happens, you can't hit him.

463
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,880
He is your father.

464
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,960
Mr Cheng, as a doctor, we're surrounded by joy and sorrow.

465
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,230
There is a saying 'once the child wants to support his parents, his parents have already left'.

466
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:07,400
So you are still very lucky.

467
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,330
You're father is still here.

468
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:13,480
Maybe he seems like a burden to you.

469
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,500
But as we see it,

470
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,300
it's a precious burden.

471
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:23,610
But taking care of the elderly takes it toll.

472
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:26,410
I can see that your mental state is not stable.

473
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:29,400
Go home and rest for two days.

474
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,510
How is that okay?

475
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:34,500
If I go, who will take care of my Dad?

476
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,220
them?

477
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:41,330
You don't have to worry about that, our hospital has a great nursing staff.

478
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:44,440
Sometimes people need to take it easy

479
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:49,280
and think hard about what is most important to them.

480
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:57,390
<i>[Nurses Station]</i>

481
00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:00,550
-Li Le, has Bed 6's report come out yet?
-Not yet.

482
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:03,920
-As soon as it comes out, I will tell Doctor Tang.
-Okay.

483
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:10,270
Head Nurse, Did you know that Cheng Guodong's family just hit Cheng Guodong?

484
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,770
They hit him? Is he hurt?

485
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:14,270
He was slapped, it is serious.

486
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,880
Then why?

487
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,380
Can I ask, where is Cheng Guodong's bed located?

488
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,600
On moment, let me check for you.

489
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,970
Can I ask you, what is your relation to Cheng Guodong?

490
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:29,590
I am his son. This is my younger sister.

491
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,660
Then Cheng Weiliang is...

492
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,720
He is our older brother.

493
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:36,950
Cheng Guodong is at Bed 10. Walk straight and you will see him.

494
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:39,220
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

495
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:47,650
Dad, Second Brother and I came to see you.

496
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:49,890
Dad, where is Eldest Brother?

497
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:51,770
He just left.

498
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,360
When you have time, take a walk outside.

499
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,710
Your face says you will try your best.

500
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:58,930
Why does my father's face look like this?

501
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:00,480
And there's an ice pack?

502
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,440
-The patient's face is swollen. A cold compress can help the area's veins to shrink.
-No, wait.

503
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,580
She didn't say pneumonia. How did his face get swollen?

504
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,720
It's like this

505
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:13,520
Second Brother, our Dad has been hit.

506
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,160
Let me see.

507
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:19,910
Head Nurse

508
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,460
Who did this?

509
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,280
-Who did this?
-Who else would it be?

510
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,500
-It is definitely these women who think that our dad has Alzheimer's and won't listen.
-It wasn't us.

511
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,680
How can you put your hands on such an old man?

512
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,280
Can you lower your voice? This is a hospital.

513
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,260
Your Dad's injury has nothing to do with us.

514
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:39,800
It has nothing to do with you? It seems to me that you did it.

515
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,060
It was Cheng Weiliang.

516
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:44,030
Don't talk nonsense. Even though my brother's temper isn't great

517
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,720
there's no way he could hit his Dad.

518
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:49,360
-Second Brother, it has to be them who did it.
-It really wasn't us!

519
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,330
It looks to me that you did it. Come on

520
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:53,290
-Let's find your supervisor.
-It wasn't us!

521
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:54,530
Let go!

522
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:56,370
-How can you hit someone?
-What's going on?

523
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:58,600
Are you okay?

524
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,910
-Help, Mister. This is a hospital.
-It was him!

525
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,580
Cheng Weiliang hit the patient.

526
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,420
They came and wrongly accused Head Nurse and I of hitting him.

527
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,790
Don't say such nonsense.

528
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,450
Leave, I will deal with this.

529
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,120
<i>[EICU]</i>

530
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:17,930
Head Nurse, what's going on?

531
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:20,660
Cheng Guodong's family did this. They pushed Head Nurse to the ground.

532
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,310
-Does it hurt?
-It's okay. It's only a small scratch.

533
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:25,630
Quickly disinfect it. Prevent an infection.

534
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:31,690
The patient's face doesn't have any major problems. Wait until the swelling goes down and it will be just fine.

535
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,630
What do you mean it doesn't have any major problems?

536
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:36,250
If a person hit your Dad, would you still consider it to be not a major problem?

537
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,230
I can 100% tell you

538
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:41,390
Tong Shan Hospital's nurses did not hit a patient.

539
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:44,630
If you guys didn't hit him, then who did?

540
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:47,300
I hit him.

541
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:51,440
Older Brother? How can you hit Dad?

542
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,720
Dad would not eat his medicine.

543
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,700
Then you still can't...He is our Dad.

544
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,600
Is that how you would take care of our Dad?

545
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,220
Then tell me, how should I take care of him?

546
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:06,880
Are you claiming to be a filial child? Would a filial child take care of their Father this way?

547
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,960
If you are going to fight, please fight outside. This is a hospital.

548
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,880
Director

549
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,140
You just admitted a cholangiocarcinoma patient, right?

550
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,930
-I will go take a look.
-Okay.

551
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,530
-Director.
-Head Nurse.

552
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,620
I heard you were injured, is it serious?

553
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:37,500
It's fine. It was only a small scratch.

554
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,180
If you need to rest

555
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,690
you can talk a half-day. I will approve your leave.

556
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:45,190
No need, Director. I'm okay.

557
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:50,060
From now on, you need to be careful. You could run into any type of situation in the ER.

558
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,850
Don't worry, I will pay attention.

559
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:01,140
Director Lu, don't you need to go check on the cholangiocarcinoma patient?

560
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,510
Cholangiocarcinoma?

561
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:05,830
-You said you would go take a look.
-That's right.

562
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:07,660
Director Lu

563
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:12,560
The cholangiocarcinoma patient is downstairs getting an examination.

564
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,160
Right. I'm getting old.

565
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:24,260
Head Nurse, why do you think Director Lu forgot to go see the patient?

566
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,790
I think it's because he was worried about your injury, so he specially came to see you.

567
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:29,090
You troublemaker, what are you trying to say?

568
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:32,930
I always feel like Director Lu pays special attention to you.

569
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:37,260
You. What do you usually call him?

570
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,850
Mother Lu.
Doesn't that make it clear?

571
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:42,730
Director Lu has always been a meticulous person.

572
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:47,460
-Him paying attention to us is normal.
-It's not the same.

573
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:52,070
Next time your say such nonsense, I will sew your mouth shut, do you believe me?

574
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:55,120
I'll get to work.

575
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:03,120
I don't talk to you two very much.

576
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:06,520
-You both think I don't take care of Father well.
-Not right.

577
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:10,350
Our family's Nuo Nuo is taking the college entrance exam soon, it is a key time period. When do you thoughtfully take care of Dad?

578
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:12,830
There are lot of things going on at my shop. Not to mention

579
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:15,220
you are the oldest son. How can you make us take care of him?

580
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:19,870
How can I? Dad is not my Dad alone. He is also your Dad!

581
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,890
I ask you both, since Dad got Alzheimer's and started living with me

582
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:27,660
other than for one meal on New Years

583
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:31,580
have you taken care of Dad? Living expenses. Medical expenses.

584
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:36,620
Have you paid any of that money? Under what criteria have you two taken care of him?

585
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:40,460
I tell you both, if I have taken such bad care of Dad, you two take him.

586
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:43,700
These past few years you have taken care of Dad by yourself. You feel wronged, don't you?

587
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:47,040
But don't forget, you're dad's favorite.

588
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,220
He never thought Wei Xiu and I were good enough. You always got the good treats and new toys.

589
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,770
We would only get your leftovers

590
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:53,330
Isn't that right?

591
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:56,990
Fine. Let's not bring it up again. Remember what happened next?

592
00:40:56,990 --> 00:41:00,200
There was finally an opening in the development department in Dad's factory

593
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,720
He didn't even consider anyone else and immediately gave you the position.

594
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,750
You had a real job. You know what Wei Xiu and I were doing?

595
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:11,430
Wei Xiu was waiting tables at a restaurant, and I was 
selling clothes at the wholesale market. 
Did he ever consider either of us?

596
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:15,600
Also, when you were getting married. We only had one house in our family

597
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,900
He didn't even talk to us and just gave it to you

598
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:20,230
We just had to leave and find a new place to stay.

599
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,030
What are you looking at?

600
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:24,160
So do you still think it's unfair that 
you were the only one taking care of dad all these years?

601
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,200
It's fair that you were the only one taking care of him.

602
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,660
Do you two have a conscience?

603
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,390
Making false claims and accusations

604
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:32,500
Did dad really want to give me that position in the factory?

605
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,840
They said that I was working in the development department

606
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,520
but I have to go down to the workshop everyday.

607
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:40,200
Wei Jie, when you selling clothes you made hundreds every day

608
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,490
Would you want to do this job?

609
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:45,890
Wei Xiu, you were working in a 5-star hotel

610
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:48,460
- You really want to spend all day with these men 
 - It's a family matter, why are you watching them?

611
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:51,730
- You don't understand 
 - Yes, dad gave me the house

612
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:53,440
But he never mistreated either of you

613
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,780
He gave all his life saving to you two

614
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:00,760
If you didn't have that money, how would you start your company?

615
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:05,300
You. How could you have gone to that training course 
and met your husband without that money?

616
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,960
- You 
- It doesn't matter what you say

617
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,090
Just take care of dad

618
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:14,250
Don't always be so prickly with us in front of our family and friends, pretending that you are some super filial son

619
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:16,780
and we're the heartless ones

620
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,900
Fine. I'll stop.

621
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:31,410
How about this? If you can take care of dad, then take him with you

622
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:33,930
If you can't take care of him, I'll do it

623
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:38,110
But neither of you has a say in how I take care of him
