00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:37,180
Doctor Xiao, if we continue with the dialysis,

17
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,870
will my child's life be saved?

18
00:01:55,610 --> 00:02:00,270
I owe a lot to this child in my life.

19
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,100
As we've come to this point,

20
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,520
let me, this incompetant father,

21
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,310
make a decision for the child.

22
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,110
She is a sensible child.

23
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,560
If you don't tell her about such a major matter,

24
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,490
and let her depart in such a muddled way,

25
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,610
she will blame me.

26
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:28,340
You are really something as a father.

27
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,560
Director,

28
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,240
Dr. Xiao is right.

29
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,760
The child has a right to know.

30
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,920
We should believe in her.

31
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:02,280
Dad, am I dying?

32
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,070
Ming Ming, we're telling you the truth

33
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,640
because we know you are sensible.

34
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,700
We don't want to hide it from you.

35
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,220
We also hope that you'll face it bravely.

36
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,200
That means I'm dying.

37
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:24,260
- Ming Ming. 
 - I'm not afraid of dying.

38
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,090
It won't hurt anymore.

39
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,240
But, I'm araid of losing Dad.

40
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,730
Ming Ming.

41
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,870
Dad, can you promise me two requests?

42
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,910
Ming Ming, just tell me.

43
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:53,100
Whatever you request, Dad will agree.

44
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,810
I want to wear a dress in white.

45
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,760
Also a pair of red leather shoes.

46
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,140
And wear white socks.

47
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,390
I'll be like a princess in the fairy tale.

48
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,530
Dad isn't good.

49
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,070
I've never bought pretty new clothes for Ming Ming.

50
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:18,630
Dad promise you.

51
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,550
I'll let you wear a pretty new dress

52
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:26,520
and become the prettiest princess in the whole world, okay?

53
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,140
Thanks, Dad.

54
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,850
I know that my illness

55
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,330
has already cost you a lot of money.

56
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,400
We shouldn't waste money anymore.

57
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,270
But, once I wear the pretty new dress,

58
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,960
I want to have a photo taken.

59
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,050
When I'm gone,

60
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,580
when you miss me, Dad,

61
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,230
you can look at the photo.

62
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,150
Dad promise you

63
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,240
on everything.

64
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,150
There's one more.

65
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:14,180
When I'm gone, Dad won't be dragged down.

66
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:19,070
You can find a new mom and have another child.

67
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,170
How did you know that I'm here?

68
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:38,120
I followed you.

69
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,370
This isn't the one that I spilled previously, is it?

70
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:47,390
Just take a sip, and you'll know what delicacy you wasted.

71
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,800
You are so vengeful.

72
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,100
Thank you.

73
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:03,440
On the matter of Yu Ming Ming, you are right.

74
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:09,800
Even though she is only a child, but she is also an independent life.

75
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,180
She has the right to know what she'll soon face and everything that will happen.

76
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:20,900
So you still think sticking to  science is the most important?

77
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,280
Of all the possible diseases in mankind,

78
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,590
the most that we understand right now

79
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:33,260
does not exceed 20% of them.

80
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,400
Within this 20%,

81
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,960
what modern medicine can cure is not even 25% of it.

82
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:44,030
In the remaning 75%, less than half

83
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:48,200
might rely on medicine science to try and fight,

84
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,740
plus a little luck, then there may be a miracle.

85
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,850
Why did you still choose to become a doctor then?

86
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,560
Because I believe in medical rationality and science.

87
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:08,880
In medical science, all emotions are meaningless.

88
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,530
A medical miracle is not created

89
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:15,610
by passion or sensibility.

90
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:20,350
It must be born of your rationality and calmness as you face the unknown.

91
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:25,610
So you pay attention to the illness itself, not the patient,

92
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,270
because when we face diseases,

93
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:37,370
we're doomed to fail most of the time. Is that right?

94
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:40,770
The ones who lose are the patient and the doctor.

95
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,720
But medical sciense definitely doesn't lose.

96
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,170
I don't have the same thoughts.

97
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,480
Dr. Bai, I know that

98
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,180
you hope the patient can receive a perfect treatment.

99
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,490
For example, in the matter of Yu Ming Ming,

100
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:58,910
you were against telling her the truth of her illness right from the start.

101
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,950
From a medical point of view, you're not wrong.

102
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:12,680
Do you know, then, why I wanted to become a doctor?

103
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,010
Why?

104
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,230
I remember when I was in middle school,

105
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,890
I saw a news report.

106
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:28,760
At that time, there was a photo of a man

107
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,380
weeping terribly as he stood on the roof of a hospital.

108
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,450
The headline of the news was,

109
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:38,620
"An emergency doctor just lost his 18-year-old patient."

110
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,830
In the face of illnesses,

111
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,930
a doctor can exhaust all efforts and means,

112
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,710
but we still can't fight off death.

113
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,700
Therefore, in that instant,

114
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,780
I wanted to become a doctor.

115
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:59,150
So you were touched because of that story?

116
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,940
Yes.

117
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,360
I've often wondered,

118
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,390
what exactly is a doctor's profession?

119
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,270
What kind of profession can let such a strong person,

120
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:16,520
after feeling powerless again and again in the face of fate,

121
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,630
and still be able to return to the operating table?

122
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,950
Later, I went abroad

123
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,970
to work for Rescue without Borders.

124
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:29,150
Once, a little girl was sent over.

125
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:34,970
Like a knife, the bullet slashed a big hole into her abdomen.

126
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,530
Her intestines were oozing out.

127
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,020
We did our best to save her.

128
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,650
We gave her blood transfusion, massive hydration infusion.

129
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:45,980
We even put in the last IV catheter we had.

130
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:50,920
We used up all of our miserably few medical resources.

131
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,020
On the day after the surgery, the little girl could say hello to us,

132
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,100
and happily talked with us.

133
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:02,320
Later, she could even eat bananas and apples.

134
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,180
But, we watched her belly swell up day after day,

135
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:11,150
while she grew thiner and thiner every day.

136
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,540
She had recurrent leaky gut,

137
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,310
but there was nothing that we could do.

138
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,530
We didn't have amino acid, and we didn't have albumin.

139
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:25,230
We couldn't even do ordinary intravenous nutrition.

140
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:33,110
Later, on the eighth day after the little girl was sent over,

141
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,970
she died.

142
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,890
I still remember,

143
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,150
she was wrapped in a red blanket when she first arrived.

144
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:53,820
A pale little face with a shy smile.

145
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:00,890
That little girl's name was Basmina.

146
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,890
Like Yu Ming Ming,

147
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,320
she was only eight years old.

148
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,490
After Basmina died, I fell seriously ill.

149
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:21,450
On the day I woke up, I sat on a hill

150
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,650
and looked over the land what was full of disasters and misery.

151
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,690
In that instant, I suddenly realized

152
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:33,450
what exactly touched me in that photo.

153
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,150
What was it?

154
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:40,150
As a doctor, what we face is not the illness but the patients.

155
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:43,210
Our mission is to stay by their side.

156
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:47,570
We should stay by them to fight diseases and overcome death. Even if we can't achieve it,

157
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:50,100
we should still stay by their side

158
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,430
to face the unchangeable fate together.

159
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,230
That's why I think

160
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,390
medical science

161
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:02,080
is ultimately about humanity.

162
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:13,960
<i>As a doctor, what we face is not the illness but the patients.</i>

163
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,960
<i>Our mission is to stay by their side.</i>

164
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,130
<i>We should stay by them to fight diseases and overcome death.</i>

165
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:23,910
<i>Even if we can't achieve it, we should stay by their side</i>

166
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:27,230
<i>to face the unchangeable fate together.</i>

167
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,830
- What's the patient's condition?  
 - The patient is 41 years old with sudden breathing difficulty.

168
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:16,780
Body temperature 37.1,  diastolic blood pressure 185,

169
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:20,170
systolic blood pressure 82, heart rate 120, respiratory rate 34.

170
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:23,320
- Blood oxygen saturation? 
 - It's 66% without oxygen.

171
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,560
- Any medical history? 
 - The ambulatory doctor said that she had a medical history.

172
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,580
It's chronic bronchitis and  emphysema.

173
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,790
She has shortness of breath when she walks.

174
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,250
Get ready for intubation.

175
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,950
Any emergency rescue treatment must ensure

176
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:43,720
the effective functioning of the circulatory and respiratory systems.

177
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,500
Regardless of the illness, the ultimate cause of death

178
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,330
is always the failure of the circulatory and respiratory systems.

179
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:52,610
Therefore, as soon as possible, we must open the airways and control blood pressure.

180
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:55,220
- Okay. Thanks, Teacher.  
 - Teacher Xiao.

181
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,130
- Teacher Xu told me to ask you to go to the emergency room. 
 - What's wrong?

182
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:02,020
There's a patient with breathing difficulty, but we can't find the cause.

183
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,390
What day is today? Where is your Dr. Bai?

184
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,110
What's the situation?

185
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:15,840
This patient was first seen an hour ago, 41 years old, respiratory failure.

186
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:20,650
When she was sent over by ambulance, she was already unconcsious. After emergency rescue, the oxygen saturation rate still can't increase.

187
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,790
Breathing isn't better either.

188
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,170
What's the medical history?

189
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:32,300
The patient has chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Her lungs already don't function well.

190
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,000
She has shortness of breath when she walks.

191
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,540
This is a new chest X-ray. Emphysema of both lungs. Increased markings in the lungs. There's nothing else out of the ordinary.

192
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,120
I've already listened. The breathing sounds are symmetrical on both sides.

193
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,800
That's what's weird. The tidal volume and oxygen inhalation concentration applied on the ventilator are already very large.

194
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,270
The airway's resistence isn't high, but the arterial oxygen pressure is still low.

195
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,620
Generally speaking, when the ventilation volume is sufficient,

196
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,020
If hypoxemia does not improve, That means

197
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,420
the pulmonary blood vessel has a problem, or there's a problem with the lung tissue itself.

198
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,730
But the patient doesn't have vascular obstruction,

199
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:10,000
and the chest X-ray also doesn't show any consolidation or compression.

200
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,950
I kept thinking about it but can't figure out why.

201
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:14,290
- Localized pneumothorax. 
 - Localized pneumothorax

202
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,450
It may be in the back.

203
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,760
Localized pneumothorax in the back.

204
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,380
That's why it's not shown in the regular chest x-ray. That explains everything. Xiao Yan, you're awesome.

205
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,390
I also said it too just now. You didn't hear?

206
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,870
You didn't say it's in the back.

207
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,270
Lunatics.

208
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,430
Help the patient arrange a chest CT scan in a while.

209
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,290
Once the diagnosis is confirmed, insert a chest tube.

210
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:39,840
Okay.

211
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,170
<i>[First Aid Room]</i>

212
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,560
He deserves to be taught a lesson.

213
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,520
Let him know that there is a higher mountain.

214
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,220
Otherwise, he would really believe that he is Hua Tuo reincarnated.  
<i>(Hua Tuo was a masterful doctor in ancient China)</i>

215
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,430
That patient with kinfe injury in Bed No. 4, how is the wound healing?

216
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,790
The healing is doing well. The stitches can be removed tomorrow.

217
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:58,550
Be careful in removing the stitches to avoid infection.

218
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,220
I will pay attention.

219
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,380
- Doctor! 
 - Doctor!

220
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,810
Doctor!

221
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,130
- Careful! 
 - What's the patient's condition?

222
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:10,180
The patient is 80 years old. He suddenly lost consciencess when talking a walk.

223
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,690
Preliminary diagnosis is brain stem infarction.

224
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:16,020
Take him to EICU immediately.

225
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,410
<i>[First Aid Room]</i>

226
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,650
What are you doing? It's the public area. Why don't you brew your own?

227
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:27,660
Don't interrupt. What do you mean? Are you setting gme up?

228
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,150
Setting what up?

229
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,930
You told me to examine the patient.

230
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:35,090
And then told Chen Zhi to get Xiao Yan. You did it deliberately, didn't you?

231
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,060
That? I was wondering what it's about.

232
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:40,870
We are all colleagues. What's the big deal to get ideas from everyone?

233
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,620
It's boring to compete one on one.

234
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,830
In a competition, there has to be a scramble.

235
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:53,590
It's it only 2 to 1 now? Do your best.

236
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,190
I'm betting on you.

237
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,900
So childish!

238
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,920
Doctor, how is it?

239
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,590
The patient has brain stem infarction caused by arteriosclerosis.

240
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:13,520
Luckily he's sent over in time, so the condition isn't worse.

241
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,020
When will he wake up then?

242
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,760
That's hard to say. It'll depend on follow-up treatment.

243
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,250
Don't worry. We've already asked specialists for consultations.

244
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,500
You must be the patient's family member?

245
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,840
I... I'm his colleague.

246
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,530
We used to teach together.

247
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:34,030
Then we probably need you to help contact the patient's family.

248
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,380
It's because the follow-up treatment requires the family to sign.

249
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:41,060
Old Zhang only has a grandson, named Zhang Da Hai.

250
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,330
I can contact him, but

251
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,650
I can't promise that he will come.

252
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,200
Does his grandson not live locally?

253
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,030
But his grandfather is so sick,

254
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:52,280
he should at least come here to take a look.

255
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,130
Besides, without the signature of the patient's family,

256
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,010
we can't progress with the follow-up treatments.

257
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,980
I've already notified him, and he said he would come.

258
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,470
He is probably delayed by something.

259
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:06,090
No matter what it is, it can't be more improtant than the old grandfather's life.

260
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:08,300
Call him again. I'll talk to him.

261
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,810
Okay.

262
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,650
Doctor, his name is Zhang Da Hai.

263
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,780
<i>Why are you calling again?</i>

264
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,640
Are you Zhang Gui Rong's family member, Zhang Da Hai?

265
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,620
<i>What are you?</i>

266
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,000
This is Tongshan Hospital's Emergency Department.

267
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,230
Zhang Gui Rong is undergoing emergency care in our Emergency ICU.

268
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:33,210
Because his subsequent condition may likely worsen,

269
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,700
we need to discuss the treatment plan with you.

270
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,830
Please come to the hospital right away.

271
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,990
<i>You want money again, right?</i>

272
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:42,340
I'll say it again. Please come to the hospital right away.

273
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,860
<i>Fine. You go ahead with the treatment. I'll come right away.</i>

274
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,820
What kind of person is he?

275
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:54,470
Sorry. He... is a little quick-tempered.

276
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:01,960
Are you two the doctors who are treating my grandfather?

277
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,910
How are you? Which patient is your family?

278
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:07,350
Did you get my approval to send the old man to the whatever ICU?

279
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,190
Did you get my approval?

280
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:11,940
I get it now. You must be Zhang Gui Rong's grandson.

281
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,420
Who are you calling as grandson? 
<i> (Grandson could be a derogatory term when used on a stranger)</i>

282
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,540
You're Zhang Gui Ron'gs grandson, aren't you?

283
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,320
Let's come inside to talk.

284
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:26,580
I am the patient's physician, if you have any questions you can ask me.

285
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:30,480
Quickly get the old man out from under the, what should I call him, CEO and give me back my money.

286
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,520
The patient's current situation is not good.

287
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,990
He needs to stay in the EICU to be observed and receive medical care.

288
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:38,350
Don't give me that. You think I don't know? Your, what should I call him, CEO's

289
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,060
fee is so high. It is clearly a scam.

290
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,190
Can you talk?

291
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:44,690
I won't talk. Let me tell you, I only came here today to ask for money, otherwise I will sue you.

292
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,950
Doctor Xiao, what's going on?

293
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,250
Everybody's here! This hospital!

294
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,130
-Don't speak so carelessly.
-Call the security officers.
-Don't touch me!

295
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:53,770
-Call the security officers. Let them all come.
-Don't speak so carelessly

296
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,760
This hospital's fees are insane.

297
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,220
Family of the patient, I am the attending physician. If there's anything you don't understand, you can ask me.

298
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,060
I have a question. Can you give me my money back? Otherwise I won't leave.

299
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:06,750
The patient currently has a brain stem infarction. He could be in fatal danger at any moment.

300
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,630
We can't let him leave the hospital right now.

301
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,600
Give me back my money, and all will be fine. Then he can stay in the hospital.

302
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,200
Why are you so unreasonable?

303
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,520
-How am I not reasonable?
-If you keep going I'll call the police!

304
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,290
Call them! I'm not scared!

305
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:18,460
-Don't fight. Are you the patient's family?
-Yes.

306
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,150
No problem, if you have a problem you can speak with me.

307
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,680
Xiao Yan, please get to work. I will deal with this.

308
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:26,360
You can't leave. We haven't finished talking. You haven't given my money back. No one can leave, that doesn't work.

309
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,570
-And you are?
-I am the emergency department's director.

310
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,170
-Okay. Do you keep your word?
-Of course.

311
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,460
The reason I came was to get my money back. These two

312
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,340
-haven't said anything.
-Does it look good?

313
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:37,470
This drama is torturous, but this person's performance

314
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,980
is a bit pompous.

315
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:42,670
Don't take pleasure in this, think of a solution.

316
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:45,140
-Hello.
-Don't touch me! I have heart disease!

317
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,900
If you touch me I will lay down right here. Do you believe me? You will have to take care of me for the rest of your lives.

318
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,330
You shouldn't act so shamelessly here.

319
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:52,710
Who is acting shamelessly? Your hospital is acting shamelessly. Cheating people of their money and chasing people out.

320
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:55,400
Dont fight. Let's choose somewhere else to talk.

321
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,970
-Excuse me.
-We can have a good chat.

322
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:59,830
-You can speak reasonably anywhere.
-Yes.
 -So we can talk clearly right here.

323
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:02,570
-Am I right, Director?
-Come speak with me.

324
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:03,830
Who are you?

325
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,570
I am a doctor. Can you not see that?

326
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,300
Bai Shu, I will deal with this.

327
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:10,760
Let me. Family of the patient

328
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,250
This is Zhang Guirong's bill after being admitted to the EICU. Take a look.

329
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,160
I won't look. Give me back my money and all will be fine. Do you understand?

330
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,610
I suggest you take a look.

331
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:25,830
<i>[Tong Shan Hospital Billing Chart]</i>

332
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,450
<i>[Balance]</i>

333
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:31,440
19,000¥? Give it back. I want cash.

334
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,550
Did you see it clearly?

335
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,860
The front part has a minus sign.

336
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,330
-What does that mean?
-It means that is what you still owe.

337
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:42,970
The money that Zhang Guirong paid before has already been spent.

338
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:45,810
Right now he owes the hospital 19,000¥. Since you are his family member

339
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,880
you need to give us that sum.

340
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,610
You want me to pay you?

341
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:52,750
-Paying money to see the doctor is perfectly reasonable.
-Right!

342
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,930
Lin Zhi, bring this family member to go pay the fee.

343
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,400
Family of the patient, come with me.

344
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:02,740
By the way, if you didn't bring any cash, we can take credit card.

345
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:08,060
I won't pay. Why do I have to pay? You said 19,000¥, that's 19,000¥. What else should I pay?

346
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:12,760
You are Zhang Guirong's only family member. If you don't pay, who will?

347
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:21,510
-I'll pay. Where do I pay?
-This way, please.

348
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,950
Don't touch me! Let me go!
-Make way for us.

349
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:25,100
Make way.

350
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,900
Why is he running? Why aren't we chasing him?

351
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:33,360
Doctor Xiao, shouldn't you thank me?

352
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,840
Thank you, Doctor Bai.

353
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:45,240
Old Zhang, have you woken up?

354
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:48,550
Can you hear me?

355
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,520
I can hear you.

356
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,970
What's your name?

357
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:55,220
Zhang Guirong.

358
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,800
Where are we?

359
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,340
The hospital.

360
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:05,870
I am your attending physician. This is my coworker, Tang Hua.

361
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:11,010
I'm sorry to trouble you.

362
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:19,260
Xiao Lian, look, I bothered you again.

363
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,820
As long as you are alright, it's okay.

364
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,330
And Da Hai?

365
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:32,640
Since you have woken up, we should discuss your treatment plan for after this.

366
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,690
Okay.

367
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:43,920
-Zhang Guirong's physical condition is not stable. You should give him watch him carefully.
-Okay.

368
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,150
It's too bad about Zhang Guirong. How can he be stuck with a grandson like that?

369
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,760
How can you say that?

370
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,900
He originally is Zhang Guirong's grandson.

371
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,020
Zhang Guirong was a teacher before.

372
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,050
Right now he is still so honorable.

373
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:57,130
How can he have Zhang Da Hai as a grandson?

374
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:01,290
Right. He didn't even come in to see his grandfather.

375
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:04,840
This kind of grandson is not filial enough.

376
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:11,800
Doctor Xiao will definitely critique me for talking about the patient's family like this.

377
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,190
It's good that you recognize that.

378
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:15,080
Anyway if I have this kind of grandson

379
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,520
I definitely will pack him up and send him to Mars.

380
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:26,990
No swelling.

381
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,630
Xiao Lian

382
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:34,730
How much money do I have left?

383
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:39,340
The doctor said you just woke up, so I shouldn't let you talk.

384
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,690
I'm fine.

385
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:46,480
Do I have 50,000¥?

386
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,230
Xiao Lian?

387
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,550
You can't give Da Hai any more money.

388
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:59,420
If you give it to him, that will just hurt him.

389
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:03,040
He came to the hospital to start a scene.

390
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:08,100
He definitely must have run into a hard situation.

391
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,150
How can he run into a hard situation?

392
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:13,250
It could be that he gambled his money and lost.

393
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,780
That stupid boy.

394
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,640
Too stupid.

395
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:27,510
But no matter what, he is my grandson.

396
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:33,160
He doesn't have any other family by his side.

397
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:38,730
You are telling me not to take care of him, then who will?

398
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:45,140
But now I'm like this.

399
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,590
I'm afraid I won't be able to take care of him for long.

400
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:55,400
Xiao Lian, please carry on my will.

401
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:00,150
This hospital visit cost over 30,000¥.

402
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:03,710
Your remaining balance is about 40,000¥.

403
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:07,000
Then how about this

404
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:12,180
Leave 20,000¥ for Da Hai.

405
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:18,280
The remaining 20,000¥ will go to you.

406
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,590
What are you doing?

407
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:24,060
You have been with me for so many years.

408
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:30,120
You haven't had even one good day. You have been suffering and inconvenienced.

409
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,010
Old Zhang, I don't regret it.

410
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:37,530
I don't need this money. You still need to be cured.

411
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:40,010
How will I be cured?

412
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:47,150
I know my own body and bones. It's not good.

413
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:54,470
This time, pay the medical fees and I don't want to get treatment.

414
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:56,590
You need to get treated.

415
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:59,660
If you leave, what will I do?

416
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:06,450
Xiao Lian, I want to be with you for several more years

417
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:12,220
but that won't happen.

418
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:16,330
I let you down.

419
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:21,190
You have been so good to me. I remember

420
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:23,920
next life

421
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:27,670
I definitely will pay you back.

422
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:30,890
Old Zhang, don't.

423
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:43,790
Okay. Call Da Hai over.

424
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,480
It's decided.

425
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:52,890
Otherwise if I go there

426
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:56,770
there's no way for me to replace his parents.

427
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:00,230
Head Nurse, look.

428
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:06,050
Good dogs don't stand in the way. Do you have a problem?

429
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:07,210
What problem do you have?

430
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:08,820
I came to see my grandpa, what can I do for you?

431
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,540
Don't cause a scene. This is a hospital.

432
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:13,030
You really think I'm stupid, don't you?

433
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,510
What the hell.

434
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,920
Will he cause an issue?

435
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,800
He is here for a regular family visit. We can't stop him.

436
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,090
Let's go finish the work in our hands. We can check on him later.

437
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,680
Da Hai came.

438
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:51,560
Grandson. I can see the color of your face

439
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,870
is not good.

440
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:57,200
Don't bring it up. If you bring it up I will get angry.

441
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,810
Last night was Barcelona against Real Madrid.

442
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:01,940
The bookmaker gave half a ball to Barcelona.

443
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:05,120
Barcelona put Messi on the bench.

444
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,450
What's worse is that it was a draw.

445
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:11,940
It was so disappointing. They lost 0 to 3. It sunk all of my money.

446
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,870
I was so angry I couldn't sleep.

447
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:16,060
My neck has fallen asleep.

448
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:21,370
Da Hai. Listen to Grandpa for a moment.

449
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:24,480
Don't gamble.

450
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,990
As the saying goes

451
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:31,630
Out of every ten that gamble, nine lose.

452
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:38,260
Then one is stuck in a bottomless hole of discontentment.

453
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,880
Old Man, don't curse me.

454
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,560
I can't turn back time. I don't have the money to buy you a cinerary casket.

455
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:50,060
Da Hai, don't speak to me that way. Okay?

456
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:53,130
Da Hai, your Grandpa wants  what's best for you.

457
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:55,860
I'm talking to my Grandpa, why is an outsider like you butting in?

458
00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:00,500
Leave it alone. You are sick and fragile and you are still worrying about me?

459
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,560
Give me money quickly.

460
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:06,950
Okay. I'll give it to you.

461
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,880
I'll give it to you.

462
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:17,290
Give it to him.

463
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:21,470
Faster. My Grandpa is talking.

464
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,620
Give it to him.

465
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:39,370
Da Hai, there's still over  ¥20,000 on this card.

466
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:40,730
Go ahead and take it.

467
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:44,150
What? It only has  ¥20,000 left? Where's the money?

468
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:47,870
I... I need money to spend on my illness.

469
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:49,680
That's all there is.

470
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,140
The money from selling the house... Why is there so little left?

471
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:55,240
DIdn't I repay your gambling debt already?

472
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:00,780
It's not enough. I... I can't repay all my debt. How can I win it back?

473
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,830
Family member, lower your voice. There are other patients in the hospital.

474
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,760
I know. You... get out.

475
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,330
Give me  ¥20,000 more.

476
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:11,720
There's no more. I really don't have any left.

477
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:16,400
Old Man, you want to see me beaten dead by the loan sharks?

478
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,160
If I'm beaten to death, you'll be happy?

479
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:21,410
When that happens, we can both go to hell to see my parents.

480
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:23,950
Our Zhang's family can reunite in the netherworld.

481
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:26,430
You'll be happy, right?

482
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:28,680
What are you doing?

483
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:32,740
Da Hai, don't push your grandfather anymore.

484
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:37,300
Your grandfather only has this little bit of money left.

485
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:44,120
No more?

486
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,920
Give that to me. Give me!

487
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:50,560
You just wait to collect my corpse. Old man, just you wait.

488
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:53,350
Da Hai...

489
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:55,630
Don't get agitated.

490
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:05,370
I know you are blaming me for not giving the money to Da Hai.

491
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:08,000
That  ¥20,000

492
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,940
is your money.

493
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:16,760
You can give it to whomever you want to give.

494
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,290
It's up to you.

495
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,230
Right now,

496
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:30,190
I'm afraid that Da Hai will get into trouble.

497
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:32,910
I'm an outsider.

498
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:35,780
Don't say that.

499
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,250
Let me finish talking.

500
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:42,880
Da Hai has never agreed to our relationship.

501
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,460
I know it's difficult for you, so I've never rushed you.

502
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:50,330
But you can't keep indulging Da Hai.

503
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:54,320
He doesn't just gamble in poker and mahjong, he is gambling in soccer now.

504
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:59,110
If you continue to let him do as he wish, he'll really ruin himself.

505
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:02,070
What do I do then?

506
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:05,150
I only have this one grandson.

507
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:11,240
I can't watch the debt collectors force him into death.

508
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:15,090
In our society now, there is the court of law and the police.

509
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:19,070
If anyone owes money, just repay the debt. They won't kill you.

510
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,940
I don't care if you scold me or blame me, I won't give money to Da Hai anymore.

511
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:27,640
Giving him money is doing him harm.

512
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,530
Blame me.

513
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:41,270
It's all my fault.

514
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:46,010
Hello. I want to pay the fee for EICU.

515
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:47,330
What is the patient's name?

516
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,110
Zhang Gui Rong.

517
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:52,900
Zhang is the word with a long bow, Gui as in fortune, and Rong as in glory.

518
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,630
The balance is 8,000.

519
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,970
I'll add 20,000.

520
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,430
This is...

521
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:05,930
Da Hai, give me the money!

522
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:07,380
He gave you all the money, right?

523
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:10,150
- You... 
 - What are you doing?

524
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:12,920
That man robbed her  ¥20,000.

525
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,020
Hurry and call the police!

526
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,520
No...

527
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,780
Don't call the police. Don't call the police.

528
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:21,620
Ma'am, are you okay?

529
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:27,330
Drink some water.

530
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:29,060
Thank you.

531
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:34,240
Ma'am, are you really not reporting to the police?

532
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:37,560
Zhang Gui Rong looks sensible to me.

533
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,970
Why is Zhang Da Hai so shameless?

534
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:42,040
It's fate.

535
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:47,940
When Old Zhang was young, he really wanted to be a soldier.

536
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:52,440
But unexpectedly, he couldn't become one.

537
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,220
So he forced his son to become a soldier.

538
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,700
That's Da Hai's father.

539
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:03,720
He died during flood relief duty.

540
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,060
Even his body wasn't found.

541
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:09,590
Da Hai's mother fell seriously ill.

542
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:12,970
She passed away too.

543
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:16,680
At that time, Da Hai was only two years old.

544
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:21,030
He lost his mom and dad at such a young age.

545
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,210
Zhang Da Hai's background is really quite pitiful.

546
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:31,010
Old Zhang has always felt that he owed him.

547
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:34,210
He felt he was at fault for harming his parents.

548
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:37,800
So he always gave in to him.

549
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:42,910
You can see, it's truly the more indulgence, the less successful.

550
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:50,460
<i>[Tongshan Hospital]</i>

551
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:54,090
As I see it, you aren't in a hurry to return to Cardiac Surgery Department.

552
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:55,820
Which eye of yours has seen it?

553
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:58,530
Both eyes can see it.

554
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:07,510
Are you addicted in competing with someone, or you have other plans?

555
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:13,500
Listen to my advice. Get your eyes checked in the Ophthalmology Department nearby.

556
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:19,440
Don't I know you? You are addicted to competing with Xiao Yan now.

557
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,680
Once you've thoroughly defeated her, the spectators around you will applaud,

558
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,120
and you'll hold up your head to return to Cardiac Surgery.

559
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,090
I'm going back to work.

560
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:40,730
Da Hai... why haven't you come?

561
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:44,980
He caught a cold. I didn't let him come in case he is contagious.

562
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:48,490
Xiao Lian.

563
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,690
That matter...

564
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:57,660
That matter... You...

565
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,440
Help...

566
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:02,990
Help me.

567
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:06,330
Here. Drink some water.

568
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:09,080
Open your mouth.

569
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,890
How can I help you?

570
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:20,800
I beg you.

571
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,300
Help me.

572
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,080
Drink some water first.

573
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,580
I'm not drinking.

574
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:32,190
I'm not drinking.

575
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:34,980
What are you doing?

576
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:38,590
I'm begging you.

577
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:57,360
Okay. I'll help you.

578
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:10,160
Thanks.

579
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:18,260
Bed No. 17's care level has been lowered to Level 1.

580
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,310
- Okay, Head Nurse. 
 - His condition is pretty good. He'll probably...

581
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:22,020
Head Nurse.

582
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,820
Zhang Gui Rong's health is worsening too fast.

583
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:29,640
When I was taking his temperature just now, he tried to thank me, but his mouth opened for a long time without saying a word.

584
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:34,560
After all his is pretty old. The body's organs have declined.

585
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,280
I estimate it'll happen in a couple of days.

586
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,460
That Zhang Da Hai hasn't come for many days.

587
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:44,730
Someone like him should get bad karma.

588
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:49,310
His blood sugar level has been unstable since morning.

589
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:53,570
I injected him with insulin to lower the blood sugar. It lowered to 14 but has risen again.

590
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:55,770
It's 27.5 now.

591
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:59,860
Since this afternoon, his blood pressure, heart rate, have continually decrease.

592
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,050
The blood pressure is too low, he needs to be rehydrated.

593
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:05,410
Dopamine combined with norepinephrine booster.

594
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:06,950
Okay.

595
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:09,120
It doesn't look like myocardial infarction.

596
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:12,330
The pupils have the same size and roundness, and not fixed.

597
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:14,840
Brain herniation and brain edema can be elimminated.

598
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,330
The oxygen saturation is decreased.

599
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:21,120
It could be pulmonary embolism. Do a rush check on the D-dimer, and pulmonary artery CT.

600
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,470
Okay.

601
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:26,890
Head Nurse, you should notify the patient's family.

602
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:28,450
Okay.

603
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,150
Xiao Li, find Zhang Gui Rong's medication record.

604
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:37,600
Okay.

605
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:49,290
How about... not torment him anymore.

606
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:51,550
Let him leave peacefully.

607
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:55,430
Let's do this. We'll do drug thrombolysis for the patient first.

608
00:42:55,430 --> 00:43:00,100
Anything after that, you can discuss with Zhang Dai Hai when he gets here.
