(Adapted from the novel "ICU 48 Hours" by Sheng Li)

3
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,040
(Episode 10)

4
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,599
She's not awake yet.

5
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:52,680
Lu Lu, you're awake.

6
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,959
Look, I made you some porridge.

7
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,120
Mom.

8
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:58,599
Leave it there.

9
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,079
I'll eat it later.

10
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:02,239
Get up. Eat it while it's hot.

11
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,519
Mom.

12
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,159
Okay, eat it later.

13
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,679
Eat it later.

14
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,719
Dad.

15
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,199
Don't glare at Mom.

16
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,840
I saw it.

17
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,560
Your dad is just worried about you.

18
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:21,000
- Yes. - See?

19
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:22,840
I only scolded you...

20
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:24,759
and Mom feels bad for you.

21
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,840
- I won't feel sorry for him. - Next time,

22
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,120
don't glare at her.

23
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:29,960
All right.

24
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,919
I won't glare at her, okay?

25
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,599
Dad.

26
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:38,280
Please step out for a while.

27
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,280
I want...

28
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:43,639
to talk to Mom.

29
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:47,520
All right. Go ahead.

30
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,999
Go on.

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,080
Go on.

32
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:56,960
Be careful with the needle.

33
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:03,759
Mom.

34
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,280
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,199
I didn't know any better.

36
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,919
I made you and Dad...

37
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,840
worry.

38
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,439
It's my fault.

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,520
I shouldn't have urged you to get married.

40
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,280
It's your own business.

41
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,120
I won't bother anymore.

42
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,039
I know.

43
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,599
You did it for my own good.

44
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,439
You're worried...

45
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,719
I won't get married...

46
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,159
and become old and helpless.

47
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:50,960
Hey.

48
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:52,520
I know.

49
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,759
It's stressful in the big city.

50
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:58,159
You've put all your energy into work,

51
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,560
so marriage is put off.

52
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,879
Put other places aside.

53
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,960
Take our city for example.

54
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,840
Those 30 years old and unmarried...

55
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,639
are doing just fine.

56
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,120
I know all that.

57
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:10,879
But...

58
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,439
I just can't get it through me.

59
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,360
When I get anxious,

60
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:18,000
I rush you.

61
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:25,480
Mom.

62
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,879
Do you know...

63
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:31,639
what I was thinking the moment I was hit by the car?

64
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,439
I was thinking...

65
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,050
I haven't gotten married or worn a wedding dress yet.

66
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:41,199
If I die,

67
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,560
it'll be such a pity.

68
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,639
Actually,

69
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,360
It's not that I don't want to get married.

70
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:52,680
I just haven't met the right person yet.

71
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,920
I don't want to settle.

72
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,439
Besides,

73
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,959
when you rush me,

74
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:05,680
I tend to get rebellious.

75
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:09,279
Even if the guys you introduced aren't that bad,

76
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,319
I would say they were ugly...

77
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,839
and unsuitable.

78
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,279
Silly girl.

79
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:18,519
It's my fault too.

80
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,360
I got anxious and introduced you to all kinds of men.

81
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,959
Some of them were indeed not suitable.

82
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,519
But honestly,

83
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,759
you're really quite picky.

84
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:35,519
Your colleagues...

85
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,319
and old friends...

86
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,639
won't introduce guys to you now, will they?

87
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,000
Look who's talking.

88
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,560
Everyone knows you're picky.

89
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,800
They run away whenever they see me.

90
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,639
I take after you in that aspect.

91
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,480
Grandma told me...

92
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,639
you were the same back then.

93
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:51,759
You were so picky...

94
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,800
that you hadn't found anyone even when you were 28.

95
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:55,879
Grandma was so angry.

96
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,319
Your grandma is more wicked than me.

97
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,360
I just graduated from school and was only 18 years old.

98
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,199
But she forced me to find a boyfriend.

99
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,839
You waited for ten years...

100
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,759
before you met Dad.

101
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:09,839
It was worth it.

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,600
It's all thanks to your grandma for rushing me.

103
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,199
Else, I wouldn't have chosen your dad.

104
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:15,160
You don't mean what you say.

105
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,000
If one day,

106
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,079
Dad is gone, you...

107
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,879
It's bad luck. Knock on wood.

108
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,360
Knock on wood.

109
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,720
I just think this.

110
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,639
Both of you...

111
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,160
seem to be at odds.

112
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,199
And you're always nagging.

113
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,240
- I'm a nagger? - This kind of relationship...

114
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,720
is a match made in heaven.

115
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:39,120
This is what I want.

116
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:40,759
This type...

117
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:42,480
of noisy...

118
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,680
and mundane marriage.

119
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,600
Mom.

120
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:48,759
I promise you.

121
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,600
I will get married.

122
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,399
But...

123
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,680
I can't guarantee when it will be.

124
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,279
I might get married tomorrow...

125
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,240
if I've found the right one.

126
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,959
But maybe,

127
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,000
I'll never meet him.

128
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,720
Then all I can do is wait.

129
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,360
Okay.

130
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,959
I promise I won't rush you.

131
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,480
I believe...

132
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,160
that you can handle your own business.

133
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,360
Thank you.

134
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,639
Mom.

135
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:49,879
Hello.

136
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,319
Hello.

137
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,639
I'm Pan Dong.

138
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,839
We were both sent here together.

139
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,240
You saved me.

140
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:02,360
Have a seat.

141
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,399
"Walden".

142
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,720
You like this book too?

143
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,000
Yes.

144
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:18,639
It's my favorite book.

145
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,720
Mine too.

146
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:23,519
"Time..."

147
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,240
"decides who you meet in life."

148
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
"Heart..."

149
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,879
"decides who you want in your life."

150
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,560
"But your behavior..."

151
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,519
"decides who will stay in your life."

152
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,879
Dr. Bai.

153
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:00,559
How did you get hurt?

154
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:02,559
I tripped and fell. My hands were on the ground.

155
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:04,450
Do you have any other injuries...

156
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:05,919
or feel any pain?

157
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,720
No.

158
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,360
How many times have I told you?

159
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,519
You're already so old. Why are you fooling around?

160
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,399
Running up and down so early in the morning,

161
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,840
busy serving the outsiders.

162
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,799
Did you really have to be in such a hurry?

163
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:19,600
The patient's condition is probably caused by external force.

164
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,639
Perhaps there's a fracture.

165
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,759
I don't think it's serious.

166
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,720
There's no obvious fracture.

167
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,090
I think...

168
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,240
you might have pulled a ligament or muscle.

169
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,600
Medication will relieve it.

170
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,480
Come back to me if there are any problems.

171
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,480
Doctor.

172
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,240
Are you sure she's okay?

173
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,879
She's in so much pain.

174
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,210
She's really fine.

175
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:10,279
Go home and get some rest.

176
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,480
Don't overwork yourself.

177
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,399
- Thank you, doctor. - You're welcome.

178
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,960
Mom, go home and get some rest.

179
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,000
Don't keep thinking about serving others.

180
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,039
And don't cook for these few days.

181
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,210
I'll order takeout for you.

182
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,799
That's no good.

183
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,000
I should at least cook for you.

184
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,679
Don't worry about me.

185
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,090
I'm so busy that I won't have time to come home for dinner.

186
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,519
And you paid for your suffering at the hospital.

187
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:35,799
Are you happy now?

188
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:41,639
It's a neurological headache.

189
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:44,090
I can only prescribe some painkillers.

190
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,919
I suggest you to get a full checkup...

191
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,330
from neurology.

192
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,240
Why is it so troublesome?

193
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:53,159
It's for your own good.

194
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,440
All right.

195
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:59,120
I think you just want to earn more money from me.

196
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:02,960
Doctor.

197
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,679
How did you diagnose my mom?

198
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,120
What's wrong?

199
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:09,120
Hang in there. The doctor will be here soon.

200
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:12,159
What happened?

201
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,159
My wrist still hurts a lot.

202
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,360
What's going on?

203
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,840
You said she'll be fine after the IV drip.

204
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:19,759
She should be feeling fine now.

205
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,320
Then why is she in so much pain?

206
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,159
This might be...

207
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,600
a normal reaction after the IV.

208
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:26,879
Say that again. This is a normal reaction?

209
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,519
Is that fluid or poison?

210
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,639
If anything happens to my mom, I'll deal with you.

211
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:31,840
Sir.

212
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,320
There's a procedure to all treatment.

213
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,918
How can I calm down when she's in pain like this?

214
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:37,038
What kind of hospital is this?

215
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:38,039
- What's wrong? - Dr. Xiao.

216
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,120
Can't you see how much pain she is in?

217
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:41,279
Dr. Xiao.

218
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:44,879
This patient pulled a muscle in her arm...

219
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,320
due to external force.

220
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:47,639
I gave her an IV.

221
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:48,840
Here's the X-ray.

222
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:56,240
I think there's a fracture here.

223
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,399
You said she pulled a muscle.

224
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,799
Why is it a fracture now?

225
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,120
It's because of her age.

226
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,399
She has osteoporosis.

227
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:05,399
Some hairline fractures are not easy to detect.

228
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,200
Don't worry.

229
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,080
I'll arrange for an orthopedic surgeon...

230
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,039
and help you secure your arm with a cast.

231
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,159
Don't worry? He told me it's nothing.

232
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,440
How can I not worry?

233
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,599
What's wrong?

234
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,879
You look half-dead.

235
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,200
It's nothing.

236
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,440
Are you afraid I'll laugh at you?

237
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,679
You found out?

238
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,080
Lin Zhi told me this morning.

239
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,679
You misdiagnosed a patient...

240
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:55,320
and took a hairline fracture for a muscle strain.

241
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:56,960
It was my mistake.

242
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,559
Who doesn't make mistakes?

243
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:01,120
Which doctor can guarantee...

244
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,679
they will never ever make a mistake?

245
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:06,000
Thank you, Tang Hua.

246
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,840
Actually, I have high hopes for you.

247
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,639
You're logical and hardworking.

248
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:20,200
You're also willing to put your patients first.

249
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,559
After a few more years in the EICU,

250
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,039
I'm sure you'll become a great doctor.

251
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,519
- Really? - Of course.

252
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,600
However,

253
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:33,399
you're too soft-hearted.

254
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,559
When you're in trouble, you always doubt yourself.

255
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,159
I don't want to either.

256
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,000
You're a doctor of medicine.

257
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,799
You have a doctorate degree.

258
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:45,000
There's nothing you can't do.

259
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,320
But I...

260
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,000
Can't you be tougher?

261
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,080
Have some backbone.

262
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,879
Get back up from where you fell.

263
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:52,919
If you do your job well,

264
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,399
no one will look down on you.

265
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,679
I'm afraid I...

266
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:58,519
Enough. Don't be like that.

267
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,039
Anyway, I've made up my mind.

268
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,360
From now on,

269
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,240
I'll help you regain your confidence...

270
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:04,600
and find yourself again.

271
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:11,960
Look at this ultrasound and chest X-ray.

272
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,519
Find any problems?

273
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,519
Thickening of the gallbladder wall.

274
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,919
Double-layered changes in the gallbladder wall.

275
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,639
Poor gallbladder translucency.

276
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,159
Uneven echo.

277
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:25,120
It's most likely cholecystitis.

278
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,359
What about the chest X-ray?

279
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,840
Thickening of the hilar shadow in both lungs.

280
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,039
Marked exudation.

281
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,440
It could be pulmonary edema.

282
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,519
Cholecystitis and pulmonary edema.

283
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,120
Are you sure?

284
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,240
I think so.

285
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,679
You must have confidence.

286
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,080
(Cholecystitis)

287
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:46,600
See, I said you could do it.

288
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,559
Confidence is what you lack the most right now.

289
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:53,039
Sometimes, for example,

290
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:54,759
mucoprotein...

291
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,360
- and bile... - You two.

292
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:57,639
You're so close to each other.

293
00:14:57,879 --> 00:14:59,080
Be careful of cross-contamination.

294
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,200
Dr. Xu, we're just analyzing cases.

295
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,759
Don't mind him.

296
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,080
Just do your thing.

297
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:09,679
Before you rule out diseases, check this first.

298
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,840
Tang Hua.

299
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:12,159
You're so protective of Chen Zhi.

300
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,360
Do you like him?

301
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,120
Dr. Xu, we're really just watching videos.

302
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,399
Dirty people see everything dirty.

303
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:19,840
Young people in love is not dirty at all.

304
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,480
On the contrary,

305
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:23,320
it's the most beautiful thing In this world.

306
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,159
Continue being beautiful.

307
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,279
Boring.

308
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:32,360
Enter the gallbladder invertedly through the bile duct...

309
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,039
or via blood circulation...

310
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,559
or via the lymphatic route into...

311
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,960
Why are you looking at me? Look here.

312
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:46,360
Acute cholecystitis attacks...

313
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:48,440
take a more typical course.

314
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,279
The onset usually occurs at night...

315
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:53,279
after a full meal...

316
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,480
or after eating greasy food.

317
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,320
Xiao Gang.

318
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,679
- There you are. - What are you doing here?

319
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,679
I went home but no one answered the door.

320
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:17,000
The neighbors said your mom fell and was sent to Tongshan Hospital.

321
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,399
Is that your home?

322
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,159
You must be having a good life.

323
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:23,679
Celebrating your birthday?

324
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:45,879
Dr. Xu.

325
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,159
What's wrong?

326
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,720
I...

327
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,759
What are you mumbling for? Tell me.

328
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:52,039
I...

329
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:54,679
Why are you hesitating?

330
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:55,799
Go on.

331
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,159
I want to ask you something about Tang Hua and me.

332
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,639
I was just kidding.

333
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:04,960
I'm sure Tang Hua knows I was joking.

334
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,599
It won't affect your relationship with her as colleagues.

335
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,279
- No, Dr. Xu... - Don't worry.

336
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,680
You'll still be good colleagues.

337
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,680
No, Dr. Xu. You don't get it.

338
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:13,319
I have a patient to tend to. I'll get going.

339
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,240
Dr. Xu.

340
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,359
It's going to hurt a little today.

341
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,890
I'll prescribe some painkillers.

342
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,799
Stay overnight for observation.

343
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,440
You can go home tomorrow when you feel better.

344
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,960
Come back for a follow-up in two weeks.

345
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,720
- Thank you, doctor. - Thank you.

346
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,799
So? Does it still hurt?

347
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:36,759
- A little. - Okay.

348
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,200
Come. It's all my fault.

349
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,559
I'm so clumsy.

350
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:41,920
I went to take the cake...

351
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,119
but left the receipt at home...

352
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:45,920
and made you bring it to me.

353
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,279
Jian Ming.

354
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,920
Let's not talk about this.

355
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,170
You did it for Xiao Gang's birthday.

356
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,680
Has he contacted you?

357
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,960
I called him a few times but he didn't pick up.

358
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,170
Maybe...

359
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:01,559
he's paying the hospital bill.

360
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,000
Don't worry, Su Lian.

361
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:05,359
Xiao Gang is a sensible kid.

362
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:06,680
He'll understand us.

363
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,200
Have a good rest.

364
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:11,559
Call our nurse if you need anything.

365
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,799
- Okay, thank you. - Thank you.

366
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,839
Dr. Xiao, how's my mom?

367
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,920
Don't worry. The cast is on.

368
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,650
Thank you, Dr. Xiao.

369
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:25,890
If I may add,

370
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,119
if I'm not mistaken,

371
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:28,599
it must be your birthday today.

372
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,960
You might always be busy...

373
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,680
and don't even remember your own birthday.

374
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,599
But to your parents,

375
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:36,759
it's a big deal.

376
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,890
If I'm right,

377
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:41,759
the cake in the old man's hand is for you.

378
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:46,170
Let me wish you a happy birthday.

379
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:49,000
- Call us if you need anything. - Okay.

380
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:52,170
What's wrong?

381
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:53,890
It'll be tough for you these few days.

382
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,680
Don't say that.

383
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,440
Look, there are many things I won't be able to do.

384
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,480
- I can't cook for you anymore. - Come.

385
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,599
I'll give you a massage.

386
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Okay.

387
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,200
You're good.

388
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,359
You're here.

389
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:32,039
Well, I...

390
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:33,440
I was looking for you.

391
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:37,890
The doctor...

392
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,319
put a cast on your mom.

393
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:40,720
She'll be fine.

394
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:43,960
I know.

395
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,480
Let's go somewhere and talk.

396
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:51,440
Sure.

397
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:05,889
This...

398
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:07,200
I know I've misunderstood.

399
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,170
During this period of time when you're with my mom,

400
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,519
I've been turning a blind eye...

401
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:15,000
because I feel conflicted.

402
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,240
I'm usually busy with work, so I don't have time for her.

403
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:20,480
I can tell that she's happier...

404
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:21,759
with you around.

405
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:23,720
But as her son,

406
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:27,359
I can't accept an addition to the family.

407
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:32,000
Yes. I understand.

408
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:34,440
I also just realized that this cake...

409
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:36,599
is not for your birthday.

410
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,039
It's for me.

411
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,200
But...

412
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,319
Your mom and I went to high school together.

413
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:56,720
I'm sure she told you about that.

414
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:58,799
But...

415
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,599
as for our relationship,

416
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:03,759
you probably don't know.

417
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:05,839
I come from Heze.

418
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,650
In the first year of high school,

419
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,599
your mom moved to Heze...

420
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:12,920
due to a family problem.

421
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,960
She transferred to our class.

422
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:17,920
The first time I saw your mom,

423
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,170
I was captivated.

424
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:23,410
I've never seen...

425
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:25,359
someone so beautiful...

426
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:27,839
and elegant.

427
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:30,920
That year,

428
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:33,359
she was 16.

429
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:37,480
Young and beautiful.

430
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,519
Proud.

431
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,759
Just like a princess.

432
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:46,839
You might think...

433
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:48,720
your mom is a nagger...

434
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:50,319
who only knows how to work.

435
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:53,640
An quite annoying old woman.

436
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:56,440
But you have no idea...

437
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,079
that she had no choice.

438
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,480
Your dad passed away early.

439
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:04,680
To not make you upset,

440
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,799
she never remarried.

441
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,799
She had to work...

442
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,720
and take care of you.

443
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:14,559
That's why she became...

444
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,319
what she is now.

445
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:21,559
But in my eyes,

446
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:25,839
she will always...

447
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,079
be the way she was when we first met.

448
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:44,920
Back then at school,

449
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:47,279
I was considered a top student.

450
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,160
The teacher purposely made us...

451
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:52,440
sit next to each other.

452
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:53,680
He said...

453
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:56,039
it's to learn and improve together.

454
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,359
But the two of us...

455
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,640
have tough personalities.

456
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,960
We wouldn't give in to each other.

457
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,839
When I said...

458
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:07,680
this was how a problem was solved,

459
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,960
your mom would insist on solving it another way.

460
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,960
Anyway, it was chaotic...

461
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:17,240
when we fought.

462
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:21,880
But for some reason,

463
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,720
slowly,

464
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,920
we fell...

465
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:28,119
for each other.

466
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:30,880
And we made a promise...

467
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:33,240
to attend the same university.

468
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:44,359
During the winter break of our third year of high school,

469
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,680
your mom accidentally fell into the water.

470
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,359
I saved her.

471
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,920
But it was so cold that I got pneumonia.

472
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,720
I was hospitalized...

473
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:00,519
for a long time.

474
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:03,559
I didn't make it in time for the college entrance exam.

475
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:07,000
When I was discharged,

476
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:09,119
I found out that your mom was missing.

477
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,880
I tried to find her.

478
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,960
But I failed.

479
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,119
I only found out later...

480
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:37,559
that our parents...

481
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,160
didn't want us to be together.

482
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,200
So when I was sick,

483
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,759
they sent your mom away...

484
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:46,720
so neither of us could find each other.

485
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:51,440
After that,

486
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,519
I simply became...

487
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,960
a factory worker.

488
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,599
After your mom graduated from university,

489
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,960
she came back here.

490
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:04,359
We had our own families and children.

491
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,359
We never saw each other again.

492
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,599
Until last year...

493
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:18,240
when my daughter brought me here to play.

494
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,319
I...

495
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:27,279
I ran into her again.

496
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:32,200
Actually,

497
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,759
I should have told you earlier about this.

498
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:36,559
But I really didn't know how to tell you.

499
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,079
Mr. Zhang.

500
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:41,359
If you're honest with me...

501
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:43,480
and tell me you're in a relationship,

502
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:46,960
I won't disapprove.

503
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:49,839
After all,

504
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,559
my dad has passed away for so long.

505
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,839
My mom...

506
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,759
deserves a companion.

507
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:57,400
It's my fault.

508
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:59,960
I shouldn't have kept it from you.

509
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:15,039
(Dear Xiao Gang, happy birthday)

510
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:22,719
Here, Mr. Zhang.

511
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,799
It's all in the wine.

512
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:25,519
Yes, it's all in the wine.

513
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:36,839
Get more rest when you get back.

514
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,799
Eat more fruit and foods that are high in calcium...

515
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:42,200
such as milk and soybeans.

516
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:43,960
Most importantly,

517
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,880
remember to come back for a follow-up in two weeks.

518
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:48,598
Okay. Thank you, doctor.

519
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:49,960
- You're welcome. - Thank you.

520
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,839
Let's go home.

521
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,599
Okay.

522
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,960
Let's go.

523
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:05,000
I'm finally discharged.

524
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:06,359
Yes.

525
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,480
I called a taxi.

526
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:08,680
Let's go home.

527
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:11,319
Mom.

528
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,880
Xiao Gang.

529
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,559
Come on, let's go home.

530
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:25,960
Let's go, Mr. Zhang.

531
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,880
Coming.

532
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,960
Let's go.

533
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:43,079
A long-lost love.

534
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,279
How nice.

535
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:46,799
Yes.

536
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:49,079
After decades of ups and downs,

537
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,319
they found their way back to each other.

538
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:52,960
Have you thought about...

539
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:55,200
what kind of love you will have?

540
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,519
With whom?

541
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,359
I can tell you haven't thought about it.

542
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,279
Forget it.

543
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,119
Just focus on your work.

544
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:19,039
Lin Zhi.

545
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,920
Why are you sneaking around?

546
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,160
There's something...

547
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:24,400
I want to consult you about.

548
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,680
What is it?

549
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,319
Let's say...

550
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,759
a girl...

551
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,480
says to a guy,

552
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,240
"What kind of love do you want?"

553
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,920
What does that girl mean?

554
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,119
What do you mean?

555
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,160
She just wants to know what kind of love you want.

556
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,839
No, I mean...

557
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,720
What I mean is...

558
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,039
why would this girl...

559
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,880
say that to this guy?

560
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,880
What's her motive?

561
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:54,720
Motive?

562
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,359
She wants to know. Otherwise, why would she ask?

563
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:58,680
You...

564
00:28:58,799 --> 00:28:59,880
Think about it.

565
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,160
This girl...

566
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:02,920
said those words to this guy.

567
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,799
Does that mean this girl likes this guy?

568
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:10,960
It's not impossible.

569
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,119
That's right.

570
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,799
Did a girl ask you that?

571
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,359
You're good, Chen Zhi!

572
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,119
I didn't know that could happen to you.

573
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,599
I'm okay.

574
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:25,799
Who's the girl?

575
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,799
I just think...

576
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,359
that girl kind of likes me.

577
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,359
She likes you? Who is it?

578
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,799
Who is it?

579
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,880
I have a patient to tend to. I'll get going now.

580
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:42,079
I hate it when they stop halfway.

581
00:29:58,839 --> 00:29:59,839
What are you thinking about?

582
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,039
Nothing.

583
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:03,559
You're sweating.

584
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:06,599
I'm eating spicy food.

585
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:08,839
Is it good?

586
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,880
Why are you staring at me?

587
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,519
Is there something on my face?

588
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:21,440
Come with me.

589
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,480
Wait.

590
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,960
Where are we going?

591
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:27,319
It doesn't matter. Just come with me.

592
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,720
We have a house call later.

593
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,039
Why are you running around?

594
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:31,440
I have something to tell you.

595
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:33,119
Say it here.

596
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,359
It's important.

597
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:40,759
What's wrong? You sound strange.

598
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,079
Just follow me.

599
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,000
Chen Zhi.

600
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:52,759
Tell me.

601
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,119
Tang Hua.

602
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:00,039
I've thought about it for a long time.

603
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,599
I'm conflicted.

604
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,759
Get to the point.

605
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,599
Can you not interrupt me?

606
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,400
Let me finish.

607
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:08,960
I'm sorry, Tang Hua. I'm too excited.

608
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:10,599
I shouldn't have talked to you like that.

609
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,759
Fine. I don't blame you.

610
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,119
Hurry up and tell me.

611
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,799
Actually, since back then,

612
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,480
my biggest dream...

613
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,519
is to be an outstanding doctor.

614
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,880
I never thought about anything else.

615
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:27,200
If you keep this up, I'm leaving.

616
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,680
No, I'll tell you.

617
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:32,839
I don't think...

618
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,759
I can continue to ignore your feelings for me.

619
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,839
I can't give you the cold shoulder...

620
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,279
or hurt you.

621
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,880
So I've decided...

622
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,719
to accept you.

623
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,759
Stop.

624
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,720
Accept me?

625
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:50,119
What for?

626
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:52,119
Accept your love for me.

627
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,839
All this time,

628
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:55,319
I've been afraid...

629
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:56,838
that dating too early...

630
00:31:56,839 --> 00:31:58,880
might affect our pursuit in ambition.

631
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,839
But now that I've figured it out,

632
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,440
I think...

633
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:03,759
we can improve together.

634
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:05,319
So I won't hesitate anymore...

635
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,279
and accept your love bravely.

636
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,559
Who are you playing truth or dare with?

637
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,839
That's a pretty big dare.

638
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:13,920
Tang Hua.

639
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:15,799
Don't do that...

640
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:18,480
to cover up your own happiness.

641
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,720
All right. Stop it.

642
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:21,759
That's enough.

643
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,960
I'll get mad if you do that.

644
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:25,640
Are you serious?

645
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,920
Do you really think I like you?

646
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:32,279
I know I wasn't good enough in the past.

647
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,319
I didn't appreciate your love for me.

648
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:38,240
But I understand now.

649
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,559
I accept you.

650
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,720
So don't be mad at the old me anymore.

651
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,319
You're mad.

652
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,799
Are you still half-asleep...

653
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,480
or did you suddenly lose your mind?

654
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,079
I told you.

655
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:52,839
I'm not interested in dating or getting married.

656
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,400
Even if I suddenly became interested,

657
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:57,759
I wouldn't be interested in a man like you.

658
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,359
Do you understand?

659
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:01,119
Tang Hua.

660
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:04,960
Are you testing me?

661
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:09,640
Fine.

662
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,400
Since you said I like you,

663
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,039
give me an example.

664
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:15,960
What made you think I like you?

665
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:17,799
If you don't like me,

666
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,000
why did you invite me to watch videos together...

667
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,319
and improve my medical skills?

668
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,319
Watching videos means I like you?

669
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,160
I was simply helping a colleague.

670
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:28,880
That and liking you are two different things.

671
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,799
And when the patient with a hairline fracture left,

672
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,559
you asked me what kind of love I wanted.

673
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,880
Doesn't that mean you want to be in love with me?

674
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,200
You're so full of yourself.

675
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,680
In the face of a beautiful relationship.

676
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:45,200
I felt touched.

677
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,319
Does asking you something means I like you?

678
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:49,640
Can I even talk to you from now on?

679
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:52,559
Do you really mean what you say?

680
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,039
You aren't testing me?

681
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:57,400
I really didn't expect you to be just like Bai Zhu.

682
00:33:58,079 --> 00:33:59,599
You're so full of yourself.

683
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,799
You think all the women in the world like you?

684
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,480
What made you think Tang Hua likes you?

685
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,599
Didn't you tell me that?

686
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,360
When did I tell you?

687
00:34:24,809 --> 00:34:27,158
No. What's wrong with all of you?

688
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:28,719
Wait. Let me think.

689
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,400
You mean the last time when you and Tang Hua...

690
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,329
watched videos together?

691
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,440
Yes. Did you tell me that?

692
00:34:35,809 --> 00:34:37,769
I told I was kidding.

693
00:34:38,329 --> 00:34:39,360
I...

694
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:40,960
Chen Zhi, although you're in pain,

695
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,199
I still have to tell you the truth.

696
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,079
Based on my observation and judgment,

697
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:46,809
Tang Hua doesn't like you.

698
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,960
And...

699
00:34:48,289 --> 00:34:49,809
you two don't suit each other at all.

700
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,289
So it's better to turn back now.

701
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,000
Can't you do better?

702
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:58,079
- Hello. - Hurry. We have a patient.

703
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,400
Okay, I got it.

704
00:35:00,329 --> 00:35:01,519
Pull yourself together. Get to work.

705
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:04,769
The patient is 58 years old.

706
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,239
He fainted while drinking tea at home.

707
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,239
When he came to his senses, he dialed 120 himself.

708
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,079
The patient said he has always been healthy.

709
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:12,329
No history of hypertension or diabetes.

710
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:13,960
But he has smoked for 40 years.

711
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:15,599
I think it's cardiogenic shock.

712
00:35:16,329 --> 00:35:17,559
Where do you feel uncomfortable?

713
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:19,119
My chest hurts.

714
00:35:19,289 --> 00:35:20,289
When did it start?

715
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,519
Around eight in the morning.

716
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:29,360
Frequent premature ventricular contractions.

717
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,769
Double-check the EKG. Get troponin.

718
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,119
Okay, I'm on it.

719
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,119
- Are you his family? - Dad.

720
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:37,329
- You can't go in right now. - Dad!

721
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:38,679
How is my dad, doctor?

722
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,239
The patient has acute myocardial infarction.

723
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,360
Is it serious?

724
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,639
The mortality rate is very high.

725
00:35:42,769 --> 00:35:44,360
Besides, based on the test results,

726
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:46,639
the area of his heart blockage is very extensive.

727
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
There's a major blood vessel in his heart...

728
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,400
that is most likely clogged.

729
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,769
But there was nothing wrong with his heart before.

730
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,920
Most acute myocardial infarctions are sudden.

731
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:58,039
It may have something to do with his long years of smoking.

732
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,599
It has been three hours since he collapsed.

733
00:35:59,809 --> 00:36:01,159
He's still in the window period for surgical resuscitation.

734
00:36:01,329 --> 00:36:03,519
So I recommend getting the stent implanted right away...

735
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:05,239
to clear his blocked blood vessel.

736
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,479
Implant a stent?

737
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,519
Yes.

738
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,239
Acute heart attacks carry many risks of complications.

739
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,559
For example, a heart rupture...

740
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:13,199
or malignant arrhythmia.

741
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,480
These are all fatal.

742
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:16,199
And the patient has frequent premature beats.

743
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,769
The blood vessel must be unclogged quickly.

744
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,519
Dr. Bai.

745
00:36:22,289 --> 00:36:24,199
This is the surgery consent form. Please take a look.

746
00:36:24,329 --> 00:36:25,809
If there's no problem, please sign it.

747
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,119
We can schedule surgery right away.

748
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,199
Is there a problem?

749
00:36:32,769 --> 00:36:35,239
But there was nothing wrong with his heart.

750
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,239
I just told you. It's acute myocardial infarction.

751
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,809
Most of the time, it happens suddenly.

752
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,920
Doctor, it says here...

753
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:42,119
after the stent implantation,

754
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:43,329
he'll have to take medication for a lifetime.

755
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:45,000
That's right.

756
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:47,360
He will need to take anticoagulants for life after surgery...

757
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:50,289
to prevent his blood vessels from getting blocked again.

758
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,679
Can we not put in a stent?

759
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:53,439
- Just prescribe some medicine. - Yes.

760
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,559
If you keep going on,

761
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:56,400
the patient will be at a greater risk of dying.

762
00:36:57,329 --> 00:36:58,329
Mom.

763
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,199
Why don't we sign it?

764
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:01,679
Xiao Man.

765
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,159
- Dong Cheng! - You can't go in.

766
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:06,199
- Hong Xia. - How are you, Dad?

767
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,159
Dong Cheng. Where does it hurt?

768
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,289
It's expensive to implant a stent.

769
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,519
Dad, don't worry about the money.

770
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:13,920
It's not about the money.

771
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,559
I...

772
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,039
Am I not fine?

773
00:37:17,329 --> 00:37:18,480
I don't need a stent.

774
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,920
The doctor said...

775
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:21,809
you need to have your blood vessel unclogged...

776
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:23,329
and a stent implanted.

777
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:24,719
They will charge a lot of money...

778
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,599
to implant a stent.

779
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:28,289
I knew it.

780
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:30,289
No wonder they're making you implant a stent.

781
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,039
But as long as it's good for Dad,

782
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,000
the stent must be implanted.

783
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,159
Implant what?

784
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,000
By implanting that,

785
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:38,639
we don't know how serious the side effects will be.

786
00:37:38,769 --> 00:37:40,519
That's right. They only care about making money.

787
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:42,289
They don't think about your dad's health.

788
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:44,480
They're not the ones experiencing the side effects.

789
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:46,400
How about this? Xiao Man.

790
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,559
Give Ling Ling a call.

791
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,840
Yes. Give her a call.

792
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:52,840
She works in a big hospital in Beijing.

793
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:54,199
Listen to what she has to say.

794
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,920
- Okay. I'll call her now. - Hurry up and go.

795
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:00,159
How is your discussion going?

796
00:38:00,329 --> 00:38:01,679
Sign it as soon as you've discussed it.

797
00:38:01,769 --> 00:38:03,000
What's the hurry?

798
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,079
My relative works in a big hospital in Beijing.

799
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:06,880
We can't just listen to you.

800
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,079
Your relative?

801
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:09,400
What relative?

802
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,329
Young man, listen to me.

803
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:14,599
Installing a stent isn't a small matter.

804
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:16,960
We'll discuss it with my family.

805
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:18,639
You're in a very dangerous condition.

806
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:20,519
Ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation can occur at any time.

807
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:21,639
It'll kill you.

808
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:23,360
Doesn't he look fine now?

809
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,960
Don't try to scare us.

810
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:27,239
Young man.

811
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:28,719
Get back to work.

812
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:30,599
When we're done talking,

813
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:33,199
we'll let you know, okay?

814
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:40,159
Dr. Xu, the patient has a relative who works at a hospital in Beijing.

815
00:38:40,329 --> 00:38:41,329
He wants to discuss with her.

816
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,079
At this rate, he'll be in danger.

817
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,719
I already told them that.

818
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,159
But the patient and his family...

819
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:48,159
all think he'll get better.

820
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:50,079
They don't take what I say seriously.

821
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:51,769
I can't wait any longer.

822
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,679
Ling Ling, right now...

823
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,119
What are you doing?

824
00:38:57,239 --> 00:38:59,119
Hello? I'm the patient's doctor.

825
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,599
He's having an acute myocardial infarction.

826
00:39:00,769 --> 00:39:02,480
We highly suspect an anterior descending artery blockage.

827
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:04,400
A heart stent surgery is necessary immediately.

828
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:07,000
You're the patient's relative and a doctor.

829
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:08,159
Let me ask you.

830
00:39:08,289 --> 00:39:10,159
Do you want him to live or die?

831
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,159
Ling Ling.

832
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,400
Tell me.

833
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,840
Is that so?

834
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,559
Okay.

835
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,559
I'll listen to you.

836
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,920
I'll do as the doctor says.

837
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:36,289
Sign it.

838
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,639
Sorry for calling you here from home.

839
00:39:43,769 --> 00:39:44,809
You must be tired.

840
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,199
But this patient's condition is special indeed.

841
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:48,679
It's my job.

842
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,199
Saving lives is our duty as doctors.

843
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:52,400
Yes.

844
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:54,360
Aren't you the same, Dr. Bai?

845
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,880
You're so busy...

846
00:39:56,039 --> 00:39:57,119
but you came all the way here.

847
00:39:57,329 --> 00:39:59,289
I'm here to learn from you.

848
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:02,159
No wonder the director thinks highly of you.

849
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:05,119
You're indeed hardworking and eager to learn.

850
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,239
- Let's get started. - Sure.

851
00:40:08,769 --> 00:40:10,159
Check the blood vessels first.

852
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,769
The anterior descending artery and right coronary artery.

853
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,679
The stenosis is greater than 90 percent.

854
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,440
Look.

855
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:22,159
The remaining circumflex is only 65 five percent.

856
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,159
It doesn't look good.

857
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,559
We need to implant the stent right away.

858
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,159
It's so serious.

859
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:31,400
I can't believe he's held on until now.

860
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,079
He's lucky.

861
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,480
Yes.

862
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:37,239
The situation is worse than we thought.

863
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,289
Luckily, he chose surgery.

864
00:40:40,329 --> 00:40:42,639
Let's go out and talk to his family.

865
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:46,360
Doctor, how's my husband?

866
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:49,000
The result of the patient's coronary artery scan is not good.

867
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:50,480
You need to prepare yourselves mentally.

868
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:51,719
Please, doctor.

869
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:53,360
Please save my husband.

870
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:54,960
We'll do our best.

871
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,159
- Don't worry. - The patient is in V-fib!

872
00:40:58,329 --> 00:41:00,289
- Doctor! What's wrong with my dad? - What's going on?

873
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,999
Defibrillation! The patient is still conscious.

874
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,399
- Should we... - Saving his life is more important!

875
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,400
Hurry.

876
00:41:05,769 --> 00:41:06,809
Defibrillator.

877
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,119
Charge to 200 joules.

878
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,809
- Charged. - Clear.

879
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:18,999
Doctor, you said there's no pain during the surgery.

880
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,238
How dare you treat a patient like this?

881
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:22,239
- I must file a complaint! - Calm down.

882
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,598
- What's going on? - This is an emergency.

883
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:24,880
I'm trying to save your husband's life!

884
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:26,239
Please be understanding, okay?

885
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,809
I can't understand! My husband is screaming inside!

886
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,078
- Calm down. - Doctor.

887
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:31,199
The situation is under control for now...

888
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:32,519
but still dangerous.

889
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:34,079
We need to put in the stent as soon as possible.

890
00:41:34,289 --> 00:41:35,769
Otherwise, he might go in V-fib again.

891
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,119
You said the surgery wasn't painful.

892
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:38,360
Why is he like this?

893
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:40,289
Please calm down. That was an emergency.

894
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:41,840
Stent surgery is a minor injury.

895
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,960
Only local anesthesia is needed.

896
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:44,719
The patient is conscious on the operating table.

897
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,400
We don't know anything. Anything you say goes.

898
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,559
Let me explain it to you again.

899
00:41:49,809 --> 00:41:51,920
When he goes in V-fib and we don't save him in time,

900
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:53,159
the patient will die.

901
00:41:53,289 --> 00:41:55,329
The best solution is to defibrillate him.

902
00:41:55,769 --> 00:41:57,199
We don't have enough time to give him anesthesia.

903
00:41:57,329 --> 00:41:58,440
Can my husband be saved?

904
00:41:58,559 --> 00:41:59,769
The operation is ongoing.

905
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,719
The previous angiography was very clear.

906
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,880
The situation is more urgent now.

907
00:42:04,679 --> 00:42:07,289
Two out of three major vessels in the heart are already blocked.

908
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,000
The remaining one...

909
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:10,039
might be blocked too.

910
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:11,960
If we don't put the stent in place in time...

911
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:13,719
and a massive heart attack occurs...

912
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,360
then there's really no way to save him.

913
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,639
- Mom. - Doctor.

914
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,480
- Calm down. - I'm begging you.

915
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:22,199
You have to save my husband.

916
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,079
Help your mom. We're going to continue the surgery.

917
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:25,440
The patient is in V-fib again!

918
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:27,000
- Dad! - Calm down.

919
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:29,119
- Dong Cheng! - Calm down!

920
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:30,440
How did this happen?

921
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:31,840
- Dong Cheng! - Dad!

922
00:42:32,289 --> 00:42:33,920
Don't get distracted. Keep going.

923
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:36,480
- Open the door! - Charge to 200 joules again.

924
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:37,679
Dad!

925
00:42:37,809 --> 00:42:39,440
- Charged. - Clear.

926
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,519
He's back.

927
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:46,719
Continue the surgery.
