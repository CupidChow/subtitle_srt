00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,540
Ying Ying, don't say those words in front of outsiders.

17
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,630
After all, he's your biological father.

18
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,930
He loves you in his heart.

19
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:59,290
Why are you not letting me eat?

20
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,740
Doctor said that you can't eat or drink.

21
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,470
- You can only be on IV. 
 If I listen to them,

22
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,580
everybody in the world will die.

23
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,400
You don't believe doctors at all, and you still come to the hospital for treatment?

24
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,160
What did you say?

25
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,730
Don't get angry. Don't get angry.

26
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,320
Ying Ying, don't talk to your dad like that.

27
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,570
Did I say it wrong?

28
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:25,590
You see how I deal with you when I'm out of there.

29
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,740
Ying Ying, you go out first.

30
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,760
This...

31
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,640
You taught her. You taught her well huh.

32
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,530
I'm hungry.

33
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,380
Get food for me.

34
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,360
Doctor said you cannot eat.

35
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,200
I'm not allowed to eat and drink.

36
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,500
You want me to die?

37
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:55,110
You guys want to starve... starve me to death?

38
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,570
Calm down.

39
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,500
- Why are you not going in? 
 - I don't want to see that person.

40
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,310
Doctor! Doctor!

41
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,100
Doctor Bai!

42
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,110
- What's wrong? 
 - Family member stay away for a while.

43
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,530
- What's wrong with you? 
 - Family member come here.

44
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,600
Oxygen saturation is so low.

45
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,530
Oxygen mask.

46
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,170
Inject 0.5 of Diprophylline into the IV. Methylprednisolone 40 milligrams.

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,290
- Later do a arterial blood gas test. After he's stable, do a chest CT scan. 
 - Okay.

48
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:39,240
- How's it? 
 - Breathing sound is low indeed.

49
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,560
Jaundice?

50
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,670
Don't tell me his liver has problems, too?

51
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,680
Do a liver function test again.

52
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,230
Hello, I'm Xiao Yan. Yes.

53
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,940
Teacher Wu said you are close to him in the past.

54
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,170
Yes, Zhi Yuan is already...

55
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,200
It's okay, it's okay.

56
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,570
It's like this. I want to ask you about a place.

57
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,430
Do you know Smoke Alley?

58
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,950
Yes, he lived there before last time.

59
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,030
Could I trouble you to think again?

60
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,880
It's okay, it's okay.

61
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,630
Thank you.

62
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,330
Let me state something first.

63
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,340
I didn't purposely eavesdrop your phone conversation.

64
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,340
But I heard a familiar location.

65
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:58,760
- You know Smoke Alley? 
 - I didn't expect you to know about it, too.

66
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,460
Can you write the address for me?

67
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,420
I just ended my shift. I bring you there.

68
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,130
This is Smoke Alley.

69
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,920
I came here before.

70
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,970
Isn't this called Shuijing Alley?

71
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,720
Believe me.

72
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:25,060
My brother and sister-in-law lived here last time.

73
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,420
I always go to their house to play when I was schooling.

74
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,930
There was an old granny who lived inside last time.

75
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,690
She was a very good person. She was very cordial.

76
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:37,640
She always asked me to go to her house to eat.

77
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,880
Maybe because she was old,

78
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,530
so she always called this place Smoke Alley.

79
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:46,940
After that, Granny passed away. Nobody mention the name Smoke Alley anymore.

80
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,930
Only people like us who lived here before know.

81
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:57,980
Did the old granny had other relatives?

82
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,000
Last time, she mentioned that she had a grandson.

83
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,550
His age is around mine. But I have not met him.

84
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:06,780
She said he went overseas long ago.

85
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,310
She was Zhi Yuan's grandmother.

86
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:28,820
<i>[Good Fortune]</i>

87
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,130
The courtyard is quite clean. Someone must have cleaned it.

88
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:49,190
I go ask around nearby to see there's anyone can contact the landlord.

89
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,340

00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,090
<i>It was also called Luo En.</i>

93
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,880
<i>I'm Luo En number 1, it is Luo En number 2.</i>

94
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,000
Just now I asked a few neighbors, they...

95
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,710
Doctor Xiao, what's wrong?

96
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,610
Nothing.

97
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:40,120
I thought of a friend from the past

98
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,300
who also raised a dog like this.

99
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,780
I know why you came back to Shanghai.

100
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,370
- Why? 
 - Find an old friend.

101
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,830
I rent this house first.

102
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:59,130
I asked a few neighbors just now. They all can't contact the landlord.

103
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:02,840
But there was one neighbor who said the landlord listed this house for rent online.

104
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,020
You can go online to take a look.

105
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,480
I found information on the landlord online.

106
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,730
Later I contact her.

107
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:23,160
Doctor Xiao, you are different from the person I thought you were originally.

108
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,670
How different?

109
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,120
Department calling.

110
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,930
Teacher Bai.

111
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,930
Result of the check is out.

112
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,600
Prothrombin time is on the high side.

113
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,920
ALT rose. 
 <i>(T/N: Alanine transaminase, an enzyme found mostly in the liver)</i>

114
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,460
Serum cholinesterase lowered a little.

115
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,620
PO2 from the arterial blood gas analysis is 52.

116
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,790
PCO2 is 38.

117
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,090
Lactic acid is 4.1.

118
00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:00,200
Chest CT scan shows interstitial change in both lungs.

119
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,510
This is liver failure and respiratory failure at the same time.

120
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,250
But will uremia cause liver failure?

121
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,020
It should not be uremia. Uremia will not worsen so fast.

122
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,370
The progression of the disease is not like that, too.

123
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,230
Then what's the medical condition?

124
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,020
Poisoned?

125
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,740
Rat poison

126
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,740
has organic phosphorus?

127
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,600
He usually likes to drink beer.

128
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,970
I asked him to do a body check-up every year.

129
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,830
He was checked 6 months ago.

130
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,230
His liver and kidney are okay and normal.

131
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:36,630
Then did he have diseases like jaundice or purpura in the past?

132
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:40,270
No. I have not seen anything showing on his body.

133
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,560
Then did you put rat poison in your house recently?

134
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,230
No.

135
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,090
Didn't he drink traditional Chinese medicine before?

136
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,730
Could it be related to the traditional Chinese medicine?

137
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,140
Did you bring the prescription for it?

138
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,240
I brought it.

139
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:05,640
We go and take a look at this prescription first. If the patient has any problems, ask the nurse to find us.

140
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,190
Okay. Thank you.

141
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,810
Thank you.

142
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,350
Ying Ying, where did you go?

143
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,900
He asked me to buy beer for him.

144
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,310
No. Doctor said he can't drink beer.

145
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,000
I go and coax him.

146
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,820
Mom, don't go in.

147
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,840
- Once you go in, he'll scold you again. 
 - It's okay.

148
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,620
He's your father.

149
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,320
Okay, got it.

150
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,060
Thank you.

151
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:50,260
- How's it. 
 - Director Qin said these are all normal traditional Chinese medicines.

152
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,360
It's impossible for it to cause such a big reaction.

153
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,580
- It's not related to these. 
 - It's really problematic.

154
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,390
Then how are we going to treat it subsequently?

155
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,230
Let's use medicines according to the symptoms.

156
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,120
Slow down the liver failure.

157
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,340
Additionally, continue to perfect the secondary checks and see if you can find any clues.

158
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,130
Okay. That's all we can do.

159
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,010
- Doctor Xiao. 
 - Doctor Bai.

160
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:26,140
I heard you accepted a patient who is suspected to have uremia and can't find root.

161
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:29,930
Yes. We found that he had liver failure after the results of the check was out.

162
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,580
But it's most probably not uremia.

163
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,880
- Did the patient come into contact with rat poison? 
 - We have already eliminated this.

164
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,060
It's most probably not rat poison.

165
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:40,890
They are still doing a comprehensive check for the patient now, hoping to find the reason as soon as possible.

166
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:43,430
Then could it be paraquat poison?

167
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:46,120
Paraquat?

168
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,130
Multiple organ failure.

169
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,170
Yes, yes. We stop chatting first.

170
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,500
-Paraquat
-What are you so worked up about?

171
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,170
-I'm saying that Zhang Jin Shan could have paraquat poisoning.
-What?

172
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:11,040
Think about it. Kidney failure, liver failure, progressive respiratory failure.

173
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,990
Does it not all point signs to paraquat poisoning?

174
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,260
Now that you say it, it does sound like it.

175
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,550
But paraquat poisoning still doesn't have an effective antidote to this day.

176
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,020
The poisoning death rate is over 90%.

177
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:23,830
-He is also not a farmer.
Alright, don't waste time. Let's go ask and we can know for sure.
-Okay.

178
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,180
Paraquat?

179
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,040
What the heck am I doing with that in my system?

180
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,510
Do you have any in your house?

181
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,910
No. We sell steamed buns.

182
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,420
Our home has never had this kind of thing before.

183
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,210
Miss, what about you? Have you come into contact with it before?

184
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:46,720
I have never heard of it.

185
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:53,540
Doctor, tell us

186
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,590
how do I have paraquat poisoning?

187
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,070
We currently are unable to determine that.

188
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,240
We need to do a routine urine test and a paraquat concentration test.

189
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,260
It would be better if it wasn't paraquat poisoning.

190
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,010
How did you think of paraquat poisoning?

191
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,550
Guess.

192
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:22,470
They said they have never come into contact with it. Could it be something else?

193
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:25,200
Once the test results come out we will know.

194
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,490
Chen Zhi, bring the urine sample to the lab department in a bit. Have them get the results to me as soon as they can.

195
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,150
Okay.

196
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,760
I'm going to the bathroom. Wait here. Don't run around.

197
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,320
You sitting here is pointless.

198
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,430
I don't have to pee right now.

199
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:02,940
No problem. Take your time.

200
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,840
Dont' worry. The situation is currently stable.

201
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,720
If there are no problems through the night, the patient can go home.

202
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,090
Thank you, Doctor.

203
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,380
Doctor Qin, can you help me with this first?

204
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,640
The patient may have paraquat poisoning, we are in a hurry.

205
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,340
Wait for a moment, once I'm done looking at this I will help you.

206
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,540
Doctor Qin, I put it here for you. I'm going to the bathroom.

207
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,920
Okay.

208
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,960
How are the results still not out?

209
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,850
Maybe the lab department is really busy.

210
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,250
Hello? What's going on? Why are things so slow?

211
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,720
You lost the urine sample?

212
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,480
When I walked over, the urine sample wasn't on the table.

213
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,500
I clearly but the urine sample there

214
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,640
then I went to the bathroom. How could it not be there?

215
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,750
How do you keep making these kinds of simple mistakes?

216
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,450
Teacher Xu, I really put it right here.

217
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:34,390
You put it there? Can it just fly away on its own?

218
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,420
What will you do next?

219
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,660
I'm sorry, Teacher Xu.

220
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,000
-Okay. Go get another sample from the patient.
-Okay.

221
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,680
Wait. I will go with you.

222
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,230
Walk faster.

223
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,700
I have to pree again?

224
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:06,160
Didn't I just give a urine sample? Why do I have to do it again?

225
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,630
I...

226
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,520
This is for the sake of your health.

227
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,200
We have to do another round of tests.

228
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,040
Doctor, has the results for the paraquat

229
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,680
come out yet?

230
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,230
It will soon. The results will come out in a bit.

231
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,270
First we will take this urine sample.

232
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:24,970
Can the family step out for a moment?

233
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,440
Okay.

234
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,990
Something about this smells fishy.

235
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,470
Could someone have stolen the urine sample?

236
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:39,430
What would they steal it for? Watering their flowers?

237
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:43,890
-It could be that someone doesn't want us to know about something in that urine.
-Huh?

238
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,540
What do you mean 'Huh'?

239
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,500
Wait and see.

240
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,380
Ying Ying, where did you go?

241
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,320
I got hungry, so I went to eat something.

242
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,520
All you do is run wild all day.

243
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,620
Once I'm healed I'll break your legs!

244
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,240
-Let's see if you can be healed first.
-You!

245
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,140
Mom.

246
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,220
-It's okay, Yan Yan.
-What's going on?

247
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,130
No problem. I just need to clean this up.

248
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,080
-Let me help.
-I just need to clean this up.

249
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,940
You dare to glare at me?

250
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,350
The paraquat concentration is 0.9.

251
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,770
It should be undetectable in a normal person.

252
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,960
But how did he come into contact with paraquat?

253
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,570
Come with me.
<i>[Body fluids, Urine and Stool Testing Location]</i>

254
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,050
-Stop. Isn't that the family of the patient?
-How is it her?

255
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,470
Why would she steal the urine sample?

256
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:03,940
It's obvious, she did this

257
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,630
to make sure we don't find the paraquat in the patient.

258
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:11,080
If we don't find a cause for the disease, there's no way to prescribe the right medicine.

259
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,020
Then the patient's symptoms will get worse and worse.

260
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,470
He could even die.

261
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:18,140
How would she already know that the patient has paraquat poisoning?

262
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,600
Perhaps she's the one to poison him.

263
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,720
No way, the patient is her father.

264
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,370
How could she use poison to harm her own father?

265
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:28,000
You two really like to waster time. Why are you overthinking things?

266
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,310
Hello, I would like to call the police.

267
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,860
Mom, sit.

268
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,800
You eat what is mine, you drink what is mine.

269
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:47,180
If I hear nonsense from you, I will beat you.

270
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,320
Family of the patient, come with me.

271
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,630
Is there an issue?

272
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:59,540
Doctor Bai wants to discuss further treatment.

273
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,380
Okay.

274
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,810
Didn't you say you wanted to discuss further treatment?

275
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:31,810
Why aren't we discussing this in the hospital room?

276
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:39,600
Yan Yan, was your father's urine sample stolen by you?

277
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,400
This has nothing to do with Yan Yan, if you have a problem ask me about it.

278
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,240
Sorry, I am talking to her.

279
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,450
This is you, right?

280
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,500
Yan Yan, you...

281
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,670
It's me.

282
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:06,050
-Why did you do it?
-I don't want him to leave the hospital.

283
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:07,740
I want him to stay here forever.

284
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,510
He is your father. Why do you want him to stay in the hospital?

285
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,340
I hate him.

286
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,850
Why?

287
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,320
I don't want to say.

288
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:36,080
Okay. Then I will ask you, how did you know your father's urine would have paraquat in it?

289
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,050
Did you find a way to expose him to paraquat?

290
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:44,520
I poisoned him.

291
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,470
You are already to suspected to have poisoned him, I already called the police.

292
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,120
-Don't take Yan Yan, let the police take me.
-It was me.

293
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:00,640
-It was me.
-It was me.
-I put the paraquat in the Chinese medicine that Jin Shan drank.

294
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,020
It was nothing to do with Yan Yan.

295
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,620
This is already attempted murder.

296
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,630
-It was really me.
-Mom.

297
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,120
Yan Yan.

298
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:15,510
Mom knows your intentions, but I can't hurt you.

299
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:30,690
Okay, then why did you do it?

300
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,520
I am not Yan Yan's biological mother.

301
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,910
Yan Yan's mother left when she was young.

302
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:53,030
When I married Jin Shan, Yan Yan was only four years old.

303
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:57,620
At the time, Jin Shan had a small factory. Our family was able to get by.

304
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,640
But not long after, the factory fell apart

305
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,350
our family owed a large amount of debt.

306
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,650
Jin Shan fell apart.

307
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:09,500
He drank all the time.

308
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:14,230
After he drank, he would come home and hit me.

309
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,990
These past ten years

310
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:21,160
The wounds I suffer on my body never stop.

311
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,180
One time

312
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,480
he broke me arm.

313
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:31,320
I was in the hospital for over a month.

314
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:38,050
He even still dared to hit me in front of the doctors.

315
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,550
Why didn't you go to the police?

316
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:45,320
I did. He was in jail for ten days, and was out in half of a month.

317
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,770
After he came back, he became even more aggressive.

318
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:51,510
Get divorced. It became like this and you still didn't divorce him?

319
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:54,910
One time, I had the divorce documents prepared and signed

320
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:59,390
but he didn't say anything

321
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:02,580
then went to my house the next day and beat my father.

322
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,710
Yes, so I could divorce him

323
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:10,160
but what about my parents? What about my family and friends?

324
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:16,830
Then when did you decide to poison him?

325
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:19,820
The day he hit Yan Yan.

326
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,790
Even though I am Yan Yan's step-mothing

327
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:28,780
Yan Yan has been like my own daughter since she was little.

328
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:33,230
Every time Jin Shan hit me, Yan Yan would protect me.

329
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:37,730
At first, Jin Shan had a little bit of humanity and couldn't bring himself to hit Yan Yan.

330
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:40,150
But one time

331
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,530
Yan Yan accidently hurt him

332
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,800
in an attempt to defend me

333
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:50,000
then he went psycho and hit Yan Yan until her stomach was bleeding.

334
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:57,670
Since then, he only needs to drink a tiny bit of alcohol

335
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:02,040
and he will hit whoever displeases him in the slightest.

336
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:06,040
These past few years, Yan Yan has received just as many injuries as I have.

337
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,440
These past few days, his leg has hurt a lot. He comes home and vents his anger on Yan Yan.

338
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,170
Yan Yan only said a few words to him, then he grabbed her head and rammed it into the wall.

339
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,700
Yan Yan became dizzy.

340
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,880
That evening

341
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,750
I asked my friend who uses farm chemicals for a bottle of paraquat.

342
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,380
They said it was for killing weeds.

343
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:42,690
Yan Yan, then how did you know your father had paraquat poisoning?

344
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:47,660
Several days ago, I saw my Mom hid a bottle of paraquat.

345
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:52,610
Today when the doctor said that my Dad had paraquat poisoning

346
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:56,570
I figured out, it was the poison my Mom gave him.

347
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:00,900
Then was stealing the urine sample something she told you to do?

348
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,770
My mom doesn't know. I decided by myself.

349
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,300
This could cause your father to die.

350
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:13,040
He is my Dad, I don't want him to die.

351
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,960
I only wanted him to stay sick

352
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,720
and stay in the hospital forever.

353
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,640
This way, he won't be able to hit me or my Mom.

354
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:39,080
I want to say goodbye to my Dad again.

355
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:43,020
Xiao Chen, you can leave.

356
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,540
Okay.

357
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,300
We already found your cause of illness. Someone gave you paraquat poisoning.

358
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,220
What? What poisoning?

359
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,920
It was me.

360
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,130
No, I did it.

361
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,950
You both poisoned me?

362
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,470
I will beat you to death.

363
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:12,950
Those two poisoned me, they caused me harm.

364
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:15,390
I want to call the police.

365
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:17,470
-I want to call the police.
-Don't move.

366
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,890
The hospital already called the police.

367
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,770
This...

368
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:26,580
Dad, I will only call you 'Dad' one more time.

369
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:31,400
These ten years, you hit me, you hit my Mom.

370
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,360
I used the paraquat

371
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,150
to return all of the suffering you caused back to you.

372
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:38,610
I don't owe you anything.

373
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,220
From this day forward

374
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,350
we are no longer father and daughter.

375
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:46,320
We will never see each other again.

376
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:50,270
If you come find my Mom and I again

377
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:53,750
I will repay you for everything you have done to us and double it.

378
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,240
Yan Yan.

379
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:10,940
Amazing, Old Bai. You still haven't told me

380
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,460
what made you think of paraquat.

381
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,980
It was the distance between people.

382
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:18,040
Li Chun and Zhang Yan Yan have been taken by the police.

383
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,040
Do we know how many years they will be put away?

384
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,160
This is up to the law, the hospital has no control over it.

385
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,760
Zhang Jin Shan doesn't have anyone to take care of him. What will he do?

386
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,150
-Find him a care worker.
-He should pay for it himself.

387
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,810
Was it you that I talked to online about renting my house?

388
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,030
Hello, it's me.

389
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:09,590
Then I'll bring you to take a look.

390
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,220
How long do you plan to rent it?

391
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,360
One year.

392
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,770
Okay.

393
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:17,140
<i>[Blessings]</i>

394
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,920
Come inside and look around.

395
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:40,570
What do you think? If you like it, we can sign an agreement directly, no need to pay an agency fee.

396
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:43,280
I will grab all of the stuff in the house as fast as I can.

397
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,370
Whatever you like, you can leave.

398
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:47,900
Once it's cleaned up a bit, it will be ready for you to live in.

399
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,740
Thank you.

400
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,160
Hello

401
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,520
I saw your information online

402
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,960
I want to hire cleaning services.

403
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,290
It's all cleaned up.

404
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:08,040
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

405
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,930
If you are satisfied with my services, you can reach out to me next time.

406
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:13,700
Our door speed is extremely fast.

407
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,700
-Okay.
-I'm taking my leave.

408
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,600
Thank you.

409
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:42,170
-Hit by a car on the road. Blood pressure 70/40. Heart rate 135.
-Turn here!

410
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:45,160
Car crash! Go call Doctor Bai! Bed 4!

411
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,860
Save him. He was hit by a car. Blood pressure 107/100. Heart rate 100. We still have not contacted the family.

412
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:51,320
Bed 5! Go call Doctor Xiao!

413
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,290
The patient has suffered damage to the chest and abdomen caused by a car crash.

414
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:55,680
We have already contacted the family. They are on their way here.

415
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,790
Blood pressure 50/40. Oxygen levels 94. Heart rate 130.

416
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:02,440
Open two vascular passages. 1000 ml of Ringer solution. Constant temperature, use more pressure to administer it quickly.

417
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,580
Okay.

418
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:06,670
Patient, can you hear me?

419
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:09,690
-You are in the hospital, did you know that?
-I know.

420
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:11,940
I will examine you.

421
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,990
Where are you uncomfortable? What hurts?

422
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:31,950
-Does it hurt here?
-Yes.
-It hurts here. Okay.

423
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,860
-Does it hurt here?
-Yes.
-Okay.

424
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,620
-What about here?
-Yes.

425
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,820
-Does it hurt here?

426
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,010
It could be hemorrhagic shock caused by injuries to the chest and abdomen.

427
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:49,930
One gram IV of tranexamic acid.

428
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,960
Prepare a bedside call button, and quickly apply

429
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,050
for five units of red blood cells. Make sure to maintain the patient's temperature.

430
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,290
Okay.

431
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,940
The girl that was hit by the car just now

432
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,090
was laying in the road. She was almost crushed twice.

433
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,930
In order to save her, he went up and stopped the car.

434
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:04,190
Thankfully the car braked in time. The impact wasn't serious, but they have been unconscious.

435
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,950
We ran an ECG in the car.

436
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:10,600
Okay, thank you.

437
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,140
ECG is normal.

438
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:20,220
Wake up! Can you hear me? Wake up!

439
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,200
Blood pressure 176/100.

440
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,500
Help me control the patient.

441
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,000
The size of his pupils aren't equal on both sides. His photoreaction is slow.

442
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,500
It could be a brain injury. Prepare a tracheal tube. Take him to get a CT scan.

443
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,630
Okay. I will go get it ready.

444
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,830
Doctor Bai.

445
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:47,700
The chest and abdominal cavities have a lot of effusion. Prepare to close drainage in he chest and abdomen.

446
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:51,580
Go find a chest and general surgeon to come to the clinic. Contact the CT and operation rooms.

447
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,220
Okay.

448
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:56,270
Nurse, where is the girl who was in the car accident?

449
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:59,940
I don't know. Sorry.

450
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:03,090
Sorry.

451
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,050
Are you Zhou Wen Lu's family?

452
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:06,120
Yes. How is my daughter?

453
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:10,810
The patient was been hit and injured by a car. She is currently in shock. As for the specific situation, it is still being examined.

454
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:14,970
-I'm begging you, examine her well.
-Can I trouble you to wait outside?

455
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:16,110
Let's go.

456
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,290
We can't wait.

457
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:19,630
Let's go.

458
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:26,680
Left subdural hematoma. The centerline is to the right. It is probably a cerebral hernia.

459
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:30,000
Give the patient upper mannitol depressurization. Quickly contact the brain surgery department. Prepare for surgery.

460
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,500
Okay.

461
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:39,360
This patient has suffered injuries from a car accident. The ultrasonic examination showed the chest and abdominal cavities have large amounts of effusion.

462
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,740
After closing chest drainage and capacity expansion, the blood pressure has been relatively stable.

463
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:45,220
It could be a spleen rupture and hemorrhage. We need to do a laparotomy.

464
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,360
I have already coordinated with the operation room.

465
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,280
Quickly do a CT scan, then bring her directly to the operation room.

466
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,990
After stopping the drainage, there is not much blood.

467
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:57,210
Let's wait for the CT scan to check again. First do surgery on the abdomen.

468
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:03,090
Doctor Xiao, the brain surgery doctors are already here but there is only one operation room.

469
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:06,500
Doctor Bai already applied to use the room for an emergency surgery.

470
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,480
Doctor!

471
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,110
She's walking away, what is happening?

472
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,260
Is there anywhere else that is uncomfortable?

473
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:27,500
Doctor Bai, right now there is only one operation room, I heard you applied for it.

474
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,990
I have a patient in critical position. I need to do surgery as soon as I can.

475
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:31,920
My patient is also in serious condition.

476
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,600
A car accident caused her to lose blood and go into shock.

477
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,530
My patient has a left subdural hematoma, it is probably  a cerebral hernia.

478
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:43,390
The operation room department called, there is an appendectomy going on in one of them. It will probably be done in half an hour. Then we can use the room.

479
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:48,280
How about this, you go in first. I need to do one more examination on my patient before their surgery. It will take about thirty minutes.

480
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,000
Thank you, Doctor Bai.

481
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,700
Take the patient to the operating theater.

482
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,030
But we still haven't been able to get in contact with his family. Should we wait?

483
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,890
It's too late, he needs to have surgery immediately.

484
00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:00,640
Okay, then I will give the medical department a call.

485
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:03,160
This...

486
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:05,410
- Nurse!
- Nurse! Nurse!

487
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,260
- Is that my daughter's report?
 - What does the report say?

488
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,720
Could the patient's family please first wait outside?

489
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,750
- What do you mean by "wait"? Do you only know how to tell us to wait? 
- What, wait?

490
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:13,870
- Please calm down. 
- Just now, you didn't let us stay inside. Now look, the report has come out.

491
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:15,460
- Exactly! 
- You still want us to wait?

492
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,030
- Please calm down—
- You have to tell us

493
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,690
- what the situation is right! 
 - Calm down.

494
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:21,350
- What's going on?
- Doctor Bai, these two are the family of Zhou Wen Lu.

495
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,420
These are her results.

496
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,180
- Okay, you can go back to work.
 - What is the situation right now?

497
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:27,900
The patient has significant fluid build-up in her chest cavity and abdominal cavity due to the car accident. She needs surgery immediately.

498
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:31,140
- What?
 - What? Wasn't she fine just now? How come she suddenly needs surgery?

499
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:34,430
Exactly! How are you planning on treating her exactly? We also want to know!

500
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:35,700
You can't delay from treating my daughter!

501
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,010
Why are you snatching it?

502
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:40,270
- You—! What kind of attitude is that?
 - What's that supposed to mean? If you don't understand, we can find someone who can!

503
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:42,690
- Who do you think you are?
 - Let's go speak over there!
- What do you mean, speak over there?

504
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:44,430
- Look at his attitude!
- He needs to explain!

505
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:47,980
- What's going on?
 - This is our Doctor Bai. Doctor Bai is our hospital's best attending physician.

506
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:51,660
Currently, the most important is to go treat your daughter, right? Please cooperate with us.

507
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,560
Even if he is a famous doctor, he still can't

508
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,430
- act like this! He needs to tell us what's happening!
- Exactly!
- Doctor Bai, the operating theater for appendicitis is free now.

509
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:57,960
Take the patient there immediately.

510
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,350
Thanks.

511
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:01,330
We have the right to know.

512
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:03,770
Don't worry, don't worry.

513
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:13,350
She's been in there for so long, how come she still hasn't come out yet?

514
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:16,440
This is all my fault. It's all my fault!

515
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,850
Can you please stop prattling on?

516
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,850
If it wasn't for your non-stop prattling,

517
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:23,920
would our Lu Lu have run out without finishing her meal?

518
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,270
Would we be in this situation now?

519
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:28,880
Wasn't I doing that for her own good?

520
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,930
Doing it for her own good? Every day, you force her

521
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:35,500
to go on blind dates with these dodgy people. You're doing that for her own good?

522
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,880
What's wrong with not being married at 30 years old?

523
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,730
Even if she wasn't married at 80, I would still take care of her!

524
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:43,070
Please keep it down.

525
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,740
Lu Lu.

526
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,720
- You need to hang in there.
 - Okay, okay.

527
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,180
If you don't hang in there, how am I supposed to go on living?

528
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:06,710
Lymphocytes. This needs too... Hello?

529
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:10,910
<i>Doctor Bai, there's a complication with Zhou Wen Lu's surgery. Director Lu wants you to go to the operating theater.</i>

530
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:13,070
Okay, I'll go there right now.

531
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:19,370
<i>We are no longer able to repair the patient's bleeding site in the spleen.</i>

532
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:23,080
<i>There are no more bleeding sites in the abdominal cavity. We have closed the drainage of the right chest cavity due to excessive bleeding.</i>

533
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:27,310
<i>It has already surpassed 1,500 mL. It requires immediate thoracoscopy.</i>

534
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,910
<i>Director Wang from the Thoracic Surgery Department is still performing surgery, so that's why we have asked you to step in.</i>

535
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:33,420
Okay, leave it with me.

536
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,080
Scalpel.

537
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,440
Protective cover.

538
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,370
Enter.

539
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:18,560
Close the light.

540
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:31,190
Go left.

541
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:38,190
Go to the right. I have not identified any obvious signs of bleeding.

542
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,420
1,000 mL of normal saline.

543
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:54,010
- Right lung ventilation. 
- Okay.

544
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:05,240
I have found the laceration.

545
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,030
- Suction. One lung ventilation.
- Okay.

546
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,620
Hemoclip.

547
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:34,030
1,000 mL of normal saline.

548
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,210
Suction. Two-lung ventilation.

549
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:46,710
Okay.

550
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,610
There is still fluid with blood in it.

551
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:53,240
Oval forceps.

552
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,130
Go up. Good.

553
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:03,950
Ruptured diaphragm.

554
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:06,340
- Silk suture. 
- Okay.

555
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:09,460
<i>[EICU]</i>

556
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:12,710
Zhou Wen Lu? Zhou Wen Lu?

557
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:22,490
Doctor Xiao, when will my daughter wake up?

558
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:26,960
Don't worry, the surgery went smoothly. Once the anesthesia wears off, she will wake up soon.

559
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,130
Thank you. Thank you.

560
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:31,720
Previously, my attitude towards you was not good.

561
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,550
I spoke a bit aggressively.

562
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,950
I would like to apologise.

563
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:38,780
- Sorry about that.
 - No worries, I understand. But thank you both for trusting in our ability.

564
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:41,150
- We definitely trust them.
- We do, we do.

565
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:45,480
Doctor Xiao, how is the boy that saved my daughter doing?

566
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,840
He has been resuscitated by my colleague. He is currently out of danger.

567
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,180
- That's good.
- We need to thank them.

568
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,460
Thank you. Thank you.

569
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,240
Here, raise your arm.

570
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:00,690
Raise your leg.

571
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:03,670
You have recovered quite well.

572
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:07,650
I am so lucky to have met such great doctors like you.

573
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:10,460
You're in a good mood. Keep it up, it will help with your recovery.

574
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:14,110
Doctor, you didn't contact my parents, did you?

575
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:16,570
We definitely need to contact your family.

576
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:21,290
This time, they have finally found a reason to bring me back to Canada.

577
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:26,090
If I go back to Canada, they will introduce me to a bunch of weird girls again.

578
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,310
Have a good rest. Contact us if you need anything.

579
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:37,360
I really did not expect that blind dating would be a worldwide topic.

580
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:41,490
Isn't there that old saying called "there is nothing new under the sun"?

581
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:46,560
Don't you think it was such a coincidence? The girl that was brought in with him today

582
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,660
got into the accident because she ran away from home in a fit of rage

583
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:51,670
because her parents wanted her to go on a blind date.

584
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:54,870
It is very common that people from two different generations would have differing views.

585
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,290
Really?

586
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:59,090
Even if the views of people from two different generations are not the same,

587
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:01,780
there are still many ways to resolve a conflict.

588
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,640
Would this method really solve the issue?

589
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:09,090
Views aren't formed in a day. Change doesn't happen overnight either.

590
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:13,240
I think the crux of it is that the older generation's way of thinking is not wrong.

591
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,870
It just doesn't suit the current environment.

592
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:18,640
If it doesn't suit, then they should communicate. Besides,

593
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,440
as parents, they need to respect their children's way of thinking.

594
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,980
They should also understand why their children think that way.

595
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,390
Did I actually...

596
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:29,740
Stop being cynical.

597
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,850
They're all looking at you.

598
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,630
Doctor Bai, thank you today.

599
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:48,690
- Thank me for what?
- The surgery.

600
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:50,440
No worries, it was all for the patient.

601
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,650
You're different to how I thought of you.

602
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:55,640
- What's different?
- See you tomorrow.

603
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:20,710
<i>You're different to how I thought of you.</i>

604
