00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:27,200
(Thank You, Doctor)

2
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,040
(Adapted from Sheng Li's novel "ICU 48 Hours")

3
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,000
(Episode 33)

4
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,120
This is what they say,

5
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,680
"Dating in later life is like an old house on fire."

6
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,599
A partner...

7
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,319
is to have a companion when we're old.

8
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,120
We have to control the patient's dosage...

9
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,120
to prevent infection.

10
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,120
Okay, got it.

11
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:45,959
How is he doing?

12
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,959
He's still not doing well. I'm afraid he might not make it.

13
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:52,519
Ms. Jiang. Did you reach his family?

14
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,519
I can't.

15
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,079
Let's treat the infection first.

16
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,079
All right.

17
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,519
Let's do what we can.

18
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,159
Hurry, flatline at bed nine. Come on.

19
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,000
Hsiao-peng, go and check it out.

20
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,560
See if something happened to Guo Hua.

21
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,639
- Take care of Mom. - Go.

22
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,090
Don't worry, Mom.

23
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,370
It's okay.

24
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:28,560
There's no heartbeat. Administer 1mg of Epinephrine.

25
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,810
- It's ventricular fibrillation. - Epinephrine injected.

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The defibrillator is ready.

27
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,159
200 joules.

28
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,479
200 joules confirmed.

29
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:42,719
Charged.

30
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,080
Clear.

31
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,520
Patient's time of death,

32
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,159
1:40pm.

33
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,960
Let's get an ECG.

34
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,800
Mom.

35
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,240
He's gone.

36
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,280
No...

37
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,120
No...

38
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,879
- Guo Hua. - Mom.

39
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,400
Guo Hua.

40
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,680
Guo Hua.

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,159
I did this to you.

42
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,159
No.

43
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,639
I didn't mean...

44
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,280
This pregnant woman has pulmonary lymphangioma.

45
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,919
Pulmonary lymphangioma...

46
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,399
is a very rare type of respiratory disease.

47
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,240
So far, we don't know the exact cause.

48
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,610
It's the most common among women of childbearing age.

49
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,959
There aren't many domestic records of this disease.

50
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,879
So far, there are only over 100 cases.

51
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:29,920
The major expression of this disease is progressive respiratory distress.

52
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,560
And it deteriorates progressively.

53
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,120
This disease often combines...

54
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,199
symptoms of pneumothorax and pleural effusion.

55
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,240
The complication in its advanced stage...

56
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,050
is respiratory failure.

57
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,800
So respiratory failure...

58
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,759
is the biggest cause of death for this illness.

59
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:47,610
After the prognosis, the survival period...

60
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,319
is 10 years at most.

61
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:51,519
That's why the patient has to go through...

62
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:53,480
a very painful and long process.

63
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:56,610
The cause of the disease is unknown.

64
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,959
So there's still no conventional treatment.

65
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,199
Usually, in the final stages,

66
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:05,050
the patient needs a lung transplant in order to survive.

67
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,240
If the pulmonary lymphangioma is in the early stages...

68
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,519
and the lungs still function,

69
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,519
normal pregnancy is fine.

70
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,199
But today,

71
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,170
this patient is already in a more advanced stage.

72
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,560
If the pregnancy continues,

73
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,050
she will most likely die of respiratory failure.

74
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,279
That's why OB-GYN recommends...

75
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,839
terminating the pregnancy as soon as possible.

76
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:25,050
The baby is now 25 weeks.

77
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,199
Terminating the pregnancy would be too cruel.

78
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,160
It would be cruel not to terminate the pregnancy.

79
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:32,040
She has hypoxemia.

80
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,360
It causes fetal distress and fetal growth restriction.

81
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,800
The newborn will suffocate or even end up stillborn.

82
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:42,079
What's more, some medication for pulmonary lymphangioma...

83
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:44,240
can cause damage to the baby.

84
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,720
Even if she manages to give birth,

85
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,839
it's very unlikely that she could have a healthy child.

86
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,759
So either from the patient's perspective...

87
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,279
or the baby,

88
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:56,279
the Pediatrics recommend terminating the pregnancy immediately.

89
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,959
But the current issue is that...

90
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:59,720
the patient insists on giving birth.

91
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:01,959
Is there really no other way?

92
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,040
The OB-GYN Department sees thousands of pregnant women a year.

93
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,759
There are many patients...

94
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:09,399
who would do whatever it takes to give birth to a child.

95
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:10,839
In terms of humanity,

96
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:12,279
I can empathize with this patient.

97
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:15,240
But you can't bet your life on luck.

98
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:17,519
And if anything happens,

99
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,800
it won't just impact the patient herself,

100
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:24,800
but it will also impact our doctors and our hospital.

101
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,519
That's the most important reason.

102
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,920
Yes.

103
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,639
That's an important reason.

104
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,879
If our doctors and our hospital...

105
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:37,240
get investigated for this case,

106
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:39,560
it may lead to suspensions...

107
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,240
or even the closing of our hospital.

108
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:44,199
What will happen to other patients who require treatments then?

109
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:45,879
Dr. Lu.

110
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,759
You must think of a way to convince the patient...

111
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:49,839
to terminate the pregnancy.

112
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,959
How about this?

113
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,720
Let me express my personal opinion.

114
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,040
I still hope OB-GYN can work with...

115
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:58,720
We've made ourselves very clear.

116
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,319
Dr. Lu.

117
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,399
You must think of a way to convince the patient.

118
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:07,319
Make her give up on her unrealistic fantasy.

119
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,519
This child must not be born.

120
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,160
As you can see,

121
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,399
OB-GYN's stance is clear.

122
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,800
They don't want to take over.

123
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,519
So...

124
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,920
why don't you try persuading them again?

125
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,240
The patient is so determined.

126
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,959
Maybe it's not out of her own will.

127
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,199
She might have been influenced.

128
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,199
On the contrary, I think it's the patient's decision.

129
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:00,839
Give me the chart for bed 32.

130
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:03,680
- Okay. - You don't know them.

131
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
Excuse me. How do I get to the EICU?

132
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:08,279
Are you the patient's family?

133
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,040
I'm Sun Fang Min's family.

134
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,680
I'm her attending physician.

135
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,680
Come with me.

136
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:16,680
Dad, I was on a business trip for just a few days.

137
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,120
How could something so serious happen?

138
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:19,680
No matter what,

139
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,720
we can't just force her.

140
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,800
I had no choice.

141
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,120
She still won't give up?

142
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,759
I've already told her.

143
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,959
But she wouldn't listen.

144
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,199
Why is Xiao Min so stubborn?

145
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,240
You don't agree that she gives birth to this child?

146
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,279
Of course not.

147
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,559
We went to so many hospitals...

148
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,919
and even consulted our friends abroad.

149
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,090
Everyone was against Xiao Min having the baby.

150
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:41,919
No matter what we say, it's useless.

151
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,399
But now,

152
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,159
we can only rely on you to persuade the patient.

153
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,399
We will.

154
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,879
Dr. Xu. Dr. Bai.

155
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,039
Yes? Is there something wrong with the patient?

156
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,210
My mom is fine.

157
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,480
She just wants to see the police officers.

158
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,720
She has something to tell them.

159
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,960
What is it?

160
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,480
I don't know either.

161
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,600
She says she can only say it when she sees the police.

162
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:13,919
That's why I'm asking for your opinion...

163
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,840
in case it affects her health.

164
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,039
It's okay. Contact them.

165
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,879
We'll take a look later.

166
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,039
Okay.

167
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,120
Thank you.

168
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,120
Is there anything you want to tell us?

169
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,399
Go ahead.

170
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,840
Mom.

171
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,159
Don't you have something to tell the police?

172
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,480
Hurry up and say it.

173
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,720
You turned on the heater, didn't you?

174
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,210
Dr. Bai.

175
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,090
What are you talking about?

176
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,559
That's someone else's heater.

177
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:52,039
How could my mother-in-law have turned it on?

178
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,759
I turned it on.

179
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:57,720
Officer, she must be confused.

180
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,240
Mom, it's more than 100,000 yuan.

181
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,679
I'm not confused.

182
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,090
I turned it on.

183
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,210
Mom.

184
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,840
Let her finish.

185
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,360
Guo Hua hadn't been feeling well.

186
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:14,120
His room was very cold during winter.

187
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,450
I didn't want him to get cold.

188
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:18,519
So I bought him an electric heater.

189
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:22,120
But he was afraid that there would be electrical problems.

190
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,720
So he didn't dare to turn it on.

191
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,759
But this time,

192
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,600
he was sick.

193
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,330
He was very sick.

194
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,330
I turned on the heater...

195
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,330
without his permission.

196
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:42,919
Then it broke down.

197
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,480
When I noticed it,

198
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,559
the fire couldn't be contained.

199
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:53,360
I got Guo Hua killed.

200
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:55,879
That means the cause of the fire...

201
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:59,159
was due to the inappropriate use of the heater.

202
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:02,120
Yes.

203
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,960
You have to think this through.

204
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,600
You can't bear such a grave responsibility, Mom.

205
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,919
I can't put the blame on him...

206
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,679
just because he's dead.

207
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,519
You've been busy all these years.

208
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,679
It was Guo Hua who kept me company.

209
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,600
I know you don't like him.

210
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,200
He was a jerk when he was young.

211
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,440
But he was...

212
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,120
really good to me.

213
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:35,360
Just because he's gone,

214
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,159
it doesn't mean he has to be my scapegoat.

215
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,960
It's over 100,000 yuan, Mom.

216
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,879
We don't have that much money.

217
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,240
Don't worry.

218
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,000
I'll pay for it myself.

219
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,320
Even if I have to sweep the streets,

220
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,799
I still have to compensate them.

221
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:53,960
- Gosh, Mom. - Ma'am, stay calm.

222
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,039
Don't get so worked up.

223
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:56,879
All right, that's enough.

224
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,360
We've told Mom not to date that Bi Guo Hua.

225
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:08,399
But she just wouldn't listen.

226
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,759
He was a disaster. He would get into trouble anyway.

227
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,759
Things have gotten so serious. What should we do?

228
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,399
All right, that's enough.

229
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,840
What's the use of saying all this now?

230
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:17,480
Why are you mad at me now?

231
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,279
I'm not the one who made a big mess.

232
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,799
A big mess?

233
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,200
How bad can it be?

234
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,399
It's just a few hundred thousand yuan.

235
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:24,399
Can't we just compensate for it?

236
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,080
That's easy for you to say. A few hundred thousand yuan.

237
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,360
Do you have that money? Or do I?

238
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,240
Where are we going to find a few hundred thousand yuan?

239
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,600
Fine, we won't compensate them.

240
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:32,120
Let's wait until they sue my mom.

241
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:37,759
How about this?

242
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,360
We have a car.

243
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,879
Let's sell it first for a few thousand yuan.

244
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,120
We'll come up with the rest later.

245
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:50,240
We finally bought that car...

246
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:52,360
by scrimping and saving.

247
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:54,360
We've only had it for less than two years.

248
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,399
And now, we're selling it.

249
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,240
How are you going to replenish the supplies?

250
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,480
All right, honey.

251
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,080
At worst, I'll use a cart.

252
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:11,159
Didn't we also make it this far when we didn't have a car?

253
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,360
I don't want you to suffer.

254
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,200
Look at what Mom did.

255
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,559
It's our fault for not caring about Mom enough.

256
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,120
We're all to blame.

257
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:25,559
Honey.

258
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:27,159
We have to help Mom...

259
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,200
with the compensation.

260
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,039
I didn't say I won't.

261
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,519
Thank you, honey.

262
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,159
That's because she's our mom.

263
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:44,799
Mom.

264
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,159
I've discussed it with Xiao Ling.

265
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:50,320
We'll pay for the compensation.

266
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,320
Xiao Peng.

267
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,679
Yes, let's do this together.

268
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,480
I can't get you involved.

269
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,279
What are you talking about, Mom?

270
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,559
We're a family.

271
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:06,159
Besides, in the past,

272
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,000
we didn't care enough about you.

273
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,960
We're also at fault.

274
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,480
If anything happens in the future,

275
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,200
let's pull through as a family.

276
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:45,360
Why did you come back?

277
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,279
How could I not?

278
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,279
Look at what happened.

279
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,440
I'm sorry.

280
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,320
It's affecting your work.

281
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,960
That's not the point.

282
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:57,399
Let's listen to the doctor, okay?

283
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:59,279
- I want to be discharged. - Xiao Min.

284
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:02,639
If I stay here,

285
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:05,480
they will only persuade me to terminate my pregnancy.

286
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,200
Hong Wei.

287
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:12,200
I really want this baby.

288
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,279
I want this baby too.

289
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,600
But if I have to put your life on the line,

290
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,320
I won't allow it.

291
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,000
Dr. Xiao, Dr. Tang.

292
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,840
How are you feeling today?

293
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,960
I'm okay.

294
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,480
We found some information in international journals...

295
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:32,399
on pregnant patients with pulmonary lymphangioma.

296
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:34,240
We hope you can read them carefully.

297
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:35,799
Here.

298
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:37,080
Are they all dead?

299
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:40,840
There's one case in which the fetus is dead.

300
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,960
I'm not like them.

301
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:44,039
Xiao Min.

302
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,320
Ever since I was little,

303
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:47,840
I've always been tough.

304
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,559
- I know, but... - I've told you.

305
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,480
When I was little, Dad took me shopping.

306
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,960
Then I got into an accident.

307
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,639
I was hit by a car.

308
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:59,799
The doctor almost announced my time of death.

309
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,200
But I made it through, didn't I?

310
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,840
Even the doctor said I was lucky.

311
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,799
Your past experiences have nothing to do with your illness.

312
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,919
That's right. It has nothing to do with this.

313
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,120
If you can't help me give birth to my baby,

314
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,519
I want to be discharged.

315
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,879
Xiao Min, calm down.

316
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:17,480
- I am calm. - You...

317
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:19,159
You want to be discharged now.

318
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,799
Do you want to give birth at home?

319
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:24,120
What if the umbilical cord wraps around the baby's neck?

320
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:25,679
What about excessive bleeding?

321
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,720
What about respiratory failure?

322
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:31,879
Any of those possibilities will kill you and the baby.

323
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,080
Can you handle this situation?

324
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,039
Can your family handle it for you?

325
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,000
If you go home now, you're not going to give birth.

326
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,639
You'll be killing your child with your own hands, okay?

327
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:48,480
Xiao Min.

328
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:51,159
Let's listen to the doctor.

329
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,519
Okay?

330
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,879
I don't have to leave the hospital.

331
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,480
But I'm keeping the baby.

332
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,079
Doctor.

333
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,759
I'm really sorry.

334
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,799
My wife really wants this baby.

335
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,519
She insists on giving birth.

336
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,480
Is there a specific reason?

337
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,920
I asked her.

338
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,799
She just said she wanted the baby.

339
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,410
She just wanted to be a mom.

340
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,650
But ever since she got pregnant,

341
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:34,759
she has changed.

342
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:36,119
She doesn't listen to anyone.

343
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:37,960
But don't worry.

344
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:40,039
I'll try harder to persuade her.

345
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,440
In her current condition,

346
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,960
she must not be discharged.

347
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,410
She has to stay at the hospital.

348
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,599
Otherwise, if anything happens,

349
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,039
it will be too late to save her.

350
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:50,279
I know.

351
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,799
Thank you.

352
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,039
Thank you.

353
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:04,410
The patient is adamant.

354
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,480
I think you should discharge her.

355
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,559
Give her one last checkup.

356
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:16,359
If there's no other issue,

357
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:18,079
you can discharge her.

358
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,680
So you're saying...

359
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,319
that you'll let the patient fend for herself?

360
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:23,559
As doctors at this hospital,

361
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,119
we've carried out our obligation to inform and persuade her.

362
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:28,170
There's nothing else we can do.

363
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:29,319
Dr. Lu.

364
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:31,839
The patient is in a critical condition.

365
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,920
If we discharge her like this,

366
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:35,480
an accident is very likely to happen.

367
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,240
Xiao Yan.

368
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:40,039
I know you're doing this for the sake of the patient.

369
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:41,039
That's great.

370
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:42,920
But as you know,

371
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:46,240
this patient has already been to all the hospitals in the city.

372
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,410
None of them would document her as their patient.

373
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:52,279
We've already gathered our specialists for a consultation.

374
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,000
No one is willing to take over.

375
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,279
Do you know why?

376
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,279
Because everyone knows...

377
00:18:57,519 --> 00:18:59,240
that a pregnant patient...

378
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:00,799
in the advanced stage of pulmonary lymphangioma...

379
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,599
who insists on delivering her baby...

380
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,000
is a ticking time bomb.

381
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:05,279
She could explode at any time.

382
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:07,720
That's them. We're not them.

383
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,559
We can't ignore the patient.

384
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:14,839
The EICU really can't afford any accidents in this situation.

385
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,680
Yes. An experienced but incompetent doctor...

386
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,119
finally found a lifeline.

387
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:24,720
He surely won't allow a patient to mess up his chance.

388
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,839
I don't care for your sarcasm.

389
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:28,920
I'm doing this for the sake of the Emergency Department.

390
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:30,559
Yes, right.

391
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:33,759
You're doing your best for the EICU.

392
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:35,559
I can understand that.

393
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,480
But Dr. Lu, have you thought about this?

394
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,559
When the patient is at her wit's end and something happens to her,

395
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:44,170
will the media mention...

396
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,559
Tongshan Hospital's Emergency Department...

397
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:47,759
for turning a blind eye?

398
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:49,410
If that happens,

399
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,410
the social influence can be bad.

400
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:54,599
Then your future will be bleak.

401
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:55,920
In her case,

402
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:59,119
she's risking her own life by insisting on her pregnancy.

403
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,680
She's willing to take the risk to have a child.

404
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:03,559
But Tongshan Hospital's EICU can't take the risk.

405
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:06,170
For someone like her who insists on her pregnancy,

406
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,170
it's very likely that something will go wrong.

407
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,920
You could even say it's a 100 percent chance.

408
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,559
If anything happens to her,

409
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:16,079
the hospital is very likely to shut down the EICU.

410
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,039
Let me ask you one thing.

411
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:20,039
If the hospital shuts down the EICU,

412
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,480
what about the other critical patients...

413
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,799
who are waiting to be treated?

414
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:27,799
Dr. Lu does have a point.

415
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,960
Xiao Yan.

416
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:32,240
You're this patient's attending physician.

417
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,359
How are you going to resolve this?

418
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,960
Dr. Lu, I think life can't be measured like that.

419
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:44,650
A person's life and a group of people's lives...

420
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,890
are equally priceless.

421
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,319
So...

422
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,890
I agree with Dr. Bai.

423
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,240
We can't kick out the patient now.

424
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,410
Well said.

425
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,279
If you insist on keeping the patient,

426
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:01,920
you'll have to persuade the other departments...

427
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:03,759
to conduct a joint treatment.

428
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:06,440
This is just the Emergency Department after all.

429
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,759
Dr. Lu, does that mean you've agreed to it?

430
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:15,410
Persuade the patient...

431
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:17,680
or persuade the other departments.

432
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,960
I got it.

433
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:25,799
Let's do our best, everyone.

434
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:32,119
I was quite surprised by how Bai Zhu reacted just now.

435
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:34,890
He has always been a very responsible doctor.

436
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:37,039
You're just too prejudiced against him.

437
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:38,960
That's not prejudice.

438
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:42,319
He's competent and good at his job indeed.

439
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:43,319
I won't deny it.

440
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:45,170
He has a mediocre sense of responsibility.

441
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:47,079
But I don't like...

442
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:49,279
how he looks down on this and that.

443
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,480
It annoys me.

444
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:52,359
Think about it.

445
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:55,319
What if he's a female doctor with this personality?

446
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:56,319
What do you think?

447
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,000
It's kind of cool.

448
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,519
How can you say you're not biased?

449
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:21,359
Hong Wei.

450
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:25,319
Hong Wei.

451
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,559
- Hong Wei! - Xiao Min.

452
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:28,559
Xiao Min.

453
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,400
What's wrong?

454
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,359
Did you have a nightmare?

455
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,839
I dreamed that the baby was gone.

456
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,240
Don't be afraid. I'm right here.

457
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,160
I'm here.

458
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,680
If I don't have this child,

459
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,680
I don't know how to live out the rest of my life.

460
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:55,519
Don't think too much.

461
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:57,400
You still have me...

462
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,279
and your parents.

463
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:02,680
I know you all love me.

464
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,799
But I want to have a child of my own.

465
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:09,319
I want to...

466
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,079
I want to see our baby being born.

467
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,960
I want to see our child grow.

468
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,240
If one day,

469
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,720
I'm no longer around,

470
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,079
our child can keep you company.

471
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:28,079
What are you talking about?

472
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,559
We just want you to be fine.

473
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:34,359
Okay?

474
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,039
I did some research.

475
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,880
With this disease,

476
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,519
I won't be able to live more than 10 years.

477
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,880
I'll die sooner or later.

478
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:04,599
I'm an only child.

479
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,400
I want to leave something behind for my parents.

480
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,559
Xiao Min.

481
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,400
Let me tell you.

482
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:24,279
When you get better,

483
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:27,839
we'll have our own children.

484
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,039
Do you know that?

485
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:35,680
I don't want Mom and Dad...

486
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,799
to see me off first.

487
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,279
I want to give them a child.

488
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,480
And it's best if it's a girl.

489
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:48,160
She'll take care of them for me...

490
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:51,839
to make up for their loss of losing me.

491
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:54,559
It's a continuation of my life.

492
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:02,359
And yours.

493
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,839
I want to have our child.

494
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,960
This little one...

495
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:16,960
is a gift from heaven.

496
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:20,680
It's not something anyone can have.

497
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:23,160
You wish.

498
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,079
By the way, I want our baby...

499
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,160
to take care of you for me...

500
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,640
and keep an eye on you.

501
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,759
I dare you to forget me.

502
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,160
Hong Wei.

503
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,359
Please grant me this wish.

504
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:05,880
All right?

505
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:34,559
Come in.

506
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:37,279
Dr. Jiang.

507
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Dr. Xiao.

508
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,279
Are you also here for that pulmonary lymphangioma patient?

509
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:44,559
Dr. Jiang.

510
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,359
I still think we should keep the patient here.

511
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,160
She really can't go home in that condition.

512
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:52,880
Dr. Bai has told me all about the patient's condition.

513
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,400
It's a tough situation.

514
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,640
Dr. Jiang.

515
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,039
We can't give up on the patient just because it's difficult.

516
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,119
Looking at the current case,

517
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:03,880
we can't guarantee the patient's full recovery.

518
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:06,960
Instead, it's better to respect the patient's wishes.

519
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,640
- But we can... - Come in.

520
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,920
Dr. Jiang.

521
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:11,680
You're both here.

522
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,599
Dr. Lu.

523
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:16,400
They seem to share one mind.

524
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:17,920
It's like they've discussed it.

525
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:20,319
They both came to talk to me about the same patient.

526
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,599
I called you because...

527
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,359
I would like to discuss this together.

528
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,640
My opinion remains the same.

529
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:28,759
Either the patient agrees to terminate the pregnancy...

530
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,599
or they have to persuade the other departments...

531
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:31,799
to do a joint treatment.

532
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:33,680
If both don't work,

533
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,400
I think she should be discharged.

534
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:37,480
What if we can keep the patient's condition stable...

535
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,880
and make sure she gives birth safely?

536
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,519
The patient is at an advanced stage.

537
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:42,079
Her lungs are severely damaged.

538
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:45,480
This is a patient with pulmonary lymphangioma...

539
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:47,160
who was successfully treated abroad.

540
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,039
She safely delivered the baby.

541
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:50,880
Let's take a look.

542
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,640
How did you get this?

543
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:02,359
I was in their hospital for a conference on heart surgery.

544
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:03,559
We've been in touch ever since.

545
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,640
Although Dr. Jiang has agreed to take in this patient,

546
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,119
please keep in mind...

547
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:10,279
that we have to coordinate with the other departments.

548
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,680
They're the key to ensuring the patient's safe pregnancy.

549
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,480
Don't worry. I'll send this report to them later.

550
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,160
Dr. Jiang has agreed to it.

551
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,680
I don't believe that they can still make up excuses.

552
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,279
Dr. Bai.

553
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,000
I thank you on behalf of the patient.

554
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,359
You don't have to thank me.

555
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,240
Come on. Let's tell her about this.

556
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:32,400
- How was it? - Well...

557
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,680
- I didn't see her. - Ma'am, slow down.

558
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:34,839
- Let's take a look here. - Xiao Min.

559
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,839
- What's the matter? - Sun Fang Min is gone.

560
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:38,559
- When did she disappear? - Just now.

561
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,160
She sent us away. Then she was gone when we got back.

562
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:43,799
Where could that child have gone carrying a baby?

563
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,119
Did you look in the restrooms?

564
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:46,440
I did, but I couldn't find her.

565
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,480
We want her to terminate the pregnancy.

566
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,680
Would she...

567
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:52,519
- What should we do? - Let's not waste time.

568
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:53,519
Check the CCTV footage.

569
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:55,319
Okay.

570
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,720
Xiao Min.

571
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,440
It's the balcony on the third floor.

572
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,640
Xiao Min.

573
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:11,799
Xiao Min, what's wrong?

574
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:12,960
- What's wrong? - Don't.

575
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,079
Don't push it out.

576
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,279
She's sitting here. It might hurt her.

577
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,680
- Here. - It's too narrow.

578
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:18,880
Dr. Bai, leave it to me.

579
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,480
Be careful.

580
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:35,759
Xiao Min.

581
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:37,559
Xiao Min.

582
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:39,559
Xiao Min.

583
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,279
Don't worry. Her pulse is stable.

584
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:47,960
Okay.

585
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,640
Xiao Min, what are you doing?

586
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:52,559
Dad.

587
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,359
I want to go home.

588
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,240
I don't want to be in the hospital.

589
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,880
You keep forcing me to get an abortion.

590
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:00,079
Xiao Min.

591
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:02,079
Don't be so stubborn.

592
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:03,920
Mom.

593
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,440
You can feel its heartbeat, right?

594
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,680
My baby is healthy.

595
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,880
Mom, I'm begging you.

596
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,400
Don't make me regret it for the rest of my life.

597
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,119
The hospital has agreed to admit you.

598
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,680
Really?

599
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:21,480
- You're not lying? - It's true.

600
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:23,119
The director agreed.

601
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,839
- That's great. - Thank you.

602
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:27,559
Thank you.

603
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,640
- All right. - Thank you.

604
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,240
Slowly.

605
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,200
My child. Come on.

606
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,119
Let's go. Come on.

607
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,440
Here, hold on to me.

608
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:36,599
Come on.

609
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:43,440
Have a good rest.

610
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,880
How was the checkup?

611
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,519
The baby is healthy.

612
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:52,759
Temporarily hypoxia didn't affect the baby or the patient.

613
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,279
This is a time bomb.

614
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:57,680
Don't make any mistakes.

615
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,039
I didn't expect you to be so agile.

616
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,960
When I was with Doctors Without Borders,

617
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:08,359
it was rougher out there.

618
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,440
We might face all sorts of situations.

619
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,599
So we had to hone our skills.

620
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,119
That included physical fitness.

621
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,759
Did you learn to ride a motorbike there too?

622
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,519
I learned it when I was a kid.

623
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,680
When you were a kid?

624
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,680
How young were you?

625
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,839
Actually, your personality is quite like a boy.

626
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,480
How am I like a boy?

627
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:29,960
You look cool when you ride.

628
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,799
Maybe it's because I'm a Gemini.

629
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,079
That's why you get to see different sides of me.

630
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:36,880
My brother was also a Gemini.

631
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:40,039
Ever since I was little, I thought he was very special.

632
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,000
When I wasn't looking,

633
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,720
he showed a different side of himself.

634
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,519
Sometimes it's a surprise.

635
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,920
Sometimes it's a shock.

636
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,079
But I still wanted to play with him.

637
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,680
So did I surprise or shock you?

638
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,680
Take a guess.

639
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,559
I'll go back and think about it.

640
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:00,920
I'm going to make my rounds.

641
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:14,720
Isn't this too difficult?

642
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:17,519
Dad, don't waste your time getting all sentimental.

643
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:18,880
- Go to bed early. - No...

644
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,160
Who taught you those words?

645
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:25,599
Besides, when did you hear me getting all sentimental?

646
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,079
Dad.

647
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:31,200
Are you going to learn how to ride a motorcycle?

648
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,799
This doesn't suit your character.

649
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
What character?

650
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,240
Hurry and go to bed.

651
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,079
Dad, I know.

652
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,079
You're doing this for Ms. Xiao, aren't you?

653
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:45,720
Do you want to get tickled?

654
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,920
You haven't succeeded in your relationship!

655
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,160
Keep trying, Dad!

656
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:00,119
Dr. Bai, we just received a patient.

657
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,160
Seizure and coma. He's in the EICU.

658
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,519
Dr. Lu wants you to take over.

659
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:04,960
This is the chart and the X-ray.

660
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,920
The X-rays are clean.

661
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:15,359
Gao Ming.

662
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,880
Who is it?

663
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,440
I know this patient.

664
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,039
He was treated in our hospital for gastric cancer.

665
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,680
He's a sketch artist.

666
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,160
He drew a webtoon about his illness.

667
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:29,799
It's a hit on the Internet.

668
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:31,039
There are hard copies.

669
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,640
He said on Weibo that he donated his earnings...

670
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:35,880
to help more children from poor families.

671
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,519
No wonder.

672
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,319
Everyone else was on their phones.

673
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:41,759
But he was always glued to his pen and paper.

674
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:44,519
He was always serious in writing and drawing.

675
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:46,519
Those doctors in the Gastrointestinal Department...

676
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:48,119
have become characters in his webtoon long ago.

677
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,359
I saw on his chart that the surgery was a success.

678
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,119
The operation was successful.

679
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:54,640
It's not just the cancerous tissue,

680
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,559
but all the lymph nodes were also cleaned out.

681
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:58,799
When he was discharged, he told us...

682
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,799
he was going to keep drawing for the rest of his life...

683
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,079
to help more people.

684
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:04,119
We all thought he was cured.

685
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,559
Let's go and check on him.

686
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,679
Dr. Xu.

687
00:34:13,769 --> 00:34:15,159
How are you? Do you feel better?

688
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,769
My head hurts a little.

689
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,809
My hands are shaking and I can't hold the pen.

690
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,289
Is it related to headaches?

691
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,880
I think it has something to do with it.

692
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:24,400
You need to get more rest.

693
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,960
Okay.

694
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:30,769
I thought...

695
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:32,599
I wouldn't come to the hospital anymore.

696
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,329
Let me introduce him.

697
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:36,809
This is your attending physician, Dr. Bai Zhu.

698
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,519
This is Dr. Chen Zhi.

699
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:41,679
Dr. Bai.

700
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:43,039
Dr. Chen.

701
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,199
Hello.

702
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:46,400
Do you think...

703
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,119
I'll be okay this time?

704
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,719
I don't want my parents to worry.

705
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:53,440
Don't worry. We'll do our best.

706
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,360
You'll get better.

707
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,079
Did you forget what you said last time?

708
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,769
No matter what, you must have hope.

709
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:12,960
Last June, Gao Ming underwent gastric cancer treatment.

710
00:35:13,289 --> 00:35:14,599
The aftereffects were obvious.

711
00:35:14,809 --> 00:35:17,159
After the second phase, the ascites were almost gone.

712
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,239
There were no obvious lumps when we did a gastroscopy.

713
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,559
Did it metastasize to his brain?

714
00:35:24,809 --> 00:35:27,559
But Dr. Xu said that the X-ray was clean.

715
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:28,960
We couldn't see anything.

716
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,840
Dr. Bai, do you think...

717
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:34,559
it's the side effect of the medicine?

718
00:35:40,769 --> 00:35:41,880
That makes sense.

719
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,559
How did you come up with that?

720
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:45,809
Even I didn't think of that.

721
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,079
Go on.

722
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,769
Run an MRI on the patient.

723
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:56,960
I'll do it now.

724
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,079
Be nicer to others.

725
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:04,000
Not everyone is like you, Bai Zhu.

726
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,840
If I'm nicer to him,

727
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:08,000
that's being irresponsible to the patients.

728
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:11,079
He had that idea...

729
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,639
in hope that there would be a miracle for the patient.

730
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,769
Isn't that what you've been working toward?

731
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,840
Do you think gastric cancer can just disappear?

732
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,559
Can spinal paraplegia be healed on its own?

733
00:36:26,769 --> 00:36:27,769
That's right.

734
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,480
I believe in miracles.

735
00:36:29,809 --> 00:36:30,960
But I don't believe in them for no reason.

736
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,400
Otherwise, it's just blind optimism.

737
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,960
You know that...

738
00:36:41,809 --> 00:36:42,960
when I was in graduate school,

739
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,960
I was more interested in basic research.

740
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,400
I found out...

741
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,960
I could see the surgical ward from my office.

742
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,559
I would just stand there...

743
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:57,360
and watch those patients get thinner day by day.

744
00:36:58,159 --> 00:36:59,920
They got out of bed less and less often.

745
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:03,159
Until one day, I tried to find a familiar face,

746
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:04,199
but I couldn't find any.

747
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,199
That was when I thought...

748
00:37:10,289 --> 00:37:13,000
I worked with samples and reagents every day.

749
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,079
I watched their lives being taken before my very eyes.

750
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:20,000
I might as well reach out to them...

751
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:21,920
to help them and heal them.

752
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:29,480
It's a simple act of wanting to save lives.

753
00:37:32,809 --> 00:37:35,360
That's because I believe I can give them hope.

754
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,599
But that's only under one condition.

755
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,960
I have to become the best doctor.

756
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,360
You need to be more patient with the young doctors.

757
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:47,079
Weren't we also young once?

758
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,039
That was you.

759
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:51,039
It wasn't me.

760
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:55,000
You're amazing.

761
00:37:55,329 --> 00:37:56,639
You'll die if you don't brag.

762
00:37:58,559 --> 00:37:59,639
I will.

763
00:38:04,769 --> 00:38:06,920
Is Xia Tian here?

764
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:09,079
Hey, kid. This is the EICU.

765
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,119
You can't come in here.

766
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,559
I just want to see Xia Tian.

767
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:14,239
I want to thank him.

768
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,559
Xia Tian?

769
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:17,159
There's no patient named Xia Tian here.

770
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,519
That's Gao Ming's pen name.

771
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,960
Hi. Are you a fan of his?

772
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:24,599
He's my idol.

773
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:26,360
He's also my savior.

774
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:27,679
Ying Ying.

775
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:29,079
Ying Ying.

776
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:31,079
Ying Ying, you scared me.

777
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:32,809
I thought I lost you.

778
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:34,599
Is she here to look for Gao Ming?

779
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:36,920
She saw on the Internet that Gao Ming is in the hospital.

780
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,809
She made a huge fuss at home and insisted on visiting.

781
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,289
It was Gao Ming who raised the money...

782
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,199
so she was able to keep both fingers.

783
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:44,199
The doctor said her nerves were damaged...

784
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,480
and it was hard to recover.

785
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:47,119
But we're already very happy.

786
00:38:47,289 --> 00:38:49,199
No wonder she said he was her savior.

787
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:51,039
Last year,

788
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,840
Ying Ying's hand got caught in the meat grinder by accident.

789
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,769
It wasn't life-threatening at that time.

790
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:57,329
But the surgery fees were too expensive.

791
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,519
We just couldn't afford it.

792
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,289
We even wanted to give up having the surgery.

793
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:04,329
Luckily, Gao Ming was in the hospital then.

794
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,809
After he heard about it,

795
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,519
he drew a webtoon about Ying Ying...

796
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:08,719
and informed the netizens.

797
00:39:08,809 --> 00:39:11,039
He raised enough funds for her surgery within an hour.

798
00:39:11,329 --> 00:39:12,809
Yes, the surgery was a success.

799
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,289
In the past year,

800
00:39:14,289 --> 00:39:16,960
we've managed to pay back the money the netizens raised.

801
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:18,679
If it weren't for Gao Ming,

802
00:39:18,769 --> 00:39:20,559
Ying Ying wouldn't be like this now.

803
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,480
Come on, kid. I'll take you to him.

804
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,960
Okay, let's go.

805
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:31,239
Thank you, Xia Tian.

806
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:34,159
How nice.

807
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:36,719
Are you sick?

808
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:41,519
Xia Tian, hang in there.

809
00:39:41,809 --> 00:39:42,960
My mom said...

810
00:39:43,329 --> 00:39:44,840
good things happen to good people.

811
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,159
You're so kind.

812
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:47,599
Good things will happen to you.

813
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:50,199
It will.

814
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,000
Right. I drew a picture for you.

815
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:04,809
Look.

816
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,079
Although I'm not as good as you,

817
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:08,960
I'm still trying my best.

818
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:11,079
I drew this with my left hand.

819
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,809
This is what you look like.

820
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,199
Xia Tian, your name is just like summer.

821
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,519
This is amazing.

822
00:40:23,809 --> 00:40:24,880
I love it.

823
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,480
Thank you.

824
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:27,880
So, Xia Tian,

825
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,480
you have to do your best and get better.

826
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,440
I want to learn from you.

827
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,719
When I grow up, I want to be a great artist like you.

828
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:38,000
You can do it.

829
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:47,159
- Be careful next time. - Thank you, officer.

830
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:50,519
Okay, let's go.

831
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,329
Don't worry. I'll be there soon.

832
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:00,079
Wait.

833
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,079
- What's wrong? - It's the wrong direction.

834
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,000
- Stop here. - But it's a one-way road.

835
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:07,400
You're supposed to take the road across from here.

836
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,159
Park the bike properly. Please show me your ID.

837
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,079
Excuse me.

838
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,920
Hello?

839
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:16,039
Mr. Wang.

840
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:17,119
I know.

841
00:41:17,329 --> 00:41:18,519
I have something to do.

842
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:20,039
I'll be back as soon as I'm done.

843
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:21,559
I won't let it affect my work.

844
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:22,639
Okay.

845
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,880
Are you done? Please show me your ID.

846
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:26,239
I really didn't...

847
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:28,559
Excuse me.

848
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:31,440
Don't worry. I'll be right back.

849
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:33,119
Give me 2 to 3 minutes.

850
00:41:33,329 --> 00:41:35,329
Okay. Wait for me in front of the house.

851
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,360
All right.

852
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,769
- All right. - Just now, I...

853
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,360
I feel so wronged.

854
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,159
I really didn't want to do this!

855
00:41:45,809 --> 00:41:48,079
I've always been very careful!

856
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,289
But everyone has been rushing me!

857
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,809
I still need to work overtime.

858
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,239
My girlfriend didn't bring her keys.

859
00:41:53,239 --> 00:41:54,480
She asked me to deliver them!

860
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,920
What can I do?

861
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,880
- This is so unfair! - All right. I know, I get it.

862
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,440
- Calm down, okay? - I'm really tired.

863
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:02,639
What's wrong?

864
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,769
Doctor, what's wrong with me?

865
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:09,559
We need to run more tests.

866
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:12,000
Get some rest first.

867
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:14,079
Tang Hua, come with me.

868
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:17,639
Look.

869
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,119
The blood test shows...

870
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,639
a drop in platelet and hemoglobin levels.

871
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,119
The creatinine is slightly higher.

872
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:28,880
I saw the chest CT scan too.

873
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:30,559
There's a small amount of pleural effusion.

874
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:35,679
It's either poison or infection.

875
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:37,639
The patient doesn't have a fever.

876
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,360
His white blood cell count didn't increase either.

877
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:42,000
So it's not an infection.

878
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:45,239
Then where did the blood he threw up come from?

879
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,119
If the heart motility is too high,

880
00:42:47,289 --> 00:42:49,679
a large amount of blood can go into the lungs.

881
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,199
It can also cause hemoptysis.

882
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,920
His lungs are clean.

883
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,769
Because it's going through normal channels.

884
00:42:55,329 --> 00:42:56,559
Let's check his heart.
