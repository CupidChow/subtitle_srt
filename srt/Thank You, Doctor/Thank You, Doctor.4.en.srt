<i>[Episode 4]</i>

16
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,590
Director, I think

17
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,490
the traffic flow is poorly designed here.

18
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:52,430
After many discussions with infrastructure and security teams,

19
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:55,070
this is the final decision to revert it back to a one way lane.

20
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,750
If it's us,

21
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,570
we might follow the sign and go around on the one way lane.

22
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,930
Ordinary cars and normal patients might also go around.

23
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,680
Think about it. If there is an emergency patient in the car,

24
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,590
will they have the time or patience to circle around?

25
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,990
For patients with sudden cardiac arrest or major bleeding,

26
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:18,070
circling once around can mean the difference between life and death.

27
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,220
If there's an emergency patient in the car,

28
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,870
including our ambulance,

29
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,790
they enter through the main door and definitely want to reach the ER as soon as possible.

30
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,910
That's reasonable. Old Lu.

31
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,080
Open this entrance. I'll let them know about it.

32
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,720
Okay.

33
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,160
Is there anywhere else that is uncomfortable?

34
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,340
No.

35
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,460
He knocked his head.

36
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,460
When he was walking on the road, he accidentally slipped and knocked on the road curb.

37
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,700
Do you feel dizzy?

38
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,470
No. It just hurts.

39
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,250
Do you feel nauseous?

40
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,930
No.

41
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,560
You're okay. The wound is not big.

42
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,970
Later I'll help you to bandage it and you'll be okay.

43
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,720
To be safe, go and do a CT scan.

44
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,680
- Okay.
- Okay.

45
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,530
<i>[Emergency]</i>

46
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,950
Doctor, don't tell me I have a concession due to the fall?

47
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,520
No.

48
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,790
- Are you sure you don't feel dizzy, nauseous, and don't have any vomiting signs now?
- No.

49
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:24,180
From the CT scan, there's no obvious damage and bleeding inside the skull.

50
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,220
It's an external injury. He'll be okay after a few days when he fully recovers.

51
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,570
Okay. Thank you.

52
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,400
Then can I leave? The smell in the hospital is really bad.

53
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,010
You can. Tomorrow remember to come and change your medication.

54
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,810
- No!
- You can't come down from the bed.

55
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,590
I tell you, you must be hospitalized.

56
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,820
Doctor, where do I pay the hospitalization fees?

57
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,070
He doesn't need to be hospitalized. His is a small injury. He'll be fine after a few days.

58
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:47,630
An injury on the head is a small one? What if it gets infected?

59
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,310
What if there's bleeding inside the brain?

60
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:53,200
Don't you guys have the EICU? It's reportedly not cheap.

61
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,750
- We'll get him hospitalized to observe it.
- Yes.

62
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,160
We don't care about money. We know the principle of "you get what you pay for".

63
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,150
We have EICU here indeed.

64
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,910
As for the fees, we also charge according to the approved prices from the Administration of Commodity Prices.

65
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,350
We get him hospitalized and pay the fee regardless of the price.

66
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,920
Just now I also said.

67
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,750
There's no need for the patient to be admitted to EICU for his condition.

68
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,260
And all the patients in our EICU are in critical condition. It's not good for his recovery.

69
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,640
Dad, Mom, EICU is for patients in critical condition. I'm not staying there.

70
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,650
What do you know? You should not be careless with the injury on your head.

71
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,270
Didn't the doctor examined it? It's a small external injury.

72
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:28,050
Just listen to your dad. If you have any situation, it's easy to deal with it if you're in the hospital.

73
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,860
- Okay.
- Stay in the hospital.
- It's settled then.

74
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,710
You go and arrange a room for one person in the EICU.

75
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:37,150
We are short of beds in our EICU.

76
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,450
This is how you provide service?

77
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,320
I'm really sorry.

78
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,800
EICU is for us to monitor critically ill patients.

79
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,790
Not everyone is suitable to be admitted into EICU.

80
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:50,010
Okay, okay. You're Xiao Yan, right? I will file a complaint about you now.

81
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:53,280
The District Health Commission will deal with you. The District Health Commission will deal with you.

82
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,910
- I don't believe they won't.
- Director.
- File a complaint about her.

83
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,590
It's okay. I'll handle it.

84
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,650
Calm down, this family member.

85
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,840
What do you do?

86
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,370
I'm the director here. I'm Lu Ping An.

87
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:08,580
You came at the right time. Your Doctor Xiao here simply do not care about the patient's safety.

88
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,080
Sloppy and settle things by brushing them off. She has a big problem with medical ethics.

89
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,580
I'm just about to feedback to the District Health Commision about this problem.

90
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:19,920
Calm down. You just want the patient to be monitored in the EICU for a few days, right?

91
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,280
- Yes.
- Okay, okay. Leave this to me. I'll arrange.

92
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,060
This child's health is the most important, right?

93
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:30,360
This way, please. This is our EICU.

94
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,530
- You've heard about the ICU, right?
- I know about it.

95
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:38,290
There's a big difference between EICU and the traditional ICU.

96
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:42,630
ICU basically admits and treats patients who comes out from the ER.

97
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:46,070
The patients needs a lot of machines for support.

98
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,100
So it's definitely totally enclosed.

99
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,010
EICU, also called the Emergency ICU,

100
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:54,450
basically admits and treats critically ill patients who don't go for surgery.

101
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,940
It combines the ER,

102
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,760
ICU and Emergency Care Unit, playing an integrated role.

103
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,360
So this place basically is half enclosed.

104
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,470
- It looks like the environment here is not bad.
- It's okay.

105
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,250
Quick, handle it. Careful, he might suffocate.

106
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,260
Dad, Mom. You stay here if you want to. I'm not staying here.

107
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,600
Sorry, Doctor.

108
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,280
Dong Dong, slowly.

109
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,550
- Okay, okay, Doctor. Goodbye.
- Slowly.
- Son.

110
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:39,180
Director, the patient in that bed vomits many times a day.

111
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,800
You purposely brought them there, right?

112
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:47,050
I think the Emergency Department is a place that completely exposes human nature.

113
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:50,580
Next time, you'll realize there are all kinds of people here.

114
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,820
So sometimes you don't need to deal with problems head-on.

115
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,330
Change the angle and attack circuitously.

116
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,960
You really worry a lot for our ER.

117
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,430
You also know that it was really not easy to establish the EICU.

118
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:05,310
So I think just don't make any mistakes.

119
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,420
I'll learn more from you.

120
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,160
<i>[Emergency]</i>

121
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,350
- Register me. I came in the morning.
- Register me.

122
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:24,630
Queue here. Don't rush, don't rush. Queue up, queue up. Queue from the back. Don't rush.

123
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:27,700
- Register me, register me.
- Queue up, queue up.

124
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,430
So messy.

125
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,920
Once there are a lot of patients, the triage station is on very high pressure.

126
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,400
Director, I think we cannot do the layout like this.

127
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,410
We should separate the normal emergency and critical emergency patients.

128
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,590
The place is this big. There are so many patients. How do we separate?

129
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:46,770
The triage department separates normal emergency patients and then separate into the different consulting rooms.

130
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:51,000
But some critical emergency patients can't wait for this process.

131
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,760
So I think we should get someone who specially sends them to the ER.

132
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,480
The attending physician will do the emergency treatment.

133
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,690
What do you think?

134
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:02,350
I think what Doctor Xiao said is reasonable.

135
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:08,220
How about this? The process specification that you devised is not yet released.

136
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,510
When it is released, we'll execute according to your process, okay?

137
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,090
Now I'm saying

138
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:16,040
that some patients cannot wait.

139
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,100
Xiao Yan, I understand what you mean.

140
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,920
But this is not a war field hospital. It's not a battlefield as well.

141
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,070
I think that the ER is a battlefield.

142
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,910
One more process will delay by 1 second.

143
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,920
A life might be sacrificed.

144
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:41,780
Director, how about we try Doctor Xiao's way of triaging?

145
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:46,190
We can also find the problems and improve them through the practical operation.

146
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,590
Good ball!

147
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,920
- Next time let's meet for a match. Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

148
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,600
- I'm leaving.
- Bye-bye.

149
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,060
Wait for me, wait for me.

150
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,870
Next time I'll still defend you.

151
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,370
Bye-bye.

152
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,840
<i>[Ambulance]</i>

153
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:20,950
What the patient's situation?

154
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:23,700
The patient is a 21 year-old university student. He suddenly fainted in a basketball match.

155
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,650
We monitored in the ambulance. Heart rate 168. Blood pressure 72/41.

156
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,200
Hold on, turn left.

157
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:33,540
ER Bed 2. Prepare to transfer. 1, 2, 3.

158
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,080
Blood pressure, heart rate?

159
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,430
Blood pressure 72/41. Heart rate 168.

160
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:52,340
- Establish IV access. Pull up the blood pressure by using medication.
- Okay.

161
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,530
- Blood sugar level?
- Blood... Blood...

162
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:58,120
- 5.2.
- We can eliminate low blood sugar. It's also not a problem with the nervous system.

163
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,350
Give me the ECG.

164
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,670
Supraventricular tachycardia*. Administer adenosine triphosphate.
<i>(T/N: irregularly fast or erratic heartbeat)</i>

165
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,270
Wait. Ineffective cardioversion.

166
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,970
Resuscitated from 120, how long has it been?

167
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,870
- More than 1 hour.
- It's not right.

168
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:11,040
Fainting triggered from supraventricular tachycardia, he should wake up after so long.

169
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,930
Blood oxygen level?

170
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:14,820
Under the situation of breathing in oxygen, the saturated blood oxygen level is 85%.

171
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,910
Supraventricular tachycardia will not have such a big impact on breathing.

172
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,460
It's not right that the blood oxygen level is so low.

173
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,860
I'll go and see if he has a history of asthma or a cold recently.

174
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:25,020
Wait. You check his body first. I'll contact the patient's family members to see if he has any other medical history.

175
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,420
Okay.

176
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,440
The physical examination just now revealed absent respiration.

177
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,520
I want to do a CT scan, but I am afraid of a high risk halfway through.

178
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,030
Take them to the Emergency ICU to get checked out. Prepare a bed-side chest radiograph.

179
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,910
Not good!

180
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:43,700
The oxygen levels in their blood have fallen to 68%!

181
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,100
Let's go!

182
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,150
You are so fast to check on the patient.

183
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:50,970
Have you not considered inhalation of a foreign object?

184
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:54,440
What a pity. A college all-star athlete

185
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,860
Looks like he's about to be ruined by treatments.

186
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,840
The chest radiograph shows that there is no aerothorax. The right lung has patchy shadows.

187
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,110
The right lung is completely not working, prepare the bronchoscope.

188
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,550
Okay.

189
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,110
A piece of chewing gum.

190
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:33,660
Something so simple, how did we not think of it?

191
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,580
We took something simple and made it more complicated.

192
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:40,350
Not right. I understand that girl, Tang Hua.

193
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,420
That tomboy is crude and careless.

194
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,810
How was she able to think of something so specific?

195
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:47,650
Doctor Tang had asked me about the patient's situation.

196
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,870
But she also was not sure what the cause was.

197
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,690
Xiao Yan.

198
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,090
It was definitely Xiao Yan that realized the cause.

199
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,910
We are done for. We have been humiliated.

200
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,580
Have we been humiliated?

201
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,360
What brand was the chewing gum?

202
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,070
Why would we care what brand it is? Aren't they all the same?

203
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:09,980
Then are you in charge of Tang Hua or Xiao Yan?

204
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,730
Blood pressure and heart beat are stabilized.

205
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,460
Once an operation room is ready we will help you begin the surgery.

206
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:28,860
If she feels thirsty, dab a cotton swab in water and wipe it on her lips.

207
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,940
Doctor Xiao, that college student was discharged.

208
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:41,520
It was too bad, it would have been better if he could have stayed a few more days.

209
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:49,170
Originally it was foreign object inhalation, once the object was out, he was fine, and there was no need to stay at the hospital.

210
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,130
It's not enough.

211
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,280
If he could be here, it would remind those arrogant people

212
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,860
that their shame is still engraved here.

213
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,800
This way of thinking is problematic.

214
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,670
Doctor Xiao, how are you so amazing?

215
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,850
You were able to tell immediately that he had inhaled a foreign object.

216
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:09,300
If you had time to go look in the trash cans at a gym and count how many pieces of gum there were

217
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,550
you would also have known.

218
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:16,360
Right, chewing gum and playing basketball. how handsome is that?

219
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:20,350
Doesn't that Bai Shu self-proclaim himself to be smart?

220
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,510
This time he was stupid.

221
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:26,210
If you only pay attention to the patient's condition and the quota, I can't even imagine it.

222
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:30,340
If you try to pay attention to what kind of person the patient it, it becomes simple.

223
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,470
Doctor Xiao, you really are amazing.

224
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:35,980
Go on. Only you would say that.

225
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,510
Once you have it organized, you can give it to me tomorrow.

226
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:43,330
-Okay, Director.
-Okay. Go on.

227
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,730
Director!

228
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,760
Why are you only just leaving? Are you not the day shift?

229
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,780
I have a patient who just started surgery. I got held up.

230
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,190
Why are you also still here?

231
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:58,740
The standard procedure that Xiao Yan drafted was distributed today in the hospital. I studied it.

232
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,010
Director, today I helped Doctor Xiao settle a conflict.

233
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:05,030
I had good intentions. Are you mad?

234
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:09,820
What are you talking about? How can I be made about that? Am I that narrow-minded?

235
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:14,990
Not to mention, The Dean is always emphasizing "live and learn".

236
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,640
Doctor Xiao, her words are blunt

237
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,260
but I was thinking, she returned from out of the country.

238
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,400
The ways of expression around the world are different than how we express things.

239
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,960
You speak the truth. Today I didn't really lose face

240
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,940
because Xiao Yan spoke out towards me in public.

241
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:32,410
She had an opinion on the situation, and she also has foreign experience that I can learn from.

242
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:36,790
I think that was a good thing. I read her standard procedure thoroughly.

243
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:40,010
No need to bring it up. It was written very well.

244
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,140
After I read it

245
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,150
my heart was feeling a bit uncomfortable.

246
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:51,170
Doctor Xiao was hired by The Dean. I don't know if she will be here long.

247
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,240
I was not uncomfortable because of that.

248
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,550
Even if she is here for a long time, because of her insight and abilities

249
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:00,380
people will despise our low status.

250
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,890
I am uncomfortable towards myself.

251
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:06,650
I have been at this hospital for over twenty years already.

252
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:10,650
In terms of professional capability, we don't have any amazing future to work towards.

253
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,990
I thought, if we could run our ER

254
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:18,020
and EICU smoothly, and not cause any issues

255
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,090
I would feel secure in my heart.

256
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,810
With a director so patient, attentive

257
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:27,860
and responsible, nothing bad will happen.

258
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,690
Okay.

259
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:35,090
It's so late. How about we find somewhere to have a meal.

260
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:37,340
Probably not. I need to get home to my family.

261
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:41,350
Right, your nanny has already left. You better head back home to take care of Xian Yun.

262
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,670
-I'm leaving. Bye.
-Okay.

263
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:53,640
<i>[Emergency]</i>
-Old Bai, come eat some BBQ, there's a place with grilled kidneys that's not too bad.
-I can't.

264
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,830
Are you going to go home and make your own food?

265
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:59,280
Tell that little one in your house to come. I'll call him.

266
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,220
Don't call him. He will learn badly from you.

267
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,430
What's wrong? Do you not like BBQ? We can eat western food.

268
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:09,010
I just don't like you. Whether it's Chinese BBQ, Western hamburgers, go by yourself.

269
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,210
You're the only oen with taste? You're unhappy because you got beaten?

270
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:15,040
What is it? The last case of meningitis, didn't you win that game?

271
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,060
You lost this time, but now your score is only 1-1.

272
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,310
What are you saying? I don't understand.

273
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,790
You are pretending. You continue to pretend.

274
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,300
Okay. Go eat. I'm leaving.

275
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,190
Would you believe me if I said he definitely goes home and vents his anger through video games.

276
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,330
-Punch!
-How childish.

277
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:42,030
Stay to one side. Is your homework done?

278
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:45,660
How was it at the emergency department?

279
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,700
You have been talking to Uncle Xu Yi Ran, am I right?

280
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,140
I have to keep track of your performance at the hospital

281
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:56,360
in case you one day are feeling so sad that you want to die.

282
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,560
I would become an orphan.

283
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,530
Come. Sit.

284
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:10,730
Then shouldn't I also keep tabs on your performance at school?

285
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:14,890
Today your teacher called me saying your grades dropped.

286
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,800
-You can continue to vent now, I won't bother you.
-Come back.

287
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,350
It's time for me to bother you.

288
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:26,160
Look at your dad. When I was going to school back then, I always ranked number one.

289
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,340
How are you nothing like me?

290
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:32,270
Uncle Xu said, that time was because you were cowardly and incompetent

291
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:35,970
you needed to rely on studying to win the attention of your teachers and classmates.

292
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,660
He also said you studied until 3 or 4 am every day.

293
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,900
That Xu Yi Ran. I tell you

294
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,830
don't ever talk to him again.

295
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:49,000
Besides Auntie Zheng, Uncle Xu Yi Ran is your only friend.

296
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,410
If I don't help you keep up your relationship, you really will be alone.

297
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:55,070
I don't need you to worry about me.

298
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:59,610
Also, you just made me remember. Next time you have a test, if you don't test well

299
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,940
be careful, I will put you in order.

300
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,510
Dad.

301
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,740
I feel like this is only to test you. Once you aren't sad at all

302
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,320
soon or later you will be put back in the cardiac surgery department. Fighting!

303
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,470
In which eye do you see that I'm sad?

304
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:23,030
Okay, quick, go study.

305
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,560
-Patient situation!
-The patient is eight years old, we has always lost consciousness.

306
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,780
Blood pressure is at 70 40. The patient has Uremia.

307
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:55,070
-Doctor, the child has always been on dialysis.
-Are you the patient's family?

308
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,690
-I am his dad.
-I am his aunt.

309
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:59,260
The patient's family needs to wait out here for a moment.

310
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:12,330
I am considering a coma caused by renal encephalopathy. Do a routine blood test and biochemistry analysis.

311
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,990
-Ventricular fibrillation. Preparing defibrillation.
-Okay.

312
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,580
<i>[Emergency]</i>

313
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,730
He woke up.

314
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:36,020
Dad. Auntie.

315
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:39,980
Don't worry. I'm fine.

316
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:46,750
You're okay. That's great. But Dad was scared to death.

317
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,490
I knew our Ming Ming would be okay.

318
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:55,100
As soon as you're feeling better, Auntie will bring you to the playground.

319
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,100
Doctor, how are things looking?

320
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:05,710
The patient's situation has worsened. We have to transfer her to the EICU to do dialysis.

321
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,440
Prepare hemodialysis for her.

322
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,830
Dad. I don't want to do dialysis.

323
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:15,470
Young one, you need to do dialysis to treat your illness.

324
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:20,280
Also your dad said that you have done dialysis before, right?

325
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,240
I believe you can be brave, okay?

326
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,350
Auntie Doctor, I'm not afraid of pain.

327
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,780
Dialysis is very expensive

328
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:33,400
staying in that hospital ward is also very expensive.

329
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,760
I don't want to make my Dad spend lots of money again.

330
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,690
Baby, be good.

331
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:55,720
Listen to what Auntie Doctor is saying. Do the dialysis.

332
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:01,640
Dad has money. As long as it can help Ming Ming to be cured

333
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,220
Dad has money.

334
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,370
Dad.

335
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,820
Be good.

336
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:20,470
How is the recovery of the burn patient in Bed 3 going?

337
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:23,790
The wound has healed well. Doctor Xu has already decreased their dosage.

338
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:26,260
We need to keep watch on his body temperature.

339
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:30,480
Because this stage has the greatest risk for infection.

340
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:42,810
What are you doing? Go drink some water.

341
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,990
Come.

342
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,940
Have a cup of water.

343
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:01,660
Dr. Bai is proud.

344
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,050
But we admit that he is skillful and capable.

345
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:08,880
Besides, our EICU needs talented doctors.

346
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,370
If he is willing to stay, he will be a great help.

347
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:14,810
Being capable is not enough.

348
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,890
His character doesn't fit.

349
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:19,360
He may cause more harm with his capability.

350
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,380
Have you forgotten his incident in the cardiac surgery department?

351
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,980
Because he was too young then.

352
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:29,540
Once you tame a wild horse, you get a pedigreed horse.

353
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:33,980
Dean Jiang placed him in ER because he trusts you to use his talent.

354
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,510
Do you believe that I can tame him?

355
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,760
I do.

356
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,250
Look. It is good that

357
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:46,330
you applied an EICU room from the hospital

358
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:48,770
It is very good.

359
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:51,610
I just learn from Dr. Xiao's experience.

360
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,170
Didn't she say that

361
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:57,330
EICU provides emergency care for serious patients

362
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,520
Patients' will to live

363
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,010
may influence their recovery.

364
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,960
Patients' family can assist us

365
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,350
to heal our patients.

366
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:13,420
I give you a thumb up for your willingness to change.

367
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:17,890
Thank Head Nurse Jiang's support and understanding.

368
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:37,470
Your twenty-six year old brain doesn't move fast enough. Just don't mess around in the emergency room.

369
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:40,030
You should apply for Department of endocrinology and nobody will rush you.

370
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:43,450
-Stop giving me trouble here.
-What does the emergency department do?

371
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:46,030
The emergency medicine is like mastering making life-and-death decisions.

372
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:49,210
When you enter the emergency room, what you face isn't patients, you face the god of death.

373
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:52,100
You have to decide in which direction the god of death will extend its hand.

374
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,770
Stop him, and you save the patient.

375
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:58,160
Here you need to see better than an eagle, and run faster than a dog. The most important is that you are cool-headed and have quick thinking.

376
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,980
The patient is dying, the family is jumpy. If anyone panics, you can't panic.

377
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,850
If the patient hasn't started to tremble, and you are first to tremble, how will others believe in you.

378
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,960
You are bothering me. Are you finished?

379
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,700
As Director was doing his rounds, he asked this guy for a patient's situation.

380
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,290
It was just an anterior myocardial infarction. Can't you just answer directly?

381
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:14,900
Our Dr. Chen actually analyzed the medical condition to come up with seven possibilities.

382
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,770
Great, by the time you've verified them one by one, the grass on the patient's grave will be half a meter high.

383
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:21,780
Teacher Xu is right. i should learn well.

384
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,020
What is the point to learn?

385
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:27,630
Look at Director Lu and Dr. Xu's level.

386
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:30,050
And Dr. Xiao.

387
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:33,510
ER is a place for some people to slack off.

388
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:36,650
Once they stay for 10 or 20 years, they become a deputy director or attending physician.

389
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,490
It is not a problem at all.

390
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,820
Give me a sip.

391
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,250
Can you have a good hygiene? Drink with your own cup.

392
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,420
Educate him for me.

393
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:48,500
Teacher Bai, what areas should I improve?

394
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,320
Nothing. You are perfect.

395
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:55,830
You can diagnose meningococcal meningitis as a common diarrhea.

396
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:58,800
Your level in the future will be about the same as Director Lu.

397
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,420
Listen to me.

398
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,650
Don't think too much. Just fool around.

399
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:05,550
Go on trolling the bell as long as one is a monk.

400
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:08,900
Don't keep talking until your words hurt people. You are also in the emergency department now.

401
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,680
Don't be so fierce that you'll even chop yourself down.

402
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:14,430
This is the reality. If you don't like my words,

403
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,420
that only explains one thing,

404
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,640
you are incapable.

405
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:27,830
Abilities are accumulated little by little.

406
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,700
Good. This looks like my students.

407
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:36,060
Teacher Xu, I am out to test patients' blood sugar.

408
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:39,760
Wait. If you have questions, don't come to us.

409
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,210
Go to Head Nurse.

410
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:45,840
She saw and saved the most patients in the ER.

411
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,890
You are still a doctor who knows theories well but lack of practices.

412
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:54,230
Remember.  Sweet talk with her and she will teach you everything.

413
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:57,350
Teacher Bai, thank you.

414
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,610
So rare.

415
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:05,450
What a rare occurrence in a hundred years that you're not trying to annoy people.

416
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:07,870
Is it scary for you to have contact with normal people?

417
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:09,510
It's not scary.

418
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:12,670
I'm just tired, especially when I'm with you.

419
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,170
Do you think I'm not tired?

420
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:17,010
I'm tired of looking at your playacting every day.

421
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:29,590
- Maintain this set of micropumps overnight.
- Okay.

422
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:33,630
Doctor, is there any problem?

423
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,770
Her condition isn't good.

424
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:40,070
It's not easy for her to have persisted to now.

425
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,800
Yeah.

426
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,530
Our local doctor also said that

427
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:48,770
it's already a miracle that the child has survived to now.

428
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:53,360
Her mother died early on.

429
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,500
I've been busy.

430
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:00,310
When Mingming was five or six years old, she already knew to help with household work.

431
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:04,010
Washing clothes, cooking... she learned everything.

432
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:08,780
Even our neighbors said that they've never seen such a mature kid.

433
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:16,610
- Pay attention to her vital signs. Call me if there is anything unusual.
- Okay.

434
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:18,850
Thank you, doctor.

435
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,050
- Doctor.
- Why are you still here? Didn't I tell you to get stitched?

436
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:31,070
We're waiting for our boss to pay for the fees.

437
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:33,800
Neither of us has any money.

438
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:36,970
Doctor, I still feel

439
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:39,560
- a little bad.
- Feel bad?

440
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,520
What's the matter? Where do you hurt?

441
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,360
It doesn't hurt. I just feel...

442
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,980
I don't know how to say it. I just feel strange, a little uncomfortable.

443
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,830
He probably got a shock.

444
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,860
It's nothing big.

445
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,050
Let's do this. Sit here for a while first.

446
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:59,950
After you've stitiched up, tell me if you still feel bad.

447
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:02,380
Go back and rest. Lie on the side.

448
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:05,320
- What's the matter?
- He got hit by a car.

449
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:09,860
Let me check you a little. Lean back.

450
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,810
How do you feel now?

451
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:23,330
I don't know how to say it.

452
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:27,680
After an auto accident, it can be as short as a few hours or as long as a week for observation.

453
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,430
If you have any symptoms, you just tell us.

454
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:32,910
Thank you, doctor. I also...

455
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,610
He's really okay.

456
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:37,890
We've seen plenty of these little bumping type of injury.

457
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:39,970
This doctor already checked him.

458
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:42,510
- I think he's just got a shock.
- Let me examine you again.

459
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,430
There's no need to check.

460
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:47,210
He's already checked. There's really nothing.

461
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:51,050
You're not the patient. How can you decide for the patient?

462
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:52,860
But I know about what happened.

463
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,060
When he had the accident, I was next to him.

464
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,870
That truck was backing up

465
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:59,370
and didn't see him. So it scraped him a little.

466
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:03,100
It looked scary, but it's nothing serious.

467
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,400
Isn't that right, Old Zhang?

468
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,950
Wait.

469
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:12,210
What's this blood?

470
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:14,410
Where's the blood?

471
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:17,430
This...This must be from the mouth.

472
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:27,090
Give the patient another blood test. Schedule CT and MRI.

473
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:32,040
- We cannot completely rule out the possibility of intracranial hemorrhage right now.
- Intracranial hemorrhage?

474
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,270
Fractures of the base of the skull due to traumatic brain injury are often accompanied by otorrhea.

475
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:37,640
.The discharge from the ear may be bloody fluid.

476
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,550
Doctor, I'm actually okay.

477
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,260
- I can't bother you...
- Don't move yet.

478
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,470
Do you feel nauseated and want to vomit?

479
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:48,000
- Lie down, lie down.
- Hurry and lie down.

480
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,770
Where are you going? Why don't you hurry up to pay the fees?

481
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:53,590
- I really don't have money.
- When will your boss get here?

482
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,890
Director, the patient was in a work-related accident.

483
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:58,110
Their boss is on the way over here.

484
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:00,560
The intracranial hemorrhage is likely to deteriorate rapidly.

485
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,870
He must be examined immediately.

486
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,090
Open up the Green Channel.

487
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:10,770
Thank you for being there. It's also good that he didn't get stitched up for quite a while.

488
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,940
If he was discharged early...

489
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,330
It's good that his condition was not impacted.

490
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:19,240
I heard, because of moving the lanes in front of the entrance,

491
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:23,420
Madam Lu is not doing well in front of the Dean. You shouldn't worry too much.

492
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:27,310
EICU is newly establsihed. It takes time for all the departments to come together.

493
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,430
It's not easy for Madam Lu, either.

494
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,280
I understand.

495
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,620
I used to always try to save several seriously injured patients simultaneously.

496
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,010
I'm used to the stress and can't change my habit of rushing people.

497
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:39,120
The CT result of that auto accident paitent has come out.

498
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,020
- There's massive intracranial hemorrhage, and the patient is showing impaired consciousness.
- Prepare for craniotomy.

499
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,030
- You'll do the surgery yourself?
- There's no time to wait.

500
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:47,080
Xiao Yan!

501
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,460
Thank you for saving my patient.

502
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:57,030
The intracranial pressure is normal.

503
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:00,060
The blood clot has been expelled. Prepare for closure.

504
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:14,710
What? She removed a hidden risk that you forgot,

505
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,690
so she is your idol now?

506
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:18,850
So you've heard?

507
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:20,820
Do I need to hear about it?

508
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:24,830
This is the first time that the EICU opens up the Green Channel.

509
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:27,190
- Everyone knows.
- You're so weird.

510
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:29,030
But seriously,

511
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,880
Xiao Yan is a medical doctor with a kind heart.

512
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,600
Does she know that you are praising her?

513
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,460
That patient was already finished with his exam.

514
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,880
She voluntarily came over to ask more questions.

515
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,920
That's how the bleeding in the ear channel was discovered.

516
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:46,040
The foreman who accompanied him originally tried to prevent further exams, but even he panicked.

517
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,910
Director didn't hesitate and opened the Green Channel.

518
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:51,520
- It's because I wasn't there.
- So what if you were there?

519
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,250
Eevn if you were there, you might not have noticed the problem.

520
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:57,080
Xiao Yan has made me realized that, sometimes,

521
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,090
emergency isn't necessarily when someone is wheeled in front of you with bleeding and visible injuries.

522
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:04,840
You have to really care about each patient in order to discover the critically ill.

523
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,880
Not eating anymore?

524
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,550
I feel nauseated listening to you, can't eat anymore.

525
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:15,090
Be more open-minded. It won't hurt you to admit someone else is good.

526
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:23,950
Dr. Xiao, this is Yu Mingming's medical history and matching information.

527
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:26,320
The local hospital there sent it over.

528
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:30,710
Yu Mingming is so pitiful.

529
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:34,040
She is such a good child. How could she get afflicted with this illness?

530
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,900
Yu Jianguo is also miserable.

531
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:41,120
Mingming's mother died when the child was very young.

532
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,560
The father and daughter are left to depend on each other to survive.

533
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:47,430
Yu Jianguo sells vegetables in the market

534
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:50,320
to raise the child through hardship.

535
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,480
Who could have imagined that she would get such an illness.

536
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,560
To get treatments for the child, Yu Jianguo

537
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,090
has even sold the house.

538
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:01,160
It's really bad luck.

539
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,900
How do you know so much?

540
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,610
I heard from others.

541
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,810
Is there a problem?

542
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:18,870
Yu Jian Guo didn't bring Ming Ming in for dialysis,

543
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:21,350
or give do a matching test for the kidney transplant.

544
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,490
Really? For a kidney transplant,

545
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:27,530
- relatives are the best match for a greater chance of success.
- That's what the chart says.

546
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,450
Maybe it's wrong?

547
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:32,410
Think about it. Yu Jian Guo didn't do the test to see if he is a match,

548
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:34,440
didn't bring Ming Ming to do dialysis,

549
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,780
and is just waiting for another kidney. It doesn't make any sense.

550
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,600
He might have his reasons.

551
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:47,370
- Another mouthful.
- I'm full, you have it father.

552
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:51,820
Your aunt made this for you, not for me.

553
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:57,530
Father, don't force Aunt to make congee for me.

554
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:00,860
I'll eat whatever you have.

555
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:03,100
Ming Ming, you are ill.

556
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:06,520
This congee is good for you.

557
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:11,980
- Open up.
- You must be tired looking after me, you need to eat well as well.

558
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:16,030
- You really won't listen to me?
- If you don't have any, I won't have any.

559
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,570
Ok, ok.

560
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:24,890
Ming Ming you have this, I'll have that.

561
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,340
Be careful, it's hot.

562
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,680
Let's both have some?

563
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:58,920
Ming Ming, I've got to talk to the doctor.

564
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,100
You eat your congee.

565
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:20,380
We looked over Ming Ming's medical history.

566
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:23,030
You didn't take her for dialysis.

567
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:25,590
It's my fault.

568
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,630
Dialysis is too expensive.

569
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:30,430
And you are supposed to go three times a week.

570
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:33,550
Sometimes I see that Ming Ming is doing ok and I think

571
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:36,020
it won't matter if we miss one or two appointments.

572
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:39,070
That's not how it works.

573
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:41,990
Let me explain it to you. If she doesn't come for dialysis

574
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,940
she can't get rid of the toxins in her body.

575
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:49,700
The build up of toxins will harm her other organs.

576
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:54,800
Then...then you can just give her a transplant, that will work won't it?

577
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:00,190
It's too late.

578
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:04,960
Ming Ming has already suffered irreversible injuries to her organs.

579
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,420
She can't receive a transplant.

580
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,710
Too late?

581
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,290
How could it be too late?

582
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:16,130
Our local doctor already told us, as long as we found her a match

583
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:18,230
she would get better.

584
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,790
I've done by best to earn the money to come here

585
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:27,150
and get her a transplant. How could it be too late?

586
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,040
Were you having me on?

587
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,250
You were.

588
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,280
What have you been doing all this time?

589
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:43,190
It was your decision not to see if you were a match. Now it's too late.

590
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:50,290
That's my business, it has nothing to do with you.

591
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:54,390
What's wrong with him?

592
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:07,600
- Why didn't you eat anything?
- I was waiting for you.

593
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,070
Alright, let's eat together.

594
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:14,520
- Father.
- What?
- What did the doctor say?

595
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:21,380
She said...I needed to look after you.

596
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,050
Why is it so slow?

597
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:49,710
Can't you be any faster? I'm dying here.

598
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:52,360
What's wrong?

599
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,780
Sorry, I can't hear you.

600
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:56,360
What's wrong with you?

601
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,580
Oh...I have a fever.
- Go over there and take your temperature.

602
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,390
Where do I go?

603
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:05,530
Over there! If you can't hear what she is saying, you should have brought someone else with you!

604
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:08,050
- Just over there.
- Ok.

605
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,240
Nurse, my son has a stomachache.

606
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,230
- Go over there and measure his blood pressure.
- Thank you.

607
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:17,820
How slow can you be? I've been waiting for ages already!

608
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:21,590
- Auntie, calm down please...
- Auntie? Who are you calling auntie?

609
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:24,860
- The queue is...
- Who are you calling auntie?
- Madam!

610
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:27,680
I know there's a long queue. Please wait for your turn.

611
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,470
How can you make ill people wait like this?

612
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:32,180
Help me out right now, or don't think about helping anyone else.

613
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,260
- What's wrong? - Dr Bai.

614
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,080
This lady thinks her head is hurting so much she can cut the queue.

615
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,490
You are a doctor? Can you tell me what's wrong with me?

616
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,090
Sir, what's wrong?

617
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:51,710
My stomach hurts, and I think I'm getting palpitations.

618
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,880
Come here, I'll take you for an examination.

619
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,760
Hey! I was in front of him!

620
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,050
You seem to have a lot of energy.

621
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:59,660
I think you'll be fine.

622
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,150
Grandma, why don't you go back to the queue.

623
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:05,680
- Grandma? Grandma? Why aren't you helping me?
- What's wrong?

624
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,780
What's wrong with me? You need to atttend to me first.

625
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:12,750
Lin Zhi, take a video and then call the police.

626
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:16,190
- Ok.
- You think that will scare me? How can a doctor not attend to his patients?

627
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,720
Keep filming.

628
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,950
Wait! Do you know how expensive that phone is?

629
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:22,480
Are you sure you want to try it?

630
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:28,380
- My head. Oh, my head.
- Let's go.

631
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,190
Bend your knees.

632
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:45,260
- I'm going to press down on your stomach. Tell me if it hurts.
- Ok.

633
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:56,770
- It hurts here does it?
- Yes.

634
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:58,780
Turn over onto your side. Slowly.

635
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:01,420
This is a great start.

636
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:05,310
As long as it's not a one-off.

637
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:07,310
Have you been injured recently?

638
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:09,960
Yesterday a bike ran into me.

639
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:13,970
The handlebar hit my stomach.

640
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,720
I see. Lay there for now.

641
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:31,960
Hello? Chen Zhi. Can you come over here? We need to do a CT scan.

642
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:37,750
Did the sun rise in the West? You were actually willing to take on a patient.

643
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:41,430
It might be a ruptured spleen.

644
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:43,220
That bad?

645
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:01,880
Dr Bai, here are the results.

646
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:08,130
So it is a ruptured spleen. He only has 6 grams of hemoglobin left.

647
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:11,930
He needs a blood transfusion. Send him to the EICU and get the hepatobiliary department to look at him.

648
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:13,300
Got it.

649
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:21,080
If you ask me, you really are lucky.

650
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:25,410
If you hadn't met Dr Bai, the situation could have been a lot worse.

651
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:29,360
Thank...thank you, Dr Bai.

652
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:34,190
Rest up. We've been in contact with your family, they will be here soon.

653
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:42,500
Dr Bai,

654
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,410
how did you know

655
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:47,720
that patient was different to the others?

656
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,750
- You really want to know?
- Yes.

657
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:52,010
I can't be bothered to explain.

658
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,930
Go back and read through all your textbooks.

659
00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:01,680
Next time tell me how to spot a seriously ill patient.

660
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,860
Ok, I will read up on it.
