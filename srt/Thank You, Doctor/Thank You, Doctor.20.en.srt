If you see a problem from a dialectical point of view,

5
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,079
there are two sides to everything.

6
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,519
Don't worry about right and wrong.

7
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,439
Especially for us doctors.

8
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:45,879
You just got to hold on to the bottom line.

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,599
To save lives.

10
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,719
That's right.

11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,680
It's easier said...

12
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:53,799
than done.

13
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:56,640
It even takes a lifetime of effort.

14
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,200
Maybe in the end,

15
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,079
we'll finally understand...

16
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,120

18
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,719
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

19
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,370
I know what to do now.

20
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,120
All the doubts and uncertainties...

21
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:24,719
are meaningless.

22
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,479
All we can do...

23
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,039
is try our best...

25
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,680
How long has he been unconscious?

26
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,360
Eight years.

27
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,400
Are you his family?

28
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:54,840
I'm his wife.

29
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:56,439
Stop the bleeding first.

Doctor.

31
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,759
My husband...

32
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:01,479
His condition is stable for now.

33
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:03,400
As for further details, we need to run some tests on him.

34
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,759
Let's go and stop the bleeding first.

35
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,560
Contact the CT room.

36
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,599
Okay.

37
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,120
There's bleeding in the abdomen.

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Spleen rupture.

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
There's a lot of bleeding.

40
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,360
Contact General Surgery.

41
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:24,439
Prepare for a splenectomy.

42
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,479
Okay.

43

Ms. Jiang.

44
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:38,719
Sir.

45
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,159
Why are you back?

46
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,439
Starting today,

47
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,080
I'm officially back at work.

48
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,680
Then...

49
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,280
What about Xian Yun?

50
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,360
It's all thanks to Xiao Guang.

51
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:52,120
Now, he's busy doing his instructional videos every day.

52
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,479
He has no time for me.

53
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:55,360
I have no presence at home at all,

54
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,000
so I can only come back to work.

55
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,159
Well...

56
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,759
Will that do?

57
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,759
Mr. Pan takes better care of him than I do.

58
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,080
Okay.

59
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,039
I didn't expect you to come back to work so soon...

60
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,639
as you have to take care of Xian Yun at home.

61
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,000
Since you're back now,

62
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,360
work hard then.

63
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,759
If you have any problems at home,

64
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,080
just let me know.

65
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:16,000
Don't worry, sir.

66
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,839
Xian Yun is in good condition now.

67
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,079
Ms. Jiang.

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,519
Welcome back.

69
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:26,079
- Did you miss me? - I missed you so much.

70
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,480
Doctor.

71
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,240
Will he be okay?

72
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,560
The surgery went well.

73
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,759
His life isn't in danger for now.

74
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,279
When can he be discharged?

75
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,319
It's hard to say.

76
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,079
It depends on the patient's recovery.

77
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,079
Spleen rupture is complicated.

78
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,170
I suggest...

79
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,199
he stay in the hospital for further observation.

80
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,639
Xiao Wen, how's your head?

81
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,439
Is it serious? Have you had a checkup?

82
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,079
I'm fine, Jian Guang.

83
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:57,800
I accidentally bumped my head.

84
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,959
There's some blood on my forehead.

85
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,199
How can you be so careless?

86
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,319
What if it leaves a scar?

87
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,680
Doctor.

88
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,120
Is there any test she needs to take?

89
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,120
I'll pay the bill.

90
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,360
Jian Guang.

91
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,240
I'm really fine.

92
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,000
Don't worry.

93
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,480
We've checked everything.

94
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,759
There's nothing wrong.

95
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,730
That's good then.

96
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:19,519
If anything unusual happens to the patient,

97
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,560
come to us again.

98
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,879
Okay.

99
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:30,720
Why did you fall off the bed all of a sudden?

100
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,480
The nurse and I wanted to change his sheets.

101
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,319
I was thinking about us...

102
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,120
and I fell all of a sudden.

103
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:46,120
This patient is in a vegetative state.

104
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,319
You should be more careful.

105
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,800
What are you looking at?

106
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:55,439
Don't you think this scene is kind of weird?

107
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,439
The husband on the bed has been in a coma for eight years...

108
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,480
and something is going on...

109
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,480
between his wife and another man...

110
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,519
next to his bed.

111
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,720
It's terrifying to think about it.

112
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,000
They say that no filial son can survive a long illness.

113
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,199
I think we should add another saying in the future.

114
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,639
There's no husband and wife when you're sick for a long time.

115
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:13,240
After all,

116
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,399
he was in a vegetative state for eight years.

117
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,519
Who would be able to stand it?

118
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,240
However,

119
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,079
it's also possible that this man is a relative of the wife.

120
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,319
For example, her brother.

121
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:22,319
Her brother?

122
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:23,639
It's obvious that they're a couple.

123
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:26,120
You two must have a lot of time on your hands.

124
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:29,240
How can it be a relative?

125
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,279
Right?

126
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,000
You're right.

127
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,079
That's fine.

128
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,120
- Okay then. - What about this?

129
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,079
Dr. Xu, the patient in Bed Number 5 is awake.

130
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:51,879
How is he opening his eyes? They're closed.

131
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:53,199
I really saw him open his eyes just now.

132
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,439
I even put my hand in front of him.

133
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:55,519
He woke up?

134
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:56,600
- I just saw it. - He has no response...

135
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,600
to external stimuli.

136
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,480
- He must have been mistaken. - Dr. Xu, I saw it with my own eyes.

137
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,680
When I waved at him...

138
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,000
I think you saw it wrong.

139
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,000
Dr. Xu.

140
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,279
Even if he opened his eyes,

141
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,879
he could be unconscious.

142
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:09,920
It doesn't mean he's awake.

143
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,839
Sir, I'm not lying.

144
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,319
I really saw him wake up.

145
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,360
Theoretically,

146
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:21,839
the cases...

147
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,879
of a vegetative person...

148
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,319
waking up after being hit...

149
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,879
are very rare.

150
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,959
Of course.

151
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:30,040
It happens sometimes.

152
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,240
I got it.

153
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,639
It must have been after the patient...

154
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:33,960
was injured in this accident that he woke up.

155
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:36,210
Just now,

156
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,840
I went to check again with Yi Ran.

157
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:41,120
I really didn't see him showing signs of resuscitation.

158
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:43,639
Dr. Xu, I really saw the patient woke up.

159
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,639
The patient might wake up for a short time.

160
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,759
but it was just an epiphenomenon.

161
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,090
The patient is still in a vegetative state,

162
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,279
so you don't have to worry...

163
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:53,450
about whether he has woken up or not.

164
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:54,879
Yes.

165
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:55,879
Yi Ran is right.

166
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:58,450
If he really wakes up, we'll discuss it again.

167
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,559
Let's get back to work.

168
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,090
What a waste of time.

169
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:08,210
Get me some water.

170
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:12,090
I really saw it.

171
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,720
Aren't you going home?

172
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,720
Why are you back?

173
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:30,919
Dr. Xu.

174
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,480
I believe he'll open his eyes again.

175
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:36,879
You're obsessed.

176
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,720
Dr. Xu.

177
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:41,240
Do you think I'll become a great doctor...

178
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,000
and make a big achievement?

179
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,210
Who provoked you again?

180
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,279
I do.

181
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,919
Lin Zhi.

182
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,330
- What are you looking at? - Dr. Tang.

183
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,159
Look.

184
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,879
What is he doing there?

185
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,210
I don't know.

186
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,799
I heard from Ms. Jiang...

187
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:19,480
that he has been like this since last night.

188
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:21,039
He comes here whenever he has time.

189
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,159
I almost thought he was the patient's family.

190
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:39,090
Bed Number 13.

191
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,600
Give him four more units of insulin.

192
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,799
The patient in Bed Number 5 is awake.

193
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,960
He's awake?

194
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,210
He's really awake.

195
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,679
Let's go.

196
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:54,159
Chen Zhi, are you crazy?

197
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:55,960
Don't go.

198
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:57,600
What else do you want?

199
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,759
He's really awake.

200
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,519
We can see it ourselves if he wakes up or not.

201
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:02,080
Don't look at his eyes.

202
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,399
Look here.

203
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,480
It's really moving.

204
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:08,679
I'll tell Dr. Lu.

205
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:10,759
He...

206
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:11,919
He woke up?

207
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:13,000
No, he didn't.

208
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,159
We did an electroencephalography on the patient...

209
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,360
and it showed normal brain waves.

210
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,679
That means...

211
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,320
there's still a chance that he'll wake up.

212
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:24,240
What do you mean?

213
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,080
Will he wake up or not?

214
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:29,039
Based on the patient's condition,

215
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,759
after the effective treatment,

216
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:32,559
there's a high chance that he'll wake up.

217
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,039
So you have to make a decision soon.

218
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,639
We'll start the treatment right away.

219
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,200
Why do I feel like she doesn't want us to treat him?

220
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,320
Jiang Chao woke up?

221
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,240
Xiao Wen.

222
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,240
Dr. Lu.

223
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:57,879
I have a question.

224
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,240
How likely is it that Jiang Chao will wake up?

225
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,159
The possibility of him waking up is very high.

226
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,360
How high is it?

227
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,320
Dr. Lu, can you give us a specific number?

228
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,320
Let's say 60 percent or 70 percent.

229
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,399
That's up to you.

230
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,559
Do you want him to wake up or not?

231
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,080
100 percent to 0 percent.

232
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,159
Everything is possible.

233
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,679
What do you mean?

234
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,279
Here's the thing.

235
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,639
You want an exact number.

236
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,200
I can't give it to you.

237
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,919
All I can say is there's a high chance he'll wake up.

238
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,720
I mean, the treatment you're doing.

239
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,879
Are there any side effects?

240
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:30,960
Medication, for example.

241
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,279
Will it cause brain damage?

242
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,399
Will it cause him not able to wake up?

243
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:36,759
Do you want this kind of medicine?

244
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,080
Let me introduce you.

245
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:39,360
Bai Zhu.

246
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:41,519
Here's the thing.

247
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,840
Don't worry.

248
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,399
We'll definitely use the safest treatment.

249
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:48,080
What you said earlier is impossible.

250
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:51,840
So I'd like to ask you discuss it as soon as possible...

251
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,639
and we'll also treat the patient as soon as possible.

252
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,679
Okay?

253
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,440
How about this?

254
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,000
Let us discuss it first.

255
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:08,559
Sorry. Hold on.

256
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,639
Can we talk?

257
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,759
Are you going back now?

258
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,519
Xiao Wen will stay to take care of Li Jiang Chao.

259
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:19,039
I'm going back to work.

260
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,240
Doctor, what can I do for you?

261
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:26,639
I...

262
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,480
I wanted to ask you something.

263
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,440
It's about your relationship with Ms. Hao Wen.

264
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,360
I'll be honest with you.

265
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,600
In the past few days, I've asked a few friends for help.

266
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,320
Initially, I planned to propose to her last night.

267
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,360
However, I didn't expect at a time like this,

268
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,360
Li Jiang Chao had an accident.

269
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:52,919
Proposed to her?

270
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:59,000
Weren't Ms. Hao Wen and Mr. Li Jiang Chao married?

271
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:01,639
She already filed for divorce.

272
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:02,759
The result will be out soon.

273
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:04,399
That's what the lawyer said.

274
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,200
In her case, the court supports divorce.

275
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,879
What if she says yes?

276
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,120
What about the patient?

277
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:15,960
I've already thought about that.

278
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,279
I've found a welfare center for him.

279
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,559
The environment there is quite good.

280
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,559
We'll pay them monthly.

281
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,720
They also promised to take him in.

282
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,120
But now,

283
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:26,960
that's not the point.

284
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,759
Xiao Wen is too responsible.

285
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,519
Even if she filed for divorce,

286
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:36,440
she hasn't completely let it go.

287
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,399
All these years,

288
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,919
no matter how...

289
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:42,440
No matter how I confessed my love to her,

290
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,440
she never said yes.

291
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:46,360
She insists on taking care of Li Jiang Chao alone.

292
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,559
I don't know what to do.

293
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:52,279
So I thought I should just propose to her.

294
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,559
Are you saying that you're going to abandon the patients...

295
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,200
at the welfare center?

296
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,279
Tang Hua.

297
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:59,000
Can't I say it if I don't like it?

298
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,639
What do you want her to do then?

299
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,080
Do you want her to stay with her vegetative husband forever?

300
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,759
No. Don't be angry.

301
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,080
You...

302
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:15,679
You have no idea.

303
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:18,039
What has Xiao Wen been through in the past eight years?

304
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:21,440
Li Jiang Chao loves to drink.

305
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,919
After drinking,

306
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,399
he'd behave like a rascal.

307
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,240
He has a bad temper and he hits and scolds people.

308
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:30,200
He has offended all his friends and relatives.

309
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,360
Even his parents won't acknowledge him as their biological son.

310
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,320
After that, he had a car accident and in a vegetative state.

311
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,559
No one cares about him anymore.

312
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:44,799
No one came to help Xiao Wen.

313
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:46,600
You're doctors.

314
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,759
You should know...

315
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:48,759
a person in a vegetative state...

316
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:50,559
has a problem with his bowels.

317
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:52,919
He needs someone to take care of him, right?

318
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,480
Because of this,

319
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,399
Xiao Wen even quit her job.

320
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,679
She runs a fruit shop near her house.

321
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:03,360
She sells fruits...

322
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:04,960
and takes care of Li Jiang Chao at the same time.

323
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,919
You don't know anything about all this.

324
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:09,080
What right do you...

325
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,919
What right do you have to criticize her?

326
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,320
We understand her difficulties.

327
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:18,279
However, we still have to treat the patient.

328
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,440
Besides,

329
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,039
if he recovers,

330
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,320
he might be able to regain his mobility.

331
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,000
It's also a relief for both of you.

332
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,480
It's not that we don't want to treat him.

333
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,039
It's because...

334
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,039
Forget it.

335
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,519
I'm sorry.

336
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,360
Let us discuss his treatment.

337
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,679
Sorry to disturb you.

338
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:54,120
Xiao Wen.

339
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,559
Let's treat him.

340
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:58,320
Otherwise, the doctor will be suspicious of us.

341
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,200
What if Jiang Chao really wakes up?

342
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:04,200
What should we do?

343
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,799
What's meant to be will be.

344
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,920
Don't think too much.

345
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,680
I'm so anxious.

346
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:17,599
Don't worry.

347
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,079
I'm here.

348
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,170
I'm home.

349
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,799
It smells so good.

350
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,279
Why did you make so many dishes today?

351
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:32,890
Ms. Jiang.

352
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:34,680
I didn't make the dishes.

353
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:37,240
I've been cleaning all day.

354
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,720
Mr. Jiang told me to use this disinfectant...

355
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,410
to clean the whole house.

356
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,720
Yes, I asked him to do so.

357
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,920
I'm the one who cooked the dishes.

358
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,960
What? You don't believe me?

359
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:52,759
Let me tell you.

360
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:54,839
Mr. Jiang has been busy the whole day.

361
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,359
Other than grocery shopping, I didn't do anything else.

362
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,960
He washed, cut, and stir-fried the vegetables.

363
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:02,440
He did it all by himself.

364
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:06,650
Is today a special day?

365
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:07,839
Why did you cook?

366
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,200
No.

367
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,680
I just watched a random cooking show...

368
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,519
and did it on a whim.

369
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,650
It has been years since I last cooked for you.

370
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,359
Let's see if my skills have deteriorated.

371
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:20,079
Come and try it.

372
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:21,890
I know it's delicious just by looking at the color.

373
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:22,890
Try it.

374
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,119
I'll go wash my hands and get some rice.

375
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,200
Hurry up.

376
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,200
Mr. Jiang.

377
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,480
I'm going home.

378
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:32,680
Okay.

379
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:38,650
Mr. Pan.

380
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,759
Aren't you eating with us?

381
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:40,759
No.

382
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,410
Something came up at home.

383
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,170
- You guys go ahead. - Okay.

384
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,799
- Thank you for your hard work. - No problem.

385
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:47,480
Be careful on the road. Bye.

386
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,170
Here.

387
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:51,279
- Try it. - Here.

388
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,680
Try this rapeseed.

389
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:54,240
Is it the same as before?

390
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,960
I haven't had it in a while.

391
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:01,839
How is it?

392
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's delicious.

393
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,319
I'm glad you like it.

394
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:06,440
Try the other dishes.

395
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:07,759
It's the same as before.

396
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,039
Slow down.

397
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,359
You eat too.

398
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:11,519
I'll eat.

399
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:13,720
I love cured meat.

400
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,559
Hey, Xiao Shan.

401
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,799
You don't have to clean up now.

402
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,240
Mr. Pan can do it tomorrow.

403
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,650
What are you doing? It's nothing.

404
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:31,759
Come on.

405
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:32,759
Put it down.

406
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,960
I need to talk to you.

407
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,839
Sit down.

408
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:39,650
What's wrong with you today?

409
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:41,920
It's nothing.

410
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:45,650
Well,

411
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,680
I have something to tell you.

412
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:50,480
Don't get worked up.

413
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:52,680
I'm not.

414
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,410
Tell me.

416
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,240
Jiang Xian Yun.

417
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,759
What are you doing?

418
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,799
I told you to calm down.

419
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:15,839
Calm down.

420
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,119
Listen to me first.

421
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:18,839
Okay?

423
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:25,359
Xiao Shan.

424
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:27,680
The other day,

425
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,680
I...

426
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:32,410
I flipped through...

427
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,839
the photos of both of us...

428
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,170
since we first met...

429
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:39,920
until now.

430
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:44,799
I remembered a lot of things.

431
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:48,599
Do you remember our first date?

432
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,119
That day was so cold.

433
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,440
We made plans to go to the movies.

434
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,319
When we were walking on the road,

435
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:58,599
you saw a stray dog freezing to death.

436
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:01,170
You cried a lot.

437
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,519
You couldn't even watch the movie.

438
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,170
That's when I thought...

439
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,440
that you were a kind person.

440
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:16,000
I think you're the one I want in my life.

441
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,240
Later, I took you on a trip to Beijing.

442
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,480
We didn't have money back then.

443
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,519
So we got the smallest room in a hotel.

444
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:30,799
It only had a single bed.

445
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,839
I said I'd sleep on the floor and you'd sleep on the bed.

446
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,440
However, you refused.

447
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:37,799
In the end, the two of us...

448
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,680
We both slept on that single bed.

449
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,759
In the middle of the night, I fell under the bed.

450
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:44,799
Why are you beating around the bush?

451
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,799
What do you mean by that?

452
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,000
Just hear me out.

453
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,680
After that, you got a job.

454
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:56,359
You became a nurse.

455
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,559
I was strongly against it.

456
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,319
I thought...

457
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,160
you were too kind.

458
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,160
You're also very thoughtful.

459
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:06,880
Seeing those patients...

460
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,960
to face separation or even death...

461
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,119
is torture for you.

462
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:12,519
After all these years,

463
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,359
from a nurse,

464
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:18,720
you've become...

465
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,079
a head nurse now.

466
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,680
You've learned to face reality.

467
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:28,119
You've learned how to control your emotions.

468
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:31,319
It's probably because of...

469
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,960
your professionalism.

470
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:37,400
However, when you get home...

471
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,880
and take off your lab coat...

472
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,599
Let me tell you this, Xiao Shan.

473
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,880
You're just an ordinary person.

474
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,720
You're the same...

475
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,240
as the patients' families in the hospital.

476
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,079
You don't have to bear those pressures.

477
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,400
I didn't understand back then.

478
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:07,240
When I had the car accident,

479
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,359
I thought I was the most miserable person in the world.

480
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:10,759
God is so unfair.

481
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:13,039
You should be punished for taking care of me.

482
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,880
But then I thought it through.

483
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:21,599
It's so unfair to you.

484
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:26,400
The stress you're under at work and at home...

485
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,559
is far greater than the pain I have physically.

486
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,000
I've never considered this issue...

487
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,960
from your point of view.

488
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,319
I'm already in this state,

489
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:53,079
but you're different.

490
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,839
You don't have to stay with me and keep suffering like this.

491
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:03,160
Every day, when you come home from work,

492
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,519
I can never see your happy look anymore.

493
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:13,160
All I see is pain.

494
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,880
You're in pain.

495
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:18,400
I'm in more pain.

496
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,880
This is not the happy life...

497
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,960
I wanted to give you...

498
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,519
when I pursued and married you.

499
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,519
Over the years, I haven't fulfilled...

500
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:31,519
the responsibilities and obligations...

501
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:33,599
that a husband should have.

502
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,960
As long as you're happy,

503
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:42,440
I'll be truly happy.

504
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:48,839
However, you've changed too much for me.

505
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:55,480
If this goes on, I won't be able to face you anymore.

506
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,200
Xiao Shan.

507
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,359
You shouldn't have someone like me in your life.

508
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,160
Someone like you...

509
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:15,079
shouldn't be in my life as well.

510
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,880
Your chronic cough...

511
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,640
is caused by postnasal drip syndrome.

512
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,440
Doctor. What kind of illness is it?

513
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,480
Is it serious?

514
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,079
It's fine. I'll prescribe you some medicine.

515
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:13,559
Dr. Bai.

516
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,000
The vegetative patient woke up.

517
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:21,880
He woke up?

518
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,440
He's conscious now,

519
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,720
but his motor nerves haven't recovered yet.

520
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,440
It has been eight years.

521
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,359
Isn't this considered a miracle?

522
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,440
Are you not feeling well?

523
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,079
Do you want to see someone?

524
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,119
You want to see your wife?

525
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,279
I just saw his wife. She's outside.

526
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:03,319
I'll go look for her.

527
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:07,359
Don't worry.

528
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,000
Jiang Chao...

529
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,279
is awake?

530
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,960
The patient wants to see you.

531
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:19,680
Xiao Wen.

532
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:21,880
Why don't I go with you?

533
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:24,480
Wait for me outside.

534
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,079
Jiang Chao just woke up.

535
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:27,559
He doesn't want to see you.

536
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,200
Let's not provoke him.

537
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:31,160
I've been thinking a lot lately.

538
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:35,119
I think I can handle him on my own.

539
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:36,920
Don't worry.

540
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,480
Don't get worked up.

541
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,519
Do you want to tell me...

542
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,240
that you're ready to quit drinking again?

543
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:02,599
You want me to forgive you...

544
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,359
and live a good life with you.

545
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,200
Jiang Chao.

546
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,440
Think about it.

547
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,240
How many times have you said that?

548
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:14,880
You always say that to me every time you sober up.

549
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,319
I can memorize it now.

550
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,440
They say...

551
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:24,000
for domestic violence, it's zero times or countless times.

552
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:26,960
I won't believe you anymore.

553
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,880
No matter what, I'm sorry for the past eight years.

554
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:34,680
I apologize.

555
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,279
I'm sorry.

556
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,519
However, don't try to take advantage of me.

557
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,160
I've thought very clearly in the past eight years.

558
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,279
Before you went unconscious,

559
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,720
you kept saying that I was having an affair...

560
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,920
with Jian Guang.

561
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:58,640
But at that time, I didn't even know him.

562
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:00,799
If he didn't stop you,

563
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,759
I'd be the one lying here today.

564
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,160
I've repaid what I owed you...

565
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,640
for the past eight years.

566
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,319
- You... - Don't get too worked up.

567
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:24,119
Do you have something to say?

568
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:25,960
You can write it on my phone. Here.

569
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,359
You want to call the police?

570
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,960
He's awake.

571
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,359
He wants to call the police.

572
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:56,440
What's meant to happen will happen.

573
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:58,000
I'll face it with you.

574
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,440
What should we do when the police are here?

575
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,240
Xiao Wen.

576
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,279
Have you thought about it?

577
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,599
You've been carrying this responsibility for eight years.

578
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:12,599
You've been anxious for eight years.

579
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,279
You can finally let it go today.

580
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:20,079
I remember we were neighbors eight years ago.

581
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,880
I always heard...

582
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,279
Li Jiang Chao taking it out on you...

583
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,519
because he drank too much.

584
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,240
Actually, I don't blame you for what happened.

585
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:33,279
I couldn't take it anymore.

586
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,880
That was why I rushed in.

587
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,279
If it weren't for that,

588
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,319
that incident wouldn't have happened.

589
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,440
You did it to protect me.

590
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,960
He was very drunk that day.

591
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:44,319
He wasn't in his right mind.

592
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:46,960
He didn't only suspect us.

593
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,880
He even hit you.

594
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:52,119
I was so scared.

595
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,119
If I didn't stop him, he would've beat you to death.

596
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,200
That was why I took a flower pot and smashed him.

597
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:00,359
I thought he just fainted.

598
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:03,880
But who knew he'd be in bed for eight years.

599
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,480
Yes.

600
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:08,039
It has been eight years in the blink of an eye.

601
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:12,359
Because of that incident, we got to know each other better.

602
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:14,519
That was when I knew for the past eight years,

603
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,839
you've suffered a lot.

604
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,079
Later, he became a vegetable.

605
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,119
It must've been harder for you.

606
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:27,920
Jian Guang.

607
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,640
You've been taking care of me and helping me...

608
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
for the past eight years.

609
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,680
Without you,

610
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:38,000
I really don't know if I can make it.

611
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,279
Xiao Wen.

612
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:42,160
In order to take care of Jiang Chao,

613
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:43,720
you never agreed to marry me.

614
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,759
Now that he's awake and called the police,

615
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,920
we should be responsible for this.

616
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:51,680
Maybe in the future,

617
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,079
we won't be able to see each other for a long time.

618
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:55,680
You said it yourself.

619
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,680
If it weren't for me,

620
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,680
I don't know if you can make it these eight years.

621
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,759
But I want to tell you.

622
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,920
There are many eight years...

623
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:07,319
in our future.

624
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:11,400
I hope...

625
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,440
I can always take care of you.

626
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,279
Xiao Wen.

627
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,480
I know you received the divorce decree today.

628
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:29,759
Will you marry me?

629
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,279
- Here. - Wait.

630
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,599
Jian Quang.

631
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:13,799
I'm actually a little scared.

632
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:15,640
Don't be scared.

633
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:17,079
I'm here.

634
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,039
When we get out of jail,

635
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,160
we'll have nothing to do with him anymore.

636
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,240
At that time,

637
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,880
I'm sure we'll have our own life.

638
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,720
Xiao Wen.

639
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,119
This day has finally come.

640
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:47,200
(Tongshan Hospital)

641
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,119
I have already arranged next week's schedule.

642
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,279
Please keep an eye on the patient in Bed Number 17.

643
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,680
- Okay. - Tell them to come today.

644
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,680
Ms. Jiang.

645
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:57,359
Aren't you off today?

646
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:58,480
Why are you here?

647
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,160
I was worried, so I came to take a look.

648
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:01,279
Dr. Xiao.

649
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,319
You're such a dedicated doctor.

650
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:04,839
Isn't Xiao Guang getting discharged today?

651
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,319
- Has he left already? - Not yet.

652
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,079
He's sulking in there.

653
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,289
What's wrong with him?

654
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,679
Dr. Bai originally said...

655
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:12,039
that he'd take him to the amusement park...

656
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,329
after I took care of the paperwork today.

657
00:34:13,769 --> 00:34:15,679
But a patient with severe burns came at the last minute.

658
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,639
So he went to see the patient.

659
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:19,960
I don't think he'll be discharged today,

660
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,289
let alone going to the amusement park.

661
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,679
Okay.

662
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,679
I'll go check on him.

663
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,440
Look at the curl of his mouth.

664
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,159
It can even hang an oil bottle.

665
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,960
My dad isn't a man of his word.

666
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,079
He's a liar.

667
00:34:53,329 --> 00:34:54,920
I can't trust him anymore.

668
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,559
Still, he can't keep his patients away, right?

669
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,199
But there are so many doctors here.

670
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:01,960
Mr. Xu said it.

671
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,639
The world won't move without him.

672
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:07,769
That means your dad is a skilled doctor.

673
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,329
You should be proud of him.

674
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,880
Ms. Xiao. Don't speak up for my dad.

675
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:14,199
From now on, I'll never believe him again.

676
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,440
I don't believe anything he says.

677
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,079
If you can't go this time, you can go next time.

678
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,119
Ms. Xiao.

679
00:35:19,329 --> 00:35:21,039
You don't understand my dad.

680
00:35:21,289 --> 00:35:23,079
He's a control freak.

681
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:25,639
He won't let me hang out except for school.

682
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
It has been a long time...

683
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,159
since I've been to an amusement park.

684
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:31,199
If I wasn't sick, I'm sure he wouldn't say yes.

685
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:33,719
If I can't go this time, I won't have a chance in the future.

686
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,480
I'm sure your dad did it for your own good.

687
00:35:36,769 --> 00:35:38,400
He's worried about your condition.

688
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:39,599
Think about it.

689
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,239
There are so many people at the amusement park.

690
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,519
Some of the rides are dangerous.

691
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,639
What if you get hurt and bleed?

692
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,880
But if I'm in a bad mood, I'll still get sick.

693
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:52,039
He's so full of himself.

694
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:53,679
He doesn't care about my feelings at all.

695
00:35:55,769 --> 00:35:56,769
Ms. Xiao.

696
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,360
Why don't you take me there?

697
00:35:59,769 --> 00:36:01,119
I can't.

698
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,159
Ms. Xiao, please.

699
00:36:03,289 --> 00:36:05,079
It has been a long time since I've been to an amusement park.

700
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:06,960
Your dad won't allow it.

701
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,960
It's okay. Just don't tell my dad.

702
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,639
Please, Ms. Xiao.

703
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,039
Please.

704
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:14,400
I haven't been to an amusement park for a long time.

705
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:20,329
I'm so happy.

706
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:22,199
Ms. Xiao.

707
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:23,199
Hurry up.

708
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,000
What do you want to play?

709
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,559
I want to play bumper cars first.

710
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,559
Bumper cars?

711
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:28,599
Let's go.

712
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:11,679
Okay, let's do that.

713
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:15,679
Dr. Bai.

714
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:17,119
Dr. Xiao asked me to tell you this.

715
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,199
She took Xiao Guang to the amusement park.

716
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:19,239
She told you not to worry.

717
00:37:19,809 --> 00:37:20,960
To the amusement park?

718
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:22,880
Who gave her permission to do that?

719
00:37:23,289 --> 00:37:25,289
Dr. Shaw looked for you, but you were working.

720
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,000
Ms. Xiao.

721
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:37,809
Look. It looks like a Monster Zoo.

722
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,840
That merry-go-round looks like a turtle.

723
00:37:41,329 --> 00:37:42,519
And this roller coaster.

724
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:44,360
It's curvy like a snake.

725
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,559
You're right.

726
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:53,289
I'm doomed.

727
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,119
Your handsome dad is calling.

728
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,289
I knew it.

729
00:37:58,289 --> 00:38:00,599
Good times are short-lived.

730
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:05,599
Who are you to take Xiao Guang out without my permission?

731
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:08,519
I'm sorry.

732
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:10,000
Bring him back right now.

733
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,289
I...

734
00:38:18,289 --> 00:38:19,440
You're right.

735
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,400
Sometimes, Dr. Bai is a control freak.

736
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,440
I'm sorry, Ms. Xiao.

737
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:25,840
I got you in trouble again.

738
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,289
You didn't get me in trouble.

739
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:31,159
I'm very happy today too.

740
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,440
Cheers.

741
00:38:34,769 --> 00:38:35,840
Cheers.

742
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:44,400
Let's go out again next time, okay?

743
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:45,960
Okay. I want to ride the Ferris wheel again.

744
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,159
- Sure. - Xiao Guang.

745
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,480
Dad.

746
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:49,719
How are you?

747
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,400
Don't bother. I'm fine.

748
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,440
How many times have I told you?

749
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:54,329
Without my permission, you're not allowed to play outside.

750
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,079
Dad, we had so much fun today.

751
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,159
Dr. Bai.

752
00:38:58,599 --> 00:38:59,679
You too.

753
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:01,840
Without the guardian's permission,

754
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,480
you privately...

755
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,809
You took a sick child out of here.

756
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:07,559
This is a serious threat to his life.

757
00:39:07,809 --> 00:39:09,400
Isn't this illegal in a foreign country?

758
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,360
- I'm sorry. - No, Dad.

759
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,599
It's not Ms. Xiao's fault.

760
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,769
I begged Ms. Xiao to take me out.

761
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:15,840
Bai Ji Guang, let me tell you.

762
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,920
From now on,

763
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:18,360
I won't let you go to the amusement park.

764
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,519
- Dad. - Let's go.

765
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:20,599
Dr. Bai.

766
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,000
Xiao Guang.

767
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,639
Why don't you go in first?

768
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:25,679
I have something to say to your dad.

769
00:39:27,329 --> 00:39:28,960
Then you two shouldn't fight.

770
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,000
Go inside.

771
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:31,360
I'll deal with you later.

772
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:32,679
Your shoelace.

773
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:34,679
Your shoelace.

774
00:39:38,329 --> 00:39:39,360
Dr. Bai.

775
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,840
Do you know what Xiao Guang calls you in private?

776
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,920
Bossy.

777
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,000
Control freak.

778
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,599
We tell each other everything.

779
00:39:45,769 --> 00:39:47,639
He said the same thing to my face.

780
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:48,920
You really tell each other everything.

781
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,960
But I believe...

782
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:52,920
you didn't tell him about his condition.

783
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,920
It's none of your business.

784
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,239
I know you want the best for him,

785
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:58,039
but you shouldn't control him like that.

786
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,159
He should have room to grow on his own.

787
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:02,440
He's someone with severe thalassemia.

788
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,440
I know.

789
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,199
He's someone with severe thalassemia,

790
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:06,400
but he's eight years old.

791
00:40:06,809 --> 00:40:08,329
He has the right to know.

792
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:10,880
He also has the right...

793
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:12,559
to live a happy childhood like other kids.

794
00:40:12,809 --> 00:40:14,880
If he's not happy and cheerful at all,

795
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,809
what's the point of living longer?

796
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:18,289
Think about it.

797
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:22,000
Why is he not happy?

798
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,519
Why is he not cheerful?

799
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:25,329
Seriously.

800
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,199
Dad, what did Ms. Xiao say to you this afternoon?

801
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,809
When you come home, you're as dumb as a chicken.

802
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:39,000
Is that how you use this idiom?

803
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,639
I'm a chicken.

804
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:42,719
What are you?

805
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,960
A chick?

806
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,480
No matter what Ms. Xiao says, I'm sure she's right.

807
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:50,360
Otherwise, you wouldn't be as dumb as a chicken.

808
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:53,039
Whatever. Just eat your food.

809
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,440
Don't keep repeating the same idiom.

810
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
By the way, Dad,

811
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,000
I need to talk to you.

812
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,519
This afternoon, you were wrong about Ms. Xiao.

813
00:41:06,769 --> 00:41:08,880
It was really me who begged Ms. Xiao for so long,

814
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,289
then only she agreed to take me there.

815
00:41:10,289 --> 00:41:12,480
She said she wanted to discuss it with you.

816
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,960
But weren't you seeing patients?

817
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,769
Am I seeing patients in the mountains?

818
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,809
How hard is it to talk to me?

819
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,159
Chen Zhi originally wanted to discuss it with you,

820
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:23,920
but Ms. Xiao said...

821
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,559
you don't like to be disturbed when seeing patients.

822
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,039
That's why we didn't go find you.

823
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,079
She knows me well.

824
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,079
Look at how happy you are.

825
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:38,079
Who's happy?

826
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,119
Hurry up and eat.

827
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:42,239
Stop staring at me. Eat up.

828
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,440
Hello.

829
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Dr. Xiao.

830
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:21,360
I still want to say this.

831
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,639
Xiao Guang isn't a normal kid.

832
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:27,079
He's a kid with severe thalassemia.

833
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,440
A minor injury...

834
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,840
might cause him a lot of harm.

835
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,809
No matter what,

836
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:36,159
you shouldn't have taken him away without discussing it with me.

837
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,519
That's very wrong.

838
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:40,719
About that,

839
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,079
I didn't think it through.

840
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:44,159
I apologize.

841
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,840
Okay.

842
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,960
That's a good attitude.

843
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:49,559
Remember that.

844
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,079
Don't do that next time.

845
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:53,840
Is there anything else?
