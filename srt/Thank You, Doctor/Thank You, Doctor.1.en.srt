00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,660
Nine months pregnant. A massive prenatal hemorrhage.

19
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,040
Her heart rate has obvious signs of speeding up.

Look at the situation, it has to be a rupture of the uterus.

Do you know what dosage of Oxytocin the local hospital has given her?

30 doses.

Doctor Bai, why are you still here? We need to start the meeting.

But the Hospital Directors are here.

37

Do you know the criteria for becoming a good doctor?

38
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,600
First, punctual.

39
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,910
Second, patient.

40
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,260
Then don't be late.

41
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,700
The surgery is done, prepare for stitching.

42
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,580
Mrs. Xiao, She's bleeding.

43
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,030
Two units of blood supplement.

44
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,520
The patient's blood pressure is unstable, we have already given her six thousand units.

45
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,630
If we give her more, we will have replaced all of the blood in her body and it won't have any effect.

46
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,800
Let's remove the uterus.

47

Everyone quiet down.

Doctor Bai Shu is Mr. Chen Chuan Shu's attending physician.

If he doesn't come, what are we going to talk about?

55
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:35,020
If he never comes, we will continue to wait for him.

56

Who says I'm not coming?

57
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,760

Let's start.

59
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,240
Alright, Doctor Bai is here, so let's start the meeting.

60
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,330
Today's main topic of discussion is one of our patients in the cardiac surgery department.

61
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,110
Mr. Chen Chuan Shu's surgical plan.

62
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:01,270
Mr. Chen has a very rare primary malignant cardiac tumor.

63
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,200
Since he entered the hospital, we have providing him with conservative treatment.

64
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,410
Mr. Chen is one of China's most outstanding experts in linguistics.

65
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:12,730
He has contributed greatly to the development and research of China's linguistics field.

66
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:16,050
For such an accomplished expert

67
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:21,350
we need to be very cautious with his surgical plan.

68
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,780
We can't have any errors.

69
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,140
Okay.

70
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,280
Who wants to speak?

71
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,970
I'll speak first.

72
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:33,570
Mr. Chen is eighty-three years old

73
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:36,600
all of his bodily functions are already worsening

74
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,890
especially his cardiac functions.

75
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:41,480
If we go through with the surgery and remove the tumor

76
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,970
we will need to used extracorporeal circulation.

77
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:48,220
It is very likely that his body will never make it off the operating table

78
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,820
because it can't handle the operation.

79
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:57,350
So, to elderly people, continuing conservative treatment is the best choice.

80
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,340
Of course, from our perspective here at the hospital

81
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:03,370
Mr. Chen has been very influential in our country as an expert professor.

82
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:06,120
If we choose to take the risk of surgery and it leads to an accident

83
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,510
it will definitely bring a lot of trouble

84
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:11,100
for our whole hospital's medical work.

85
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,780
Therefore I recommend continuing conservative treatment.

86
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:18,040
It sounds like you all have the same opinion.

87
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,270
Doctor Bai, you are Mr. Chen's attending physician.

88
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,260
Tell us your opinion.

89
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,240
I believe that an excellent doctor only needs to consider one thing.

90
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,710
Curing the sick and saving them.

91
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:34,150
I want to ask everyone

92
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,270
how do you cure the sick and save them?

93
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,450
Do you only consider the risk that you take on yourself

94
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:42,010
and neglect the hopes of the patient? Is that how you act as a doctor?

95
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:44,320
Pretty words. Who wouldn't want to say them?

96
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,390
We have considered the realistic risks

97
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:49,400
but Mr. Chen's tumor situation is too complicated.

98
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,540
As soon as a surgery's risk becomes too great, I don't approve of it.

99
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,550
Every surgery has a risk, no matter how great or small.

100
00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:01,120
Then based on what you just said, if a surgery has a big risk, we should just surrender.

101
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,610
You said it too simply. If even just a small accident happens, an elderly person's life is at risk.

102
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,010
If you don't face risks, elderly people's lives will be at risk also.

103
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,310
Every surgery I have done has never gone wrong.

104
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,240
It's never happened before, it will never happen in the future.

105
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,910
Director, I am very confident

106
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:20,270
I can complete this surgery perfectly, and bring Mr. Chen's life a miracle.

107
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,580
This world has nothing that is 100%.

108
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:27,170
In case you haven't forgotten, Mr. Chen is strongly against surgery.

109
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,230
He himself wants to continue with conservative treatment.

110
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:33,230
So shouldn't we respect the opinion of the patient?

111
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:36,640
The patient's opinion? Are you kidding me?

112
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,280
As a doctor, the only thing we need to consider is the patient's condition.

113
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,940
Doctors cure patients.

114
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:45,380
If you always consider the opinion of the patient, then where is our professionalism as a doctor?

115
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,540
Of course our medical professionalism is important

116
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,220
but we also need to supplement that with respecting the wishes of the patient.

117
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,920
This is the criteria we need to uphold.

118
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,140
This way we can protect the patient, their family members

119
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:59,020
the hospital and the doctors.

120
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:03,560
-Director...
-Our decision is to continue with conservative treatment.

121
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,530
You all should have takeaways from

122
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,510
our discussion at today's meeting

123
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,180
In regard to Mr. Chen's treatment plan

124
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:18,320
my suggestion is that we should respect the patient's opinion

125
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,780
which is conservative treatment.

126
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,880
-Director.
-This marks the end of the meeting.

127
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,490
-Director.
-You can stay.

128
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,940
Taking a risk? He just wants to show himself off.

129
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:34,450
Did you see how conceited he was? It was as if no one was as important as him.

130
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:38,990
I want to know if he truly is Director Jiang's disciple. If sooner or later

131
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,820
he will be our cardiac director.

132
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,690
-Teacher
-Call me Director.

133
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:51,880
Director, Mr. Chen's situation is very dangerous.

134
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,530
-As soon as the tumor breaks through the heart, at any time her could...
-It's not like nobody knows that.

135
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,350
But the risk of surgery is too great.

136
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,110
But you know the extent of my abilities.

137
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,370
I can definitely take the tumor our safely

138
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,800
-and help Mr. Chen recovery his health.
-Doctors are not gods.

139
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:10,310
No one can sustain a success rate of 100% forever.

140
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:13,560
According to you, even if the surgery fails

141
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,340
it will only be one setback in your career as a doctor.

142
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,410
But to the patient and their family

143
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,320
it will be a final farewell.

144
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,550
Bai Shu, you need to learn how to treat illness

145
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:34,150
from the perspective of the patient and their family.

146
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:37,020
-But I am confident...
-We cure disease to save people.

147
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,070
Curing disease is not hard, what's hard is saving people.

148
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:43,660
A doctor is not a repairman. What we face is not lifeless tables and chairs

149
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,870
but living people with blood, flesh

150
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:49,560
thoughts and feelings.

151
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:54,660
While we are saving people, we can't only pay attention to the disease.

152
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,580
We also have to respect the patient's own opinion.

153
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,070
Do you understand?

154
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,370
I haven't convinced you, is that correct?

155
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:24,360
While I was in school, you never taught me this.

156
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,480
Back then you told me

157
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,690
that as doctors, we need to fight disease

158
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,330
at all costs. We need to save the patient's life.

159
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,360
I will still tell you that now.

160
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,170
In my heart, a true doctor should be as flawless as a robot

161
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:44,620
be constantly striving to achieve the perfection of a robot, and be calm and rational.

162
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:49,120
No matter what, don't be moved by factors outside of the disease.

163
00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:00,480
Teacher, I will choose to follow your advice from before

164
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,160
when I'm at work.

165
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:26,310
Xue Li, you shouldn't have taken any risks today.

166
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:29,450
This is not Lausanne University's affiliated hospital. We don't have the support of other departments.

167
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:34,500
-Even if an embolism can't be done, removal of the uterus is the safest option.
-I know.

168
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,380
But you still chose the risky option in order to preserve her uterus.

169
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:44,400
Do you remember when we first got here, the first postpartum woman that we treated?

170
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,730
I remember it clearly.

171
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:49,840
In her hand she was holding an talisman full of scriptures.

172
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,990
Before she went under anesthesia, she was repeatedly emphasizing

173
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:58,060
that anyone who steals her uterus will be cursed, and will never find happiness in their life.

174
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,410
Are afraid of her curse?

175
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:03,470
I just always think about why every time in the face of life and the uterus

176
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:06,740
they prefer to choose saving their uterus over saving their lives.

177
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,500
Actually I can understand it.

178
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,690
Here, women's value comes from having children.

179
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:16,870
Losing one's uterus means becoming useless to one's family.

180
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:21,340
It also means living a life of shame among one's clan.

181
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,930
So I have to take risks.

182
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:31,520
As a doctor, what you face is not only injuries and disease

183
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,550
you face the people behind the injury and disease.

184
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:37,090
Only saving one's life is useless.

185
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,990
If there was no war, this would definitely be a fertile and tranquil valley.

186
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:51,450
But we can't change war and poverty.

187
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,450
We don't even have a way to understand the local postpartum women.

188
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:57,650
Their reckless persistence towards giving birth.

189
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:02,180
They throw away their own lives in order to birth children.

190
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:08,330
But we are these wounded people and postpartum mothers' only hope.

191
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:11,390
They need us.

192
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,970
What about you? Do you not need someone to rely on?

193
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,800
I do need that.

194
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:35,130
You are who I rely on.

195
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,860
Once we finish this task

196
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:43,100
let's go back to our own country. I will bring you back to Shanghai for a break.

197
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:45,970
Back to your hometown?

198
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:49,280
Right. Haven't you never been there before?

199
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:55,160
Now that I think about it, I haven't ben there in a really long time.

200
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:00,260
When I was young, out home was in a place called Yan Xiang.

201
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,400
Right, it was called Yan Xiang.

202
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,790
Walking out of that alley, you would see a small river.

203
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:09,320
In our small courtyard, we have a loofah plant trellis,

204
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,660
a small fish pond, and I also have a small pet dog.

205
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,890
He is also called Ron.

206
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:18,230
I am Ron No. 1. He is Ron No. 2.

207
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,780
I have always been thinking,

208
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,960
maybe one day,

209
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,360
I will return with the person I love to that small courtyard,

210
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,380
and live a peaceful life.

211
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,420
What's wrong?

212
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,940
I thought...

213
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,300
you were proposing.

214
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,860
You're not willing?

215
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,090
I am not willing.

216
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:04,550
You don't even have a ring, it is not the least bit official.

217
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,050
<i>[Nurses' Station]</i>

218
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:29,010
Doctor Bai! Something is happening at Bed 26!

219
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,860
- Grandpa?
- Chuan Shu, can you hear me?

220
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,010
Can you hear me?

221
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,470
- What's wrong?
- The doctor's here.

222
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,900
Excuse me, Grandmother.
(TN: Polite way to address an elderly woman)

223
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,740
Grandfather? Grandfather!
(TN: Polite way to address an elderly man)

224
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,590
There is no pulse. His chest isn't rising or falling.

225
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,160
The patient is in ventricular fibrillation (V-Fib). Patient's family, please step aside.

226
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,520
- What's wrong with him?
- Bring over the defibrillators.

227
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,140
Please step aside. Come, pull out the bed!

228
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,320
<i>It isn't serious, right?</i>

229
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,170
Prepare for CPR!

230
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,670
The defibrillators are ready.

231
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,030
200 joules.

232
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,360
Confirming 200 joules.

233
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,200
It's finished charging. Get away from the bed.

234
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:28,020
Okay, he is back. Get him an EKG.

235
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,210
You can bring the patient's family back in. Push the bed back.

236
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,820
Patient's family can come back in.

237
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,080
Doctor Bai, how is he?

238
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,600
It's okay, he is stable now.

239
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,250
- Thank you.
- Really? Thank you.

240
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,500
You're welcome. This is our duty.

241
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,110
I would like to speak with you both.

242
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,540
It is regarding his condition.

243
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,340
Let us go over there to talk.

244
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:57,080
<i>[Inpatient Department]</i>

245
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,070
When he first arrived, this malignant tumor

246
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,410
had partially blocked the superior vena cava entrance.

247
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,780
This resulted in obstruction to his blood circulation.

248
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,950
In addition, this was accompanied by massive pericardial effusion.

249
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:11,510
Over the past few days, after going through our conservative treatment,

250
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:14,350
not only has he not improved, instead he has gotten worse.

251
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:19,580
If we continue like this, this tumor may break through to the heart at any time and cause bleeding.

252
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:23,350
When that time comes, it may result in massive accumulation of blood in the pericardial cavity.

253
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,770
When that happens, his heart will be squeezed.

254
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:30,130
In the end, he may die due to cardiac arrest.

255
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:33,420
You saw what happened just now. It is actually very dangerous.

256
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:36,580
So I recommend he has surgery immediately.

257
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,750
Is this height okay?

258
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,310
It is okay. I want to see you.

259
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:50,640
If you want to see me, then put your glasses on.

260
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,350
I can see you clearly now.

261
00:19:55,350 --> 00:20:00,880
Husband, you scared me to death just now.

262
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:05,120
Do not worry.

263
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,990
There will not be any problems. Am I not fine now?

264
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,500
This time, you need to listen to the doctor, okay?

265
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,960
Okay, let's not talk about this.

266
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,280
Do not worry.

267
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,430
Close your eyes and rest a while.

268
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,570
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

269
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:45,460
- Good morning.
- Morning!
- Good morning.

270
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:59,930
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

271
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,460
How did you sleep last night?

272
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,350
I slept fine, how about you?

273
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,850
I slept all right.

274
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,310
Here.

275
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,440
Why so romantic?

276
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,240
Where did you pick them from?

277
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,400
Shirley, marry me.

278
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,130
I bought this ring a long time ago.

279
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:53,820
I never had the guts to give it to you.

280
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:57,890
Over this past half year, we have both experienced war.

281
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:01,730
Time and time again, we have raced against death.

282
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,890
In my heart, it has become clearer and clearer

283
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:07,730
that I hope I can be by your side for the rest of my life.

284
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:12,470
Not only as a partner, but also as your unwavering other half.

285
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:17,890
No matter what happens in this life, I also hope you can be by side.

286
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:19,820
I can't be without you.

287
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,050
Will you marry me?

288
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,920
<i>Marry him! Marry him! Marry him! Marry him!</i>

289
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,970
<i>Marry him! Marry him! Marry him!</i>

290
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:36,930
<i>Marry him! Marry him! Marry him! Marry him!</i>

291
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:40,220
<i>Marry him! Marry him! Marry him!</i>

292
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:43,080
<i>Marry him!</i>

293
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,730
Guard down!

294
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:55,300
Guard down! Where's the doctor?

295
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,000
I'm doctor. I'm doctor.

296
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,350
Okay, help help. He got shot.

297
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,230
He has been shot in his lower abdomen.

298
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,080
Operation room! Patient status?

299
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,520
Blood pressure is 100 over 60.

300
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,240
Heart rate is 130. Respiration rate is 20.

301
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,080
Sonogram first. Pay attention to his vital signs.

302
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,310
The sonogram is broken. It's still not fixed.

303
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,100
Blood pressure is dropping. 80 over 50.

304
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,320
Direct laparotomy. Suction.

305
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,610
The cord to the light is broken.

306
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:23,110
- Where's the backup cord?
- Still not fixed.

307
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,000
I'll go grab it.

308
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,940
- What happened?
- I'm getting tools.

309
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,270
No.

310
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:32,490
- Save him first!
- I am saving him!

311
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:35,020
No. Go back!

312
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:39,670
- Stop!
- If you want him to live you can't disrupt surgery.

313
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:44,760
If he dies, you die.

314
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,600
Understand?!

315
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,470
Go.

316
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:58,240
Help please!

317
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,310
Help!

318
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,070
Help! Please!

319
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,900
Go!

320
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,130
It sounds like it's close.

321
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,960
Focus on surgery.

322
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,690
How is the patient?

323
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,430
I am still looking for the site of bleeding.

324
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:30,770
- If movement of the shrapnel causes any more damage, then there will be a problem.
- There isn't enough blood.

325
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:33,900
If we still can't find it, I'm afraid it'll be too late.

326
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,170
I found it.

327
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:51,760
It is a perforating wound in the inferior vena cava.

328
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,540
- How much blood do we have left?
- We still have 1500cc left.

329
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:10,120
Doctor Xiao, what's wrong with Ran?

330
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:13,370
- What's wrong?
- I'm fine.

331
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:16,330
I got unlucky. When I went to get supplies I got hit with a mine.

332
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:18,080
- Let me help you.
- Don't come here!

333
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,750
You haven't finished the surgery yet.

334
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,650
I'm fine. I didn't hurt my back.

335
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:25,910
Continue the surgery. Check on me

336
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,740
when you finish.

337
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:31,120
Doctor Xiao, his blood pressure is still dropping!

338
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,870
You...

339
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,370
I'm really fine.

340
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,480
I am also a doctor.

341
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,910
I know my condition.

342
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,600
Don't worry.

343
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,720
Continue the surgery.

344
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:59,180
Okay. Then wait for me.

345
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,980
If you need anything, tell me immediately.

346
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,460
Okay.

347
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,800
Continue the surgery, I'm fine.

348
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,210
Keep pumping.

349
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,860
Ran. Ran.

350
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,590
Ran.

351
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,900
Ran.

352
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,750
Wake up.

353
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:06,950
- How did the surgery go?
- Very successful.

354
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:09,740
Let me treat your wounds now. Get up.

355
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:13,980
- It's too late.
- No it's not.

356
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,350
The shrapnel hit my liver.

357
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,990
I have lost too much blood.

358
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,600
We don't have any more blood.

359
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,240
There's still time. Get up, let me help you.

360
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,350
Shirley...

361
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:40,490
I'm afraid I won't get the chance...

362
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,750
to take you back to Yan Alley.

363
00:27:55,890 --> 00:28:00,170
I-I'm sorry...

364
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,030
Ron?

365
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:31,060
There's time. Just wait for me.

366
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,790
Let me help you with the surgery.

367
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,720
Prepare for surgery.

368
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,030
There is a lot of blood in his abdominal cavity! I must save him!

369
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,480
- Shirley!
- Don't stop me!

370
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,450
Move! I must save him!

371
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:46,040
Ran, he's gone.

372
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:53,480
I could've saved him.

373
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,480
I could've saved him.

374
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,490
I could've saved him.

375
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Doctor Bai.

376
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:50,050
Sir, how do you feel today?

377
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:52,320
- Much better.
- Much better, right?

378
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,520
Grandpa's appetite today is very good. He ate a lot.

379
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,920
What? He can't eat too much.

380
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,610
Sir, the blood vessels in your heart is not enough.

381
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:05,480
If you eat too much, it'll be hard to digest. That's why he should only eat half for each meal.

382
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,600
- Oh.
- Do you understand? As long as you get the nutrience it'll be enough.

383
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:13,110
Grandpa, look, the doctor said you can't eat that much.

384
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,980
Chen Yan, go to the nurse's station to get your grandpa's medicine.

385
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,390
And then ask about how the medicines work.

386
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:22,160
Don't think it's a hassle, make sure you understand.

387
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,790
Okay. Grandpa, I'll be back.

388
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,330
Don't worry.

389
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:39,750
Sir, I heard Chen Yan say before

390
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:43,480
that you've written a specialized text about the evolution of language and culture in the Shang and Zhou dynasties.

391
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,510
I did.

392
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,640
Are you interested?

393
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,900
Not me, I don't know much about that area.

394
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:54,160
I have a friend who really admires you.

395
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,010
He is also really passionate about linguistics.

396
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:01,710
So he told me to ask you, where can he buy that specialized text?

397
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,420
I am ashamed.

398
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:11,330
It still has not been published yet.

399
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:17,710
I also heard him say that you have been writing it for over a decade now.

400
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:22,520
I started planning when I was young.

401
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:26,260
But at that time, I had a heavy work load.

402
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:29,190
I also had a lot of school work.

403
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:32,230
I never had time to continue.

404
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:39,460
After I retired, I started writing.

405
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:44,170
I've wrote for six to eight years now.

406
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:50,820
Research on the evolution of language and culture in the Shang and Zhou dynasties...

407
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:55,460
is still a blank slate in our country.

408
00:31:56,150 --> 00:32:00,360
I always thought that, before I died,

409
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:04,890
I could fill up that blank space.

410
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:09,370
But now that my body is like this,

411
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:13,730
I'm afraid it'll be a shame.

412
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,390
What a shame.

413
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:24,490
Your wish is still not complete in the end.

414
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:27,580
For you, and for our country,

415
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:30,040
it's a huge loss.

416
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:34,940
For me personally, it's nothing.

417
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:40,460
It has been worth living this long.

418
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,650
I just feel that

419
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:48,050
I could not leave those

420
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:51,800
young people with a passion for the evolution of the language culture

421
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:57,640
in the Shang and Zhou dynasties with something of use.

422
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,300
I feel

423
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,310
it's such a shame.

424
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,400
Grandma.

425
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,340
Sir,

426
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,170
the tumor on your heart

427
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,240
can be removed.

428
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,920
As long as the surgery is successful and you heal well

429
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,720
there's a lot of time later to finish.

430
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,020
To finish your wish.

431
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:43,840
You came here just to say this?

432
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:47,260
Yes.

433
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:51,840
Actually, I've considered surgery.

434
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:58,000
It's just that my family is worried.

435
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:02,770
We sought a lot of experts.

436
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:07,330
They all suggest a safer way of treatment.

437
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:13,580
Actually, dying is a natural part of human life.

438
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:17,600
I'm not scared of this.

439
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:20,680
I just feel

440
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:24,630
I don't want to leave before my wife.

441
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:29,840
Because I'm going to leave soon,

442
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:34,650
I'm afraid she won't take good care of herself.

443
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:42,840
Yes, I understand this point.

444
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,730
Surgery is a risk.

445
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:50,540
But if you don't the surgery, the tumor will continue to worsen.

446
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:53,430
Then you might...

447
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:02,000
Please believe in me. I have the skills and faith to be successful in this surgery.

448
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,410
Doctor Bai.

449
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:15,480
Doctor Bai, my entire family has agreed for a safer treatment of my grandpa.

450
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,830
Please don't mention these things anymore.

451
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,480
Chen Yan.

452
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,710
Grandma Wu, Mr. Chen.

453
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:28,030
I feel like the best option right now is surgery.

454
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:31,110
I've already prepared a flawless surgery plan.

455
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,890
I also considered all the risks.

456
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:38,470
Doctor Bai, I know you're the most skilled young doctor at Tongshan Hospital.

457
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,670
You've also performed many heart surgeries.

458
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:44,250
However, based on my grandpa's current situation, surgery is a gamble.

459
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:49,300
Under this condition, we cannot risk this.

460
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,520
I haven't had any mistakes in my surgeries to this day.

461
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,770
My grandpa needs to rest right now. Please leave.

462
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:56,420
Chen Yan.

463
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,640
Don't worry, it's fine.

464
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,460
I've already said everything I needed to say.

465
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,380
I'll wait for your response.

466
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,670
Okay.

467
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:08,200
Sir, rest well.

468
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:11,760
If you need anything, let me know.

469
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,470
Doctor Bai.

470
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:23,330
If you keep trying to persuade my grandpa to do surgery,

471
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:26,560
I will ask the hospital to switch the lead doctor.

472
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,600
Did you get humiliated again?

473
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,280
Aren't you guys in Emergency too busy to even go to the toilet?

474
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,780
How do you have the spare time to wander around Cardiology?

475
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:48,780
I'm here to help him get familiar with the place. We just happen to see you get kicked out by the patient's family.

476
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,930
- Teacher—
- Let's go eat lunch.

477
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:53,080
He's like that. Let's go.

478
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,280
You require quite a lot from new doctors. They have to accompany you 24 hours.

479
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,280
It's not like I can't be independent. I don't need him to accompany me.

480
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,640
Okay, go eat by yourself.

481
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,820
Sit here. Which school did you graduate from?

482
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:21,190
He has a PhD from a medical university. I don't know why students from medical universities can't even write up a medical history.

483
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:23,400
Nobody willing to take him. Madam Lu shoved him to me.

484
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,930
Let me introduce you. Cardiac surgeon, Doctor Bai. Amazing knife from Tong Shan.

485
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:29,220
He calls himself Star of the future.

486
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,860
- Hi Professor Bai.
- Don't let Xu Yi Ran intimidates you.

487
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:36,060
You have higher academic qualification than him. When you get promoted to be the Associate Professor in two years, he will has to call you professor.

488
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,560
Can you eat properly?

489
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:41,490
I have to remind you. Just now, you misused a term.

490
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:46,030
I was asked to leave by the patient, not kicked out. Asked.

491
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,930
Is it regarding that linguistic expert's surgery?

492
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:54,310
Yes. If I don't take the risk, the old gentleman is just waiting to die.

493
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:57,700
Dean is right, you don't care about team works.

494
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,500
- What about...?
- Team will me will be fine.

495
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,600
Bai Zhu, you don't have to pay attention to anyone else.

496
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:06,440
Can you be any louder? The entire cafeteria knows you like Bai Zhu.

497
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,140
That's good.

498
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:12,480
I need to let those single nurses and doctors know

499
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,610
that Bai Zhu is mine.

500
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:18,070
Everyone else can go chill somewhere else.

501
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:22,250
Don't worry. With his arrogant and snarky personality,

502
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:24,170
No one is going to fight with you. Keep him for yourself.

503
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:30,300
That's great. In this world, only I know Bai Zhu is good.

504
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:34,610
My situation is not bad either. Why did you fall for him and not me?

505
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:37,930
Because I don't like second-hand material.

506
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:47,910
Oh right, I heard you're insistent on performing surgery.

507
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:51,170
There are reasons why people are concerned about it.

508
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:53,460
Do you want to consider again?

509
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,720
I won't give up.

510
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:01,420
I also I believe Mr. Chen's family will understand it sooner or later.

511
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:14,140
Grandpa, it's cloudy outside so let's just relax in here.

512
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:18,810
If there was sunlight that would be great.

513
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:20,640
That's right.

514
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,710
When the weather is good, I'll take you outside to sunbathe.

515
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,180
I love the sunshine.

516
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:02,500
Doctor Bai, can I ask for some of your time?

517
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,170
Of course. No problem, please come in.

518
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:07,260
Okay.

519
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,690
Did you find me to...

520
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:21,020
I want to speak about my husband's surgery.

521
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:28,700
Grandpa, if you're tired, let's go back.

522
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:32,280
No, no. Let me stay some more.

523
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,890
Okay.

524
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:40,750
- Chen Yan.
- Grandma.

525
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:44,930
Go back to work. Let me speak with your grandpa.

526
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:47,510
Okay. Then don't stay here for too long.

527
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,790
- Go back to your room soon.
- Okay.

528
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:51,770
Grandpa, I'm going back to work.

529
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:55,330
How are you?

530
00:40:57,050 --> 00:41:00,580
What's going on that you have to hide from him?

531
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:04,980
I found your manuscript underneath your pillow.

532
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,570
I now have free time to read it.

533
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,410
Husband, listen to the doctor.

534
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,080
Do the surgery.

535
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:23,310
No.

536
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:27,250
Also,

537
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:30,380
I don't want to leave you.

538
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:34,200
No, no, no. Don't say something like that.

539
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:41,670
You need to finish your book.

540
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:44,880
This has been your hardwork for 10 years.

541
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,080
It's just a book.

542
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:51,680
The surgery was so risky, not worth it.

543
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,960
I know you're worried about me.

544
00:41:55,610 --> 00:42:00,340
Yes. I am worried about you.

545
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,900
Did you know?

546
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:09,730
If you don't do the surgery, you could have...

547
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,330
Don't worry. I have a big life.

548
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:20,870
I just spoke with Doctor Bai.

549
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:25,840
He said that he has faith in performing well.

550
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:29,480
We've lived forever now.

551
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,650
I understand how you feel.

552
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:36,390
You don't want to do surgery because

553
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:40,570
you're afraid that you won't make it past surgery, and I won't be able to live well by myself.

554
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:44,320
- Right?
- Yes, yes, yes.

555
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:49,510
But did you know? We have an opportunity for treatment.

556
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:53,520
We're giving it up.

557
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:58,310
My heart hurts more.

558
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:00,300
No.

559
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:15,970
