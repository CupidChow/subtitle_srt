She's still in a coma.

00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,190
Please Andriana,

18
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:42,570
I need to know the truth.

21
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:40,210
I just called Aunt Andriana.

22
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,690
She told me a lot of things.

23
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,680
I always hated you.

24
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,970
You can't imagine how it was

25
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,230
for a ten year old child to be sent to a foreign country,

26
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,080
and to live with a foreign family.

27
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,200
I was so scared.

28
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,920
I know,

29
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,920
Andriana is one of your best friends.

30
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,640
But she isn't my friend.

31
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,190
She is not my family.

32
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,630
She isn't my mother.

33
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,940
I still remember,

34
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,810
every day and every night in England

35
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,240
I missed you.

36
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,970
I was waiting for the day you would come to take me home.

37
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,280
But every day I would be disapointed.

38
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,050
Finally I realized,

39
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,530
that you would never come.

40
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:00,200
You sent me abroad to take revenge on my dad.

41
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,380
I was just a pawn in your plan.

42
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,540
Since then,

43
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,890
I started to hate you.

44
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,870
I didn't take your calls, and I didn't even want to see you.

45
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,320
If anyone even mentioned your name, I would get mad.

46
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,220
But not long after, you started to feel regret.

47
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,680
You said you'd take me home.

48
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,520
But at that time, I felt like I could never

49
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,490
forgive the mother who abandoned me.

50
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:46,050
I told you, if you tried to come to England to find me

51
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:50,160
I would leave home, so that none of you could find me.

52
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:58,120
You've probably forgotten all that.

53
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:04,090
These past years, just like you,

54
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:07,150
I was living with pain and hate.

55
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:14,360
I thought I meant nothing to you.

56
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,500
Until I saw those photos.

57
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:24,030
I realized, things weren't as I thought.

58
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,690
For so many years, you had been by my side.

59
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,120
My mom loved me so much.

60
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,710
I was so happy.

61
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:48,360
But when I came to see you,

62
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,160
you said all those things to me.

63
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,230
Doctor Bai said you did it

64
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,830
because you didn't want to be a burden on me.

65
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,470
You wanted me to hate you, forget you,

66
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,210
and start a new life.

67
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,670
But after so many years,

68
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,850
I can't do it.

Can you be humane at all?

78
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:16,450
Going back to cardiac surgery and saving many patients is the most humane thing ever.

79
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:21,060
Doctor Bai said that you can have surgery in two days time.

80
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,700
Ms Ge, here are your documents.

81
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,050
I signed it.

82
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,560
Give it to your father.

83
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,200
Alright.

84
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:52,880
Doctor Bai was right.

People can't live in hate.

86
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:01,190
I've made him suffer enough over the years.

87
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,880
And hurt myself in the process.

88
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,790
I need to put an end to it.

89
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:11,390
He'll be free and I'll be free too.

90
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,490
I'll take care of you.

91
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,610

 - Yes.

92
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,100

 - Xiao Xuan.

95
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,770
The surgery was a success, how are you feeling?

96
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:27,210
We were able to completely remove the tumor.

97
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,470
At the moment, we can't see any remaining cancer cells.

98
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:34,220
Remember, you must come back for a check-up every three months to prevent a relapse.

99
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:39,440
Isn't it time to say thank you?

Thank you, Doctor Bai.

You're welcome.

Doctor Xu!

104
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,440
You know, you aren't my type.

105
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,040
But...I didn't mean it when I said Doctor Bai was more handsome than you.

106
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,490
Thank you.

Thank you.

110
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,330
If it wasn't for you, Ge Hong wouldn't have agreed to the surgery so quickly.

111
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,880
Colleagues help one another out.

112
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,020
You helped me with Fang Nan.

113
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,120
How did you know that Ge Hong was hiding something?

114
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,050
I remembered that when I was working with Doctors Without Borders,

115
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:08,590
I treated a pregnant woman.

116
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:11,810
Before I gave her anesthesia, she kept stressing to me

117
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,840
that we couldn't remove her uterus.

118
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,860
She was willing to die instead.

119
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,150
I didn't understand at the time.

120
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,540
But later, I found out that over there,

121
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,240
a woman who's unable to give birth to children

122
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,820
loses all her dignity.

123
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,510
So I realized that if Ge Hong was unwilling to have the surgery,

124
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:31,110
she must have her reasons.

125
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:35,110
That's also why you insisted on respecting

126
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,350
Wang Qing's personal wishes, right?

127
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:39,800
I believe that doctors not only deal with illness

128
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,320
but also with the person behind the illness.

129
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,510
Study of humans.

130
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:49,020
Perhaps there are some contradictions with the medicine that you believe in.

131
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,040
That's true,

132
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,690
but things aren't that absolute either, right?

133
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,820
I can agree with that.

134
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:02,440
I hope we can work together in the future.

135
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,340
Professor!

136
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,170
What are you doing here?

137
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,110
You gave me a fright.

138
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,090
I was waiting for you.

139
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:26,420
You can talk to me during the day in my office.

140
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,860
Why were you waiting here? What's going on?

141
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,330
You're never in your office when I visit. I had to come wait here.

142
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,840
So, what do you want to say?

143
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:38,190
Sir, Ge Hong has made a donation.

144
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:42,410
The hospital laboratory is set now. Shouldn't I be returning to the cardiothoracic department?

145
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:43,870
How are those two things related?

146
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,370
Of course they're related.

147
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:48,190
If I hadn't persisted, Ge Hong wouldn't have agreed to the surgery.

148
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:51,390
You're her primary doctor. Convincing her to have the surgery

149
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,180
is simply a part of your job.

150
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,820
- But... 
- That's enough.

151
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,060
Hey.

152
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,540
What are you doing?

153
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,680
You even put your seat belt on.

154
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,550
Alright, stop messing around.

155
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:14,010
My wife is waiting for me to have dinner.

156
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:18,140
That's perfect. If you won't agree, then I'll go home with you.

157
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,910
I'll just live there and eat there from now on.

158
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,610
How old are you? Tell me.

159
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,390
How old are you?

160
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,510
You're still acting so shamelessly.

161
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:31,130
You forced me to do this.

162
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,400
Okay, fine. Come home with me.

163
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,540
My wife has been wanting to find you a partner.

164
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:41,300
She knows some girls who are quite nice. You should meet them.

165
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,000
Why don't I invite a few over tonight?

166
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,660
Your wife truly has great taste.

167
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,450
What did you just say?

168
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:53,380
My wife's taste... What about it?

169
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,580
Are you saying that I'm not handsome?

170
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,830
No. You're the most handsome teacher I've ever had.

171
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,190
Sir, look over there.

172
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,250
You rotten kid!

173
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:21,380
Doctor, Xiao Ting's stomach hurt a lot during class today.

174
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,810
We were excused from class so I could take her to the hospital.

175
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,300
How long has it been hurting?

176
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,130
For about two hours today.

177
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,560
Have you had stomach pain before?

178
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,050
For the past two years, it comes and goes.

179
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:36,620
It would hurt for a few days and then get better, so I never paid much attention.

180
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,860
But this month, the pain is a lot more frequent.

181
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,130
And it's especially painful today.

182
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:46,190
70/40, your blood pressure's low. Lie down over there.

183
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,520
Relax.

184
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,150
Hands.

185
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,960
It hurts here, right?

186
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,240
Tenderness on the lower right abdomen.

187
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,960
No rebound tenderness. It could be acute appendicitis.

188
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,350
Is your period regular?

189
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,020
Doctor, my period has always been irregular.

190
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:31,120
You're her boyfriend, right?

191
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,640
Yes.

192
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,420
I'm going to give you a urine test.

193
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,720
A urine test?

194
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,680
To see if you're pregnant.

195
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,530
I'm well aware of my body's condition.

196
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:44,010
I'm not pregnant. I don't want the test.

197
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,340
A urine test is routine practice.

198
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,120
After the results come out, we can continue assessing.

199
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,130
I'm not doing it. Wang Xiang, let's go.

200
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:55,300
You can't leave yet. You have abdominal pain and low blood pressure.

201
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,630
- Are you okay? 
- Are you okay?

202
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:03,580
Tang Hua, get the patient a blood test.

203
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:07,000
Since the patient has denied being pregnant, also get her a CT scan.

204
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,670
Make sure she signs the waiver first.

205
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,120
Okay.

206
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,880
Let's go. Come this way.

207
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,380
Slowly.

208
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,720
How's the pain now?

209
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,160
The CT shows no swelling or presence of exudate in the appendix,

210
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,560
no deposits in the urinary system,

211
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,490
a small amount of fluid in the pelvic cavity.

212
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:34,020
Imaging is unclear, and ectopic pregnancy can't be ruled out.

213
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,200
I want to speak with you privately.

214
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,450
Wang Xiang, it's been a long day. I'm kind of hungry.

215
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,170
Can you buy me something to eat?

216
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,660
Okay.

217
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:56,600
Dr. Xiao, you want to convince me to take a pregnancy test, don't you?

218
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,810
The sooner we test, the sooner we can eliminate different causes for illness.

219
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,320
We can only treat you once we determine the cause of the problem.

220
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,600
Dr. Xiao, do you know why I'm unwilling to be tested?

221
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:13,110
My whole life,

222
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,490
I've always been the kid parents compare their own kids to.

223
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:24,900
Throughout school, I was always a top student and brought home many awards.

224
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,330
When I got to college, I started getting scholarships.

225
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,440
And yet,

226
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,570
my parents have no confidence in me.

227
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:38,300
Whenever I go home for the holidays, my parents talk to me like they're questioning a prisoner.

228
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,780
Now I have a boyfriend and I've kept it a secret from them.

229
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,440
I'm done living as someone untrustworthy.

230
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,110
I'm sure that your parents love you, even if their method is wrong.

231
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:55,930
You should find an opportunity to talk it out with them.

232
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,920
It's pointless.

233
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,730
Yu Ya Ting's blood test came back.

234
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:06,220
Her blood amylase levels are normal, and acute pancreatitis is unlikely.

235
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,060
Okay.

236
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:11,020
She still hasn't agreed.

237
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,550
She's being too stubborn. The testing is for her own good.

238
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:17,780
Although we're trying to treat patients,

239
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,550
we have to respect their personal wishes.

240
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:27,980
Lift your legs. Let me do an examination.

241
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:38,420
- Does this hurt? 
- A little.

242
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,460
Tenderness on the lower right abdomen,

243
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:46,010
but there's no tightness in the stomach. The CT shows no problems.

244
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:50,180
Further testing should be done where the imaging is unclear.

245
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:54,500
Oh, right, have you done a pregnancy test and ultrasound yet?

246
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:00,820
You should get it done to rule out an ectopic pregnancy.

247
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,840
I'll transfer you over to the EICU first.

248
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,350
Dr. Xiao,

249
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:27,890
I think you should try to convince Yu Ya Ting again.

250
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:31,750
I know you've already spoken to her,

251
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,290
and I trust your professional judgement.

252
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:39,750
But trusting her and getting the test done don't conflict with each other.

253
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:44,360
It's a necessary test in the diagnostic process.

254
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:53,960
I understand what you're saying,

255
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:59,210
but it might be difficult for a young woman to open up about these kinds of matters.

256
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:01,450
You have to understand that too.

257
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:05,430
I'll find another opportunity to talk to her.

258
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:16,420
<i>[Emergency]</i>

259
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,550
Look at how anxious you are.

260
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:31,200
I'm fine. It doesn't even hurt anymore.

261
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,640
You can never hide how you're feeling.

262
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,350
Look at your furrowed brows

263
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,610
and sunken lips.

264
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:47,820
That's more like it. You know what they say online.

265
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:52,420
The most important thing about people is that they should be happy.

266
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,790
Tell me what's on your mind.

267
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,530
I promise I won't get angry.

268
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:08,160
Ting Ting, maybe we should listen to the doctors and do the examination.

269
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,920
Wang Xiang.

270
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,670
Even you don't believe me?

271
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,580
It's not about believing you. I'm just worred about you.

272
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,910
And this morning, you were in so much pain,

273
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,190
but you wouldn't have come to the hospital if I hadn't insisted.

274
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:23,130
I know my body the best.

275
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:25,160
You don't need to worry about it.

276
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:39,930
My dear, let's wash your face.

277
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:44,140
Clean your face so you're all pretty.

278
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:50,670
My dear, do you know what I just thought of?

279
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:55,690
I went out to buy some things, and then it started raining.

280
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,090
While it was raining,

281
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:05,810
I suddenly remembered the fight we had the year after we got married.

282
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:08,620
You were really something back then.

283
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,610
Now that we've gotten old,

284
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:17,940
of all the things to remember, I thought of that fight.

285
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:24,160
I really want to have a fight with you again.

286
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,990
I'll leave you be. Let's wipe your hands.

287
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:42,190
Your lovely hands.

288
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:46,130
Let's wipe your face.

289
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,910
Beautiful.

290
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:54,290
Who's little girl is this?

291
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,050
And your head.

292
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:02,030
Mr Su's wife was hit by a car two weeks ago.

293
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:04,690
She had a brain herniation and blood on the brain.

294
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:07,500
Mr Su couldn't accept it, and didn't want to give up on her.

295
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,350
What's the situation now?

296
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,080
She is in a vegetative state.

297
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,670
The family?

298
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:17,490
They were both university professors.

299
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:20,230
Their children live far away, they haven't got back yet.

300
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:23,900
'The children want to repay the parents, but the parents have already left'.

301
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:27,310
The two of them hated inconveniencing other people.

302
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:31,980
Before the surgery, he didn't want to worry the children, so he didn't tell them.

303
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,520
But she hasn't woken up since the surgery.

304
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,720
He didn't know what to do, so he finally called the children yesterday.

305
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,410
Such important news. He should have told them earlier.

306
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:46,570
A month ago Mr Su

307
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:49,090
was diagnosed with Alzheimer's at our hospital.

308
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,580
He was afraid he would slowly forget Grandma Jin,

309
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:56,250
so every day after he washes her,

310
00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:00,330
he writes down everything that happened that day in his diary.

311
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,970
You had an argument?

312
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:30,510
Young man, go in and say sorry. She's ill.

313
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:34,990
She made me say it. And she promised she wouldn't get angry, but she did.

314
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,900
She went back on her words.

315
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,000
And it wasn't my fault.

316
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,970
- Why should I apologize? 
 - You...

317
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:45,230
remind me of my younger self.

318
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:48,120
We argued before about illness.

319
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,590
Back then I had serious myocarditis.

320
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:56,030
I told her I was going on a work trip, but she found me out.

321
00:24:56,030 --> 00:25:00,520
She ran after me, shouting.

322
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:05,280
It was because she was nervous. She was worried something would happen to me.

323
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:10,440
She was with me in hospital for 2 months, feeding me.

324
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,560
I see you are good to her,

325
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,320
not leaving her side. Just apologize, alright?

326
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,280
It's not embarrassing for a man to apologize.

327
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,290
You'll feel much better once you do.

328
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:25,820
The clouds will disperse,

329
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:29,160
and the sun will shine on your relationship again.

330
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,100
That's my experience.

331
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:35,590
What happened to your wife?

332
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:41,680
Car accident. She's in a vegitative state. There's no hope.

333
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,850
Don't worry.

334
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:50,770
You two lived through so much,

335
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:52,690
she will wake up.

336
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,940
Take it easy.

337
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:11,180
<i>[Emergency]<i></i></i>

338
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,380
Why didn't you tell me your stomach had been hurting?

339
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:24,760
Exactly! You must do exactly as the doctors say.

340
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:30,650
Let's leave the patient to rest, why don't we talk outside?

341
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:43,230
Doctor, if you have something to say, go ahead.

342
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:47,960
For women of this age who complain of abdominal pain,

343
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,460
we normally ask them to do a urine test for pregnancy.

344
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,590
To see if she is pregnant or not.

345
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:56,020
But the patient is sure she is not pregnant, and won't do the test.

346
00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:00,040
Don't worry, we will perform other tests on her.

347
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:05,150
Since I am her attending doctor, I have to tell you the truth.

348
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:09,830
I know you don't want us to misunderstand Ting Ting's situation.

349
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:13,540
Don't worry, we trust our daughter.

350
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:16,520
And she is already an adult.

351
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,890
She can make decisions for herself.

352
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:21,580
And she will take responsibility for those decisions.

353
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:25,400
We just want to know

354
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,340
why she has abdominal pain.

355
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,930
We need to wait for the test results to come back.

356
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:33,590
Ting Ting, does it hurt?

357
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:39,910
Dad, Mom, I shouldn't have started dating behind your back,

358
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,870
but I am sure I'm not pregnant.

359
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:44,700
It's alright.

360
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,830
Your mom and dad trust you.

361
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:53,290
Ting Ting, we want to say sorry.

362
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:56,710
We didn't realize how much you've grown.

363
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:59,980
You have your own ideas, we should respect you.

364
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:03,100
We shouldn't ask you to be like us.

365
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,890
We've thought about it. We want to give you more space

366
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:09,710
to live how you want to.

367
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,880
We believe in you.

368
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:18,100
Silly Ting Ting, what are you crying for?

369
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,390
Haven't we talked it out now?

370
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:22,100
Don't cry.

371
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,280
I won't cry, I won't cry.

372
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:31,650
Ting Ting, from today on, no matter what you do,

373
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:35,280
we will support you and be there for you.

374
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,020
But since you are ill,

375
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:45,000
you should listen to the doctors, and do the test. Right?

376
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,180
- Ok. 
 - Yes.

377
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,770
Your dad is right.

378
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:52,480
Let's listen to the doctors and have you tested.

379
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,020
Your health is most important.

380
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,190
- Alright? 
 - Ok.

381
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:00,170
Yes, that's it!

382
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,470
There's no obvious abnormality.

383
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:07,950
There's a small amount of fluid in the pelvis,

384
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:10,830
and the urine test was negative so she can't be pregnant.

385
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:17,320
It's not an ectopic pregnancy, but the CT and ultrasound both show a small amount of fluid in the pelvis.

386
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,850
That's probably what is hurting her.

387
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:22,420
That's possible.

388
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,710
Let's get her checked by a gynecologist, and hear what they say.

389
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,210
Ok.

390
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:31,620
- Where does it hurt? 
 - The bottom right hand side of my abdomen.

391
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,240
- Does it hurt anywhere else? 
 - No.

392
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,530
What happens when it hurts?

393
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:40,220
It comes in waves. The pain is very bad.

394
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:45,270
- When it hurts, it make you feel like you are going to poo? 
 - No.

395
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:47,990
Alright, bend your knees.

396
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,300
Let's have a look.

397
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,760
Does it hurt? What about when I don't touch it?

398
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,330
Here?

399
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,610
Here?

400
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,970
Here?

401
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,400
Roll on to your side.

402
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,460
Slowly does it.

403
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,460
- Does it hurt here? 
 - No.

404
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:16,950
- Here? 
 - No.

405
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,730
Alright.

406
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:21,290
It's all done. Get some rest.

407
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,860
Doctor Chen, do you think the pain is due to pelvic fluid?

408
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:29,450
From her symptoms and the examination,

409
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:32,630
it doesn't seem to be related to pelvic fluid.

410
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,270
I'd advise you to try some other tests.

411
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:37,720
- Thank you. 
 - No problem.

412
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,460
I never thought this would happen, our child...

413
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,990
- Doctor Xiao! 
- Doctor Xiao, what do you think?

414
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,840
The CT scan of her abdomen shows no abnormalities.

415
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,610
There's no evidence that surgery is needed. The urine test was negative.

416
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:54,260
So she is not pregnant.

417
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:57,490
The gynecologist's tests showed it isn't pelvic inflammatory disease.

418
00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:02,760
Doctor Xiao, you said there's no evidence surgery is needed. What did you mean?

419
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,830
That there is no need to do surgery on her abdomen.

420
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:10,590
But we advise doing a gastrointestinal examination to find out why she is in pain.

421
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:14,380
- Ok. We'll do it. 
 - We'll do it.

422
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,820
You still didn't find out why that girl had pain in her abdomen?

423
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,970
We already sent her for a gastrointestinal examination.

424
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:25,440
There's no need to rush.

425
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,410
Didn't you say she already had this for two years?

426
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:30,230
It takes time to treat chronic diseases.

427
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:33,110
The gastroscopy was fine.

428
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:36,940
The colonoscopy didn't find any prominent tumor polyps or congestion.

429
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,970
The abdominal pain is not an issue of the stomach or colon.

430
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:42,190
But the digestive tract is very long.

431
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:46,440
The gastroscopy examines the top part, the colonoscopy examines the lower part.

432
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,470
It doesn't reach the ileum and jejunum in the center.

433
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:51,910
Could there be a problem with that area?

434
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,950
Then we'll have to do a capsule endoscopy.

435
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:56,230
I'd better discuss it with the parents.

436
00:31:56,230 --> 00:32:00,160
The gastroscopy and colonoscopy didn't show any abnormalities.

437
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:04,630
We suspect the pain might be caused by the ileum or jejunum.

438
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:08,280
So, we advise doing a capsule endoscopy.

439
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,440
What is a capsule endoscopy? Will it be hard?

440
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,430
A capsule endoscopy is where a camera the size of a capsule

441
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:18,140
is swallowed by the patient with no need for anesthetic.

442
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:21,380
The capsule goes into the stomach and passes through the gut,

443
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:24,150
examining the large and small intestine.

444
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:27,370
The recorder will continuously take pictures of the process,

445
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:31,840
and we can use the photos to determine any problems in the gut.

446
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,510
Around six or seven hours after swallowing the camera

447
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:37,540
the patient will excrete the camera in their feces.

448
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,940
The whole process is painless and non-invasive.

449
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:43,560
But it is expensive. Around ¥5000-¥6000.

450
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,440
- Alright. 
 - Ok.

451
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,310
<i>[Emergency]<i></i></i>

452
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,610
We have the results of the capsule endoscopy.

453
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:10,260
There's a small issue.

454
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,730
Her small intestine contains diverticula. But they aren't very big or very many. (TN: diverticula are small bulges or pockets)

455
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:16,020
There is no sign of obvious inflammation,

456
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:19,850
so that probably isn't the reason for the pain.

457
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,850
Then...what's the problem?

458
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:24,320
We've already considered many options.

459
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,030
Some illnesses are rare.

460
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:28,050
So I want to ask you.

461
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:30,970
What about testing for a mesenteric embolism?

462
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:32,290
What's that?

463
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:35,340
It occurs when there is a sudden interruption of blood supply to the arteries.

464
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:38,980
It damages the intestinal loops and causes acute ischemic necrosis.

465
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,790
and symptoms of strangulated bowel obstruction.

466
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:45,440
Doctor Xiao, we can't understand what you are saying.

467
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,720
If you think we should examine it, then please do.

468
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:52,380
Alright. Then we will send her for a CT scan to check for mesenteric artery enhancement.

469
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,260
Another CT? Didn't she already do one? Why another one?

470
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,230
This CT is different.

471
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:59,760
This time, we will inject radiocontract agent into the blood vessles

472
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,700
to see whether the mesenteric artery is embolized.

473
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:06,120
This is how we test for the disease.

474
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,550
Then...is it dangerous?

475
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:11,810
It's similar to a normal CT, and the patient has healthy kidney function.

476
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:13,420
There shouldn't be a risk.

477
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:16,060
Alright, we'll do it.

478
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,690
The CECT's results have come out.

479
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:26,140
It's fine, no sign of a mesenteric embolism.

480
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:30,010
You've already done so many tests, what is the problem?

481
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:32,310
She's in so much pain she can't sleep.

482
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:35,460
If you can't find anything else,

483
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:38,310
can't you at least prescribe her some pain medication?

484
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:42,280
Have you...ever suffered from epilepsy?

485
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:47,230
Um...a while ago I did. But then

486
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:49,560
after seeing the doctor and taking medicine,

487
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,410
I haven't had it since.

488
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:57,000
I think your daughter's pain might be related to epilepsy.

489
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,410
Epilepsy can be inherited?

490
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:03,530
Epilepsy isn't normally inherited. The chances are very low

491
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:05,600
But let's not dismiss the possibility.

492
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,860
Let's send the patient for an EEG.

493
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:11,980
Doctor Xiao, the EEG results are out.

494
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:18,710
There are obvious spikes and sharp waves in her brain waves.

495
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:21,100
It could be epilepsy.

496
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:24,390
Let's prescribe her medication first. Intravenous sodium valproate.

497
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:27,310
And then ask the Neurology Department to take a look.

498
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:28,830
Ok.

499
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,510
Doctor Xiao, after injecting the sodium valproate,

500
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:37,460
the patient's pain decreased significantly and after twenty minutes she was able to sleep.

501
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:42,670
It's abdominal epilepsy. In the morning let's give her oral anti-epileptic medication.

502
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,010
Yes.

503
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:46,480
Doctor Xiao, you're really amazing.

504
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,230
You can solve even the most complicated diseases.

505
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,580
You're awake.

506
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,420
You came.

507
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:19,760
Oh yeah, is your stomach still sore?

508
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,190
Since the injection last night, it hasn't been painful.

509
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,950
Great!

510
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:34,910
Wang Xiang. After you apologized to me yesterday,

511
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:38,580
I spent a lot of time thinking. I was in the wrong too.

512
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,630
I was too stubborn.

513
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:43,620
Let's not argue in future, ok?

514
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,430
Oh yes, your parents went to buy you breakfast.

515
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:53,220
They obviously really love you.

516
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:09,290
Ting Ting, listen to this.

517
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:12,210
Mr Su next door is still looking after Grandma Jin.

518
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:16,020
But he's old, I'm worried he's not up to it.

519
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:21,000
I was thinking, maybe I can talk to him, see if he can hire a nurse.

520
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,450
Once they leave here, it won't be so hard for him.

521
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:29,060
I think it's a great idea. You need to find a true professional.

522
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,840
Alright.

523
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,500
- She likes this. 
 - Looking at her charts...

524
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,980
Doctor Xiao, Doctor Tang, good morning.

525
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:38,070
After a night of observation, we are sure Yu Ya Ting is suffering abdominal epilepsy.

526
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,760
It can be treated with oral medicine.

527
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,890
I'll prescribe her medication and then she can leave the hospital.

528
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:43,260
- Great. 
 - Great.

529
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:47,350
If she has any abdominal pain in future, you must bring her back in.

530
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:51,520
If not, I would advise a return check up in two weeks time.

531
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,030
- Thank you both for your hard work. 
 - Thank you, thank you.

532
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,780
- Thank you for your hard work. 
 - Take a look.

533
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:00,920
If there are no problems, please sign your name. Grandma Jin can go home today.

534
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,370
You're going home today?

535
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:07,860
Xiao Wang found us a nurse, she is packing up now.

536
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:12,500
I've discussed with the children. We don't want her to die with regrets.

537
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:17,720
There's a large courtyard in our hometown, she loved sitting there and soaking up the sun.

538
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:22,160
I promised to take her there in two years time.

539
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,350
I didn't realize it would be this soon.

540
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,430
I guess you could say it's

541
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:30,730
falling leaves returning to their roots.

542
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,060
Doctor Bai, these documents are for you to sign.

543
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:51,640
Heidegger once said, we are all headed towards death.

544
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:55,730
Death is the unavoidable final resting place for all people.

545
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:58,520
But sometimes I think to myself,

546
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,530
if I was wheelchair-bound,

547
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:04,550
if I was Grandpa Su, what choices would I make?

548
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:09,500
But more often, I use my medical knowledge

549
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,580
to make decisions.

550
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:15,000
Even more than my patients, I have to believe

551
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,940
that my choices are rational, are the best.

552
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:23,700
Facing death is one of the demands of being a doctor.

553
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:27,390
Death ultimately means withdrawing the technology.

554
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:31,140
Before withdrawing, should one do a last stubborn fight?

555
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:34,440
But we often don't know

556
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,390
when is the right time to give up.

557
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:42,860
We don't know if this decision will be accepted by others.

558
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:47,300
So, medicine is a type of philosophy.

559
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:51,100
It's the philosophy of values in the face of life and death.

560
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,320
You're right.

561
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,620
We will spend a lifetime looking for the answers.

562
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:01,670
Sometimes patients clearly have no hope or survival

563
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,880
but we still carry on until the last moment,

564
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,880
out of compassion.

565
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:11,560
But sometimes, the family chooses to give up

566
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:15,280
and we feel pained.

567
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:23,790
Even though people will eventually grow old and die, but life cycles alternately.

568
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:27,230
Because there is the outflow of feelings, life continues one.

569
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:35,280
Look at Grandpa Su and Grandma Jin.

570
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,850
Although he doesn't know how long she will live,

571
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:45,530
or how long Grandpa Su can keep those memories,

572
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:51,130
but their love, their character made an impression on us.

573
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:55,220
I suppose that is meant by the phrase "although life may be limited, the spirit is immortal".

574
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:12,290
Jin Shan.

575
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,700
Here.

576
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,490
Take care.

577
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:22,010
- The patient's condition? 
 - Transferred from Huangcun Hospital.

578
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:23,560
Persistent abdominal pain and reduced of urination.

579
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,290
- Serum creatinine at 820. 
 - Take him to the emergency room.

580
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:27,410
Get Doctor Bai.

581
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:29,010
Keep steady!

582
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:33,600
Let's stop him vomiting. He needs cimetidine and vitamin B6, intravenously.

583
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,170
Yes.

584
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:38,910
- Uremia. 
 - Uremia wouldn't cause so much vomiting. 
(TN: Uremia is a build up of toxins in the blood)

585
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:41,050
- The patient's relatives? 
 - Here.

586
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:43,090
I'm his wife and this is my daughter.

587
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:45,690
- When did he become ill? 
 - Four or five days ago.

588
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:49,830
Because he had foot pain he was prescribed two days of Chinese medicine.

589
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:52,160
But he started to vomit blood.

590
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,830
We went to the local hospital

591
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:55,880
and they found that his kidney function was very bad.

592
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,520
They said it could already be uremia.

593
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,460
Has he had hemodialysis?

594
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:03,570
The local hospital couldn't do it, so they transferred him here.

595
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:07,500
Chen Zhi, contact the hemodialysis lab.

596
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:11,190
Doctor, what is wrong with him. It's not really uremia, is it?

597
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:13,220
I hope it's uremia.

598
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,470
- Ying Ying. 
 - At the moment we can't be sure.

599
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:19,290
There are many reasons for high serum creatinine levels. Let's get his levels down first,

600
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:21,700
and then see what caused it.

601
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,450
He should be moved to the EICU.

602
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:26,810
Head Nurse, take the family to complete the hospitalization procedures.

603
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,590
Yes. Come with me.

604
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:29,710
Ok.

605
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:31,650
Ying Ying, stay with your dad, ok?

606
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:34,600
I don't want to, I'm going with you.

607
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:43,070
Here.

608
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:50,630
It's interesting, isn't it?

609
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:53,230
You really must be bored.

610
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:55,760
I was talking about her attitude to her dad.

611
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,600
I know!
