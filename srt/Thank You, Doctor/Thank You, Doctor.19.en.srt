00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,599
(Thank You, Doctor)

00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:30,159
(Adapted from the novel "ICU 48 Hours" by Sheng Li)

3
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,000
(Episode 19)

4
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,680
Dr. Bai.

5
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,120
Xiao Guang is awake.

6
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,799
I'm here...

7
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:54,439
to apologize to you.

8
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,799
Dr. Xu told me...

9
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,239
about you and Xiao Guang.

10
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,400
Xu Yi Ran, that blabbermouth.

11
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,599
What did he say to you?

12
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:10,090
He told me about Xiao Guang's condition...

13
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,759
and your not giving up.

14
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,090
You as a doctor...

15
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,599
and Xiao Guang as a patient...

16
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:16,960
never gave up.

17
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,439
That's how you made the impossible again and again

18
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,530
I admire your persistence and courage.

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,530
And I apologize for misunderstanding you.

20
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,280
So...

21
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:33,439
are you going to agree with my beliefs...

22
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:35,599
or are you going to convince me to agree with you again?

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,719
A person's belief is formed over a long period of life experiences.

24
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,960
Once it's formed,

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,240
it's hard to change.

26
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,840
That's right.

27
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,080
They say a leopard can't change its spots.

28
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:49,680
That's why I have no intention of surrendering.

29
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,879
I won't persuade you like before either.

30
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:55,120
I just came to show my respect.

31
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,120
Although I don't agree,

32
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,680
I understand your point of view...

33
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,319
and respect your choice.

34
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,439
A lot has happened lately.

35
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,599
It has changed my opinion of you.

36
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,680
Although I don't agree with your beliefs,

37
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,280
I think...

38
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:11,879
we're the same kind of person.

39
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,439
Let's agree to disagree and give up the rivalry...

40
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,879
and help more patients.

41
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,319
You've said so much yet I still think...

42
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,199
that my belief is right.

43
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,960
Let's agree to disagree.

44
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,039
I'm going to make my rounds.

45
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,560
Xiao Guang told me...

46
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:44,520
you look very cool when you ride your bike.

47
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,599
If you have time, visit him often...

48
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,879
and talk to him about bikes.

49
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,439
I will.

50
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,039
I don't know what's with this kid's taste.

51
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:17,480
If it really hurts,

52
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,680
I'll have them give you a painkiller shot.

53
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,079
Mr. Jiang, are you in a lot of pain?

54
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,399
Xiao Guang.

55
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,439
Are we disturbing you?

56
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,639
No.

57
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,360
My illness hurts all the time.

58
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,439
But I'm not as strong as Mr. Jiang.

59
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:38,730
Sometimes when I'm in a lot of pain, I'll yell.

60
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,319
But my dad said it will affect others.

61
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,610
But sometimes, I just can't help it.

62
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,000
Mr. Jiang.

63
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,879
If you're in a lot of pain, you should scream.

64
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,399
Then it won't hurt as much.

65
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,399
Little brat.

66
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:52,079
You know what pain is?

67
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,360
True pain...

68
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:00,050
is when nothing you do helps.

69
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,759
Then think about...

70
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,439
what makes you the happiest.

71
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:05,240
The more you think about it, the less it hurts.

72
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,730
That's what my dad taught me.

73
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,199
He said when you're thinking about something happy,

74
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:11,120
the body will secrete a substance.

75
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,680
That substance can alleviate the pain in the body.

76
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,170
I think about the time Dad took me out to play football.

77
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,959
Thinking about it made my pain go away.

78
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,050
Mr. Jiang, do you want to give it a try?

79
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,639
All my life,

80
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,360
there's nothing to be happy about.

81
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,040
Xiao Guang.

82
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,160
He's tired.

83
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,600
Why don't you rest for a while too?

84
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,959
Thank you.

85
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,959
Does it feel better now?

86
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,399
Xiao Guang is so cute.

87
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:56,959
I wonder what his mom looks like.

88
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:59,360
What? Are you trying to replace her?

89
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,040
I'm not capable of that.

90
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,600
Dr. Bai is so picky.

91
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,959
His wife must be a beautiful and talented woman.

92
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,399
His son is eight years old.

93
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,600
Why do all the good men get married so early?

94
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,000
Did I hear you right?

95
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,720
How is he a good man?

96
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,560
You're just prejudiced against him.

97
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,639
- You can't see the big picture. - Hey.

98
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:19,360
You two.

99
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,199
It's time to work.

100
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,600
Are you not busy?

101
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:26,319
I'm done.

102
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,240
Dr. Xu.

103
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,639
Come here for a second.

104
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,720
What is it?

105
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,600
You're closest to Dr. Bai.

106
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:38,199
You must know how his wife looks like.

107
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,800
Bai Zhu isn't married.

108
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,000
Nonsense.

109
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:43,560
How could he have a child when he's not married?

110
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,199
You'll have to ask him yourself.

111
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,720
I'm not at liberty to say.

112
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:47,959
He's a bad person.

113
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,079
What kind of logic is that?

114
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:52,920
How is he a bad person?

115
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,240
He had a child out of wedlock...

116
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,399
and then broke up with her.

117
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,079
Isn't that bad?

118
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Your brain is too big.

119
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,040
You could write a soap opera.

120
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,680
I'm impressed, Tang Hua.

121
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,199
I don't think Dr. Bai is like what you described either.

122
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,079
He's only hiding the fact because he feels guilty.

123
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,879
I must have guessed right.

124
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,360
Did you not take your medicine today?

125
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,000
What's going on?

126
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:32,959
What do you mean?

127
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,480
You're playing dumb again.

128
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:37,279
What's going on between you and Xiao Yan?

129
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,199
What's wrong with the two of us?

130
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,319
Come on.

131
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,800
Even Chen Zhi that blockhead could tell.

132
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,680
Do you think I'm blind?

133
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,560
Did you make up with her?

134
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,920
Are you back to the flirting status that you were?

135
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,000
No. When were we flirting?

136
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,920
Don't tell me.

137
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,759
You really live up to the old saying.

138
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,480
The tree wants peace, but the wind won't stop blowing.

139
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,279
There's always someone like you...

140
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,439
around talented people who is such a tattletale.

141
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,160
Forget it. I'm full.

142
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,639
You can eat by yourself.

143
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:19,839
- Hello. - Dr. Bai.

144
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,279
Xiao Guang is in a lot of pain.

145
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,800
Okay, I'll be right there.

146
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,519
Have some water, okay?

147
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,639
Don't get up.

148
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,210
Yes, lie down.

149
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,240
One more sip.

150
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,600
Good boy.

151
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,159
Did it hurt a lot earlier?

152
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm much better now.

153
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,240
Did you reach Dr. Bai?

154
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,240
Yes.

155
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,799
- You're so brave. - Xiao Guang.

156
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Dad.

157
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:55,330
Does it still hurt?

158
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,879
I'm much better.

159
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:58,279
What happened?

160
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,600
The pain was acting up.

161
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,399
This kid is really something.

162
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,600
He didn't cry or scream.

163
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:06,240
He just endured it by himself.

164
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,639
That's how his illness is.

165
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,240
It hurts every day.

166
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,480
You're still so young, but already suffering so much.

167
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,799
It's okay, Ms. Lin.

168
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:15,960
I'm used to it.

169
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,559
My dad also said,

170
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,879
a real man should endure hardships.

171
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,840
Only then can he protect others.

172
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,879
You're so sensible.

173
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,799
All because I have a worrying dad.

174
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:32,090
How is there a son like you?

175
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:34,720
How dare you bully your dad in front of others?

176
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,279
Are you Ms. Xiao Yan who rides the bike?

177
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,279
You know me?

178
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,759
He talks about you all the time at home.

179
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,159
What are you talking about?

180
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,450
I never did that.

181
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:01,159
I was just kidding. It's a kid's joke.

182
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,559
Since Xiao Guang is fine,

183
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,450
we'll get going.

184
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,039
Bye, Xiao Guang.

185
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,360
Okay. Bye, Ms. Xiao and Ms. Lin.

186
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,120
Bye, Ms. Tang.

187
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,090
How did you know I'm Ms. Tang?

188
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,450
Did your dad badmouth me at home?

189
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,210
No. I heard from Mr. Xu Yi Ran.

190
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:24,720
He said...

191
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,600
there's a pretty but terrifying aunt in the EICU.

192
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,559
I recognized you as soon as you came in.

193
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:31,000
You're such a sweet talker.

194
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:32,600
But I'm not an aunt.

195
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:34,279
You should call me Pretty Lady.

196
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,000
Okay, from now on, I'll call you Pretty Lady.

197
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,039
- It's a deal. - It's a deal.

198
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,879
- Bye. - Bye.

199
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,799
I'll get him another gown.

200
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,450
He was sweating from the pain.

201
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:47,600
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

202
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:56,919
I didn't know...

203
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,320
you were quite sociable.

204
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,480
I learned from you.

205
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,840
From me?

206
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,919
You forced me.

207
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,399
When did I force you?

208
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,639
I'm just kidding. It's a kid's joke.

209
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,039
I think...

210
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:18,639
Xiao Guang isn't Bai Zhu's biological child.

211
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,519
How could someone like him...

212
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:24,240
have such a cute child?

213
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:27,759
It's true Xiao Guang's personality is not like Dr. Bai's.

214
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,320
He doesn't have a mom.

215
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:31,440
And he's so cute.

216
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:33,159
He must be adopted.

217
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:36,240
Get back to work.

218
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,399
I'm sure of it.

219
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,240
Ms. Jiang.

220
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,480
Ms. Jiang.

221
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,639
It's time for Mr. Jiang's medicine.

222
00:11:58,039 --> 00:11:59,279
He's asleep so early.

223
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,559
He was in a lot of pain today.

224
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,279
He must have been exhausted.

225
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,759
Doesn't he have anemia? Does it hurt that much?

226
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,639
What Xiao Guang has is thalassemia.

227
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:18,720
It's a hereditary hemolytic anemia disease.

228
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,320
There are many symptoms to this illness.

229
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:23,919
Xiao Guang has the most serious one.

230
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,720
His whole body aches as if poked by needles.

231
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:29,039
I did some research.

232
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:30,840
His level of pain...

233
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:32,639
is almost the same...

234
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,279
as your level of cancer.

235
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,159
This child...

236
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:42,159
is so sensible that it feels bad.

237
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,240
Many parents...

238
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:47,200
would give up in the face of this illness.

239
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,559
Is it a fatal disease?

240
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:52,120
Xiao Guang's thalassemia is the severe kind.

241
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:55,039
Many kids like him die at the age of five or six.

242
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:57,720
It's not easy to survive until eight...

243
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,919
like him.

244
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:00,039
Moreover,

245
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,159
this child is still so optimistic.

246
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,759
Is there no cure?

247
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,559
Does he have to live In fear of death for the rest of his life?

248
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:09,840
Bone marrow transplantation and cord blood transplantation...

249
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,120
are the only cures to this disease.

250
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,639
But Xiao Guang...

251
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,759
never seems to find a match.

252
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,440
He's such a cute kid.

253
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,159
God is so cruel.

254
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,279
Dr. Xiao.

255
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,320
Can you tell me more about this child's story?

256
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,200
Do you know why...

257
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,840
insisted on saving you and didn't give up?

258
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,600
Is it related to this child?

259
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,799
Xiao Guang is diagnosed...

260
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,480
at birth.

261
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,399
Many doctors thought he wouldn't live past his first birthday.

262
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:45,080
Only Dr. Bai...

263
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:46,759
never gave up.

264
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:55,559
(Tongshan Hospital)

265
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,360
Ever since you've been hospitalized,

266
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:00,720
you've been eating more.

267
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,559
It takes a lot of energy when I'm in pain.

268
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:07,240
Does it still hurt?

269
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,840
Not anymore.

270
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,440
Is it enough?

271
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,840
I'm full.

272
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,639
Don't just stay here.

273
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:19,720
It shows that you don't like to work.

274
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,000
Go back to work now.

275
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,639
You know how to chase me away now.

276
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,399
Fine.

277
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:32,320
I'll get back to work then.

278
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:34,559
If it hurts again, tell them to reach me.

279
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:36,200
If you want water,

280
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,559
ask Ms. Jiang for it.

281
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:39,279
Okay.

282
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,519
Fine.

283
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,360
Don't worry. I'll keep an eye on him.

284
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,759
Thank you.

285
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,080
I'll get going.

286
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:55,159
Are you full?

287
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,360
Yes.

288
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,679
Your hair is a bit long.

289
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:01,240
I'll get the tools later and trim it for you, okay?

290
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,039
Ms. Jiang, you know how to cut hair too?

291
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:04,399
- Of course. - You're amazing.

292
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,240
It might turn out ugly though.

293
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,360
Xiao Guang.

294
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,399
Didn't you say...

295
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,480
it won't hurt if you scream?

296
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,960
Why did not scream?

297
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:16,559
I didn't want to bother you.

298
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,720
I also didn't want my dad to worry.

299
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,679
When I'm in a lot of pain while alone at home,

300
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:23,879
I'll scream.

301
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:31,519
You're so sensible.

302
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,240
Do you know...

303
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,879
that your illness...

304
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,679
might not be curable?

305
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,279
Xian Yun.

306
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,559
It's okay, Ms. Jiang.

307
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,840
I know.

308
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,440
Xiao Guang.

309
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:50,879
You might die if it's not cured.

310
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,360
Are you scared?

311
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,759
What are you saying?

312
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,639
I just want to talk to him.

313
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:57,519
He's still a kid.

314
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:59,679
- What are you talking about? - Xiao Shan.

315
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,440
You've been here all day.

316
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:04,320
Why don't you go and take a walk in the yard?

317
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:05,840
I'm not going.

318
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,320
Don't worry.

319
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:09,519
I like this kid.

320
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,679
I won't do anything stupid.

321
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:12,960
How about this?

322
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,320
Go to the market downstairs...

323
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:17,360
and buy some yogurt for Xiao Guang and me.

324
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:18,600
My favorite one.

325
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,120
Go on.

326
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,679
Go on.

327
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,960
Do you drink yogurt?

328
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,440
It's okay, Ms. Jiang.

329
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,320
Don't be shy. I know you like it.

330
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,639
I'll go buy it now.

331
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,840
Thank you, Ms. Jiang.

332
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,039
Ms. Jiang, remember to wear your jacket.

333
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:39,799
Got it.

334
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:42,080
Xiao Guang.

335
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,639
Thank you.

336
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,799
Xiao Guang, come here.

337
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,720
Come and sit with me.

338
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,360
Come.

339
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,720
You haven't answered me.

340
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,839
If you're not cured, you'll die.

341
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:10,920
Are you scared?

342
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,319
I'm not.

343
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,410
Why?

344
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,079
Mr. Jiang, are you afraid of dying?

345
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,650
I'm not afraid.

346
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,920
I want to die, but they won't let me.

347
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,279
Do you know what death is?

348
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,519
I know.

349
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:27,279
Don't think I'm just an eight-year-old.

350
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:29,359
I know what death is.

351
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,480
I've seen it many times on the TV and Internet.

352
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,720
If I die,

353
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,440
I won't know anything.

354
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:39,480
I'll never see my teacher and classmates anymore.

355
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,480
I'll never see my dad anymore.

356
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,720
That's right.

357
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:45,000
You won't be able to see your dad,

358
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:46,319
your teachers and classmates.

359
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:48,279
You won't know anything. It's so scary.

360
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,759
But...

361
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:51,839
everyone dies eventually.

362
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:53,279
There's no point in being afraid.

363
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:56,279
We might as well live each day to the fullest.

364
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:59,759
And you know what, Mr. Jiang?

365
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,720
Just because I have this illness,

366
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:04,599
my teachers, classmates, and my dad...

367
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,240
all don't get mad at me.

368
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,480
They're so nice to me.

369
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,960
Some of the kids in my class have very fierce parents.

370
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:11,599
They even envy me for being sick.

371
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
This is called...

372
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,759
a blessing in disguise.

373
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,200
What does it mean?

374
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,890
It's an idiom.

375
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:23,200
The story goes like this.

376
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,680
In ancient times, there was an old man in the frontier.

377
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:26,890
His name was Sai Weng.

378
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:29,519
He had a very nice horse.

379
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,480
Then one day, it went missing.

380
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,410
His neighbors...

381
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,279
all came to comfort him...

382
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:36,519
and told him not to be sad.

383
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,960
Sai Weng said,

384
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:39,599
"I lost the horse."

385
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,119
"But who knows?"

386
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,200
"It might be a good thing."

387
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:45,920
Not long after that,

388
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,839
this fine horse that went missing...

389
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,039
suddenly returned.

390
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:51,720
And it brought back another fine horse with him.

391
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,680
The neighbors came running again...

392
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,839
to congratulate him.

393
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,279
But Sai Weng wasn't happy.

394
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,680
He said, "How do you know..."

395
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,890
"what was brought back..."

396
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:04,200
"isn't a disaster?"

397
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,359
A few days later,

398
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,650
Sai Weng's only son fell...

399
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:12,680
- Ms. Jiang. - from the back of the horse.

400
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,680
He broke his leg...

401
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,359
and became crippled.

402
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,279
Sai Weng's neighbors...

403
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:21,839
came running again.

404
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,279
They wanted to comfort him.

405
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:28,480
Overjoyed, Sai Weng said,

406
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:29,960
"How do you know?"

407
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:32,410
"It might be a good thing."

408
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:36,279
Then a war broke on the frontier.

409
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,279
All young men had to enlist in the army...

410
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,599
and go to war.

411
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,839
At the battlefield,

412
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,839
nine out of ten people died.

413
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:48,519
Due to his leg injury,

414
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,759
Sai Weng's son survived.

415
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:53,410
He avoided the disaster of life and death.

416
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,079
Mr. Jiang, I understand now.

417
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:59,119
This story talks about...

418
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:01,890
how good things can be bad and vice versa.

419
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,119
Is it blessing or bane?

420
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,960
Whichever it is,

421
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:08,559
it will change under certain conditions.

422
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,559
You have to...

423
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,079
see things as they should be.

424
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,200
Whether it's good or bad,

425
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,000
you have to adjust your mindset...

426
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:18,319
to face it and accept it bravely.

427
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,650
Mr. Jiang, you're amazing.

428
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:23,519
You sounded like my language teacher.

429
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:26,599
Mr. Jiang.

430
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,039
Were you a teacher before?

431
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:32,920
I really was...

432
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:35,000
a teacher.

433
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:38,650
But that was a long time ago.

434
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:43,279
Why did you quit being a teacher then?

435
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:45,680
Was it because you were sick?

436
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:51,279
I...

437
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,039
had a car accident.

438
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,480
And I couldn't stand on the podium anymore.

439
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:04,000
But you spoke really well just now.

440
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,079
Even better than my language teacher.

441
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,599
Little brat.

442
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,839
You're a sweet talker.

443
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:14,079
By the way, Mr. Jiang.

444
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,890
If you can't stand on the podium,

445
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,720
you can give lectures online.

446
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,410
What?

447
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,890
Give lectures online.

448
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:23,000
Give lectures online?

449
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:25,440
That's right. I'm in too much pain sometimes,

450
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,559
I take classes online because I can't go to school.

451
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,839
It's very convenient.

452
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,890
- Really? - Yes.

453
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:33,559
Xiao Guang, tell me more.

454
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:35,599
How do I give lectures online?

455
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,839
Sure.

456
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,559
There's some software to give online lectures.

457
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:42,650
For example...

458
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:03,960
Dear students, for this class...

459
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,559
Let's learn about wine.

460
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:25,880
What are the poems about wine?

461
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:27,799
In what categories can they be divided into?

462
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,160
(Tongshan Hospital)

463
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,519
Get back to work.

464
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:52,839
Dr. Bai.

465
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,079
Dr. Xu.

466
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,480
Dr. Lu.

467
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,079
Xian Yun asked me to bring him here.

468
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:59,799
He has something to say.

469
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:01,599
Dr. Bai.

470
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,920
Thank you for saving me.

471
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,359
In the past few days,

472
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:10,519
I've caused you a lot of trouble.

473
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:12,559
From now on,

474
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:15,359
I'll live well.

475
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,200
As for why I came today...

476
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,519
To be honest,

477
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:24,319
it's quite embarrassing.

478
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:26,720
Xiao Guang...

479
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:28,279
changed me.

480
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:31,640
Xiao Guang's pain...

481
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,519
in the face of illness...

482
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:37,079
and the fear of death...

483
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:39,279
are no less than mine.

484
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,160
Besides, he's only an eight-year-old child.

485
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,319
But he always gritted his teeth...

486
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,680
to face the unknown future...

487
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:50,319
with strength and a smile.

488
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,880
To be honest,

489
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:54,920
when Xiao Guang just moved in...

490
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,319
to the bed next to me,

491
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,000
I was really annoyed with him.

492
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,400
After all, he is Dr. Bai's son.

493
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,799
But later on,

494
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:10,759
every time I saw him,

495
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,519
I'd feel embarrassed.

496
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,240
Compared to Xiao Guang,

497
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,279
I'm more like...

498
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,400
a timid and cowardly child,

499
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:21,839
while Xiao Guang is the mature and brave adult.

500
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:26,039
Xiao Guang's strength...

501
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,720
and optimism changed me.

502
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:30,119
I've rediscovered...

503
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,599
the value and meaning of living.

504
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,720
Xiao Guang is like a small sun.

505
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,920
Xian Yun used to be a good teacher.

506
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:45,279
Due to the car accident,

507
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,680
he left the podium.

508
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,000
It was Xiao Guang who gave him hope.

509
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:52,720
These days,

510
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,519
I often dream about the time...

511
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,599
when I used to stand on the podium.

512
00:24:57,759 --> 00:24:59,960
Life was full back then.

513
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,759
it was full of hope.

514
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:05,519
I want to live like that again.

515
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:08,599
I want to live a life filled with hope.

516
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,039
Xiao Guang told me...

517
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,480
a lot of people teach online nowadays.

518
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,759
They're not limited by the time and place...

519
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,480
nor their physical condition.

520
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,039
Although I'm not the best teacher,

521
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:25,400
I've had a lot of life experience.

522
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:31,119
Today, I'm here to tell Dr. Lu...

523
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,720
that I want to be discharged.

524
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,400
I want to use...

525
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,119
my remaining time...

526
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:39,880
to go home and organize my teaching experience.

527
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,920
I want to teach online.

528
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:45,920
I want to help the kids...

529
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,839
who can't enter their classrooms physically.

530
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,680
It's also...

531
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,839
my little contribution...

532
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,599
to the society.

533
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:06,119
Mr. Jiang.

534
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:08,960
To be honest,

535
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,759
everyone is happy that you can think this way.

536
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,000
Do you know what?

537
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:14,480
You're setting a good example...

538
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:15,839
to those in pain.

539
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:18,000
No matter what happens,

540
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:20,200
you must have hope.

541
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,880
Be strong and live on.

542
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,640
Be happy every day.

543
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,759
Okay.

544
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,039
Dr. Lu.

545
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,680
For the past few days,

546
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,920
- I've caused you a lot of trouble. - Not at all.

547
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,799
Especially Dr. Bai.

548
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,720
I really hope...

549
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,119
you can forgive me.

550
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,279
It's okay.

551
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,440
There's nothing to forgive.

552
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,480
Between doctors and patients,

553
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,119
understanding is a must.

554
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:54,799
Dr. Bai.

555
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:56,400
Thank you...

556
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,240
and Xiao Guang.

557
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:05,880
We'll get going.

558
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:09,640
Xiao Bai.

559
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:11,240
Thank you so much.

560
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,759
I should thank Xiao Guang too.

561
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,799
You and the kid are always welcome to my home.

562
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:17,599
- Okay. - I'm leaving.

563
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,480
Bye.

564
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:21,000
- Bye. - Bye.

565
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,079
Thank you.

566
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:23,920
- Bye. - Bye.

567
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,119
Ms. Jiang finally did it.

568
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:40,920
Come to think of it,

569
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:42,920
we have to thank Xiao Guang.

570
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,359
If it weren't for him,

571
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:47,039
Mr. Jiang would probably fight until the end...

572
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,039
with us.

573
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,480
Dr. Bai, I've always wanted to ask.

574
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,000
How did you educate Xiao Guang?

575
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:53,519
He's too sensible.

576
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:54,920
He's my son.

577
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,880
Of course he learned from me.

578
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,640
Have you forgotten what Xiao Guang said?

579
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,279
- He has a worrying dad. - He has a worrying dad.

580
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:05,960
- One, two, three. - All right.

581
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,279
- Okay. - Dr. Lu.

582
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:08,400
I shouldn't have...

583
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,759
It's all right. Let bygones be bygones.

584
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:10,920
Let's not talk about it.

585
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
We should look ahead.

586
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,400
Yes, let's move on.

587
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,599
Come, raise your arms.

588
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:16,720
Are you tired?

589
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,519
Get some sleep.

590
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,000
- Dr. Lu. - Get some rest.

591
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,119
Close your eyes and get some sleep.

592
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,000
Dr. Lu, sit down. I'll get you...

593
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,440
- The house has been empty... - There's no need.

594
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:37,119
Xian Yun's thinking has changed so much.

595
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:38,920
It's quite comforting.

596
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,279
Yes.

597
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:42,000
I'm really grateful to Xiao Guang.

598
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:44,079
He's getting better.

599
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:45,680
You can relax now.

600
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,400
You've been so busy lately...

601
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,519
that you're looking haggard.

602
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:51,480
You should get some rest too.

603
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,799
Take care of yourself.

604
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:54,359
As long as Xian Yun is okay,

605
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,079
I can do anything.

606
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,880
Dr. Lu.

607
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,720
With Xian Yun's condition,

608
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:02,839
I don't think he can be left alone.

609
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,279
I'm afraid I have to look after him at home.

610
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,319
I know.

611
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,839
Don't worry about the department. Leave it all to me.

612
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Just take care of Xian Yun.

613
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,440
Xian Yun's condition...

614
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,640
won't go away in a day or two.

615
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,480
Besides,

616
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,000
all this while,

617
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,920
we've been such a nuisance to the department.

618
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:27,359
One person is worth eight people in the department.

619
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,640
And you always take care of me.

620
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,119
It'll affect you.

621
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,240
No.

622
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,079
- Well... - I've decided.

623
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:37,559
I'll resign.

624
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:39,200
Resign?

625
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,559
You're overthinking it, Ms. Jiang.

626
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,119
Don't try to dissuade me.

627
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:49,400
Dr. Lu.

628
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,039
This is my resignation letter.

629
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,599
I still have things to do.

630
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:57,599
I'll get going now.

631
00:29:57,799 --> 00:29:59,240
You don't have to see me out. I'm leaving.

632
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,599
Dr. Lu!

633
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,920
Mr. Pan.

634
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,160
It's Lu Ping An.

635
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,359
Mr. Jiang has been discharged.

636
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,480
Do you still want to help out at their house?

637
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,039
All right. It's still the same as before.

638
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,960
As for the missing money, I'll pay it back for you.

639
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,799
Don't let it slip.

640
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,680
Okay.

641
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:28,920
I think...

642
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,839
you should give them a call.

643
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:33,039
Just ask them if they need you there.

644
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,039
Just say you know Mr. Jiang has been discharged,

645
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:38,079
so you wanted to check on him.

646
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:40,799
Okay.

647
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,440
You talk on the phone first.

648
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,319
Tell me when it's done.

649
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,920
Okay.

650
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,559
Why didn't you sleep?

651
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:59,000
- I did. - Did we wake you up?

652
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,160
No.

653
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,079
Honey. Come, sit with me.

654
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:05,880
What's wrong?

655
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:07,640
Nothing.

656
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,759
Dr. Lu left?

657
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:10,400
Something came up at work.

658
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,039
- Right, I'll boil some water. - Don't bother.

659
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:14,799
Sit with me for a while. I want to talk to you.

660
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:17,599
What's the matter?

661
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,519
I heard everything when you were talking to Dr. Lu.

662
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:25,599
Honey, promise me.

663
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,720
Don't quit, okay?

664
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:30,920
Promise me.

665
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,319
If I don't quit,

666
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,680
who will take care of you?

667
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,240
I know you too well.

668
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,759
Too well.

669
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:51,759
You've worked at Tongshan Hospital...

670
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:52,960
since graduating from nursing school.

671
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,720
This job is too important to you.

672
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:58,160
No matter how important it is,

673
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:00,400
it can't compare to you.

674
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,519
I was wrong.

675
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:10,960
I was too egoistic.

676
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,519
I don't want to be a burden to others or to you.

677
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,599
But I understand now.

678
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,359
I want to see you keep working happily.

679
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,000
That way, I can work comfortably, right?

680
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,119
Look.

681
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:26,440
I've already consulted them.

682
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,240
The website will pay me...

683
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,920
for teaching online.

684
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,119
This way, I can earn my own money.

685
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:33,799
Don't worry.

686
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,759
I won't do anything stupid like that again.

687
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,720
I'll give Mr. Pan a call.

688
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:41,240
If he's willing to come back, that's even better.

689
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,160
If he's not willing to come, we can find someone else.

690
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:47,400
I know what you're worried about.

691
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,319
I won't do anything stupid again.

692
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,319
I already know the value and meaning of living.

693
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,319
Really?

694
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:01,599
Really.

695
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:14,359
Okay.

696
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:16,440
I'll work hard.

697
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,480
Then you give good lectures too.

698
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,799
There are 12 rabbits...

699
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:41,519
and 23 chickens.

700
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:43,799
Ms. Xiao.

701
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,680
Look, did I get it right?

702
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:48,799
You're absolutely right.

703
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,960
That's great.

704
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,359
I used to be afraid of solving problems like this.

705
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,000
I finally know how to solve them now.

706
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,160
Thank you, Ms. Xiao.

707
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,640
That's because you're so smart.

708
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,960
You're so quick-witted.

709
00:33:58,039 --> 00:34:00,119
But why didn't you ask Dr. Bai?

710
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:01,960
I heard he used to be a top student...

711
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,960
back in school.

712
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,799
I asked him, but he wouldn't help me.

713
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,000
Why?

714
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,279
Every time I ask him,

715
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,480
he'd always say,

716
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:09,880
"A man has to rely on himself."

717
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:11,159
"You can't rely on others...

718
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,880
whenever there's a problem."

719
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:14,559
But he's your dad.

720
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:17,039
He should be the one to teach you all this.

721
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:19,079
It's his duty as a father.

722
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:21,039
Yes, that's what I told him.

723
00:34:21,329 --> 00:34:22,329
And his answer to me was,

724
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,000
"Search online."

725
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,960
Well, he's not a very good father then.

726
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,840
Actually, sometimes,

727
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,079
I know how to solve the math problems...

728
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,400
and spell the English words.

729
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,199
I pretend not to know them on purpose and asked him.

730
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:34,920
But he always says he doesn't know.

731
00:34:36,289 --> 00:34:40,119
In the words of Mr. Xu and Ms. Zheng,

732
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,559
my dad is someone who needs a sense of presence.

733
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,639
If I don't act like I don't know...

734
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,519
and ask him questions back and forth,

735
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,119
he'll lose his sense of presence.

736
00:34:48,289 --> 00:34:49,639
Once he loses his sense of presence,

737
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,079
there will be trouble for me.

738
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,239
Dr. Bai is so weak.

739
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,159
Yes, my dad is fragile.

740
00:34:55,329 --> 00:34:57,000
He's more of a child than I am.

741
00:34:57,079 --> 00:34:59,440
When he thinks people don't take him seriously...

742
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:01,000
or steal his thunder,

743
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:02,719
he can stay mad for days.

744
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,360
He'll play games every day to vent.

745
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,480
He's so childish.

746
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:06,639
Very childish.

747
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,039
And sometimes, not sometimes.

748
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:10,289
It's every time.

749
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,239
I have to cheer him up...

750
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:13,480
on purpose...

751
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,679
before he recovers.

752
00:35:15,289 --> 00:35:17,199
It's tiring to be his son.

753
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:18,769
It must be hard on you.

754
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,289
Not at all.

755
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:22,599
Xiao Guang, I'll get back to work.

756
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,400
Dr. Bai.

757
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,039
Are you here to see Xiao Guang?

758
00:35:34,289 --> 00:35:35,480
You're here too.

759
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,000
I'll get back to work.

760
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,639
Dad.

761
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,840
Tell me.

762
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,440
Did you do something wrong again today?

763
00:35:56,519 --> 00:35:57,559
I'm sorry, Dad.

764
00:35:57,559 --> 00:35:59,159
When I had lunch today,

765
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,400
I shouldn't have left half a bowl.

766
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,599
It's a shame to waste food.

767
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,400
Every grain of rice is a product of hard work.

768
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:04,769
You're still talking nonsense.

769
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:07,400
- I'm talking about earlier. - Just now,

770
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,599
I shouldn't have asked Ms. Xiao for help.

771
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:09,769
A man should rely on himself.

772
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,289
Is that what I'm talking about?

773
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,039
Bai Ji Guang.

774
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:14,639
You're good.

775
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:18,000
Now you know how to talk behind my back now.

776
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,039
- What? - Am I as fragile and childish...

777
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:21,289
as you said?

778
00:36:21,289 --> 00:36:22,719
Dad, listen to me.

779
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,329
Haven't you always lectured me to tell the truth?

780
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,480
Is that the truth?

781
00:36:28,329 --> 00:36:29,440
Don't fall.

782
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,159
Also,

783
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:33,329
when did I need a sense of presence?

784
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:34,809
Anyway, what I said is true.

785
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:39,289
I won't hit you.

786
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:41,199
Do you think...

787
00:36:41,329 --> 00:36:42,960
I won't be able to control you?

788
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,289
From now on,

789
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:47,000
I'll cut your weekly allowance in half.

790
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,119
No!

791
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:49,559
No, Dad. I'm sorry.

792
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:50,809
No...

793
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:51,920
Dad, you didn't see it.

794
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,440
I didn't mean to slander you.

795
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:55,400
When Ms. Xiao and I were talking about you,

796
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,840
she was so happy and kept asking me about you.

797
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:01,329
What did she ask?

798
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,679
Let me tell you.

799
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:09,719
Why don't you ask her yourself?

800
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:11,039
- I'm going to bed. - You...

801
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:13,159
- Finish what you're going to say. - It hurts.

802
00:37:13,809 --> 00:37:15,400
No, Dad. I'm a patient.

803
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,809
You can't beat me like this.

804
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,719
I can't be in pain.

805
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,039
I'm going to sleep. I'm a patient too.

806
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,960
Fine.

807
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:26,199
Sleep.

808
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:27,639
Sleep until you die.

809
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:30,239
Good night.

810
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,159
Good night.

811
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,960
Bye.

812
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,559
See you tomorrow.

813
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,000
Dr. Bai.

814
00:37:52,329 --> 00:37:53,400
Don't you have to take care of Xiao Guang?

815
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:55,639
He's sound asleep.

816
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:00,239
Tang Hua mentioned you today.

817
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:02,880
She has changed her opinion of you because of Xiao Guang...

818
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,769
and hasn't bad-mouthed you in a while.

819
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,880
If one always badmouths me,

820
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,079
that only means...

821
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:11,039
I'm important to them.

822
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,329
That's the sense of presence Xiao Guang mentioned.

823
00:38:14,289 --> 00:38:16,079
Don't listen to him.

824
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,809
But the relationship between you two is quite interesting.

825
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:23,719
From what Xiao Guang said,

826
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,639
at home, he's the adult that takes care of you.

827
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,840
You're the kid he takes care of.

828
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,639
By saying that,

829
00:38:33,289 --> 00:38:35,719
you complimented my son yet belittled me.

830
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,239
It's hard to react to that.

831
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,329
I wasn't belittling you.

832
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:41,960
I just realized something from what Xiao Guang said.

833
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,039
Underneath that arrogant exterior,

834
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,039
you're genuine and warm-hearted.

835
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,559
That's not what you wanted to say, was it?

836
00:38:56,329 --> 00:38:58,329
Mr. Jiang has been discharged.

837
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,079
I've thought about a lot of things.

838
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:04,039
Including the argument we had the other day.

839
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,639
I've been thinking that if I had followed...

840
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:10,039
my belief during the treatment...

841
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:13,039
which is to let him die as he wished,

842
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,239
then he wouldn't have had the chance...

843
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:17,119
to realize the value and meaning of his life.

844
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,599
So...

845
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:21,559
I'm a bit lost now.

846
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:24,769
What belief is it...

847
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,519
that I seek?

848
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,599
To harm or save people?

849
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,880
What do you think?

850
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,400
I think...

851
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,480
You've improved.

852
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,519
Come in.

853
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,119
Sir.

854
00:40:03,809 --> 00:40:04,880
You wanted to see me?

855
00:40:05,809 --> 00:40:06,960
I'd like to talk to you.

856
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,559
You're always so troublesome.

857
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,199
Have a seat.

858
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:24,329
Go on.

859
00:40:24,809 --> 00:40:26,159
Are you in trouble?

860
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,519
Dr. Xiao told me...

861
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:33,769
that Jiang Xian Yun's case...

862
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:35,440
made her feel lost.

863
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,400
She doesn't know if the belief she's pursuing...

864
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:42,000
is saving or harming lives.

865
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,679
I heard about your argument with Dr. Xiao.

866
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,400
Dr. Xiao is a little lost.

867
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:50,159
What about you?

868
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:53,159
I'm fine.

869
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,809
I don't think...

870
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,599
I made the wrong choice back then.

871
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,440
If I had chosen to listen to the patient's wishes,

872
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,079
he wouldn't have had a chance...

873
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,559
to get back on his feet like now...

874
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,079
and start a new life.

875
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:07,769
If you're so sure,

876
00:41:08,769 --> 00:41:10,119
what did you come to me for?

877
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,809
But...

878
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:16,000
But to be honest, I had second thoughts too.

879
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:17,769
More than once.

880
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:23,329
Every time I pass by the EICU ward...

881
00:41:24,289 --> 00:41:26,880
and hear the screams of excruciating pain,

882
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:28,329
I would think this.

883
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,239
A doctor's duty is to save lives.

884
00:41:33,769 --> 00:41:37,159
But to let a person live in endless pain,

885
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:39,679
am I saving him...

886
00:41:40,329 --> 00:41:41,519
or harming him?

887
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:48,329
Maybe at some point,

888
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,679
it's also a kind of bravery...

889
00:41:52,329 --> 00:41:54,809
to face death in a situation.

890
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,039
It's also...

891
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,679
a kind of respect for life.

892
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:07,079
If that's the way you think,

893
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,079
it proves I was right about you.

894
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,440
I can see...

895
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,039
your reflection on the values...

896
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:17,599
of life, death, and living.

897
00:42:18,809 --> 00:42:19,809
It's good.

898
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:23,880
When you see things from a dialectical perspective,

899
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,039
anything...

900
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:26,559
will have two sides to it.

901
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:29,039
Don't struggle with right or wrong.

902
00:42:29,329 --> 00:42:31,000
Especially us doctors.

903
00:42:31,769 --> 00:42:34,289
As long as we stick to the bottom line.

904
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:36,719
To save lives?

905
00:42:36,809 --> 00:42:37,920
That's right.

906
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:40,769
That's easy to say.

907
00:42:41,329 --> 00:42:42,960
But it's hard to do.

908
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:46,119
It requires a lifetime of effort.

909
00:42:48,289 --> 00:42:49,769
Maybe only until the end...

910
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,559
can we understand...

911
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,519
the true meaning of those words.
