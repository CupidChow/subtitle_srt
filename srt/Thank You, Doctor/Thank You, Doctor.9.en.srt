16
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,610
At the current level of medical technology, we cannot perform surgery on

17
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,340
a patient who is having huge amount of bleeding from the posterior cranial fossa

18
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,180
Even Hua Tuo (a legendary Ancient Chinese surgeon) wouldn't have been able to save the day

19
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,610
What about drug treatment?

20
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:47,010
Current medication can only stop bleeding on local areas

21
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:50,590
It does not have effect on bleeding from the posterior cranial fossa

22
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,590
At least there hasn't been any successful cases

23
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,790
So looking at the current situation, are we basically telling the patient to give up on treatments?

24
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,210
According to the patient's bleeding situation

25
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:04,190
They will survive for 4 to 5 more days at most

26
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:08,910
In this case, there wouldn't be a point persisting with the treatments

27
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,170
The patient is only 18 years old. I'd like to keep trying.

28
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:15,030
How about this. We will ask for the patient's families' opinions

29
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,980
when we see them tomorrow

30
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:28,300
Doctor Xiao, what's happening?

31
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:39,280
Why didn't I insist to get them the CT scan?

32
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,510
Their sickness would be diagnosed and treated timely

33
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,220
then the situation wouldn't have escalated like this

34
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,850
Please don't think it like that

35
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,670
You already did what a doctor is responsible for

36
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,930
It was the patient's families who didn't want to get the CT scan

37
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,540
It was them who signed the papers. It has nothing to do with you

38
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,000
If I could have made the correct diagnosis at that time,

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,210
It wouldn't have been like this if I convinced their families to get the CT scan done

40
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:05,810
But at the time the patient's symptoms were not as noticeable

41
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,420
There was no tinnitus and vomiting

42
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,910
Their cardiopulmonary blood pressure was also normal

43
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,810
Who would've thought he was bleeding from Posterior cranial fossa

44
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,740
We are doctors. We are supposed to think of all possibilities

45
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,910
And plus the patients is only 18

46
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,940
Xiao Yan

47
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,130
I have to tell you

48
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,350
Your condition does not look well right now

49
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,280
Chief lu, I...

50
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,120
I understand

51
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,440
But I'm thinking, If it wasn't for my slip-up...

52
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,820
This was not

53
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,550
Tang Hua is right

54
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,610
I know during the whole process of attending the patient

55
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:54,450
You made the correct diagnosis according to patient's conditions

56
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,560
And fulfilled your responsibility of informing the patient

57
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,100
It only turned out this way because the patient's families did not want to get the CT scan

58
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:06,420
During the whole treatment of the patient Fangnan

59
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,740
I believe you have done nothing wrong

60
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,950
Chief, I... 
 I know

61
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,770
You hold yourself to high standards

62
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,930
And you are a responsible person

63
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,800
But I'd like to remind you

64
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,000
You have to adjust your mindset

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,520
Let's face ourselves and the patient's family

66
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,480
in a professional manner

67
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,760
You especially cannot show guilt

68
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,970
in front of the patient's family

69
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,590
If they see you feeling guilty

70
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:38,500
it is very likely they would threaten you, and even the hospital

71
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,070
We have to take this into consideration, given the tense relationships between doctors and patients nowadays

72
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:45,260
And plus you don't have any responsibility in this incident anyway

73
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,490
I think you are more concerned with this incident affecting your career than anything else

74
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,860
Bai Zhu, I know you have problems with me

75
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:01,740
I am a regular person. I want to get promoted and make a fortune, like anyone else

76
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,930
I am not a saint

77
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,530
It's not that I'm worried that it would affect my career

78
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,400
I am more worried about those things would

79
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,530
impact our passion on being a good doctor

80
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:19,240
and saving lives

81
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,920
If you want to be a good doctor,

82
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,680
the first thing is to learn how to protect yourself

83
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,640
We would only have time and energy to treat illnesses and save people

84
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,730
when we are able to protect ourselves

85
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,870
This is being responsible for ourselves

86
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:36,070
and for those

87
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,230
who are waiting to be treated

88
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,350
Yes, Posterior cranial fossa bleeding

89
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:04,180
Okay, just shoot me an email if you have any info about it

90
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,340
Thank you

Doctor Xiao, are you not going to eat?

108
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:10,620
I don't know what happened to Doctor Xiao these days. She's going nuts

109
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,510
I suspect it's probably because of the patient with Posterior cranial fossa bleeding

110
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,530
It wasn't even her fault

111
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,750
She feels bad

112
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,110
whether or not it was her fault

113
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:24,570
She always thinks that if she persisted, the patient would have a chance to live

114
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,720
I don't know if you noticed

115
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,480
she reminds me of you in certain aspects

116
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,660
In which aspects?

117
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,280
The brain surgeons already said the patient was no hope

118
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:40,080
But she still wouldn't give up, looking for documents and patient cases everywhere

119
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,230
She was looking for miracles

120
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,130
Do you just want to die with the patient?

121
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,850
Are you guys good?

122
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:15,120
I'm fine. But she's not going to be if she keeps up like this

123
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,150
What's happening with you? How do you not see a car this big?

124
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:22,470
I don't know how I got here

125
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,570
I was going to go to ICU

126
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,150
It was that serious?

127
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,110
Dr. Xiao, are you okay?

128
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,090
Good thing Bai Zhu pulled her out of the way,

129
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,300
otherwise there would have been an accident.

130
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,880
When did you become a hero that saves damsels in distress?

131
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,020
I was worried that Tongshan's Emergency Department would become a laughing stock.

132
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:46,540
An ER doctor gets killed by the hospital's ambulance

133
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,970
- in front of the emergency center. 
- Stop it.

134
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,130
Enough with the unnecessary words.

135
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:54,780
He just can't say something nice.

136
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,570
I gathered you all here today

137
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,980
to think about the posterior fossa hemorrhage patient.

138
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,700
I want us to discuss the question of

139
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,810
the boundaries of medicine

140
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,820
and the boundaries of a doctor.

141
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,930
I'll share my thoughts first.

142
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,920
I've worked in the Emergency Department for more than 20 years.

143
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,800
I've helped save many patients.

144
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,140
What I strongly and clearly believe

145
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,700
is that medicine isn't omnipotent

146
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,010
and doctors certainly aren't omnipotent.

147
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,970
There will always be illnesses that we can't treat

148
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:43,700
and lives that we can't save.

149
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,120
I agree.

150
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,360
Dr. Xiao, stop blaming yourself because of that patient.

151
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,370
You'll end up collapsing if you continue.

152
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:55,870
Let me tell you something.

153
00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:01,300
Sometimes we want to save a patient more than they want to save themselves.

154
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,810
Don't burden yourself too much.

155
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,360
I...

156
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,300
When I was an intern after I finished graduate school,

157
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:18,410
there was an ER doctor who was retiring soon.

158
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:22,650
He told me that doctors are a group of people in a race with death.

159
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:26,280
Sometimes they'll win and sometimes they'll lose.

160
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:30,070
Sometimes they're powerless and guaranteed to lose.

161
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,440
But continuing to run until the end of the race

162
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,290
is the greatest respect for life.

163
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,720
Later on, that ER doctor

164
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,420
spent 50 minutes performing CPR by himself

165
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,180
to save a patient who almost drowned.

166
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,160
The patient regained consciousness,

167
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:54,080
but the doctor collapsed and didn't recover.

168
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,080
He managed to finish running the race.

169
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,330
I've always hoped to be a doctor with flesh and blood,

170
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,400
a doctor with emotions,

171
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,480
a doctor who could continue running until the end.

172
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,270
That's why

173
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,730
I want to keep treating

174
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:18,060
the posterior fossa hemorrhage patient.

175
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,580
Xiao Yan put it very well.

176
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,050
I think we should do our best

177
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:38,960
to continue running for the patient instead of giving up.

178
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,260
I have a suggestion. Everyone should help Dr. Xiao,

179
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,770
and keep running to save this patient.

180
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,710
It's for all of our patients.

181
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,380
Let's work together to figure something out.

182
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,670
- Let's work together. 
- Good.

183
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,120
Bai Zhu, what's your opinion?

184
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,900
What's the point of saying you'll help?

185
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:01,580
I'll translate for everyone. Dr. Bai Zhu means that we should work together.

186
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:07,000
I'll be honest. Right now, I can feel that

187
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,240
our Emergency Department is united

188
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,010
and ready to forge ahead.

189
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:15,420
We're an assembly united,

190
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,920
an assembly ready to fight,

191
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,450
- an assembly ready to head into a new future. 
- Alright, that's enough.

192
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,330
Okay, we'll finish here. You're dismissed.

193
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,260
Director.

194
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,860
These are the files you wanted.

195
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,520
Right. Heavy bleeding.

196
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,060
You have to help me with this.

197
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,110
No problem. I'll treat you to 10 meals.

198
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,680
Okay.

199
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,520
You came all the way out here to make a call?

200
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,290
What? Worried that Xiao Yan will find out you're helping her?

201
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm not helping her, I'm helping the patient.

202
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,060
- I was right, wasn't I? 
- What do you mean?

203
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:00,080
Running until the end for the patient.

204
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,770
If I hadn't heard Xiao Yan say it,

205
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,920
I'd have thought they were your words.

206
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,600
You and Xiao Yan are actually quite similar.

207
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,350
I mean it.

208
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:14,290
You sure do have a lot of free time.

209

<i>[Operating Room] [Anesthesia Department] [ICU]</i>

210
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:26,000
<i>[Emergency] [EICU]</i>

211
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,320
Aren't your shifts over? Why are you all still here?

212
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,380
Dr. Xiao, Chen Zhi and I

213
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,490
compiled some medical papers regarding posterior cranial fossa hemorrhages.

214
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:40,980
Take a look and see if they're useful.

215
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,570
Thank you both.

216
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:45,100
Let's go.

217
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:51,240
This USB has a video of a surgery on a posterior fossa hemorrhage patient at Ruirong Hospital.

218
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,800
Although the surgery wasn't successful, you can use it as reference.

219
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,840
Thank you, Dr. Xu.

220
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,880
- Xiao Yan. 
- Director.

221
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,680
I contacted the director of neurosurgery at Heidelberg University Hospital in Germany.

222
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,520
You might discover something new after discussing with him.

223
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,810
They have one of the best neurosurgery departments in the world.

224
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:13,320
I sent you his email address and already introduced you to him.

225
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,540
Director, thank you.

226
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,480
Thank you, everyone.

227
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,760
The way I imagined it, all of us are family here.

228
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,880
Dr. Xiao, has there been any progress?

229
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:51,480
I went through a lot of documents an consulted a lot of experts,

230
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,420
but all the documents and experts told me

231
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,510
that with this much bleeding,

232
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,320
the patient can't be saved.

233
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,850
Dr. Xiao, Director Lu is right.

234
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:08,000
We're doctors, not gods.

235
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,140
You've done your best.

236
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:13,420
You don't need to comfort me. I just wanted to discuss a bit.

237
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,710
Let's go. Help me on my rounds.

238
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:22,270
What are you doing here so early in the morning?

239
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:26,000
- What's that? 
- Professor Ebben at Johns Hopkins University

240
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,380
wrote a paper on posterior cranial fossa hemorrhage.

241
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,600
It was completed last month and hasn't been published yet.

242
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,240
It includes the latest research results.

243
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,620
- How did you get it? 
- It was easy.

244
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,620
When I went there on the exchange program,

245
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,730
I got along really well with Professor Ebben.

246
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,820
He offered me a position there, but I declined it.

247
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,610
- It should only take a few minutes to get my hands on a research paper. 
- Yeah, okay, you're great.

248
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:51,280
Take this back.

249
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,920
You keep it and give it to Dr. Xiao.

250
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,370
Why are you giving it to me? Give it to her yourself.

251
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,190
I'm busy.

252
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:00,330
So am I.

253
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,020
If you're busy, then why are you still hanging around here?

254
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:07,260
And make sure you don't leak any of that information.

255
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,640
Otherwise I'll hold you responsible.

256
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,510
How am I friends with someone so...

257
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,270
Dr. Bai helped find this for me?

258
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,560
Although he didn't tell me how he got it,

259
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,120
I know he must have put in a lot of effort.

260
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,970
You know that people usually don't let others look at

261
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:29,560
their unpublished papers.

262
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,190
Please thank him for me.

263
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,520
Do you two take me as a microphone and speaker?

264
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,520
Right, I'll personally thank him later.

265
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,690
That's more like it.

266
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,360
Okay, thank you.

267
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,560
Dr. Bai!

268
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,850
Thank you.

269
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:57,240
No problem. I've always liked helping the weak.

270
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,220
Xu Yi Ran was right. Everything you say is sarcastic.

271
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,720
But I sincerely thank you.

272
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,390
I hope it will be useful.

273
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:10,830
Dr. Xiao, the posterior fossa hemorrhage patient is in cardiac arrest.

274
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,740
Don't look anymore. Xiao Yan isn't coming.

275
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,250
She finished the procedure and went directly to see patients.

276
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:22,340
You two are here? I thought I wouldn't see you because you've been too busy.

277
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:26,300
How can that be? It's human nature to enjoy food and lust, without wich, how will we live through our days?

278
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,580
Don't you know how to talk?

279
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,060
Old Bai, how is that patient now?

280
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,190
At 10 o'clock, that child had a sudden cardiac arrest.

281
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:37,800
The rescue took two full hours but wasn't successful.

282
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,900
Have you eaten yet?

283
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,960
I don't feel like eating.

284
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:58,270
<i>[Nurses Station]</i>

285
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,610
- Is Heard Nurse here? 
 - I'll call her for you.

286
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:03,150
No need. I'll come back in a while.

287
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:05,870
Head Nurse, Director Lu is looking for you.

288
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,560
Director, you're looking for me?

289
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,390
Here's the thing.

290
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,820
I have a relative in my hometown, about 50-some years old.

291
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,140
He worked as a care worker in Jiahe Hospital previously.

292
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,590
He can't continue to work in the hospital anymore for personal reasons.

293
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,920
He came to me for help to find work.

294
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,370
I remembered that you happen to need a nanny in your home.

295
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:24,220
He is also a male, so it's perfect for him to take care of Xian Yun.

296
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,930
Do you want to consider it?

297
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,830
But he used to work in a private hospital,

298
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,160
so he must be expensive.

299
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,600
No. You only need to provide one meal a day, and  ¥3,000 a month.

300
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,710
¥3,000? This is too perfect.

301
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:39,920
That's right.  ¥3,000 is too cheap. Is there a problem?

302
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,860
You can't trust me?

303
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,490
He is cheap for a reason.

304
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:46,530
His son is working in Shanghai. There is a young grandson

305
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:49,030
who is going to the primary school. He picks up and drops off the child twice a day.

306
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:52,230
It's because of this reason that he can't continue to work in the hospital.

307
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:55,040
You can definitely rest assured about him because he is my relative.

308
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,990
He is reliable and capable. If you will consider him,

309
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:00,520
I'll call him over here so that you can interview him, okay?

310
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,250
- I-I'm interested— 
 - Head Nurse.

311
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,270
I think it should work.

312
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:11,800
I'm interested. If I can meet him in person,

313
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,450
it will be even better. Is it convenient?

314
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:16,000
It's convenient. Let's do this. I'll contact him right away.

315
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,110
I'll tell you once he gets here, so you can meet him. Okay?

316
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,870
- Okay. 
 - Good. 
 - Thank you, Director.

317
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,860
You're welcome.

318
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:25,850
Director Lu is so good to you.

319
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:29,360
Lin Zhi, do you have time now?

320
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:34,080
While there aren't many people now, I'd like to chat with you.

321
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,880
Why are you so serious?

322
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,410
I know that you like to joke.

323
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:43,720
You usually joke around with everyone for fun.

324
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,110
It can relieve everyone's stress

325
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:49,590
and also enhance the relationships among co-workers.

326
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:53,750
However, if you joke about me and Director Lu,

327
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,160
it isn't appropriate.

328
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,490
First of all, I'm already married. I have a husband.

329
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:05,150
If my husband hears what you said, what would he think?

330
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:10,890
If he worries about it, it will affect our relationship. Isn't that right?

331
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,040
Additionally, Director Lu is our chief.

332
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,300
He is also a mid-level manager that the hospital focuses on developing.

333
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:21,810
If our hospital's top leaders heard those jokes of yours,

334
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:25,270
wouldn't they have certain opinions about Director Lu?

335
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:28,010
Director Lu is usually good to all of us.

336
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:32,040
If your jokes end up affecting his future career,

337
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,110
- do you think it's appropriate. 
 - No, it isn't appropriate.

338
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:38,930
Furthermore, I work in the same department as Director Lu.

339
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:43,540
Tell me, if everyone in the department joke about us like you do,

340
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,630
how can we continue to work?

341
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:48,140
For us, one is a director, the other is a head nurse.

342
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:51,930
If we can't coordinate well, it will impact the work in the empergency department.

343
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,460
Isn't that right? At that time,

344
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:57,990
do you want to see Director Lu or me to leave?

345
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:00,930
Neither of you can leave. I wasn't thoughtful.

346
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:04,050
I just think that Director Lu is especially good to you.

347
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:07,780
I know I'm wrong. Head Nurse, don't be angry with me.

348
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,510
I'm not angry.

349
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:13,170
I know Lin Zhi has a lively nature and enjoys joking.

350
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:15,780
Actually, you didn't mean anything with what you said.

351
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,660
But, you are at work now, and you're a grown-up.

352
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:21,360
Some jokes are good, but other jokes

353
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,550
should be restrained.

354
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:26,570
I'll listen to you. I swear I won't tell jokes again.

355
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:30,240
So I won't worry about your little motor mouth anymore?

356
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,560
Back to work.

357
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,650
I just went to see Bed No.15. They are going to start extubation tomorrow.

358
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,020
- Here, drink some water first. 
 - Thank you.

359
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,940
- Director. 
 - You're here. Come, let me introduce you.

360
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:46,080
This is my relative, Old Pan. This is Head Nurse Jiang.

361
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,880
Hello, I'm Jiang Shan.

362
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,930
Call me Old Pan. I am Director Lu's relative.

363
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,580
Head Nurse Jiang's husband is paraplegic because of a car accident.

364
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,890
So he needs someone to take care of him.

365
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:01,890
As for details, you two can talk between yourselves.

366
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:06,140
If you can really go to Head Nurse Jiang's home to work, you must do a good job.

367
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,470
Don't worry, Director Lu. I'll definitely work hard.

368
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:12,790
How about this? You two can discuss in my office. I'm going to the front counter on another matter.

369
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,800
- Okay, you go do your work. 
 - Okay, good.

370
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,680
- Thank you, Director. 
 - Don't be courteous.

371
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:22,020
Old Pan, sit please. I'll be bothering you from now on.

372
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:27,670
My husband's name is Jiang Xian Yu. He used to be a teacher.

373
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:31,720
- How was the talk? 
 - Don't worry. We had a good talk.

374
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:36,080
This is the 3,500 for this month. You can count it.

375
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,990
No need. You are introduced by Director Song. I trust you.

376
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:43,610
I paid you in cash for this month. Starting next month,

377
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,610
I'll send the money to your bankcard, okay?

378
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,390
Sure, that's no problem.

379
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:50,930
Oh yes,  be careful not to slip up on this matter.

380
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:54,670
Director Lu, don't worry. My lips are sealed.

381
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:01,070
Actually, to tell you the truth, there aren't many good people like you anymore.

382
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:04,970
I can see that Head Nurse is also a good person.

383
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:08,190
- Too bad... 
 - You must be mistaken.

384
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:11,260
I'm just helping a co-worker to solve a difficulty in life.

385
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:14,450
I understand, I understand. Director Lu, if there's nothing else,

386
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:16,650
- I'm leaving then. 
 - Okay, go ahead.

387
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,040
Bye bye.

388
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,950
36, 37.

389
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:26,390
I saw the male nanny. He's quite reliable.

390
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,520
39.

391
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,240
I don't want a nanny.

392
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,140
I can't rest assured when you're home alone.

393
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,740
What is it that you can't rest assured about? I can take care of myself.

394
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,510
My illness has already cost a lot of money.

395
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:40,570
The nanny wants ¥3,000 a month, that's cheap.

396
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:44,400
- But it's still too expensive for our family. 
 - Don't worry about the money.

397
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,260
I know that you worry and care about me.

398
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:51,250
But, with our family's current condition, we can't add more burden on you.

399
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,470
Really, believe me. I can do it.

400
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:56,730
I'm so busy at the hospital. I can't always ask for leave.

401
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:59,400
Rushing back and forth between the hospital and home, I'm really overloaded.

402
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,730
You should also think for me.

403
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:04,070
Here, here.

404
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:06,430
You...You don't move.

405
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:10,590
I'll do it myself.

406
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,530
Watch me.

407
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:16,770
How about it? Isn't this good? I can take care of myself. What's the matter?

408
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:22,150
It's stuck. This tire is flat.

409
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:26,410
It's so slippery. Come help me. Help me.

410
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,770
Look at how you are, can I not worry?

411
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:38,480
No, this happened suddenly. It's an occasional occurrence.

412
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,590
Can you not be so stubborn? Just listen to me once.

413
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:45,530
No, this happens only occasionally.

414
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:49,670
Watch.

415
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:54,780
Here, don't you move. Let me do it myself. You don't do it.

416
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:58,200
I'll do it myself. I'll do it myself. You just watch.

417
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,260
How about it? Didn't I get up here?

418
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,000
Isn't this good?

419
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,860
I can take care of myself.

420
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:13,250
Wife, what happened that day was a rare incident.

421
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,770
Haven't I taken care of myself all these years?

422
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:18,130
I'm fine at home by myself.

423
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:23,300
My lower body is paralyzed, but my hands are good.

424
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,150
My hands are good.

425
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:31,350
They're good? Then you wipe yourself.

426
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,810
Are you upset?

427
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,650
I'm upset with myself.

428
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:04,860
Actually, it's not that I don't want a nanny.

429
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,830
I have a reason that's difficult to explain.

430
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:14,770
I don't want to see a stranger wipe my pee and poop every day.

431
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:19,380
I don't want a stranger to see how embarrassed I look every day.

432
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:24,280
It'll let me feel that my life is meaningless.

433
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,710
There is only burden.

434
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,700
There is only unbearableness.

435
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:50,840
Okay. I understand how you feel.

436
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,600
We won't hire the nanny then.

437
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:09,260
Here, give me your hands.

438
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:12,350
Give me. Hurry.

439
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:45,130
Is it still hard for you to accept?

440
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:54,350
I don't know who it was that told me,

441
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:58,810
doctors don't deal with diseases, they deal with patients.

442
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:02,940
Our job is to stand by their sides.

443
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:06,850
To help them defeat their disease, to defeat death.

444
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,340
Even if they don't succeed, we still have to be there to accompany them.

445
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:13,320
To support them in facing an unchangeable fate.

446
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:24,550
But you became like this because a patient died.

447
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:26,880
Don't you think its ridiculous?

448
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:31,760
The survival rate of a massive posterior fossa hemorrhage is practically zero.

449
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,590
No-one can change that fact.

450
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:39,640
I know that you wanted to save Fang Nan.

451
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:44,390
But you can't lose your rationality over this.

452
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:49,020
If it's so hard for you to accept even this kind of death,

453
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,460
it shows you are really not cut out to be a doctor.

454
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:59,220
When I was a doctor with Doctors Without Borders,

455
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,990
no matter how difficult the situation,

456
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:04,300
or how serious the illness or wound,

457
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:08,450
I would always try my best until the very end. But this time,

458
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:11,260
because of his parents

459
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:14,990
I compromised.

460
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:23,240
Although I don't accept your attitude, there was nothing wrong with your treatment.

461
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,980
Standing here, I was thinking

462
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:33,080
if I just held on a bit longer,

463
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,030
if I just held on,

464
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:39,370
and gave Fang Nan the CT scan, wouldn't he...

465
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:46,850
Being a doctor,

466
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:49,300
we are the closest to life and death.

467
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,420
The phrase written on physician Doctor Trudeau's gravestone

468
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:56,980
summarizes his thoughts on a life as a doctor.

469
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:59,190
"Sometimes treating,

470
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:02,890
often helping, always comforting".

471
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:07,780
Right now I don't want to tell you

472
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:12,230
how many people in this huge city need your help,

473
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:14,750
need you to get it togther for them.

474
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:18,110
Because this is our teachers always told us as students.

475
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:20,800
Instead, there's somewhere I want to take you.

476
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,490
- Where? 
 - You'll know when we get there.

478
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:50,800
Doctor Bai, you wanted to take me to Tongshan Hospital?

479
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,730
Doctor Xiao, do you remember the Hippocratic oath?

480
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:57,620
Of course. It's the first thing every medical student learns.

481
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:02,200
We must devote our lives to the improving the health of our nation.

482
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,050
- What's the patient's condition? 
 - 25 years old. Unconscious for an hour.

483
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:15,490
Temperature of 36 degrees. Heart rate of 118.

484
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:57,610
Look, this place is filled with people waiting for treatment, or to be saved.

485
00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:00,670
As medics, we don't trust tears.

486
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:05,710
Either you dry your tears and get on with it, or you leave.

487
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:09,390
Thank you, Doctor Bai.

488
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:11,420
Get back to work.

 - Good morning.

00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:18,590
- Later, let's go and check on the patient in bed 7 with cerebral thrombosis. 
 - Ok.

494
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,860
How is the patient who came in two days ago with burns?

495
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:23,630
He passed away last night. Albumin was only 15 grams.

496
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:26,010
Even giving him 30 grams a day was still not enough.

497
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:29,520
He also had high fever. So he couldn't be saved.

498
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:31,970
Got it.

Head Nurse.

501

Is anything the matter?

502
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:45,400
About the nanny, I discussed with Xian Yun yesterday.

503
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,120
He still thinks it's a little too much to bear.

504
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,730
It's fine. We can discuss with Old Pan again.

505
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:53,860
I'll talk to him to see if he can be cheaper. He's easygoing.

506
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:57,470
No need to bother. The problem isn't only about money.

507
00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:02,420
Mainly, Xian Yun doesn't want a stranger to take care of him.

508
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:05,240
He isn't used to it because he'll feel he is especially useless.

509
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,630
I don't want to make it hard for him, so let's forget about it.

510
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,070
Okay, okay, I understand.

511
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:12,560
It's fine. I'll tell Old Pan.

512
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,120
Director, I'm sorry.

513
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,420
It's fine. Old Pan is my own relative.

514
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:22,230
- I still have a meeting. I need to go. Let's talk later. 
 - Okay.

515
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:30,490
- Go get the prescription. 
 - Okay, thank you, doctor.

516
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:40,620
Dr. Xiao, there's someone looking for you.

517
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:02,690
Dr. Xiao, I wanted to come and confirm with you again.

518
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:06,530
At the start, if Xiao Nan had done the CT scan,

519
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:10,040
would he not have died?

520
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:20,590
No one can really control diseases.

521
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,930
Don't blame yourself.

522
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:29,380
I know I'm the one who let Xiao Nan die.

523
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:33,420
- Don't think this way. 
 - I'm the one who killed him.

524
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,570
I'm the one.

525
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:37,910
I'm the one.

526
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,570
You are Fang Nan's family?

527
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,370
I'm the mother who let him die.

528
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:51,790
Do you have his medical history? I'd like to see it.

529
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,480
Judging from the medical history, Fang Nan's posterior fossa hemorrhage

530
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,660
is caused by an extremely rare congenital disorder.

531
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,920
It's called Masquille Syndrome.

532
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:19,020
When someone has this disorder, even if CT was done before the hemorrhage started, it still wouldn't be found.

533
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:22,730
Furthermore, once hemorrhage begins, it's incurable.

534
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,880
Even the CT scan won't find it?

535
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,670
That's right.

536
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:32,150
The Masquille Syndrome is still an unsolved problem in the world.

537
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:34,420
No one can solve it.

538
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,550
Maybe after 10 or 20 years,

539
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:39,330
modern medicine will have a cure for it.

540
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,540
Masquille Syndrome?

541
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:17,210
Will it sound better as Thomas Boca Syndrome?

542
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:21,850
Thank you, Dr. Bai, for saving a mother's life.

543
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:25,180
Don't mention it. It's just a daily routine.

544
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,980
Sure. Here's the thing.

545
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:32,330
Since everyone is here, let's have a small meeting.

546
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:34,290
Everyone is busy, I'll make it short.

547
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:38,600
The wife of Huaman Real Estate's chairman has a recurrence of breast cancer.

548
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,940
They said the result from the treatment in another hospital isn't very effective.

549
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:45,200
So they want to transfer to our hospital. But the patient

550
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,610
has requirements for the attending physician's qualifications.

551
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:52,430
Therefore, after Dean Jiang and I discussed carefully,

552
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:57,160
we'll let Dr. Xiao Yan take over Ge Hong's case.
