00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:27,319
(Thank You, Doctor)

2
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:30,040
(Adapted from Sheng Li's novel "ICU 48 Hours")

3
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,040
(Episode 37)

4
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,079
What's wrong?

5
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,400
What a lousy proposal.

6
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:41,000
What kind of gimmick did you come up with?

7
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:43,879
The audience didn't like it at all.

8
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,799
Queen of Planning, my foot.

9
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:48,319
Use your brain and think about it.

10
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,359
What will the audience see?

11
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,359
Even if they don't know,

12
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,680
didn't I already give you an idea?

13
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,159
Can't you just follow it?

14
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:56,799
If it's about the proposal for the event,

15
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,560
we can sit down and discuss it again.

16
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,319
You're a big company.

17
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:02,840
I'm sure you don't want the event to be too low-end.

18
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
Let me repeat myself.

19
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,159
This is my money.

20
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,439
I'm the one in charge.

21
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,560
I call the shots.

22
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:18,039
Just do as I say.

23
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,199
That'll solve everything.

24
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,319
I'll be honest with you.

25
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,090
Your idea...

26
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,840
was leftover from someone else.

27
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,560
It's old-fashioned.

28
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,280
Aren't you afraid of it ruining your reputation?

29
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,319
I'm afraid it'll ruin mine.

30
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:35,810
Do you even have a reputation?

31
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,090
You paid for it.

32
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,680
Trust me.

33
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,370
I'll go to your office tomorrow.

34
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,810
Just one word...

35
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,319
and I can get you fired.

36
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,360
What kind of proposal is this?

37
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,960
It's just a bunch of rubbish, you know?

38
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,199
Rubbish!

39
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,479
You're so childish!

40
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,080
Childish?

41
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,960
No matter how childish it is, I'm still paying for it. Got it?

42
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,560
- I can do whatever I want with it. - Give it back to me!

43
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,919
- Do you get it? - Give it back to me!

44
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,120
- What? - Give it back to me!

45
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,360
What are you doing?

46
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,000
He Lan.

47
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,479
He Lan, are you all right?

48
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,280
Blood?

49
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:16,319
Help!

50
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,360
Help!

51
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,599
Call 120!

52
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,919
It's ectopic pregnancy.

53
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,800
You haven't given birth before.

54
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,400
Let's go with conservative treatment.

55
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,319
Where's your family member?

56
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,639
I don't have one.

57
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,800
This child's father and I...

58
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,400
got divorced recently.

59
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,080
What about your parents?

60
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,879
I'm here on business.

61
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,439
My parents are out of town.

62
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:54,080
Cervical ectopic pregnancy is relatively rare.

63
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,199
It might cause fatal bleeding.

64
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,599
You have to be careful.

65
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,120
I got it.

66
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,879
Your situation is unique.

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,360
We suggest you contact the father.

68
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,520
After all, it's not your matter alone.

69
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,319
There's no need.

70
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,879
There's no need...

71
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:17,920
to contact others with such bad news.

72
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,730
Since we've broken up, it should end cleanly.

73
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,839
All right.

74
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,279
For your case,

75
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,839
we'll transfer you to the obstetrics.

76
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,879
They have a more specialized...

77
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,000
and better treatment.

78
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:34,319
Thank you.

79
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,610
Can you hold me?

80
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:44,519
How about here?

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,199
A little.

82
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:52,800
Can you try to bend your legs?

83
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,639
Try again.

84
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:04,879
I can't.

85
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,319
Doctor.

86
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,879
What's wrong with me?

87
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:14,170
Is the treatment not working?

88
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,050
We don't know the details yet.

89
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,079
We'll see after the MRI scan.

90
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,639
According to the MRI scan,

91
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,920
the infarction mainly involves the right cortex.

92
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,120
After the thrombolysis,

93
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,279
a blood vessel on this side still hasn't opened yet.

94
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,800
A second thrombolysis is needed.

95
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,959
Another thrombolysis is not feasible in such a short period.

96
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,199
The risk is too high.

97
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,279
If I hadn't misdiagnosed her...

98
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:36,920
The misdiagnosis has nothing to do with the thrombolysis.

99
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,480
Thrombolysis is effective within the specified time.

100
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,879
So your mistake...

101
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:42,639
doesn't affect the outcome of the treatment.

102
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:45,600
So don't let this affect you anymore.

103
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,759
Okay?

104
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:49,800
Okay.

105
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,399
- But Dr. Xiao... - Chen Zhi.

106
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,360
If you keep talking about the misdiagnosis,

107
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,360
I'll fulfill your wish...

108
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,959
and report you to the hospital.

109
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,920
If the patient's family won't let go of this issue,

110
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,519
this matter...

111
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,240
will become a nonsensical and inexplicable medical incident.

112
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:09,160
They'll either settle or send you to court.

113
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,839
In the end, the hospital will compensate them...

114
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:12,199
and lose its reputation...

115
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,480
on your behalf.

116
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,680
Will you be satisfied with this outcome?

117
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,079
- I'm sorry. - Dr. Chen.

118
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,920
Go inform her family.

119
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,399
No thrombolysis for now. She has to be observed.

120
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,800
Okay.

121
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:31,519
Poor thing. You yelled at him again.

122
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,800
If I don't yell at him,

123
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,399
he won't stop.

124
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:36,759
My head is about to explode.

125
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,560
By the way, Dr. Xiao.

126
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,600
the blood pressure of the patient in bed nine is up again.

127
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,959
Let's check it out.

128
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,160
Let's go.

129
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:49,040
Fu Ping.

130
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,839
Give me another 50,000 yuan.

131
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,639
I need it within two days.

132
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:57,399
If I don't invest, my friend won't let me in anymore.

133
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,160
Fu Ping.

134
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,519
It's just 50,000 yuan.

135
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,639
Please.

136
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,759
My friend's project is a sure win.

137
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,399
Think about it.

138
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,680
You're working so hard all your life to earn money.

139
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,920
They just move their hands and already earn money.

140
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,399
It's not worth it...

141
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,759
to miss this chance.

142
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,920
Fu Ping.

143
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,160
Fu Ping.

144
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,480
Get out.

145
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,920
I don't have the energy to argue with you.

146
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,079
I'm sure we'll make money with this investment.

147
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,639
I'll give you a bonus at the end of the year.

148
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,199
I'll buy you a bag and a car.

149
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:31,480
I'll buy you whatever you want, okay?

150
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,600
Stop trying to persuade me.

151
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,879
My friend told me.

152
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,079
If I invest in this project,

153
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,560
I can lie down and count money until my hand gets a cramp.

154
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,639
Is there such easy money in this world?

155
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,519
If money were that easy to earn,

156
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,079
everyone would live in a big house...

157
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,759
and drive a nice car.

158
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,240
That's because they don't have a chance.

159
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,120
I have a chance, don't I?

160
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,040
Xiao Xiang.

161
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,560
Can't you just look for job...

162
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,319
and live a stable life?

163
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,000
Last time,

164
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,759
my colleague got you a job.

165
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:08,759
You quit after two days.

166
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,160
Don't mention your colleague.

167
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,600
I'm angry even just thinking about it.

168
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,240
What kind of job did he recommend me?

169
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:15,600
It's the same as working at a construction site.

170
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,920
It's tiring day and I don't make much money.

171
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,600
I've realized it through this incident.

172
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,920
If I work for someone else,

173
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,759
I'll be destined to work for others for the rest of my life.

174
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,879
To make money,

175
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,319
we need to invest and start our own business.

176
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,959
So Fu Ping,

177
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,519
it's just 50,000 yuan.

178
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,000
My friends are all starting at 100,000 yuan.

179
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:37,840
I'll feel embarrassed to put in less than that.

180
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,960
I don't have any money.

181
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,039
Don't lie to me.

182
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,450
How could you not have any money?

183
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,639
I saw it that day.

184
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,279
There's a few thousand dollars in your account.

185
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:53,720
Then...

186
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,399
how about 40,000 yuan?

187
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,480
Fu Ping, just 40,000 dollars.

188
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:58,879
Nothing less.

189
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,279
And I promise.

190
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:01,840
If I don't make money this time,

191
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,919
I'll look for a job properly.

192
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,240
Okay?

193
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:07,159
Get out.

194
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,639
Fu Ping, just 40,000 dollars.

195
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,840
Get out!

196
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,159
Fu Ping!

197
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:14,639
Fu Ping.

198
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:16,240
- Stop bothering your sister. - Get out!

199
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,759
- Get out. - Mom. Why are you chasing me away?

200
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,679
- Fu Ping. - Stop it.

201
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,960
- Fu Ping. - Get out.

202
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:29,639
Fu Ping, think about it.

203
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:30,879
Get out.

204
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,600
Ping Ping.

205
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,600
- No need. - Xiao Xiang...

206
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,960
is really immature.

207
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:57,919
Ping Ping.

208
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:01,000
You've had high blood pressure for three years.

209
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,480
Why didn't you tell me?

210
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,120
Mom.

211
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

212
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,480
I just thought...

213
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,399
it wasn't a big deal.

214
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,159
So I didn't tell you.

215
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,480
I know you want to save money for the family...

216
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,240
and delay treatment as much as possible.

217
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:27,000
If you had used the money you gave Xiao Xiang...

218
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,600
to buy medicine,

219
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,879
you wouldn't have to suffer like this.

220
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,759
Why didn't you tell me?

221
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,679
You don't even buy clothes...

222
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:42,090
on usual days.

223
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:46,480
Think more about yourself in the future, okay?

224
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,159
It's all my fault.

225
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,090
Whatever Xiao Xiang wants, I buy it for him.

226
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:55,279
When he wants money, I give him money.

227
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,759
I've spoiled him too much.

228
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,840
You're the breadwinner...

229
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,759
of the family.

230
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:03,679
Ping Ping.

231
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,240
We're sorry.

232
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,600
We've let you down.

233
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,440
Mom.

234
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,399
Don't cry.

235
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:22,799
Xiao Xiang is my brother.

236
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,320
If I don't care about him,

237
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:27,080
who will?

238
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,759
It's all my fault.

239
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:32,519
I spoiled him too much.

240
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,279
I spoiled him rotten.

241
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,360
Ping Ping.

242
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,799
About this project,

243
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:44,799
I think it's more reliable...

244
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,320
compared to the other ones...

245
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,279
he mentioned before.

246
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:50,519
If God is willing...

247
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,000
and gives him a chance,

248
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,240
he'll be able to walk the right path.

249
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,240
You won't have to work so hard anymore.

250
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:05,279
All right.

251
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,879
Give him another 50,000 yuan.

252
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,759
Give it to him?

253
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,000
Ping Ping, this money,

254
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,159
you need it for your treatment.

255
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,759
Forget it.

256
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:25,960
Give it to him.

257
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,519
I'll have peace of mind too.

258
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,480
It's my fault for spoiling him.

259
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:32,600
Now, he's out of control.

260
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:33,960
I give him everything he wants.

261
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,799
He doesn't even feel sorry for you.

262
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:41,080
Mom.

263
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,879
Let's just say I lost the 50,000 yuan.

264
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,320
This is the last time.

265
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,039
If he asks for more,

266
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,480
I really won't have any.

267
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,799
He promised me just now.

268
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,759
If he fails,

269
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,399
he'll find a proper job.

270
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,600
Let's hope he keeps his word.

271
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,879
She insists on another thrombolysis?

272
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:21,919
Yes.

273
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,240
Didn't you tell the patient...

274
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,919
of the danger of a second thrombolysis?

275
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:26,159
I did.

276
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,080
But the patient insisted.

277
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:29,799
It's just a small part of the blood vessel.

278
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:31,279
She's taking such a huge risk.

279
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,480
The patient said she does sales.

280
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:35,639
The family's finances depend on her alone.

281
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,799
If she stays in the hospital for a long time,

282
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:39,080
she might lose my clients.

283
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,000
Then the family will lose their source of income.

284
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,320
Having no source of income...

285
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,919
is better than dying?

286
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,360
Thrombolysis will likely cause bleeding...

287
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,799
and a severe one.

288
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,000
Any doctor wouldn't agree to it.

289
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,200
The right leg can only feel...

290
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,360
under strong stimulation.

291
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:06,120
Looks like it will take a while to recover.

292
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,399
I can't stay in bed forever.

293
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,159
Dr. Xiao.

294
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:13,480
Let's do the thrombolysis again.

295
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:15,559
A second thrombolysis is too dangerous.

296
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:17,759
There's a high possibility of severe bleeding.

297
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,799
I know you want to recover quickly.

298
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,120
But you can't risk your life.

299
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,159
You can't be irresponsible for yourself.

300
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,120
I'm willing to take a little risk.

301
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:29,639
You have no idea.

302
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,919
If I don't make money,

303
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,720
my family will collapse.

304
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:35,200
My brother's monthly payments...

305
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:37,320
and my mom's living expenses...

306
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,600
You're paying for them alone?

307
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,679
Your brother seems like he's almost 30.

308
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:43,960
Why isn't he paying anything?

309
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,960
Dr. Xiao.

310
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,240
Please do it for me one more time.

311
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,919
What if something really happens?

312
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,519
What about your mom...

313
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:57,919
and your brother?

314
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,720
I was completely fine. How did I get sick?

315
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:07,480
Everything needs money.

316
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:09,399
Don't think about it for now. Rest well.

317
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,200
Only when you recover...

318
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,679
can you continue to work and earn money.

319
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:16,600
Let's go.

320
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,360
Poor girl.

321
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,600
Her brother and her mom...

322
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,879
both need her.

323
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,799
How much savings can she get from working?

324
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,159
And her brother is an adult.

325
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,600
Why doesn't he have a job...

326
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,759
and just relies on his sister?

327
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:39,360
In this world,

328
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,399
there are people who put shackles on their love.

329
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,679
But more love...

330
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:44,559
brings warmth and companionship.

331
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,840
For example, your mom urges you to get married.

332
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,480
Can you call your mom a bane?

333
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,600
When she nagged me too hard,

334
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:53,159
it was a bit of a disaster.

335
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:55,120
But I know.

336
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,960
it's for my own good.

337
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,960
She loves me.

338
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:59,519
Everyone has flaws.

339
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,720
It's normal for parents to have flaws.

340
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,320
Just like us.

341
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,639
Is everything about us...

342
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:06,360
completely perfect?

343
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:07,720
That's true.

344
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:10,120
But some things can't be helped.

345
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:11,919
Enough.

346
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,320
Let's get back to work.

347
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,440
Must I have my uterus removed?

348
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,200
Then I can't bear children anymore?

349
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,200
That's right.

350
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,240
Doctor, is there any other way?

351
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,559
We've tried everything.

352
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:31,039
But the pathology report after the curettage...

353
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:32,480
shows cancer in your uterus.

354
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:36,960
You haven't had children yet.

355
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,559
I know the hysterectomy...

356
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:40,320
is a big blow to you.

357
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:42,200
But as a doctor,

358
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,440
that's all I can advise.

359
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,279
But I'm only 31.

360
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,480
Then I'll...

361
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,200
I'll never ever bear children?

362
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,279
I'm sorry.

363
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,079
Look at you.

364
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,240
Why aren't you getting a checkup at the hospital?

365
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:22,319
You brought me here instead.

366
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,720
Ms. Xiao.

367
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:26,559
My dad hasn't been himself recently.

368
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:28,559
What's wrong?

369
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,200
He used to look up medical cases...

370
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:32,650
before he went to bed.

371
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:35,000
But I don't know what's wrong with him lately.

372
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:37,440
He has been doing some research on motorbikes.

373
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,960
That's out of the norm for my dad.

374
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:41,599
I was so worried.

375
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,680
Later, I realized...

376
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:47,599
when it comes to motorbikes, I think of you.

377
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:51,000
You should go back.

378
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:52,319
Your dad is waiting for you.

379
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,890
Ms. Xiao, let me finish.

380
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,200
You and my dad...

381
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:01,200
are both excellent doctors.

382
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:03,519
And you're both equally good-looking.

383
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:06,519
I know very well that my dad likes you.

384
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,079
I just want to ask...

385
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:10,680
what you think about my dad.

386
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:18,890
In my heart right now,

387
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,279
there's someone I can't let go of yet.

388
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,000
You said it yourself.

389
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,680
Your dad is an excellent man.

390
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,890
Being with him...

391
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:29,119
when I have someone else in my heart...

392
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:31,079
would be unfair to him.

393
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,170
Why don't you let that person go?

394
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,680
You'll understand...

395
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,039
when you grow up.

396
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,000
- Why are you running around again? - Dad, sit tight.

397
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Sit tight.

398
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:51,960
I have something serious to tell you.

399
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:54,440
I ran into Ms. Xiao just now.

400
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,240
I told her everything about you...

401
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,279
searching up motorbikes.

402
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,960
And I asked her what she thinks of you.

403
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:03,440
You punk.

404
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,720
Who asked you to be a busybody?

405
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,170
I'm just anxious for you!

406
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,680
No, not anxious.

407
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,559
I used the wrong word this time.

408
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:11,680
You little eunuch.

409
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:14,170
You're the eunuch. I'm the emperor.

410
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:16,410
Dad.

411
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,039
You need to work harder.

412
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:20,890
Ms. Xiao came to take care of you when you got sick last time.

413
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:23,119
That means she cares about you.

414
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,650
When I was sick last time?

415
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:27,759
Yes.

416
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:29,559
I called Ms. Xiao and told her you were sick.

417
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,920
Then she came.

418
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:32,720
She was in your room for quite a while.

419
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,410
Dad, you don't know?

420
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:41,480
Wasn't it Zheng Ya Jie?

421
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,799
She came later.

422
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:46,680
Ms. Xiao prepared the honey water and medicine for you...

423
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:48,759
before leaving.

424
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Then...

425
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,839
what...

426
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,410
did Ms. Xiao say?

427
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,200
She said...

428
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:03,119
there's someone in her heart that she can't let go.

429
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,119
Dad, do you know who it is?

430
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,960
Li Fu Ping?

431
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:10,440
He Lan?

432
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:21,720
You look different from back then.

433
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,720
You too.

434
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,650
Why are you admitted into the hospital?

435
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:33,200
Cerebral infarction.

436
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,000
It's been a while.

437
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:37,410
How...

438
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,759
Is it serious?

439
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:40,119
Now,

440
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:41,720
my condition is stable.

441
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It's just...

442
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:45,960
I can't really move one side of my body.

443
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,559
What about you?

444
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:51,039
Are you sick too?

445
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,480
Ectopic pregnancy.

446
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,440
That's...

447
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,559
That's dangerous, isn't it?

448
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,079
I won't be able to have kids...

449
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,319
for the rest of my life.

450
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,359
Don't think too much.

451
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:12,759
Get enough rest...

452
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,160
and recuperate.

453
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:16,720
I'm sure you'll recover.

454
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,240
Isn't that how life is?

455
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,720
The choices you make over and over again...

456
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,799
has already predetermined the outcome.

457
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:27,440
There's nothing to complain about.

458
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:28,880
Yes.

459
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:32,559
We make...

460
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,799
every choice ourselves.

461
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,279
A while ago,

462
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:42,160
I saw you on the cover of a magazine.

463
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:45,480
Queen of Planning.

464
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,200
Brilliant.

465
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,640
It's just superficial.

466
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,720
Look.

467
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:57,599
I'm already 31 this year.

468
00:22:58,039 --> 00:22:59,319
I can't have children.

469
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:03,119
I think it'll be hard for me to get married in the future.

470
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,960
Look at us when we were in school.

471
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,440
We were majoring in journalism.

472
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,240
Every day,

473
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:13,160
we dreamed that one day...

474
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,640
we'd become journalists.

475
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:17,880
But somehow, I ended up in marketing.

476
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:20,160
Only when I entered society did I realize...

477
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,960
that dreams and reality are so different.

478
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,920
I remember back then...

479
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:28,119
your family found you a job at a newspaper company.

480
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,759
Why didn't you go?

481
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,000
I wanted to rebel.

482
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:35,680
I refused the elders' help...

483
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:38,720
because I wanted to try my best...

484
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,759
on my own.

485
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:44,680
I ended up like this.

486
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,720
And then I fell in love with the wrong guy.

487
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,880
Everyone was against it.

488
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,839
But I...

489
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,079
was stubborn and didn't listen.

490
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,720
Until I found out he had another woman.

491
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,680
That's when...

492
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,000
I realized...

493
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,759
that I was a total idiot.

494
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,440
It's okay.

495
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:22,279
I'm over it.

496
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,480
What about you?

497
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,799
Have you been well?

498
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:28,680
I remember...

499
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,920
you received an invitation from "Investigation",

500
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,759
the best magazine in Beijing.

501
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:34,720
Why didn't you go?

502
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,480
At that time,

503
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,400
I did it for my mom and brother.

504
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,960
They said...

505
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,039
they didn't want to be too far away from me.

506
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,359
That's too bad.

507
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,440
You're so professional.

508
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,319
All of us had high hopes for you.

509
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,359
Some life decisions...

510
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,200
are truly regretful.

511
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,480
Don't you think so?

512
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,160
We're still young.

513
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,559
We can still start over.

514
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,519
Can we?

515
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:20,640
Yes, we can.

516
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:22,759
You...

517
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,119
You should be like me.

518
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:26,319
Let go of the past.

519
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,599
That's how you can embrace the future.

520
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,720
When we get better,

521
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:36,240
we must get together more often.

522
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,640
Everything will be fine.

523
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,160
Okay, here's the anesthesia.

524
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,079
Relax and take a deep breath.

525
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,960
You're awake.

526
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,480
You should've told me.

527
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,960
I know you don't want to see me.

528
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:45,599
I didn't want to come either at first.

529
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:47,359
But...

530
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,119
I feel like...

531
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:53,880
I owe you an apology.

532
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,519
Don't catch a cold.

533
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:06,920
Here.

534
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,240
Our Ping Ping is so pretty.

535
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,000
How do you feel now?

536
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:23,400
Much better.

537
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,480
He Lan.

538
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:37,160
The experience event you planned...

539
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,640
went viral.

540
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:40,319
You're trending.

541
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,680
This comment says...

542
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,400
you are like a clear stream in the charity activities circle.

543
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,079
You neither sell misery...

544
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:48,799
or are too serious or boring.

545
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,359
It was a very interesting event.

546
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,680
They can't stop.

547
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,880
But...

548
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:02,559
Hello?

549
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,319
Xiao He.

550
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,640
This is Mr. Wang.

551
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:08,480
Did the surgery go well?

552
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,680
Thank you for your concern, Mr. Wang.

553
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,839
The surgery went well.

554
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,240
That's good.

555
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:13,440
Here's the thing, Xiao He.

556
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:16,400
The event you planned worked.

557
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,799
Would you have time...

558
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:20,000
to think about our company's proposal?

559
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,240
Our company still needs you.

560
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:23,440
I'm sorry, Mr. Wang.

561
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:24,519
I don't have time.

562
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:26,799
Xiao He.

563
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:27,839
Don't be mad.

564
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,759
What happened was a misunderstanding.

565
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:32,599
We were too impulsive.

566
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,319
Mr. Wang.

567
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:37,160
I don't do planning anymore.

568
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,240
You don't do planning anymore?

569
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,319
What are you going to do then?

570
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,640
I'm going to recharge and study,

571
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:49,839
and get back to our dream of becoming journalists.

572
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,200
If one day...

573
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,920
I want to have children,

574
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:56,880
then I'll be a godmother...

575
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,759
to your child.

576
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,880
What about you? What are your plans?

577
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:05,720
Me?

578
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,319
I'll learn from you.

579
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,960
It's been so long.

580
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,680
This one can't be saved.

581
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:26,799
What about you? Can you be saved?

582
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,440
Let's not talk about me first.

583
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,480
I heard it's as if you moved into Yang Jing's room recently.

584
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,480
How about this?

585
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,319
Ask to be transferred to the OB-GYN department.

586
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:35,319
Leave me alone.

587
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,519
Dr. Bai, we have a patient with acute appendicitis.

588
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,440
I'm your attending doctor, Bai Zhu.

589
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,759
Based on the CT scan,

590
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:43,960
your appendix is very swollen.

591
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,440
It might perforate anytime.

592
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:47,319
I suggest immediate surgery.

593
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,559
Surgery isn't necessary.

594
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,559
See if you can go with conservative treatment.

595
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:55,240
Just give me some medicine.

596
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,480
Tell the patient...

597
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,720
what happens when the appendix perforates.

598
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,119
Perforation of the appendix can cause a lot of bacteria...

599
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,839
to be absorbed by the peritoneum and mesentery.

600
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,160
It will enter the bloodstream and cause sepsis.

601
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,920
If it causes a toxic infection in the abdominal cavity,

602
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,720
intestinal necrosis will occur in serious cases.

603
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,880
After peritonitis,

604
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,359
complete intestinal obstruction would occur...

605
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:12,799
due to intestinal adhesions.

606
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,480
It could be life-threatening.

607
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,920
Then operate on me.

608
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:19,319
I'll do it.

609
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:20,920
I want surgery.

610
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,759
You'll do it.

611
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,960
Me?

612
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,200
Yes.

613
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,279
Come on.

614
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,759
If you don't do it soon,

615
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,400
the patient will wake up.

616
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:51,519
Dr. Xu.

617
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:53,319
I'm afraid I'll cut too much.

618
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,319
There's a first time for everyone.

619
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,319
Believe in yourself.

620
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,319
Dr. Xu.

621
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,920
I'll start now.

622
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,200
Remember.

623
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,880
Steady, accurate, firm.

624
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,759
We've successfully removed the appendix.

625
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:20,839
The surgery went well.

626
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:22,279
Rest well from now on.

627
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:23,319
Okay.

628
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:25,480
Thank you, doctor.

629
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,359
It's what we should do.

630
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:32,920
I heard it was your first solo surgery.

631
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,160
Tang Hua, I wasn't mature enough before.

632
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,559
You're mature after getting the appendix out?

633
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,680
I want to tell you something.

634
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,680
What is it?

635
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,400
From now on,

636
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,720
I'll work harder...

637
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,559
and be more assertive.

638
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:46,839
I'll show you a new me.

639
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,960
Okay, I'll be waiting.

640
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:04,119
Ms. Jiang.

641
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:05,519
Dr. Xu.

642
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,839
He's still in surgery after all night?

643
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,079
He's still in there.

644
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,319
There he is.

645
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,319
- Doctor. - Don't worry.

646
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,480
The surgery was a success.

647
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,960
The severed finger has been reconnected.

648
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,039
Thank you. Thank you, all.

649
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,400
We'll tend to other patients in the EICU.

650
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,200
Okay. Thank you.

651
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,519
Thank you for today, Dr. Liang.

652
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:30,519
This time,

653
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:32,279
you owe me big time.

654
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:33,279
Of course.

655
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,480
I'll repay you.

656
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,839
You haven't slept all night. Get some rest.

657
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:39,000
- Okay, I'll go get some rest. - Okay.

658
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:40,359
Thank you, Dr. Liang.

659
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:42,559
Dr. Lu.

660
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,799
You've been working all night too.

661
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:45,240
Go home and get some rest.

662
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:48,960
It's time to make rounds.

663
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I'll do it for you.

664
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:51,400
I'll only feel relieved if I do it.

665
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,599
Otherwise, I won't be able to sleep well.

666
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,839
Come on, let's go together.

667
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,039
I'm not as healthy as before.

668
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,759
In the past, working for 24 hours...

669
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,319
wouldn't be as bad as this.

670
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,200
Still here?

671
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,400
Good.

672
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:09,719
I asked the cafeteria to make you some chicken soup.

673
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,329
Thank you.

674
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,440
Sit down. I'll do it for you.

675
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,769
My stamina...

676
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,559
is not what it used to be.

677
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:23,239
After a long night,

678
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,440
I'm sore all over.

679
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,519
You must be tired.

680
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,719
- Thank you. - Here.

681
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,119
Go back to sleep after you finish it.

682
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:30,199
It smells so good.

683
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:31,599
I'm really hungry.

684
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,559
Tell me.

685
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,769
That patient had given up.

686
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,079
Why didn't you?

687
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,719
You dragged Dr. Liang into it...

688
00:34:39,769 --> 00:34:41,719
and even went to the operating room to help.

689
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,920
I saw his eyes.

690
00:34:47,289 --> 00:34:48,769
He looked desperate.

691
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,440
Those eyes...

692
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,719
reminded me of my third uncle.

693
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:58,559
My third uncle and I got along very well.

694
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:00,960
He was a very smart person.

695
00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:04,400
He was also kind and funny.

696
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:06,719
And he could juggle.

697
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,329
He brought laughter to everyone...

698
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,639
everywhere he went.

699
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:12,769
Everyone loved him so much.

700
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,639
But God is unfair.

701
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:19,559
At such a young age, before he could even get married,

702
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,809
he got sick.

703
00:35:23,769 --> 00:35:24,880
It was lymphoma.

704
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:30,809
I remember it very well.

705
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:32,840
It was the first day of the Lunar New Year.

706
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,079
Every family set off firecrackers.

707
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:36,769
They were ready to celebrate.

708
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:38,809
But my uncle wasn't going to make it.

709
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:46,039
He...

710
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,599
He called my grandparents to his side.

711
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:00,480
He said to take him to Shanghai for a visit.

712
00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:05,599
Just one sentence and he was gone.

713
00:36:14,769 --> 00:36:16,769
Because of this, my grandparents...

714
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,679
couldn't forgive themselves until the day they died.

715
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,199
Medicine wasn't advanced back then.

716
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,079
Many patients couldn't receive effective treatment.

717
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,159
But today,

718
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,960
the healthcare industry is progressing rapidly.

719
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,329
We have the opportunity to save lives...

720
00:36:40,329 --> 00:36:41,559
in better conditions.

721
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,039
Yes.

722
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,960
Since then,

723
00:36:45,289 --> 00:36:46,960
I decided to study medicine...

724
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,599
and become a doctor.

725
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:50,559
A good doctor.

726
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:52,329
I want...

727
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:53,960
for those...

728
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:56,119
who can't afford to seek treatment...

729
00:36:57,159 --> 00:36:59,000
to able to afford so.

730
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:04,329
Over the years,

731
00:37:06,289 --> 00:37:08,360
I think for some reason,

732
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,000
my mindset changed a lot.

733
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:15,360
It's as if...

734
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,000
I've forgotten why I started.

735
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,679
I tried so hard to change...

736
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,880
to achieve something...

737
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,719
in order to show my self-worth.

738
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,519
That's why many people say...

739
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,360
that I've become materialistic.

740
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:36,199
Maybe...

741
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,000
I'm just not a good doctor.

742
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,039
The most important ability...

743
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:45,840
of a good doctor...

744
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,769
is to be able to empathize with the patients.

745
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,440
Drink up.

746
00:37:56,519 --> 00:37:57,599
It's getting cold.

747
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:06,159
What are you doing here?

748
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,440
- Xiao Yu. - Dad.

749
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,559
Why are you here?

750
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,329
Did you fall sick?

751
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,440
I'm not sick.

752
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:16,880
This...

753
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,400
I'm Ping An's ex-wife.

754
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,920
You can call me Ming Hui.

755
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:22,809
I'm Jiang Shan.

756
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,119
I'm the head nurse here.

757
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,440
This is our daughter.

758
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:28,920
Her name is Xiao Yu.

759
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:31,519
Look. She looks so much like Ping An.

760
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:32,840
Xiao Yu, say hi.

761
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:34,159
Hello.

762
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:36,239
Hello. Good girl.

763
00:38:36,809 --> 00:38:38,880
Dr. Lu, I'll get back to work then.

764
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,920
Okay.

765
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:41,199
Take your time.

766
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,119
What's the matter?

767
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,039
Are you here to see me because something happened?

768
00:38:49,289 --> 00:38:50,329
Ping An.

769
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,239
I'm sick.

770
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:06,119
Dr. Lu, look.

771
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,840
Multiple lumps found in the liver area.

772
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:12,000
Not evenly spaced.

773
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:13,400
The form is not organized.

774
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:14,880
The borders are not clear.

775
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,769
The diameter, shape, and size are all different.

776
00:39:16,809 --> 00:39:18,159
And they're fusing with each other.

777
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:19,679
Liver hemangioma?

778
00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:21,769
Based on the ultrasound,

779
00:39:21,769 --> 00:39:22,809
it seems so.

780
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,880
But it's better...

781
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,039
to get an enhanced CT scan...

782
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:27,199
or MRI...

783
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:28,329
just to be sure.

784
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:34,199
The ultrasound results are out.

785
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:35,440
Is it bad?

786
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,880
Occupying lesions in the liver.

787
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:38,719
It could be liver hemangioma.

788
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,400
We need to run more tests...

789
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,599
to be sure.

790
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:43,920
It's not liver hemangioma.

791
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,639
It's liver cancer.

792
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,639
Don't let your imagination run wild.

793
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,679
We'll have to run some tests.

794
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:50,840
We don't know for sure.

795
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,960
I'm not imagining things.

796
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,079
My liver...

797
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:56,639
has been hurting for months.

798
00:39:57,769 --> 00:39:59,000
A while ago,

799
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,159
I went to Ruirong Hospital for a checkup.

800
00:40:01,329 --> 00:40:02,400
It's confirmed.

801
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,719
It's liver cancer.

802
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,880
Stage four.

803
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,960
This...

804
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,920
How is this possible?

805
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:21,440
What's impossible about this?

806
00:40:21,769 --> 00:40:24,039
No, I mean...

807
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:25,840
Haven't you always been well?

808
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,920
Why all of a sudden?

809
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,809
Bad luck, I guess.

810
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:32,079
After we divorced,

811
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:34,119
I took care of our child.

812
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:36,920
Now she's all grown up...

813
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:38,809
and has matured.

814
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,559
But I caught this disease.

815
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:45,559
Tell me.

816
00:40:45,809 --> 00:40:47,119
What's the point of my life?

817
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:52,719
Just focus on your treatment.

818
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,809
Leave Xiao Yu to me. Okay?

819
00:40:57,239 --> 00:40:58,679
I know...

820
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,599
I haven't done well enough all these years.

821
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,679
I don't blame you.

822
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,000
Xiao Yu doesn't blame you either.

823
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,840
You're a doctor.

824
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,159
And you're the chief.

825
00:41:14,329 --> 00:41:15,440
How about this?

826
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,719
Transfer to our hospital.

827
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,809
Our doctors...

828
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:21,809
and equipment are all very good.

829
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,119
And if you transfer here,

830
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,039
I'll have someone to look out for you.

831
00:41:25,289 --> 00:41:27,039
It's already like this.

832
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:28,519
I don't need to transfer.

833
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:30,119
Ping An.

834
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,599
Actually, I came this time for Xiao Yu.

835
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,719
Don't worry.

836
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,239
I'll take good care of Xiao Yu.

837
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,480
I'm not pushing Xiao Yu to you.

838
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,809
What I mean is...

839
00:41:48,809 --> 00:41:50,039
I don't think...

840
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:51,809
our family be one from now on.

841
00:41:53,239 --> 00:41:54,880
I want Xiao Yu...

842
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:58,039
to be able to spend more time with her parents.

843
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:04,119
When I'm free,

844
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,840
I'll visit Xiao Yu often.

845
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,329
We haven't had dinner together for a long time.

846
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,840
Lately, Xiao Yu loves the grilled prawns...

847
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,679
I make for her.

848
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:15,239
How about this?

849
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,480
I'll make it for you at your place.

850
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,920
Of course, if it's inconvenient for you,

851
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:26,559
I'll make it at home and have Xiao Yu take them to you.

852
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,519
It's fine.

853
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:30,639
Just come.

854
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:34,679
Come, Xiao Yu.

855
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,519
Xiao Yu.

856
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:42,159
Let's go to your dad's place.

857
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:44,769
I'll make your favorite grilled prawns, okay?

858
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,039
Okay.
