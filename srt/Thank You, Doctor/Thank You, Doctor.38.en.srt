1
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,239
(Thank You, Doctor)

2
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:30,079
(Adapted from Sheng Li's novel "ICU 48 Hours")

3
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,079
(Episode 38)

4
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,439
Stage 4 liver cancer?

5
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:37,480
It was checked by Ruirong Hospital.

6
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,280
We just got the test results.

7
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,359
She wants to take the kid to have a meal at home today.

8
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:50,680
You don't have to tell me that.

9
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,840
You didn't spend much time with the kid before.

10
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,200
Now,

11
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,920
her mom is sick again.

12
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,200
You should spend more time with them.

13
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,760
Ping An.

14
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,400
Let's go.

15
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,810
I'll get going then.

16
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,199
Mr. Zhao.

17
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,370
This is Dr. Bai from the Emergency Department.

18
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,810
He used to be a top doctor in the Cardiac Surgery Department.

19
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,719
Mr. Zhao had coronary artery bypass surgery...

20
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:43,159
and aortic valve replacement at their county hospital before.

21
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:45,960
When he came to travel this time, he felt uncomfortable in his chest.

22
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,080
I did an electrocardiogram,

23
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,240
stress test, and cardiac catheterization.

24
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:52,319
I can't breathe.

25
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,319
During a routine checkup,

26
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,080
he suddenly found it hard to breathe and kept coughing.

27
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,280
It's getting worse now.

28
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,439
Also, he has tachycardia.

29
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:21,039
I can hear pathological murmurs in his mitral valve and aorta areas.

30
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,520
Could it be mitral stenosis...

31
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,280
or subclinical myocardial infarction?

32
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,439
It is more likely to be peripheral leakage...

33
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,639
caused by suture avulsion.

34
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:28,960
In this case,

35
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,520
should we let him return to the same hospital...

36
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,599
to continue with the treatment?

37
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,560
How can he move in his current condition?

38
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,599
How about this?

39
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,240
Let's do an echocardiogram first.

40
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,000
Aortic regurgitation.

41
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,240
Moderate to severe reflux.

42
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,840
We need to get him to the EICU.

43
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,159
Sir, what should we do next?

44
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,000
Contact the county hospital that performed the surgery.

45
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,479
It's best to do it as soon as possible.

46
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,800
We should leave this matter to the local county hospital, right?

47
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,919
Mr. Zhao just had surgery.

48
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,560
Considering the adhesion and pressure of further surgery,

49
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,360
opening his chest again is too risky.

50
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,000
It's safer to treat conservatively with medicine.

51
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,879
If we don't have a second surgery,

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,840
the patient's quality of life will be greatly affected.

53
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,560
But we have a problem.

54
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,960
Mr. Zhao is too old.

55
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:17,050
It's too risky if he undergoes another surgery.

56
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:18,879
How about this?

57
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,480
Contact the local hospital first.

58
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,170
Let's see how it goes, okay?

59
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,120
Everything was done properly.

60
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,360
There was no problem.

61
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,319
That's right.

62
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,839
There was no problem with the surgery.

63
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,199
Could it be that the calcification...

64
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,759
and deformation of Mr. Zhao's autologous valve...

65
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,759
affect the suture of the valve...

66
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,600
and cause the suture to fall off?

67
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,199
That's why it causes peripheral valve leakage...

68
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:34,600
and aortic reflux.

69
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,600
In this case,

70
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,160
I suggest that Mr. Zhao should be given...

71
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,480
the best treatment without surgery.

72
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,560
With Mr. Zhao's current condition,

73
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,079
there won't be any problem in performing another thoracotomy.

74
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,720
I watched the videos and records...

75
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,759
given by the county hospital five times.

76
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,319
He has sufficient healthy muscles and vasculature in his heart.

77
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:57,040
He can fully handle the intensity of thoracotomy.

78
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,560
But after the surgery, Mr. Zhao has been very weak.

79
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,079
That's because the suture is torn off and regurgitated.

80
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,560
Let's do another surgery to fix this problem.

81
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,519
I'm sure he'll get better.

82
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,759
I agree with Dr. Bai.

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,319
The patient in Bed Number 9 has difficulty breathing.

84
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,680
Honey.

85
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:15,759
Honey.

86
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,839
- What is it? - What's going on?

87
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:17,920
Doctor.

88
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,199
Blood saturation, 90. It's still dropping.

89
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,279
All right. Don't worry.

90
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,560
Intravenous injection.

91
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,560
0.4mg of Cedilanide.

92
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,279
- 40mg of Furosemide. - Okay.

93
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,759
Excuse me.

94
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,319
Sir.

95
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,720
Have you made up your mind?

96
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:31,000
Are you still worried about the risk of surgery?

97
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:32,079
The Emergency Department...

98
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,279
is a non-profit department.

99
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,959
We reveal the details of society...

100
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,959
and all patients.

101
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,600
The EICU is for saving people.

102
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,199
If we can save the patients,

103
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,920
we don't have any reason...

104
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,680
not to treat patients.

105
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,079
Do you understand?

106
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:54,319
I also want to say...

107
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,199
Sir.

108
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:58,720
You're becoming more and more like a real chief.

109
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,920
What do you mean?

110
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:02,439
Do you mean I used to be a fake chief?

111
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:05,879
Jokes aside,

112
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,160
no matter what kind of plan we formulate for the patient,

113
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:12,120
we still have to listen to the patient's opinions in the end.

114
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:14,399
You still have to talk to the patient...

115
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:15,959
and the patient's family after this.

116
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,000
- Okay? - Okay, don't worry.

117
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,560
Mr. Zhao, how are you?

118
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:21,759
Are you feeling better?

119
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,560
A little better.

120
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:24,720
Dr. Bai.

121
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:27,879
Will my husband never be able to get out of bed in the future?

122
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,920
If you choose conservative medication,

123
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,519
he might still be able to get out of bed.

124
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,559
Does that mean from now on,

125
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,679
I have to go to the hospital...

126
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,480
for treatment?

127
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,480
Yes.

128
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,600
You should also know...

129
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,759
that if you choose conservative medication,

130
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,720
it can only relieve the symptoms of reflux...

131
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:46,720
and it can't solve the peripheral valve leakage.

132
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I want to travel around the world.

133
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,919
I don't want to go to the hospital all the time.

134
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,519
If that's the case,

135
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,840
there's another option.

136
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,120
Second surgery.

137
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:58,279
Another surgery?

138
00:08:58,759 --> 00:08:59,759
He has to undergo surgery?

139
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:01,679
Will that work?

140
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,799
Surgery will damage his vitality.

141
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,559
Surgery after surgery...

142
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:06,879
How can...

143
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,120
my husband endure it?

144
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,519
Actually,

145
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,240
it's not just a matter of harming his vitality.

146
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,720
A second surgery...

147
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,039
may cause more severe bleeding than the first one.

148
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,360
It may even lead to death.

149
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:19,759
It's too dangerous.

150
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,039
We'll go with the conservative approach.

151
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,279
If the second surgery goes well,

152
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,600
can I be cured?

153
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,919
If the surgery is successful,

154
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,450
you'll be as healthy as before.

155
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:32,919
That won't do.

156
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,330
Honey.

157
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,210
We can't risk our lives.

158
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,559
Dr. Bai.

159
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,799
Are you confident?

160
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,720
Mr. Zhao, don't worry.

161
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,639
I will work with experts from the Cardiac Surgery Department...

162
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:45,639
to help you formulate the safest plan.

163
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,960
Thank you, Dr. Bai.

164
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:53,720
There is no obvious deformation...

165
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:55,279
found in the patient's annulus.

166
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,759
It's not a problem with the annulus.

167
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:59,759
The lobules didn't get in the ventricles.

168
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:01,210
That's right.

169
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,720
It opens normally...

170
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:04,360
and goes in the right direction.

171
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,000
- Silk suture. - Okay.

172
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,600
The patient's autologous valve ring doesn't match the artificial valve.

173
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,600
Yes.

174
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,279
After suture,

175
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,210
the lobules can't be closed completely.

176
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:26,559
There will be an opening...

177
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:29,240
large enough to allow blood to flow back.

178
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:31,759
Go and get another valve.

179
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,000
Yes, Dr. Bai.

180
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:48,639
Are you feeling better?

181
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,759
After a few days.

182
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,240
you'll be fine.

183
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,320
Thank you.

184
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:02,879
Keep up the good work.

185
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,679
Sir, I'll get back to work.

186
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,559
It's so sour.

187
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:19,919
I see.

188
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,840
Okay.

189
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,759
Thank you, Dr. Liu. You've worked hard.

190
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,080
Okay.

191
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,080
Bye.

192
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,080
Okay.

193
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,360
Ping An.

194
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,360
Why are you here again?

195
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,159
What?

196
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,200
Do you find me annoying?

197
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:48,759
Just say what you want.

198
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:49,759
I'm busy here too.

199
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,399
Xiao Yu got first place.

200
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,480
I asked her what she wanted as a gift.

201
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:55,399
She said she wanted a plush toy.

202
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:58,399
She also said you never gave her a plush toy.

203
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,240
You got the highest score on the exam this time?

204
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:05,879
That's great.

205
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,519
I'm proud of you.

206
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:09,320
How about...

207
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,440
we go buy a plush toy this weekend?

208
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:12,799
Thank you, Dad.

209
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,080
I only want the one I like the most.

210
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,960
I know you work hard.

211
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,960
I can't waste your money.

212
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,120
Good girl.

213
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:24,360
Let's go together this weekend.

214
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:25,559
There's no need.

215
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,879
I'll take Xiao Yu there myself.

216
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,440
You're not feeling well.

217
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:32,159
You should rest at home.

218
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:34,080
Ping An.

219
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,799
Do you despise me?

220
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:39,759
I'm sorry.

221
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,360
I know it's not good for me to bother you all the time.

222
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,440
However,

223
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:45,919
this body of mine...

224
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:48,639
- doesn't have much time left. - Li Ming Hui.

225
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,720
How long are you going to keep up the act?

226
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,440
What do you mean?

227
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:58,840
Xiao Yu.

228
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:02,679
Did you see that?

229
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:04,399
Your dad is going to find you a stepmom.

230
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,440
That's enough.

231
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,639
I don't want to argue with you in front of the kid.

232
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,279
Tell your dad that you don't want a stepmom.

233
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,759
You want us to be together.

234
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:14,399
- Tell him now. - Li Ming Hui.

235
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,159
Stop using Xiao Yu as a cover, okay?

236
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,759
I just called Dr. Liu from Ruirong Hospital.

237
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,720
You don't have liver cancer at all.

238
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:24,600
It's just an uneven fatty liver.

239
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:38,080
I'm sorry.

240
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,879
I didn't mean to lie to you.

241
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:45,240
You know what's on your mind.

242
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,399
What's on my mind?

243
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,840
I just want to give Xiao Yu a complete family.

244
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:52,720
Xiao Yu can't live without her dad.

245
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,559
That was not what you thought back then.

246
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:12,440
Lu Ping An.

247
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,039
I'm Xiao Yu's mom.

248
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:17,600
Am I not as good as that woman?

249
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:21,759
There's nothing to compare.

250
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,360
I know I've let you down in the past.

251
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:26,919
But I'm back now, aren't I?

252
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,879
Do you hate me that much?

253
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:29,960
I used to hate you,

254
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:32,639
but not anymore.

255
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:36,360
Let bygones be bygones.

256
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,679
We can't turn back time.

257
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,159
But there's one thing.

258
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:42,559
We're Xiao Yu's parents.

259
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:45,480
We should fulfill our responsibilities.

260
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,480
What do you think?

261
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,840
Xiao Yu.

262
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,080
Let's go.

263
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,919
Dad, I'm a good girl.

264
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:59,200
Don't abandon me.

265
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,759
Xiao Yu.

266
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,000
Remember this.

267
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,080
I'll always be by your side...

268
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:11,399
and you'll always be my sweetheart.

269
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:12,720
All right?

270
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:13,960
Dad.

271
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,440
Will you still buy me plush toys in the future?

272
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,440
Of course.

273
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:18,840
Didn't we agree?

274
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,600
We'll buy it this weekend.

275
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,720
Listen to your mom.

276
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,360
Go.

277
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,879
I'll call you this weekend.

278
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:43,759
Bye, Dad.

279
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,279
(Tongshan Hospital)

280
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,159
Come in.

281
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:15,399
- Sir. - Ms. Jiang.

282
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,120
This is the treatment plan for Bed Number 9.

283
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,279
I need your signature.

284
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:31,759
Ms. Jiang.

285
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,240
I'd like to have a word with you.

286
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,320
Have a seat.

287
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:45,639
My ex-wife was here...

288
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,919
Sir.

289
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,039
It's okay.

290
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,279
I'm fine.

291
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:51,320
That's good.

292
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,480
She has always been like that.

293
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:58,039
She doesn't care about other people's feelings.

294
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:01,840
When I first met her,

295
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:04,279
I thought she was a straightforward person.

296
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,680
I thought things would get better...

297
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,119
after we made adjustments.

298
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,599
After we got married,

299
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,890
she got even worse.

300
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:18,720
She complained about me every day.

301
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,559
She said...

302
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,170
I bought a smaller house.

303
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,200
She also said I didn't earn enough money,

304
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,680
not ambitious,

305
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,319
and content with the status quo.

306
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,039
So during that time,

307
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,279
I worked overtime at the hospital...

308
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,720
to make more money.

309
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,650
Maybe I was too naive.

310
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:41,200
She said...

311
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:43,890
she couldn't see hope being with me.

312
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:48,079
Then it got worse.

313
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:51,440
We fought very frequently.

314
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,799
In the end, she wanted a divorce.

315
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:57,650
Later on,

316
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,079
Later on, she really took Xiao Yu away.

317
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,599
After the divorce,

318
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:15,960
I became very lost.

319
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:18,650
Living as a married couple,

320
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,440
if we can't understand each other,

321
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,170
and support each other,

322
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:26,720
then being together...

323
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:28,170
is quite painful.

324
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,480
Maybe it's a relief...

325
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,960
to be apart.

326
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,960
Maybe.

327
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,200
Later on,

328
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,720
I put all my focus on work.

329
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,170
Every day,

330
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,410
I think about how...

331
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:48,480
to come up with a better treatment plan...

332
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,119
and what better treatment to help patients.

333
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:55,039
I know they all talk about me behind my back.

334
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:57,759
They say I've changed.

335
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:00,240
I've become a snobby person.

336
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:04,890
But that's not true.

337
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,680
I just want to use such means...

338
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,799
to distract myself...

339
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:13,279
so that I won't think...

340
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:16,920
about the great mental pain that divorce has caused me.

341
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,240
Everyone talks about me behind my back...

342
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:23,000
that all I care about is sales...

343
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:25,839
so that I can get promoted and get a raise.

344
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:28,920
That's not true.

345
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,839
I just don't want to...

346
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,519
and don't dare to stop myself.

347
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:44,920
You haven't changed.

348
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,960
You insist on operating...

349
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:50,319
on the patient with a broken finger who has given up treatment.

350
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,920
That's the best proof.

351
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,650
Don't worry about what other people think...

352
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,240
or say.

353
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,079
Those who truly understand you...

354
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,920
don't need your explanation.

355
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,200
I really envy Xian Yun.

356
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:08,920
He suffered so much,

357
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,119
but he still has you.

358
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,519
You've always been there for him.

359
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:24,440
I'm sorry. I...

360
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:26,200
I shouldn't have told you this.

361
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,480
I...

362
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,720
But these words have always been held in my heart.

363
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,200
In the past few years,

364
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,170
I don't know...

365
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:45,890
who I can talk to about these words.

366
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:49,799
I'm really sorry.

367
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:53,039
Sir.

368
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,799
If you have something to say,

369
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,480
you should let it out.

370
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:59,240
If you hold it in for too long, you'll get sick.

371
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:02,359
Next time,

372
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,759
if you still want to talk to someone,

373
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,079
I'm here.

374
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:07,039
I'm here to listen.

375
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,720
Thank you.

376
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,799
You should get back to work.

377
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,170
I'm sorry for taking up your time.

378
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:35,720
Take a look.

379
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,240
If there's no problem,

380
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,319
then you can sign it here.

381
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:39,359
What's the matter?

382
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:41,359
I'm processing Zeng Xu Ming's discharge.

383
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:42,599
Discharge?

384
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:43,759
We've discussed it.

385
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,759
I want to take Xu Ming back to his hometown...

386
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:46,799
to recuperate for some time.

387
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:48,599
Xu Ming is from Qingdao.

388
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:50,599
He grew up by the sea.

389
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:52,319
He loves the smell of the sea the most.

390
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,640
I think he will feel better looking at the sea.

391
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,839
It'll help him get better, right?

392
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,720
Apart from this,

393
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,079
I can't do anything else for him.

394
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,920
Xu Ming.

395
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,759
Where is he?

396
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,359
Hi. What's the matter?

397
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,480
Have you seen Xu Ming?

398
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,039
Zeng Xu Ming, stop right there!

399
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,319
Where are you going?

400
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:58,400
You don't want me anymore?

401
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:04,960
I'm paralyzed.

402
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,519
I'll be like this for the rest of my life.

403
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,079
But you're different.

404
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,359
You will have a better life after you leave me.

405
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:11,440
You think I didn't want to leave you...

406
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,559
because I felt guilty...

407
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,599
for saving that kid...

408
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,839
and not saving you in the first place, right?

409
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,519
You're wrong to think that way.

410
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,160
When I first saw you paralyzed,

411
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,519
I regret it too.

412
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:25,119
I thought about it too.

413
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:27,759
If I had saved you first, what would happen?

414
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:31,039
But soon, I let go of the burden in my heart.

415
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:35,400
Because I know my boyfriend and I are the same.

416
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:37,079
If you were me,

417
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:39,039
you would make the same choice as me.

418
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:48,000
I'm sorry, Li Shuang.

419
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:50,000
I was narrow-minded.

420
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,599
I'm sorry.

421
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:54,599
I'm sorry.

422
00:23:57,839 --> 00:23:58,960
I'm sorry.

423
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,880
Bai Zhu.

424
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:13,359
I'm a good friend, right?

425
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:15,160
Here, have two skewers.

426
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,960
"Apart from this,"

427
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:19,960
"I can't do anything else for him."

428
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:24,599
Nothing.

429
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,920
Chen Li Shuang said that today.

430
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,559
Why do I feel like you're talking about yourself?

431
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,880
The skewer looks good today.

432
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,480
Of course, I stayed behind to grill it.

433
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,079
You stayed behind to grill it?

434
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,640
All right, I'll try it.

435
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,799
What's wrong? You feel like coughing?

436
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,200
Are you okay?

437
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,440
Doctor.

438
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,119
As the baby grows,

439
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,799
the pressure on the patient's heart will become greater.

440
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,519
It will also increase hemoptysis.

441
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,279
It's hard to stabilize pulmonary lymphangioma.

442
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,920
The daily oxygen consumption will also increase.

443
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:20,480
We need to pay close attention...

444
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,880
to the situation of the mother and baby.

445
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:23,240
If necessary,

446
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:25,480
deliver the baby as soon as possible.

447
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:27,640
This will lessen pressure on her heart and lungs.

448
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,839
The patient's chance of survival will be higher then.

449
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,319
It's a solution.

450
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:34,640
At the moment, the baby is only 28 weeks old.

451
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,519
It weighs about 1kg.

452
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,400
To deliver a normal baby,

453
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,960
37 weeks is a minimum.

454
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:42,839
The patient's safety comes first.

455
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,720
There are still many precedents...

456
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,839
for the survival of 1-kg fetuses in the country and abroad.

457
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,960
No.

458
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:51,319
1kg is still too small.

459
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:53,200
Even if there's a precedent,

460
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,279
no one can guarantee that this baby will survive.

461
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,440
Given the patient's condition,

462
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:02,880
whether she's giving birth now...

463
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,039
or waiting until 37 weeks,

464
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,640
she is at great risk.

465
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,680
So I suggest we respect the patient's wishes.

466
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,079
Sure.

467
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,079
He has been fine in my belly for more than 190 days.

468
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,599
If I lose him because of the premature birth,

469
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,519
I can't accept it.

470
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:30,000
You promised me.

471
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,440
But you have hemoptysis now.

472
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,680
I'm tough.

473
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,720
It's all right.

474
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:50,519
Xiao Min.

475
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,440
We had a deal.

476
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,960
You can't change your mind.

477
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,559
Since the patient insists,

478
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:01,400
we'll wait until the full term.

479
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,960
However, we need to have a backup.

480
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,359
If the patient's condition is good,

481
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,920
we'll perform a cesarean section at 37 weeks.

482
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,880
If something unexpected happens,

483
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,759
we have to have an emergency plan.

484
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:24,440
Let's take a look at her situation.

485
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,920
How's the patient's condition?

486
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,440
His heart is beating faster.

487
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:29,839
That means her cardiopulmonary function has deteriorated.

488
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,960
We can't wait any longer.

489
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,240
Call the OB-GYN, Pediatrics,

490
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,319
Respiratory, and Cardiac Surgery Department...

491
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,400
for surgery.

492
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,839
- Okay. - Doctor.

493
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:38,440
My daughter will definitely...

494
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,200
give birth to the child smoothly, right?

495
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,039
We'll do our best...

496
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:43,680
to make sure the mother and the baby are safe.

497
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,079
Please come with me.

498
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,880
Okay.

499
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:51,680
The surgery is very dangerous.

500
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:54,240
Some accidents may occur.

501
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,000
For example,

502
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,759
after the placenta comes out,

503
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:00,359
her blood pressure will drop.

504
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:01,839
When her blood pressure drops,

505
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:03,359
her heart won't have enough blood supply.

506
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:05,319
It can easily cause...

507
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:06,599
malignant arrhythmias...

508
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:08,799
and even cardiac arrest.

509
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:11,000
But don't worry.

510
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,279
As a doctor, I'll do my best...

511
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:15,480
to protect the mother and the baby.

512
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:16,559
However,

513
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,920
if something happens,

514
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:23,319
I hope for your kind understanding.

515
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:24,359
Okay?

516
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,039
Thank you, doctor.

517
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:27,119
Thank you.

518
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:28,160
We'll do our best.

519
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,200
Okay?

520
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,720
Xiao Min.

521
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,920
Xiao Min, what's wrong?

522
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:47,359
Are you not feeling well?

523
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,000
- What's wrong? - I'm a little scared.

524
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:54,079
Don't be scared.

525
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,039
Come on.

526
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:03,400
Honey.

527
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,240
Honey.

528
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:08,759
I'm scared.

529
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,240
Xiao Min.

530
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,200
Don't be like this.

531
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,400
You make me feel bad.

532
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:31,160
Let's not...

533
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:33,240
Let's not have this child.

534
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:35,319
I'll tell the doctor right now.

535
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:36,720
We're not having the baby.

536
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:38,640
Honey, I'm fine.

537
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,759
I'm fine.

538
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,119
I just couldn't control my emotions.

539
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,480
I'm fine.

540
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,319
I'm fine now.

541
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,720
Xiao Min.

542
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:00,160
I'm begging you.

543
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,480
I'm begging you.

544
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,319
Let's not...

545
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,799
have this child.

546
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:16,640
Hong Wei.

547
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:18,920
Let's not be silly.

548
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:21,720
We've already come this far.

549
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,200
I'm tough.

550
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:27,119
I'll be fine.

551
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:28,240
I'm sure I'll be fine.

552
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:34,640
About...

553
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:38,720
About me crying just now, don't tell my parents.

554
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,920
I don't want them to worry.

555
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:44,400
I'm thirsty.

556
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:48,599
I'll get you some water.

557
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,559
Lie down.

558
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,720
Xiao Min.

559
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:06,079
Xiao Min.

560
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:07,440
Xiao Min, what's wrong?

561
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,519
- My stomach hurts. - Your stomach hurts?

562
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:10,559
Your stomach...

563
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,200
Doctor!

564
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:26,440
Take her to the operating room.

565
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,680
Call all the specialists.

566
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,799
The patient's heart rate...

567
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
indicates high pressure in the pulmonary artery.

568
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,279
Pay attention to monitoring various vital signs during surgery.

569
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,720
Okay.

570
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,720
Scalpel.

571
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:37,200
Let's cut the skin.

572
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:39,799
The operation starts at 12:14am.

573
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,920
(Tongshan Hospital)

574
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,240
(Room number, Name, Department, Code number, Status)

575
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,319
This is bad. The uterus is bleeding.

576
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:09,640
Gauze.

577
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,079
The bleeding won't stop.

578
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,480
Her blood pressure is dropping.

579
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,400
Get 2,000ml of blood...

580
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,200
and 1,000 ml of plasma fibrinogen.

581
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,279
Get me five prothrombin complex concentrates.

582
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:33,519
- Miss... - I'm going to get some blood.

583
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,160
What's going on?

584
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:37,279
I don't know.

585
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,240
Mother. She'll be fine.

586
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,480
- She'll be fine. - This is...

587
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:41,640
Who is Sun Fang Min's family?

588
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,880
- We are. - We are.

589
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:45,720
The baby is out. It's 1.5kg.

590
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,119
Just to let you know that...

591
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:48,160
the baby has been sent...

592
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,160
to the intensive care unit of the Pediatric Department.

593
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,240
Don't worry.

594
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,720
Miss, Xiao...

595
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:52,880
Sun Fang Min.

596
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,720
- How is Sun Fang Min? - She bled a lot during the surgery.

597
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,839
We're trying to save her.

598
00:32:56,839 --> 00:32:58,680
She bled a lot during the surgery.

599
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,960
What should we do?

600
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,440
Mother, don't worry.

601
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,960
Let's trust the doctor.

602
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:05,119
She'll be fine.

603
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:06,119
She'll be fine.

604
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,720
Little fellow.

605
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:15,799
Please watch over your mom.

606
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:17,440
I found the source of the bleeding.

607
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,799
Hemostat.

608
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,920
Where's the blood?

609
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,000
Go and take a look.

610
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:26,119
Here comes the blood.

611
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:27,480
Sun Fang Min, 28 years old.

612
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:28,559
Type AB, Rh-positive.

613
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,079
Six units. Confirmed.

614
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,799
Sun Fang Min, female, 28 years old.

615
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,279
Type AB, Rh-positive.

616
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:46,680
It's confirmed.

617
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,440
The bleeding has stopped.

618
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,039
Who's Sun Fang Min's family?

619
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,119
- We are. - Doctor.

620
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,599
We've stopped the bleeding.

621
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,289
The patient is fine for now.

622
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,289
Thank you.

623
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:17,639
I was so scared.

624
00:34:18,329 --> 00:34:19,440
I was so scared.

625
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:21,360
She's all right.

626
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,400
She's all right.

627
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,289
- She's all right. - She's all right.

628
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,599
She's all right.

629
00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:45,400
Hong Wei.

630
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:47,960
Go check on the baby.

631
00:34:49,809 --> 00:34:50,840
- Well... - Don't worry.

632
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,289
We're here.

633
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,239
Xiao Min will be fine.

634
00:34:57,769 --> 00:34:58,840
Okay.

635
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,769
I'll go check on the baby.

636
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,159
Usually,

637
00:35:19,329 --> 00:35:20,809
for patients with pulmonary lymphangioma,

638
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,199
there are three stages to giving birth.

639
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,679
The first stage is during pregnancy.

640
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:25,880
The second stage is during childbirth.

641
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:27,289
Luckily, she passed these two stages.

642
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:29,079
The third stage is the hardest.

643
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:31,079
After childbirth,

644
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:32,159
the blood in the body needs to be discharged.

645
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:34,159
It'll cause a huge burden on the heart and lungs.

646
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,079
Therefore, most maternal deaths...

647
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:38,159
occur in the month after childbirth.

648
00:35:38,329 --> 00:35:39,400
Anyway,

649
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,880
we can't let our guard down this month.

650
00:35:48,289 --> 00:35:49,329
Look at him.

651
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:51,289
He's so cute.

652
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:53,719
He looks like you.

653
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:56,920
He pursed his mouth when I went to see him.

654
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:59,199
He is so cute.

655
00:36:07,769 --> 00:36:08,769
When you get better,

656
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:10,769
let's go see him together.

657
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:35,599
Don't cry.

658
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,039
All right.

659
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:46,559
Rest for a while.

660
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:52,199
The patient woke up,

661
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:54,599
but his vital signs are unstable.

662
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,719
Her oxygen saturation is only 90 percent...

663
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,159
and it's falling.

664
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,809
If it doesn't go up,

665
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:01,239
it will cause blood pressure to drop,

666
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,519
heart rate to accelerate,

667
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:03,719
and even death.

668
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,119
Don't jinx it.

669
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:27,119
I missed you so much.

670
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:30,329
Don't give me that.

671
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,840
You've been in Shanghai for so long.

672
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,840
Why did you only visit me today?

673
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:35,519
I'm busy with my exchange studies at Ruirong Hospital.

674
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:37,239
I just finished studying, so I came to see you.

675
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:38,960
Are you surprised?

676
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,769
I'm more shocked than surprised.

677
00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:44,719
You don't mean what you say.

678
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:46,239
Have you not received flowers for a long time?

679
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,639
This is bad.

680
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:49,329
A rival has appeared.

681
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,960
Why are you coughing?

682
00:37:51,329 --> 00:37:53,840
I stayed up late to write my thesis...

683
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,239
and I caught a cold.

684
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,519
I'm fine. I took cold medicine.

685
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,840
You have a fever.

686
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,199
Come with me for a checkup.

687
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,119
- It's okay. I really don't need it. - Listen to me.

688
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,400
Okay.

689
00:38:09,809 --> 00:38:10,920
He dropped something.

690
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,039
Give it back to him.

691
00:38:16,329 --> 00:38:17,769
(I love you)

692
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:29,329
Tell me. Where do you feel unwell?

693
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:31,519
Sore throat, cough, fever,

694
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:32,719
and muscle soreness.

695
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,400
It's obvious that you didn't attend class.

696
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:36,360
You don't come to the hospital when you are sick.

697
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:38,159
Can this be solved by taking medicine by yourself?

698
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,440
Yes.

699
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:42,289
It's all my fault.

700
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,679
How should I write the main complaint?

701
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,079
Sore throat and cough for three days,

702
00:38:48,329 --> 00:38:49,440
accompanied by fever for half a day.

703
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:50,679
What else is there to write?

704
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,960
Current medical history.

705
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,440
Sure.

706
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,880
Pay attention in class.

707
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:01,239
Give me a break.

708
00:39:01,809 --> 00:39:04,199
I didn't want to come for a checkup because I knew you'd do this.

709
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,880
When people hear that we are medical students,

710
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:08,360
they are so envious and ask us,

711
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,329
"Do you not have to spend money to see a doctor?"

712
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,960
"Isn't it very convenient?"

713
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,400
They don't know...

714
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,809
that we have to avoid our teachers and classmates...

715
00:39:14,809 --> 00:39:15,920
when we see a doctor?

716
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:17,880
Otherwise, it'll turn into an exam.

717
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,519
What's your highest temperature?

718
00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:22,880
39 degrees Celsius.

719
00:39:24,289 --> 00:39:26,920
Is there any other discomfort other than sore throat and cough?

720
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,809
I also feel a little lethargic and my muscles ache.

721
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:32,480
Have you done any strenuous exercise?

722
00:39:32,809 --> 00:39:33,840
No.

723
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:35,880
Have you been out of town?

724
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,289
Any contact with chickens, ducks, or fowl?

725
00:39:37,289 --> 00:39:38,360
No.

726
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,559
Any diarrhea or abdominal pain?

727
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:41,239
Frequent and painful urination?

728
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,079
I don't think I have painful urination.

729
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,880
But my urine is quite dark.

730
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:46,079
There's even some foam.

731
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:49,239
I don't need that.

732
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,480
Open your mouth.

733
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,840
Let's do a hematuria test and a flu swab.

734
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:03,840
It's just a normal cold.

735
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,480
There's no need for a urine test, right?

736
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:11,239
Fine.

737
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:12,239
I'll go.

738
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:21,719
You have an Internet celebrity beauty.

739
00:40:22,769 --> 00:40:24,400
She has a handsome guy.

740
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:26,719
That's what you call...

741
00:40:31,769 --> 00:40:33,329
I was about to say something to you.

742
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Are you frustrated?

743
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,480
No, it's just...

744
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:45,679
Someone suddenly appeared...

745
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:48,239
and you don't even know what their relationship is yet.

746
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,559
Do you have to do this?

747
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:54,920
Can't you be more open-minded?

748
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:28,599
You still remember that I like to drink sugar-free drinks?

749
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,119
I bought it for you.

750
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,960
It tastes as good as before.

751
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:39,289
Let's have dinner tonight.

752
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,329
I have a night shift.

753
00:41:42,769 --> 00:41:44,559
I'm going back to Switzerland tomorrow.

754
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:45,599
Aren't you going to do me the honor?

755
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,329
It wasn't easy for me to come here.

756
00:41:47,769 --> 00:41:49,599
Your test results are not out yet.

757
00:41:49,809 --> 00:41:51,329
What if you can't leave tomorrow?

758
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:53,119
Can't you just hope that I get better?

759
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:55,719
That's enough.

760
00:41:56,039 --> 00:41:57,599
Let's have dinner at the cafeteria.

761
00:41:58,289 --> 00:41:59,289
Cafeteria?

762
00:42:07,769 --> 00:42:08,809
What's wrong, Dr. Bai?

763
00:42:08,809 --> 00:42:09,880
It's nothing.

764
00:42:29,809 --> 00:42:31,440
Young man, don't give up.

765
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:35,679
Although Dr. Xiao has many admirers,

766
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,239
of course,

767
00:42:37,329 --> 00:42:38,360
some are outstanding,

768
00:42:38,769 --> 00:42:39,920
I have faith in you.

769
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,440
You can do it.

770
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:43,289
Who's courting Dr. Xiao?

771
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:44,960
Don't be shy.

772
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,079
Aren't you courting Dr. Xiao?

773
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,519
What are you talking about?

774
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:49,599
She's my sister.

775
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,480
Have some water.
