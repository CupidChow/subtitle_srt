00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,159
(Thank You, Doctor)

(Adapted from Sheng Li's novel "ICU 48 Hours")

3
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,040
(Episode 32)

4
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:47,680
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,560
We did our best.

6
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,680
Thank you...

7
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,319
for your hard work.

8
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,919
He's the only one left in the family.

9
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:21,000
He must be so lonely.

10
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,560
When his daughter left,

11
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,039
he didn't shed a tear.

12
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,319
He was so calm.

13
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,599
I thought he was prepared for it.

14
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:35,439
I can't believe he collapsed just like that.

15
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,840
He must be heartbroken.

16
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,759
He's still young.

17
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,530
I hope he recovers soon.

18
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,039
He used to have a complete family.

19
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,319
Now he's all alone.

20
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,400
You're awake.

21
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,319
Why am I here?

22
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,039
You fainted.

23
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,919
Let me examine you to treat your symptoms.

24
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,479
I don't need any checkups...

25
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,319
and I'm not getting treated either.

26
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:13,919
I'm leaving.

27
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:15,560
I suggest you get a checkup to be safe.

28
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,840
It's none of your business.

29
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:20,039
You should get a checkup.

30
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,400
You're a doctor.

31
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,919
You can't stop me from leaving.

32
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:27,759
I'm going to find them.

33
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,039
I'm going to find them.

34
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,199
You're in a very dangerous situation now.

35
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,639
You might faint again anytime.

36
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,080
Calm down.

37
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,159
Calm down.

38
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,319
Let me go.

39
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:47,919
Let me go!

40
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,319
Dr. Bai.

41
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,639
I won't hurt you.

42
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,120
I just want to get out of here.

43
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,319
I don't want to get any treatment.

44
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:03,479
Okay?

45
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,479
Don't be nervous.

46
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,599
- Okay? - Don't get worked up.

47
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:08,960
I know.

48
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:10,560
You're just having a moment.

49
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,000
Put the pen down.

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,199
Let's talk.

51
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,680
Yes. Why don't you put the pen down?

52
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,839
There's nothing to talk about.

53
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:26,610
Nothing.

54
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,480
This doctor you're holding hostage has saved many lives.

55
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:30,730
Please don't hurt him.

56
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,079
I only have one request.

57
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,519
Let me go.

58
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,480
If I'm not mistaken,

59
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,050
I think you've already been examined, right?

60
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,560
You also have severe pancreatitis.

61
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,279
Mr. Wang.

62
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,519
Have you ever thought about it?

63
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,360
I'm sure...

64
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:25,639
your wife and daughter hope you live a good life...

65
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,360
and feel the beauty of this world for them.

66
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,360
You have the chance.

67
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,480
Why don't you cherish it?

68
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:39,959
I have a son. His name is Xiao Guang.

69
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,319
Ever since he was little,

70
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,240
he has been diagnosed with thalassemia.

71
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,720
All the doctors said...

72
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,759
that he wouldn't live past his first birthday.

73
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:47,759
However, I didn't give up.

74
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,519
He didn't give up either.

75
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,480
This illness attacks every day.

76
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,720
It's so painful when it happens.

77
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,079
Maybe even an adult can't stand it.

78
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,800
However, my son is still cheerful,

79
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,399
facing his life positively.

80
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:03,600
He's eight years old now.

81
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,439
Mr. Wang.

82
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:09,439
It's possible to cure this illness of yours.

83
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,439
You've lived for so long.

84
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:13,879
Can't you do any better than a child?

85
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,800
That's enough.

86
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,800
Get back to your work.

87
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,560
We've called the police.

88
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,720
Let the police handle the rest.

89
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,319
Today,

90
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:07,120
what happened to these two patients...

91
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:09,120
gave us a heads-up.

92
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,720
It's my problem.

93
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,040
The patient, Wang Qiang Jun's daughter...

94
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,199
had severe pancreatitis...

95
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:16,519
and passed away in our hospital.

96
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:18,360
I was her attending doctor.

97
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,639
I have actually noticed...

98
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:23,319
that Wang Qiang Jun's mood isn't right,

99
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,279
but I didn't take it seriously.

100
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:26,639
So...

101
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,160
what happened today is my fault.

102
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,079
- I'm responsible too. - Me too.

103
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,319
That's enough.

104
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,839
We're not here to find out who's responsible.

105
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:37,319
You have such self-reflection.

106
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:38,800
Very good.

107
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,040
That's the kind of attitude and responsibility...

108
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,040
doctors should have.

109
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,399
I completely understand you.

110
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,240
The tasks in our Emergency Department...

111
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,279
and EICU...

112
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,920
are difficult and burdensome.

113
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,199
Each of you...

114
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,000
are under a lot of pressure.

115
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,360
While treating patients, you have to take into account...

116
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:58,000
the psychological condition of the patients...

117
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,040
and their family members.

118
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,959
It's indeed a bit too much.

119
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,240
Yes.

120
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,959
The situation of every patient and family member is different.

121
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,879
Their psychological endurances are different too.

122
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:11,360
It's hard to tell their mental state.

123
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,759
That's right.

124
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,240
However,

125
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:15,800
that's not an excuse.

126
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,680
Think about it.

127
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:20,639
We're under a lot of pressure.

128
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:23,759
Patients and their families are under a lot of pressure too.

129
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,879
In the face of death,

130
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,120
they are likely to overreact...

131
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,720
and they may also...

132
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,279
do things that harm us...

133
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,919
and other patients...

134
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,480
or even the entire hospital.

135
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,559
We have a lot of cases like this.

136
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,759
Therefore, we must not take...

137
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:44,840
the psychological condition of patients...

138
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,720
and their families lightly.

139
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,000
We should pay attention and provide them guidance...

140
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:51,600
to avoid such things from happening again.

141
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,919
Just do what we should do.

142
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:56,919
Do it...

143
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,799
bit by bit.

144
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,120
Thank you.

145
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:50,720
Doctor.

146
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,639
I'm willing to cooperate...

147
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,120
and live well.

148
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,240
How about this?

149
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,330
In order to thank Dr. Xiao...

150
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,679
for her bravery today,

151
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:42,000
I'll treat everyone to supper.

152
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,639
What do you want to eat? I'll order.

153
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,039
Look at the time.

154
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,450
Let's forget about supper.

155
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,759
I'm afraid we'll be called away before we get to eat anything.

156
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,450
How about dumplings and apples?

157
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,879
The night shift in the Emergency Department.

158
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:53,450
- I can't forget that. - No one sells fruits...

159
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,450
in the middle of the night.

160
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,039
You're giving the delivery guy a hard time.

161
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,200
What do we eat then?

162
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,919
Let's eat chips.

163
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,000
It's called Russian roulette potato chips.

164
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,279
Although it's food, we can play it like a game.

165
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,240
There are six pieces of potato chips.

166
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,399
One of them is very spicy.

167
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,120
Let's take turns rotating them.

168
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:12,919
Do you dare to play?

169
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,679
Sure.

170
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:15,879
Why not?

171
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:18,039
Why not?

172
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:19,039
I'll do it too.

173
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:21,840
You can't be a loner.

174
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,200
It's boring.

175
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,120
Fine.

176
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,559
Aren't you bored? Why are you here?

177
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:37,519
I'm afraid that you'll be bored without me.

178
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,879
Here, let me demonstrate.

179
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,120
I don't feel anything.

180
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,879
This is pizza flavored. It's not spicy.

181
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,399
What do you mean?

182
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,840
You look disappointed when I didn't get to eat it.

183
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,559
I heard from my colleagues.

184
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,600
They went to eat hot pot with Chen Zhi.

185
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:04,600
He accidentally grabbed a piece of spicy beef...

186
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:07,600
and his face turned red like a cherry bomb instantly.

187
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:12,159
It's not spicy at all.

188
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,480
I'm a good person, so it can't be helped.

189
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,519
Let me try.

190
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,240
Mine isn't spicy either.

191
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,799
I can handle spicy food.

192
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:44,799
It's time to check your personality.

193
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:45,799
Let's do it.

194
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,039
I'm a good person.

195
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:49,240
I can handle spicy food too.

196
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,840
I'm not sure if you can handle spicy food.

197
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,399
That's impossible. How...

198
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:23,159
How can this be?

199
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,320
Dr. Xu. Did you get scammed?

200
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,960
There might not be any spicy ones.

201
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,559
Wait. Let's go for another round.

202
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:30,879
I have more. Another round.

203
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:32,120
This game is so boring.

204
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,039
- Come on. One more round. - Come on.

205
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,360
Who will go first?

206
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:45,919
- Me. - Okay.

207
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,519
How is it?

208
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:51,559
Is it spicy?

209
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,480
Is it spicy or not?

210
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,919
It's not spicy.

211
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,039
Try this one.

212
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,159
Sure.

213
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,440
Try it.

214
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,679
Thank you.

215
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,000
How is it?

216
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,039
It's not spicy.

217
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,759
- Does it feel good? - It's not in either packet, right?

218
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,200
Let me do it.

219
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,279
It feels good.

220
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:15,679
You can really take spicy food.

221
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:16,759
I don't think so.

222
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,039
You said it's not spicy.

223
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:24,200
- You got it, right? - He can't eat spicy food.

224
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:25,559
- A cherry bomb. - He ate it.

225
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:26,720
Look at his face.

226
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:34,759
Have you seen Xu Yi Ran?

227
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:36,200
No. What's wrong?

228
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,320
The inspection team will be here soon.

229
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,639
He's gone at this critical moment. This is so frustrating.

230
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,200
He must be hiding on purpose.

231
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:43,600
Hiding from who?

232
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:45,559
From Director Xu?

233
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,799
He has been having problems with his dad.

234
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,039
You shouldn't have sent him to welcome the team.

235
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:52,840
He runs out at the worst time.

236
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,559
When I see him later, I'll teach him a lesson.

237
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,879
You must teach him a lesson.

238
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:00,000
You'll be in charge of reception.

239
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:01,320
Me?

240
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,320
Sir, don't push it.

241
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,039
You don't have a choice. Hurry up.

242
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:06,120
I...

243
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,440
I didn't prepare anything.

244
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,559
How can I...

245
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,080
Dr. Xu.

246
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,879
Fellow experts, this way, please.

247
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,080
This is our EICU ward.

248
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,320
You're welcome to inspect.

249
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,120
We're not inspecting.

250
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,559
We're here to watch and learn.

251
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,240
Isn't that Dr. Bai?

252
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:37,360
Yes, that's him.

253
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:40,399
Bai Zhu and my son, Yi Ran, went to the same school.

254
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:43,320
When he was in school,

255
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,960
the teachers praised him a lot.

256
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:47,799
Even now,

257
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:49,720
his articles often appear in international publications.

258
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,240
He's young and promising.

259
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,399
Well, Yi Ran is also young and talented.

260
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:55,960
That son of mine...

261
00:15:58,639 --> 00:15:59,639
Forget it.

262
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,159
Let's not talk about him.

263
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,759
I heard there's another female doctor here.

264
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:05,240
She's also quite outstanding.

265
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:07,840
You must be referring to Dr. Xiao Yan, right?

266
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,600
She was specially hired by our director...

267
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,399
from Lausanne Hospital in Switzerland.

268
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,919
She worked as a Doctor Without Borders before.

269
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:17,679
Her medical skills are excellent.

270
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,639
You have so many talented doctors in the EICU.

271
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:23,200
- You're too kind. - Thank you.

272
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,039
All right, fellow experts. This way, please.

273
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:26,120
This way, please.

274
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,519
Dr. Bai.

275
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:42,639
Mr. Xu.

276
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,240
If you're not busy,

277
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,519
let's have a chat.

278
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:50,519
Sure, I still have 10 minutes.

279
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,840
Okay.

280
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:53,519
10 minutes then. Have a seat.

281
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,840
I took a look around today.

282
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,039
Tongshan Hospital is indeed a beautiful place.

283
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:03,320
Mr. Xu.

284
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:05,839
Is there anything you want to say? You can tell me directly.

285
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,960
You're just like me.

286
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:12,799
Not bad.

287
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,240
You know what?

288
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,039
Ever since you were in school, I've been noticing you.

289
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:17,890
So?

290
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,799
Are you interested in coming to our hospital?

291
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:25,440
I'm really sorry, Mr. Xu.

292
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,890
I can't help you with Yi Ran's affairs.

293
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:30,480
Well, Yi Ran...

294
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:32,799
doesn't resemble me in any way.

295
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:34,839
He only resembles me in this aspect.

296
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:36,440
Too stubborn.

297
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:40,440
You are his best friend.

298
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,359
If you join us,

299
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:45,839
I think it will affect his decision.

300
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:47,359
You're Yi Ran's dad.

301
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:48,890
You're also my elder.

302
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:50,279
I respect you.

303
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:51,279
However,

304
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:53,799
I really don't like it when I'm treated like a pawn.

305
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,119
I'm sorry.

306
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,319
A pawn?

307
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,559
You're mistaken, Dr. Bai.

308
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,039
One of the reasons I asked you to join Ruirong...

309
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:06,410
is because of Yi Ran.

310
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,079
However,

311
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,650
I really think highly of you.

312
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,680
Besides,

313
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,599
considering your future,

314
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,960
our hospital is more suitable for you.

315
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:21,720
Think about it.

316
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:25,039
You have profound medical knowledge,

317
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,519
outstanding adaptability,

318
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:29,240
a beautiful resume,

319
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:30,920
and fabulous educational background.

320
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:33,279
As soon as you join us,

321
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:35,759
I guarantee that in less than five years,

322
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:40,839
you'll have your own research project funding...

323
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,799
and your own lab at the same time.

324
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:49,559
The terms you mentioned are indeed very tempting,

325
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,680
but I'm not interested.

326
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,599
It's not just a waste of your abilities,

327
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,599
but it's also a waste of quality medical resources.

328
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,079
I'm used to being free and undisciplined.

329
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:06,119
I don't like to follow other people's pre-planned paths.

330
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:08,039
Even if I go to Ruirong,

331
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,240
after some time,

332
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:11,680
you won't be able to stand a subordinate like me.

333
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,960
It's no wonder...

334
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,799
that you and Yi Ran are best friends.

335
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,890
You two are so alike.

336
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,799
I've been there.

337
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:29,279
The path I designed for him is the fastest and the best.

338
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:32,000
I don't get it.

339
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,440
Why does he have to...

340
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:36,519
learn his lesson...

341
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,279
only then can he face reality?

342
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,960
I guarantee you.

343
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,000
If he continues to work here,

344
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,039
I don't think he'll be a director even if he works for his whole life.

345
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,480
Maybe he has never thought about becoming a director.

346
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:50,650
I think...

347
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,200
he just enjoys treating patients and saving people.

348
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:57,240
Becoming a director and having a good prospect...

349
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,480
It doesn't matter to him.

350
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,170
He's still too young and immature.

351
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:02,799
Mr. Xu.

352
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:06,200
I understand your good intentions as a parent,

353
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,079
but I have to remind you.

354
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,799
Don't impose your will on Yi Ran.

355
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,720
You may make things worse.

356
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,519
It's almost time.

357
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:16,650
I should get back to work.

358
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,410
Mr. Xu, see you next time.

359
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,170
See you next time.

360
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:22,720
Bye.

361
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,799
Did my dad talk to you?

362
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:42,839
He wants me to join Ruirong.

363
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,920
He even made me a very good offer.

364
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,839
It seems like my dad really likes you.

365
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,200
I doubt it.

366
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:55,279
He asked me to join Ruirong because of you.

367
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,119
But I have to say...

368
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:02,079
that your dad's deduction is pretty astute.

369
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,890
He knows that I have a huge influence on you.

370
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,650
If I go to Ruirong,

371
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,039
I'm sure you'll go too.

372
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:11,519
However, he miscalculated one thing.

373
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:13,799
He underestimated the difficulty of persuading me.

374
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,920
I, Bai Zhu,

375
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,440
won't change my mind...

376
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,240
for anyone...

377
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,720
or anything.

378
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:25,650
His respiratory system is normal, right?

379
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,720
Yes, it's normal.

380
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,720
I don't see any pantothenic acid in his digestive system.

381
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:32,410
Vomiting...

382
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:33,410
Yi Ran.

383
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,559
- You may get back to work. - Okay.

384
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,079
Why are you here?

385
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,519
Are you unwell?

386
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,519
No. My due date is near.

387
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm here for a checkup.

388
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,119
Everything is normal.

389
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,650
Are you here alone?

390
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,799
Why isn't anyone with you?

391
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:52,680
My mother-in-law came with me.

392
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,039
She has a stomachache, so she went to the restroom.

393
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,079
When is your due date?

394
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:05,599
The fifth of next month.

395
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:06,759
There's less than a month left.

396
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,839
Time really flies.

397
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:12,359
Back then, we used to do homework together.

398
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,720
It feels like yesterday.

399
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,640
In the blink of an eye, you're a mom.

400
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:20,480
You should hurry up too.

401
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:21,759
Don't be so picky.

402
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:23,079
You're missing out on all the good girls.

403
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:26,079
Yes.

404
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,960
Don't drink anything cold.

405
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:37,759
Come to my office to drink some warm water.

406
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:43,559
Let's go.

407
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,200
Here.

408
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,240
Drink some warm water.

409
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:59,160
Thank you.

410
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,119
I hope I didn't keep you from work.

411
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:08,480
I'm not busy right now.

412
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,400
They'll call me if there's a patient.

413
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:15,839
Right.

414
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,839
I ran into your dad just now.

415
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,359
There's an inspection team visiting our hospital.

416
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:21,559
He's the team leader.

417
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:24,960
Your dad asked me to persuade you to join Ruirong.

418
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,960
He really has the audacity to do anything.

419
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:31,000
He has your best interests at heart.

420
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,759
He never cares about what I think.

421
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,599
He only cares about what he thinks.

422
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,599
What a control freak.

423
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,039
Most parents are like that.

424
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:41,039
I couldn't understand it either.

425
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,720
As you know,

426
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,839
my parents are the same as your dad.

427
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:47,519
They just want me to follow their plan.

428
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,480
But now, I'm pregnant with my own child.

429
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,519
I've come to understand them.

430
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,759
Parents can give up everything for their children.

431
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,319
I can understand that.

432
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:03,200
In my department,

433
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,759
I have such patients and their families.

434
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,480
A dad with leukemia...

435
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:10,039
even tried to infect himself with the pathogen...

436
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:12,559
in order to find out what's wrong with his son.

437
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,000
I believe he's willing to sacrifice everything for his child.

438
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,680
Your dad is like that with you too.

439
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:26,960
Actually, deep down in your dad's heart,

440
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,799
he feels guilty toward you.

441
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:32,400
I know.

442
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,519
He's a very controlling person.

443
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,400
He's also very strict with me.

444
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:44,200
But there's always a kind of begging when he looks at me.

445
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:49,440
A begging behind a strong command.

446
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,519
Because of the divorce between him and your mom.

447
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,079
He must think that...

448
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,759
because of him, you didn't have a complete family.

449
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,680
So he's always trying to make it up to me.

450
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,880
In the way he thinks is right,

451
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:05,559
he paved the way for my development.

452
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,559
He even started socializing for my future.

453
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,680
He used to hate socializing.

454
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:17,880
I know it's not easy for him.

455
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:20,920
That's why whenever he made an unreasonable request,

456
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,519
I always agreed to it.

457
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,079
I was always softhearted.

458
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,359
But this time, I really have no choice.

459
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:33,799
I just want to follow my own way.

460
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:36,799
Children love their parents,

461
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:38,200
but they're always slow to realize it...

462
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,359
and then they regret it.

463
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,480
Yi Ran.

464
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:44,960
You should talk to your dad.

465
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,519
There's nothing you can't talk about between father and son.

466
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:50,279
I'm afraid it's hard now.

467
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:54,160
Maybe when I have my own child,

468
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,200
I'll be able to understand him.

469
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,240
Hello, Mother.

470
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,440
Don't worry. I'll be right there.

471
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:11,160
What's wrong?

472
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,319
My mother-in-law couldn't see me when she went back.

473
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:13,319
She's worried.

474
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,680
Don't rush it. Let me help you.

475
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,759
All right.

476
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,200
Don't rush things.

477
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:50,640
Take it easy. It's all right.

478
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:55,759
Where did you go?

479
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:56,839
You're pregnant.

480
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:58,039
Why are you wandering around?

481
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,799
Ma'am. Xiao Jing was chatting with me.

482
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,480
Dr. Xu.

483
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,400
Xiao Jing is a married woman.

484
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,079
Don't try to take advantage of every chance you get.

485
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,200
- Mother... - And you...

486
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:08,680
You're going to be a mom soon.

487
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,680
Whatever you do,

488
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,680
you have to be mindful of the consequences.

489
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,079
Let's go home.

490
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,440
Dad.

491
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:28,720
What a pity.

492
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,759
Xiao Jing is such a good girl, yet she married into such a family.

493
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,079
I still have patients. I'll get back to work.

494
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:39,160
Wait.

495
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:45,200
Do you have nothing to say to me?

496
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:46,640
I really have patients to see.

497
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,400
Are you really not going back to Ruirong?

498
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,599
Dad, I told you.

499
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:50,680
I'm doing fine here.

500
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,000
I don't want to go to Ruirong.

501
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,079
Fine.

502
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,960
You don't have to go back if you don't want to.

503
00:27:58,039 --> 00:27:59,720
Do whatever you want.

504
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,160
The inspection is over.

505
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,359
You can get back to work.

506
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,000
I'll get going.

507
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,960
Dad.

508
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,480
What is it?

509
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:24,400
You're busy with work.

510
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,079
Take care of yourself.

511
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,119
Don't treat yourself like a young man.

512
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,480
You brat.

513
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,720
Are you trying to control me?

514
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,240
Let me tell you.

515
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:46,279
I can work for another 20 years.

516
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:18,400
Has your dad left?

517
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,640
He came to say goodbye to me today.

518
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,519
I suddenly felt that he has aged.

519
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:30,640
I've been thinking.

520
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,240
I used to be so stubborn.

521
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,240
I wanted to run away from him.

522
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,319
Was I wrong?

523
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,039
I should at least consider his feelings.

524
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,519
After all,

525
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,119
I'm his only child.

526
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,640
When Xiao Guang first came here,

527
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,279
I didn't know how I should face him either.

528
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:57,240
Until one night,

529
00:29:57,799 --> 00:29:59,480
he was woken up by his own nightmare.

530
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,319
He rolled down the bed,

531
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:02,680
called out my name, and looked for me.

532
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,720
That's when...

533
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,000
I felt needed.

534
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,559
In this world,

535
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,680
you have someone to worry about.

536
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:21,839
Isn't that the greatest happiness?

537
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,559
Come in.

538
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:49,319
Dr. Jiang, are you looking for me?

539
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:51,599
It's on the table.

540
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:01,720
The preliminary results of the assessment are out.

541
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,640
See it for yourself.

542
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,799
- Is this accurate? - I'm afraid it's not.

543
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,799
I specifically asked someone to review it again.

544
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,720
I know.

545
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:17,279
The EICU is just getting started...

546
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,759
and it's still in the exploratory stage.

547
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:20,160
There's a lot to figure out.

548
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:22,240
However, I never thought...

549
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,359
that I'd get this many complaints.

550
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:25,599
Dr. Jiang.

551
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:26,960
It's all my fault.

552
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,559
When you proposed to set up...

553
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,319
an EICU in the Emergency Department,

554
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:32,319
I was on your side.

555
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,920
However, you know that...

556
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,200
I have a lot of different opinions from other departments.

557
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:39,559
I bit the bullet and assured them...

558
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,079
that the EICU would be able to do a good job.

559
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,039
Look at what happened now.

560
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:45,920
I'm the hospital director.

561
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:47,920
How am I supposed to explain this to everyone?

562
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:49,440
Don't worry, Dr. Jiang.

563
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,720
As you know, the EICU was just established.

564
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:54,400
It's still at the trial-and-error stage.

565
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,799
There are bound to be some mistakes.

566
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,440
But ever since the EICU was established,

567
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,839
we've saved so many critical patients.

568
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,720
That's a tangible result too.

569
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:03,200
The EICU was established...

570
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,960
to provide the best quality services...

571
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,720
to more critically ill patients.

572
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:09,640
We'll then be able to treat patients better.

573
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,000
Lu.

574
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:13,480
You must always...

575
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,200
serve the patients well...

576
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:16,960
and prioritize them first.

577
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,200
Dr. Jiang.

578
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:20,079
Stop it.

579
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,319
Just remember one thing.

580
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,880
You have a performance bond.

581
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:30,559
If anything happens again within six months,

582
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:32,720
I'll hold you responsible.

583
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,880
Excuse me. This way.

584
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,519
Female, 62 years old. 20 percent of her body burns.

585
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,720
Blood pressure, 120 over 80.

586
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,960
Heart rate, 110. There's one more in the back.

587
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,359
Xiao Song. Move the bed.

588
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,119
- What's going on? - Male, 65 years old.

589
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,480
85 percent of his body's surface burns.

590
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,680
I can't get his blood pressure.

591
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,960
Radial artery pulse, 112.

592
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,240
- Get a doctor. - Okay.

593
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:56,640
Steady.

594
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,720
By the time we got there,

595
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,240
she was performing CPR on her husband.

596
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:00,960
- 100 mg of pethidine. - Okay.

597
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:14,920
No congestion in lungs.

598
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:17,880
Where did you learn CPR?

599
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:19,759
I saw it on TV.

600
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,960
Doctor.

601
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:23,839
How is Guo Hua?

602
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,240
My colleague is trying to save him.

603
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,279
You have to save him.

604
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,440
Confirmation of the dilation of 1,000 ml of saline.

605
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,960
His chest is burning.

606
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,319
We have to perform an escharotomy on his chest.

607
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,559
- Scalpel. - Okay.

608
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,519
Are you sure you want to do it here?

609
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:39,799
There's no other option.

610
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,480
The chest can't expand anymore.

611
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,759
We need to release the epidermal tension.

612
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:46,799
Mother.

613
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,960
Mom.

614
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,160
What's going on?

615
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,960
Is my mother-in-law okay, doctor?

616
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,079
The patient has second-degree burns.

617
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,880
It will hurt a lot if we touch her skin,

618
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:55,359
but her life isn't in danger for now.

619
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:57,319
Mom. What happened to you?

620
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,640
It's all right.

621
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,960
Doctor.

622
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,680
Will Guo Hua be all right?

623
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:05,200
Bi Guo Hua?

624
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,319
Mum, didn't you agree to stop seeing him?

625
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,440
Why are you with him?

626
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,769
That's right, Mother.

627
00:34:09,769 --> 00:34:11,519
Why are you with him again?

628
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,880
He's not a good person.

629
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,719
Why won't you listen to us?

630
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,809
Don't talk about him anymore.

631
00:34:16,809 --> 00:34:17,880
Well...

632
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,840
Please leave the room.

633
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,920
The patient needs to rest.

634
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,039
Yes, please come with me.

635
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,679
This way, please.

636
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,159
Please wash the burned area with water...

637
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,400
and apply silver sulfadiazine cream.

638
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,769
- Get her ready for the EICU. - Okay.

639
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,079
Mom, I don't want to be in the hospital.

640
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:34,159
- Let me go home. - Xiao Min.

641
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,289
Be good.

642
00:34:35,289 --> 00:34:36,559
Doctor, come quickly.

643
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,360
What are you doing?

644
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,119
Let her go first. She's pregnant.

645
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,159
Aren't you afraid something will happen?

646
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,199
What happened?

647
00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:44,440
She wouldn't listen to us. She insisted on keeping the baby.

648
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:46,239
Who are you to stop her from giving birth?

649
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,159
She has pulmonary lymphangioma.

650
00:34:48,289 --> 00:34:50,440
- She can't keep the baby. - Dad, Mom.

651
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:53,519
I just want a child of my own.

652
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,039
Xiao Min, my girl.

653
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:56,119
Look at you.

654
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:58,000
Why are you still so stubborn?

655
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:00,639
Xiao Min.

656
00:35:01,769 --> 00:35:02,769
Doctor.

657
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:06,000
Her oxygen saturation is around 90 percent now.

658
00:35:06,289 --> 00:35:07,960
She's already in a state of hypoxia.

659
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:10,440
That includes her cough and hemoptysis.

660
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,599
It's because of the low oxygen.

661
00:35:11,769 --> 00:35:14,599
She bleeds a lot in a day.

662
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:19,039
The trash can at home is full of bloody tissue paper.

663
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:20,119
After all,

664
00:35:20,289 --> 00:35:22,039
it's caused by pulmonary lymphangiomyoma.

665
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:23,400
I've done some research.

666
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,000
It's possible...

667
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,769
for pulmonary lymphangioma patients to conceive a baby.

668
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,559
If the lung function is normal,

669
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,360
there's not much risk for patients with lymphangiomyoma...

670
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,639
to get pregnant.

671
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,440
But if your lungs are not functioning well,

672
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:36,920
I think you should avoid pregnancy.

673
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,239
You have a very serious pulmonary cystic disease.

674
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:41,639
It will cause serious damage...

675
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,719
to the gas exchange function of your lungs.

676
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,719
As your baby grows,

677
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:47,880
the symptom will get worse.

678
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,239
It can even endanger your life.

679
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,519
That's why we're suggesting that...

680
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:51,960
I'll give birth to this baby.

681
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:03,400
Doctor.

682
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,360
Doctor.

683
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,119
Look at Xiao Min.

684
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:09,039
What should we do?

685
00:36:09,289 --> 00:36:11,239
The patient's condition is quite dangerous.

686
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,440
You're her family.

687
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,440
You should advise her.

688
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,360
I hope she can terminate her pregnancy.

689
00:36:15,809 --> 00:36:16,960
You don't know it.

690
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:21,599
We've consulted all public and private hospitals.

691
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:23,440
They all say it's impossible to keep the baby.

692
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,289
But my daughter...

693
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,360
She's determined to have the baby.

694
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,199
We also don't know how to treat it.

695
00:36:30,809 --> 00:36:34,079
Her body is getting worse every day.

696
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,289
You saw it too.

697
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,289
If we didn't bring her here,

698
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,199
she wouldn't come to the hospital even if it kills her.

699
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,809
Why is she so stubborn?

700
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,159
Is having a baby more important?

701
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,599
Or is her life more important?

702
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,920
Exactly.

703
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,639
I know, right?

704
00:36:47,769 --> 00:36:49,840
Why does she want to have this baby?

705
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,440
Does she have something that can't be let go?

706
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,639
Or is someone forcing her to have this child?

707
00:36:54,769 --> 00:36:55,840
No.

708
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,079
No one forced her to have it.

709
00:36:58,809 --> 00:37:00,599
What about her husband?

710
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:03,360
Are her husband's parents eager to have grandchildren?

711
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,519
That's why she's forced to give birth?

712
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:05,769
No one forced her.

713
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:08,809
My in-laws treat her very well.

714
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,559
They don't want her to have the baby.

715
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:11,809
Doctor.

716
00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:12,880
Can you...

717
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:15,239
Can you...

718
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,039
Yes?

719
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,769
Can you give Xiao Min some medicine...

720
00:37:20,289 --> 00:37:21,679
to abort the baby?

721
00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:24,239
- That won't do. - That's definitely not allowed.

722
00:37:24,769 --> 00:37:26,559
Although from a medical point of view,

723
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,880
we hope that the patient...

724
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,960
will terminate the pregnancy as soon as possible,

725
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:31,239
the decision still is up to her.

726
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,039
No one can decide for her.

727
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:34,079
Please, doctor.

728
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:35,960
Please save Xiao Min.

729
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:38,329
Don't worry. We'll do our best.

730
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:41,000
I'll let her stay in the hospital for a few days for observation.

731
00:37:41,329 --> 00:37:42,769
After that, we'll also find specialists...

732
00:37:42,769 --> 00:37:44,400
from other departments for consultation.

733
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:46,599
As her family, please talk to her.

734
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,679
We'll find a chance to talk to her.

735
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,679
- Thank you. - Thank you.

736
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:52,400
- Thank you, doctor. Please help us. - Thank you.

737
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,639
Don't rush it.

738
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:54,679
Thank you.

739
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:56,559
- Please. - Thank you.

740
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:57,639
She's fine now.

741
00:37:58,599 --> 00:37:59,639
Doctor.

742
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:02,039
When will Guo Hua wake up?

743
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:03,599
It's hard to say now.

744
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,159
His condition isn't good.

745
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:06,289
You need to rest more.

746
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,480
- Dr. Bai. - Chief Li.

747
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,480
Chief Li.

748
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:13,599
Mom.

749
00:38:13,769 --> 00:38:15,159
This is from our neighborhood.

750
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:17,360
Mr. Zhang and Mr. Rui.

751
00:38:19,289 --> 00:38:22,000
We need to ask you something about the fire.

752
00:38:22,289 --> 00:38:24,079
What happened to Guo Hua's house?

753
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:26,559
There was wind and it was a big fire.

754
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:28,039
The fire brigade couldn't save it.

755
00:38:28,329 --> 00:38:29,360
It burned down.

756
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:31,400
According to the inspection of the scene,

757
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:33,239
I believe the fire...

758
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,809
was caused by an electrical overload.

759
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,400
You were there too.

760
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,239
Did Bi Guo Hua use...

761
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:39,360
any electrical appliances in violation of the law?

762
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,360
The house burned down.

763
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:44,000
What's the use of asking this?

764
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:46,840
The fire not only burned down Bi Guo Hua's house,

765
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:49,000
but it also burned down a convenience store nearby.

766
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,000
It caused a lot of financial damage.

767
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,039
We need to clarify the responsibility...

768
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,440
and decide on the amount of compensation.

769
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:56,400
It must be that old man, Bi Guo Hua.

770
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,840
Burning down his own house isn't enough,

771
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:00,360
he even burned down the convenience store.

772
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,000
Officers.

773
00:39:02,289 --> 00:39:03,440
Make him pay for the damages.

774
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,719
Please tell us the truth about the situation at the time.

775
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,519
Mother.

776
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:11,719
What are you talking about?

777
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,159
Are you still keeping it a secret for him?

778
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:14,880
Tell the police now.

779
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,039
If you don't tell us the situation at the time...

780
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,559
and you can't clarify your responsibilities,

781
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,159
as one of the parties,

782
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,480
you may have to bear...

783
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,719
some of the responsibility for compensation.

784
00:39:24,519 --> 00:39:26,159
Mom. Tell us.

785
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:29,000
How much will it cost?

786
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:31,360
Preliminary estimate is at least 150,000 yuan.

787
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:33,199
Mother.

788
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:35,159
Do you still want to take the blame for him?

789
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,329
Mom. Don't be crazy.

790
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:38,920
It's 150,000 yuan.

791
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:40,199
We...

792
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:41,519
Where do we get that much money?

793
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:45,599
I remember now.

794
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,000
It must be Bi Guo Hua.

795
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:48,679
He's not in good health.

796
00:39:48,809 --> 00:39:51,000
Every winter, he's freezing to death.

797
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,679
He must have had the heater on.

798
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,519
That's how the fire started.

799
00:39:54,769 --> 00:39:55,769
Is that so?

800
00:39:56,289 --> 00:39:58,880
Did Bi Guo Hua use a high-power electric heater?

801
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,480
Mom.

802
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:05,880
It's 150,000 yuan.

803
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:08,360
You don't even spend money on extra classes...

804
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,519
for your granddaughter, Miao Miao.

805
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,039
How can you be so cruel?

806
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,360
Miao Miao is your granddaughter.

807
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,769
Is she no better than an outsider?

808
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,440
Yes.

809
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,400
He used an electric heater.

810
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:34,679
He caught a cold,

811
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:36,289
so I went to take care of him.

812
00:40:37,329 --> 00:40:39,840
The heater was on.

813
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,360
Did you see the heater on fire?

814
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,679
I gave him medicine...

815
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:46,559
and put him to bed.

816
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:49,360
After that, I fell asleep on the couch.

817
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,769
When I woke up,

818
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:55,329
the fire is already burning out of control.

819
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:57,239
We've noted down everything you said.

820
00:40:57,719 --> 00:40:59,809
If there's anything we'll come to you again.

821
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:01,769
- We'll get going. - Okay.

822
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:03,599
Officers, thank you for your hard work.

823
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:04,639
Let's go.

824
00:41:12,289 --> 00:41:13,440
Listen.

825
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:15,289
She needs to rest.

826
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:17,360
Don't let her emotions fluctuate too much.

827
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:19,960
- Okay. - If you feel uncomfortable,

828
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:21,480
you can call the nurses.

829
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,920
Thank you, doctor.

830
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,079
Thank you, doctor.

831
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,960
Mother.

832
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,769
Don't blame us for scolding you.

833
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:32,480
How many times have I told you?

834
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:33,960
Don't hang out with that old man.

835
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,480
But you wouldn't listen.

836
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,639
Now that there was a fire, are you happy now?

837
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:39,809
I don't get it.

838
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,599
What's so good about that old man?

839
00:41:42,289 --> 00:41:44,880
In our neighborhood, there are so many reliable old men.

840
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,719
Why do you like him?

841
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:53,289
He's willing to stay with me.

842
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:06,440
For tens of days,

843
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,039
I don't see you or Miao Miao.

844
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:13,199
Even if he's not doing well,

845
00:42:14,809 --> 00:42:16,599
I can still see him.

846
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:21,289
He can walk and chat with me every day.

847
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:25,679
I'm old now.

848
00:42:26,769 --> 00:42:27,809
I just want...

849
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:30,159
someone to be with me.

850
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:32,119
Mother.

851
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:34,159
It's our fault.

852
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:35,769
Mom.

853
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:38,840
From now on, we'll spend more time with you.

854
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,719
It's too late.

855
00:42:49,719 --> 00:42:50,719
This is what they say,

856
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:52,239
"Dating in later life is like an old house on fire."

857
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:54,159
A partner...

858
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:55,880
is to have a companion when we're old.

859
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:57,679
We have to control the patient's dosage...

860
00:42:57,809 --> 00:42:58,880
to prevent infection.
