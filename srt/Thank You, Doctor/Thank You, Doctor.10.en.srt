16
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,680
Okay. It's like this.

17
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,000
Since everyone is here, let's do a small meeting.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,080
Everyone is busy. I'll keep the long story short.

19
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,340
The wife of the Chairman of Hua Man Real Estate has breast cancer relapse again.

20
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,560
There are no obvious effects after treatment in other hospitals.

21
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,700
She wants to be transferred to our hospital to continue treatment.

22
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,320
The wife of the Chairman of Hua Man Real Estate?

23
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,830
- Don't tell me you're talking about Ge Xue Hong? 
 - Ge Xue Hong?

24
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,050
How can someone have this kind of name?

25
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,250
She has relapse of breast cancer?

26
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:07,150
Why don't she go to the breast surgery department or oncology department? Why does she want to come to our emergency department?

27
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,080
It's like this. No matter what reason they have,

28
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,860
since they trust our hospital,

29
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,090
we must live up to their trust, right?

30
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,400
and Dean Jiang also specially told me

31
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,220
that we must show

32
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,440
our Tongshan Hospital's enthusiasm.

33
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,490
Enthusiasm?

34
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,620
- What kind of enthusiasm? 
 I know.

35
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,530
I heard from the people of the infrastructure department

36
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,640
that someone is planning to donate a new laboratory building.

37
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,720
Don't tell me the person is Ge Xue Hong?

38
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,080
She already paid of it. Of course we need to serve her well.

39
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,790
What serve?

40
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,320
We should be more enthusiastic to our patients, shouldn't we?

41
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:49,410
Besides, she donated a building to us. She is also supporting our healthcare.

42
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,400
We should respond with our enthusiasm.

43
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,490
Sounds really impressive.

44
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:57,480
Let's put this aside. There's an important point.

45
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,290
This patient has a request for her attending physician's 
seniority.

46
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:06,140
So I and Dean Jiang have carefully discussed about it.

47
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:11,270
We have planned for Doctor Xiao to accept this Ge Xue Hong...

48
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,210
The Ge Hong patient.

49
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,110
You have no opinions, right?

50
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,840
You guys were chatting well and suddenly talked about me.

51
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,920
Director, I have a lot of patients on hand now.

52
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,840
How about letting Tang Hua look after your patients?

53
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,350
Director, I think

54
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,530
you know the function of our ER and EICU more than me.

55
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,810
- Xiao Yan... 
 - Director, I also heard you guys chatting just now.

56
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,680
Donating building and such. We understand

57
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,440
that your work has difficulties, too.

58
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,330
But I can't accept this patient.

59
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,190
I go and make my rounds first. You guys chat.

60
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,950
- Director, I... 
 - Since Xiao Yan is busy,

61
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,690
then

62
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,400
how about you accept, Yi Ran?

63
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,690
Me?

64
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:11,800
Director, I reckon Ge Xue Hong won't want me due to my seniority.

65
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,660
- You choose somebody else instead. 
 - I'll do it.

66
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,020
- You? 
 - Why?

67
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,030
My seniority is not enough?

68
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,500
- Your seniority is enough. It's just... 
 - Then forget it.

69
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,650
Then you ask Doctor Tang Hua

70
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,450
or Chen Zhi.

71
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,820
- Okay. 
 - At most, this laboratory building will not be built.

72
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,450
Anyway, Dean won't do anything to you.

73
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:40,490
Director, since someone volunteered, you just let him do it.

74
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,720
Anyway, if there are any problems later, there's someone to take the blame, isn't it?

75
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,480
Take what blame? If there's a need for someone to take the blame, I'm the one.

76
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,320
Since Bai Zhu volunteered,

77
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,320
then you accept this patient.

78
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,260
There's something I need to remind you. Because I heard this patient

79
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,630
has a long-term illness, her temper is not good.

80
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:05,620
- And she's quite mean. 
 - This aspect is similar to Bai Zhu.

81
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,130
Don't create trouble.

82
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,110
Bai Zhu, I must remind you.

83
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,750
- You must manage your emotions well. 
 - Don't worry.

84
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,650
I'll take the blame if any problems arise.

85
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,290
Okay.

86
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:19,660
Since Doctor Bai is the attending physician,

87
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,890
we must cooperate with him well.

88
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,700
We try our best to make the patient satisfied,

89
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,480
including Nurse Jiang,

90
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,650
- your side... 
 - Don't worry about the nursing side. I will personally look after.

91
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,250
Don't worry, We'll serve

92
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,100
Ge Xue Hong, this living "Buddha", well.

93
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,750
Okay. Then we'll go with this first. We carry on with our work.

94
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,750
Xiao Bai, I have something to tell you. I must...

95
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,800
It's okay. Even though Doctor Bai said it like that,

96
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,400
he actually has a good sense of responsibility.

97
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,800
As long as there are no problems.

98
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:58,040
<i>[Emergency]</i>

99
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,360
- Remove? 
 - That's right.

100
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,390
Both breasts need to be removed.

101
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:05,270
Only this way, the lesions can be completely removed.

102
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,920
Otherwise, it's incurable if the cancer cells spread.

103
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,220
Don't you specialize in creating miracles?

104
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,850
You misunderstood. I'm not the one doing the surgery for you.

105
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,960
But I can tell you, after the surgery,

106
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,810
it's already biggest miracle when the cancer cells don't spread anymore.

107
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,330
I'm not removing.

108
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,080
Remove or die. You choose.

109
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,280
I'm not removing!

110
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,680
I cannot die, too.

111
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,280
It's okay. You still have time to consider.

112
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,610
When you've thought it through, come and find me again.

113
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,930
Come in.

114
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,940
Teacher, you're looking for me?

115
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,570
How's the matter on Ge Hong's surgery?

116
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,950
She still doesn't want to do the resection surgery.

117
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:07,080
It's very difficult to make up the mind.

118
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,350
But we cannot delay her condition any longer.

119
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,800
- You have to convince her as soon as possible. 
 - How can I convince her?

120
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,680
Think of a way!

121
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,850
You are her attending physician.

122
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,160
- You are the dean. 
 - How are you talking to me?

123
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,880
Teacher, there's really nothing I can do. Really.

124
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:28,910
Teacher, if you can transfer me back to Cardiac Surgery,

125
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,610
maybe I will be struck by a brainwave and think of a very good idea.

126
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,200
Get lost.

127
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,730
Close the door.

128
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,440
That thought of yours, Dean won't see it?

129
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,340
Based on your usual virtues, you will accept a patient like Ge Hong?

130
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,380
When something is unusual, there must be a bad reason for it. Dean rejected you, right?

131
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,280
He told me to get lost.

132
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,640
That's right.

133
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:08,480
Is there any way to make Ge Hong change her mind?

134
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,810
Then you have think why she doesn't want to remove first. What is the secret behind it.

135
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,990
I found this.

136
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,040
When she was young?

137
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,390
When she was young, she was gorgeous woman. She was good-looking her whole life.

138
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,760
She cares about her looks and figure the most.

139
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:30,390
So she's almost 50 years old now but looks like she just turned 40.

140
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,590
Being good-looking or saving her life is more important?

141
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:36,440
She can't even understand this. She lived 50 years for nothing.

142
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:41,220
But don't forget, she's currently fighting with a young pretty woman for her husband.

143
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,680
To Ge Hong, she's disadvantaged on this matter.

144
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,260
If she removes both her breasts,

145
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,230
isn't it equivalent of her surrendering?

146
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:53,300
She was hospitalized for so long. Did her husband come to see her once?

147
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,080
Giving up her life for a man like this,

148
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,810
she's really stupid.

149
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,560
You're a bit like Tang Hua.

150
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,670
No matter man or woman, sacrificing oneself for unworthy people, that's stupid.

151
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,960
Xiao Yan, discussing patients' privacy is not your style.

152
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:14,000
Are you caring about the patient or helping our Teacher Bai?

153
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:22,590
Do you know that Ge Hong has a daughter studying in Britain now?

154
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:26,810
If you can't convince her, you can consider asking her daughter to convince her.

155
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:29,020
I found her daughter's email address.

156
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:32,010
Why not you try to send an email to her?

157
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:45,010
- Is it okay if I write like this? 
 - How about adding one more line, "Hope that you come back to the country,

158
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:47,680
your mother needs someone to take care of her".

159
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,680
Okay. You can send it.

160
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,020
Xian Yun?

161
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:11,020
Don't move, don't move. Are you ok?

162
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,100
I'm fine. I just hate myself for being so useless.

163
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,650
Hate me for coming home late. It's past dinner.

164
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,310
Take your time, don't hurt yourself.

165
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:25,550
Here, let me push you out before I clear up.

166
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,990
You didn't burn yourself right?

167
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:42,500
I've cleared it all up. Now I'll make dinner.

168
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:49,280
Here. In future don't get restless. Just wait for me.

169
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,030
Do you have a cold? Don't give it to me.

170
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,130
No, it's just a runny nose.

171
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:59,080
Come here, I have some medicine. Let me make it up for you.

172
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,560
I'll do it, I'll do it.

173
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,680
Why don't we hire a nurse?

174
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,270
Why are you bringing that up again?

175
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,440
I know I'm too proud. I really hate myself for it.

176
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,910
I wanted to prove that I could take care of myself, but look what happened.

177
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,640
You had to spend all that time clearing up.

178
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,690
I'm your wife, if I don't clear up, who will?

179
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:43,290
Let's hire a nurse, ok?

180
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:46,520
Then you can stop worrying about me at work.

181
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,460
Why don't you call that male nurse,

182
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,720
ask him if he found a job or not. Hey, take your time.

183
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,690
Just ask him.

184
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:01,610
It's hard to find home nurses these days. And his rates were so cheap he's definitely been snapped up.

185
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:05,270
Don't worry, leave it to me.

186
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:08,080
I'll ask him. Now I'll make dinner.

187
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,530
<i>[Director Chen]<i></i></i>

188
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,170
<i>[Nurses Station]<i></i></i>

189
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:50,320
Lin Zhi. Remove the IV on bed 4.

190
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,910
Alright.

191
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,890
Monitoring Room No. 2 needs temperature taken every hour.

192
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,360
Head Nurse.

193
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,000
- Director. 
 - You see, I asked Fan.

194
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,250
He hasn't found anything more suitable yet,

195
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,190
so he's able to work for you. I'm so happy to hear it.

196
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:11,310
I didn't tell you, how did you know?

197
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:14,760
Last night, Xian Yun sent me a message.

198
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,370
He was worried you wouldn't know how to tell me.

199
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:23,220
Director, I've given you so much trouble. Looking and then not looking.

200
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,050
Of course not!

201
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:28,410
How about I give Fan a call and ask him to come here this afternoon.

202
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:32,410
You two can discuss things in person, and he can go back with you to get used to the house.

203
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,460
You can decide when he starts.

204
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,060
Ok.

205
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:40,320
Director, I'm sorry for being so much trouble.

206
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,450
Don't be so modest.

207
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:46,170
Once things settle down at home, I can give you extra jobs!

208
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,560
I promise I will work hard.

209
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,430
Oh yes, how is Ge Hong doing?

210
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:55,940
She seems to be doing well. This morning Doctor Bai brought in an oncology doctor to see her.

211
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:59,150
- I see. Well, I won't keep you any longer. 
 - Yes.

212
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:06,180
Director! Thank you.

213
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:12,750
Director Chen, why are you so happy?

214
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,510
Get back to work.

215
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,560
Thank you, Doctor.

216
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,850
Doctor Bai, do you remember me?

217
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:36,860
You're back from Beijing. Are you in a rush this time as well?

218
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,030
You-you still remember me.

219
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,040
Is it still the high blood pressure?

220
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,650
These last two days, I haven't been well.

221
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,700
I remember what you told me about last time Doctor Bai,

222
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,580
so I went to get a CT done at San Hospital.

223
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,700
Let me have a look.

224
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,180
Here it is.

225
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,310
Do you have the endocrinology report?

226
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,260
Here.

227
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:14,070
Looking at the results, you seem to have an adrenal tumor. It's benign.

228
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:17,770
This has caused your high blood pressure.

229
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:20,210
The doctors at San Hospital said the same thing.

230
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,270
Why didn't get treated at San Hospital then?

231
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:26,430
Doctor Bai, you still have a grudge?

232
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,840
So about my tumor...

233
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,300
Since it's benign, we'll do a surgery to remove it.

234
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,100
It should help with the high blood pressure as well.

235
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,040
Really? Thank you, Doctor Bai.

236
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,460
My high blood pressure

237
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,100
has been a problem for so many years.

238
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,710
Go and complete the hospitalization procedures.

239
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:44,800
I'll schedule your surgery as soon as possible.

240
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,920
Thank you, thank you.

241
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:51,060
Doctor Bai, you are the cleverest,

242
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,410
most responsible doctor I've met!

243
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,950
As well as the doctor with the sharpest tongue.

244
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:20,340
Hello.

245
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,780
Sorry, please queue up.

246
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,410
You go first.

247
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,770
I'm looking for Doctor Bai.

248
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,160
You mean Doctor Bai Zhu?

249
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,940
So that character is pronounced 'Zhu'? Yes, I think that's him.

250
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,910
I'll ask for you.

251
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:44,390
Doctor Bai, there is a lady looking for you in triage.

252
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,330
Excuse me, your name is...?

253
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,690
Li Xuan.

254
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:51,120
She said she is called Li Xuan.

255
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,920
I see.

256
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,000
Doctor Bai wants you to wait for him at the clinic.

257
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,510
Thank you.

258
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,690
Sorry, I forgot to ask. Where is his clinic?

259
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,670
Go straight ahead and then turn right, you'll see the clinic.

260
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,170
Ok, thank you.

261
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,940
Excuse me, what's wrong.

262
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:19,420
Doctor, it's my insomnia...

263
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,420
Wait a moment.

264
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:28,900
You are...Li Xuan?

265
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,400
You're pretty handsome, Doctor Bai.

266
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,670
- Have you seen your mother? 
 - Do you have a girlfriend?

267
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:37,560
Let's talk about your mother's illness.

268
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,580
No need, you set it all out in your email.

269
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,970
Did you want me to come and say my final farewells?

270
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,930
You're mother won't accept treatment or surgery.

271
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:49,940
But, there is a great chance of success with this surgery. I want you to persuade her.

272
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,650
Don't put your hopes in me.

273
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,210
She won't listen to me.

274
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,750
But you are her daughter.

275
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,210
Doctor Bai, you don't seem to understand your patient.

276
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:01,650
Of course, biologically speaking I am her daughter.

277
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:07,290
But for her, I'm just a way to get revenge on my father.

278
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,270
You'd better think of something else.

279
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,060
You came all this way, why don't you go and see her.

280
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,410
Who knows when your next chance will be.

281
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,670
Ms Ge, here is some hot water.

282
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,450
It's boiling. How can I drink this?

283
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,540
Sorry. I will go and get some cooler water.

284
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:49,360
Young Miss! When did you get back?

285
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,770
Why are you dressed like that?

286
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:01,840
I guess its genetic.

287
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,600
Why are you staying here? It doesn't seem to suit your tastes.

288
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:09,370
Weren't you happy studying in the UK? Why did you come back?

289
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,330
Does your father know?

290
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:15,830
I heard you are ill. I thought I should at least show my face.

291
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:19,070
Or else all the doctors and nurses would think you have no family or friends.

292
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,300
I'm fine.

293
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,490
You can go back.

294
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:27,380
Makes sense. I'm off then. Take care.

295
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,750
Young Miss, let me walk you out.

296
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,930
No need. Stay and take care of her.

297
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,670
Bye!

298
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,670
Doctor Bai, you see what I mean, right?

299
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,910
I can't help you with her.

300
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:44,020
- Bye. 
 - Wait.

301
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:47,130
You can't bear to let me go?

302
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:50,670
Then let's exchange numbers. We can hang out in future.

303
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,850
Here.

304
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,610
Doctor Bai, you're so traditional.

305
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,320
Bye!

306
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,120
Who was that?

307
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,940
Li Xuan. Ge Xue Hong's daughter.

308
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,290
She's Li Xuan?

309
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:23,400
So hot.

310
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,210
You're so rude.

311
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,350
Did Ge Xue Hong agree to the surgery?

312
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,520
They have a unique mother-daughter relationship.

313
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,930
Aren't you getting on well with her assistant?

314
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,050
Yes.

315
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,770
I wanted to keep it discreet, but I can't help it.

316
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,790
It's so tough.

317
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:56,270
- What are you trying? 
 - You guess.

318
00:20:56,270 --> 00:21:01,450
She said when Li Xuan was 10 years old, her mother send her abroad by herself.

319
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:05,170
Even her husband didn't know where Li Xuan was.

320
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,060
Li Xuan felt like she was abandoned.

321
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,740
So her relationship with her mother has been very frosty.

322
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,120
They only call a few times a year, and she rarely comes back to China.

323
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,760
Did she say why Ge Xue Hong sent Li Xuan away?

324
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,980
She wasn't sure.

325
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,060
But if I was to guess,

326
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,680
it must be because Li Xuan was getting in her way.

327
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,160
How?

328
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,610
Fighting over her husband with all his mistresses.

329
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:35,040
Li Xuan said that Ge Xue Hong used her as a weapon to get revenge on her father.

330
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,220
So she sent her away was to get revenge on the cheating husband.

331
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,610
The purpose was to separate them,

332
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:43,470
and not let the cheating husband see his own daughter.

333
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:48,100
No matter how much she hated her husband, she shouldn't use her own daughter as a weapon.

334
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,160
Hate makes people irrational.

335
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,650
No, that can't be.

336
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:56,320
Wasn't the reason Ge Xue Hong didn't want to get a double mastectomy

337
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,090
to keep her husband's attention with her beauty. How did it become hate?

338
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:04,830
How could such a proud person lose to mistresses?

339
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:09,240
She did it because of hate, not love.

340
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:13,240
What a pity for her daughter.

341
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,580
No matter what, it seems there's no way forward for us.

342
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:20,520
We can't solve this mother-daughter relationship.

343
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,960
Not necessarily.

344
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,000
As I see it, they both still

345
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,540
care about each other.

346
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,840
Why can't I see it?

347
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,240
That's the difference between you and me.

348
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,420
I like your confidence.

349
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,150
Keep going.

350
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,790
- Do you think she's here? 
 - She should be.

351
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,490
- Hi, doctors! 
 - She's here.

352
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,640
And on time.

353
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,630
Let me introduce you.

354
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:53,690
This is emergency room doctor, Xu Yi Ran.

355
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:56,250
- This is Li Xuan, Ge Hong's daughter. 
 - Hello.

356
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,090
- Nice to meet you. 
 - Nice to meet you too.

357
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:01,810
I guess you have to be handsome to work at Tongshan Hospital.

358
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,640
You are very good looking, Doctor Xu.

359
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,980
You have good judgement.

360
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,560
Although, you still can't compete with Doctor Bai.

361
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:15,390
Are you sure? Are you sure you don't need to see the opticians?

362
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:17,690
Alright, let's get down to business.

363
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:19,370
Doctor Bai, why are you so serious?

364
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:23,750
He's not serious, he's nervous around pretty girls.

365
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,700
Really?

366
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,720
Doctor Bai, am I pretty?

367
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,070
He has a better undertsanding of aesthetics, ask him.

368
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,800
Doctor Xu?

369
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,350
I think you very much suit my understanding of beauty.

370
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:40,820
Take a look at this.

371
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:46,310
Doctor Bai...I've told you already.

372
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,350
I can't help you with her.

373
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:51,450
We found these documents ourselves.

374
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:54,990
Your mother has been donating to charity.

375
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:59,560
Most of them are organizations to do with mother and baby or child development.

376
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,220
So? What are you trying to say?

377
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,240
She is thinking of you.

378
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:14,470
You clearly also care for her. Why can't you admit it?

379
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,900
Who do you think you are?

380
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,690
I'm busy, good bye.

381
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,300
See.

382
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,960
Even though Doctor Xiao found these documents, even if your hunch is right,

383
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,730
even if Li Xuan is thinking of Ge Xue Hong, so what?

384
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:34,960
Do you really think going back to Ge Xue Hong will convince her to have the surgery?

385
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,880
Let's see how it goes.

386
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,150
Why aren't you answering the question?

387
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,690
Just wait.

388
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:43,960
Wait for our new laboratory to be built.

389
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,110
Your attitude, honestly!

390
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:51,420
You said you often drink alcohol. It might be cirrhosis.

391
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:54,980
We can only know for sure once the CT comes back.

392
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,630
I'll send you for a CT, then you can come back to see me.

393
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,080
Ok.

394
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:08,010
Thank you, Doctor.

395
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,970
Doctor Xiao, you seem quite busy.

396
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:17,240
What do you want, Doctor Bai?

397
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,760
Thank you for the documents, they helped a lot.

398
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,600
You're too modest.

399
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,580
I found some new documents this morning.

400
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:30,100
They might be of use for you. When I'm free, let's discuss it?

401
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,870
Sure.

402
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:34,040
<i>[EICU]<i></i></i>

403
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:47,690
Doctor Bai.

404
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:52,450
Your mother just took her medication, she isn't sleeping yet, why don't you go in and say hi.

405
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:56,590
I didn't come for her. I came to see Doctor Xu.

406
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,050
Just wait here, he'll be out soon.

407
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,760
What are you looking at so seriously?

408
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,830
It's a web novel Li Xuan wrote.

409
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:21,160
It was Li Xuan who wrote this web novel?

410
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,330
How did you find it, Doctor Xiao?

411
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,790
I found the link on her Weibo.

412
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:29,750
But this was written four years ago, when she first started university.

413
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:33,360
Although she used a penname,

414
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,580
She used it to log in to literary forums.

415
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:39,600
The personal information, date of birth and university are all the same as Li Xuan's.

416
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,880
But the content is key.

417
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,780
Whether its the parents of the main character, or their situation,

418
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:49,350
from one glance you can tell it is about Ge Xue Hong and her husband.

419
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:54,350
I never thought that Li Xuan would write novels.

420
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:56,000
What did she write?

421
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,460
What was in her heart.

422
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,750
- What was in her heart?
  - You're right.

423
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:04,500
In this novel, the main character was abandoned by her mother at a young age.

424
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,500
She lived alone by herself in the UK.

425
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,380
But she never gave up on her desire for maternal love.

426
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,630
She dreamed of returning to her childhood,

427
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:16,640
returning to her mother's embrace. Got it?

428
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,120
Yes.

429
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,570
Take your time.

430
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,280
Doctor Bai, you're here.

431
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,920
Ms Ge.

432
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,190
I brought you something.

433
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,370
What is it?

434
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,500
A novel written by your daughter.

435
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,780
She can even write novels?

436
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:57,630
I would advise you to read it when you can. You might learn something.

437
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,910
I'll leave it here.

438
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,740
Doctor Bai!

439
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:08,350
I know what you are trying so hard to do.

440
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:11,680
I'm asking you, don't waste your time.

441
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,220
I won't agree to the surgery.

442
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:17,450
Get me an oncology as soon as possible.

443
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:20,390
And a new treatment plan.

444
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,330
I almost forgot to tell you.

445
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,900
When you read the book, make sure you have some tissues.

446
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:31,780
And don't get too emotional, it will affect your condition.

447
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,070
<i>[Emergency]<i></i></i>

448
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:56,690
The vital signs of the patient in bed 14 are all normal.

449
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:00,030
I just checked her blood pressure and blood sugar, no problem there.

450
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,310
<i>Going Home.<i></i></i>

451
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:34,050
I opened my right fist and stretched out my palm.

452
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:38,650
A deep line ran through the center of my palm.

453
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:42,800
I used the middle finger of my left hand

454
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,980
to carefully trace the line from left to right.

455
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:51,420
The quiet depressions, the strong warmth,

456
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:57,390
and a sudden overwhelming sense of vertigo.

457
00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:02,080
The book said that people with a line like mine

458
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,540
will wander without a home.

459
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:11,740
I was like wooden toy, abandoned in the corner of the prop cupboard in a huge theater.

460
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:15,200
My face covered in dust.

461
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,310
Opening my dark eyes,

462
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:22,280
I tried to hear the sound of snow falling.

463
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:28,530
But apart from the occasional sounds of footsteps, or a bursts of applause,

464
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:31,460
I couldn't hear a thing.

465
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:37,220
I was there through all four seasons. Always.

466
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:40,760
But the mother who had

467
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,060
danced a beautiful dance on the stage with me, was no longer there.

468
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,880
She had forgotten

469
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,520
that there was a pitiful girl she was irrevocably tied to.

470
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:54,540
Just like her, she had dark eyes,

471
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:59,780
and soft hair and a satisfied smile.

472
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:05,130
She had forgetten, that I am still here.

473
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,610
And I will never escape,

474
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:13,840
as someone who has died in endless time.

475
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,190
Did you take these?

476
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,330
That's a breach of privacy.

477
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:30,470
You should show those to Li Xuan. She thinks you don't love her.

478
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:32,820
Leave me.

479
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,180
Leave me, now!

480
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:45,650
Ms Ge, people can't live forever in hate.

481
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:03,640
Did she take those photos by herself?

482
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:08,640
She didn't admit it, but her reaction gave her away.

483
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,130
It's really stupid to let oneself live under a mask.

484
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,500
Aren't you shamefaced to criticize other people?

485
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:19,940
If she cares so much about Li Xuan, why doesn't she work hard to restore their relationship?

486
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:25,090
In my opinion, she doesn't want to involve  Li Xuan into the war between her and her husband.

487
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:29,530
Therefore, the only way is to make her stay out of the situation.

488
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,320
Following your line of thilnking,

489
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:37,770
if Ge Xue Hong shows the photos to Li Xuan, do you think she'll be moved?

490
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:41,540
Ge Xue Hong definitely wouldn't show those photos to Li Xuan.

491
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,540
That's what I think, too.

492
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:56,510
Haven't you been wanting to see Li Xuan?

493
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:01,030
- Photos? 
 - They are all in her PC.

494
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,690
Is it true that, once the breast cancer cells metastasized,

495
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,510
there is no hope?

496
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:19,250
That's right. Once they are metastasized, even if they are removed,

497
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:21,780
death is only delayed by chemotherapy.

498
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,790
- Miss. 
 - Did you get it?

499
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:47,350
I sneaked it out.  Madam doesn't know.

500
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:49,720
Don't worry. This matter has nothing to do with you.

501
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,710
- You can go back now. 
 - Okay. I'm going back.

502
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:12,640
Let's eat.

503
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,580
Did you take these photos?

504
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,290
So you have them.

505
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:23,670
I thought they were stolen by a thief in the hospital.

506
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,240
Did you take these photos?

507
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,910
Yes. I took them all.

508
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:31,290
Why?

509
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:33,090
Let's eat first.

510
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:36,840
Tell me. Why?

511
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,880
You are still wilfull just like when you were little.

512
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,870
Tell me!

513
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:49,870
You know that, to revenge against your dad at that time,

514
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:52,220
I sent you to England.

515
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,590
I know that you hate me and don't want to see me.

516
00:35:55,590 --> 00:36:00,000
Therefore, I could only secretly go to England.

517
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,500
I secretly followed you.

518
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:07,290
I stayed by you to pass the most important moments in your life.

519
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:12,010
Whenever you were happy or unhappy,

520
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:14,720
in love or out of love,

521
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,530
graduated from school or starting on a job,

522
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,500
I always wanted to be by your side.

523
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:27,700
Because, those moments

524
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:31,660
were the most unforgettable

525
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:34,180
and happiest times in my life.

526
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:47,790
But your father never had the chance to experience those moments.

527
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:54,950
At that time, he didn't know where you were

528
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:56,990
or what you were doing.

529
00:36:56,990 --> 00:37:00,430
Whenever I thought about how I could stay by you to watch you grow up but he couldn't,

530
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:02,660
I would feel so happy.

531
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:07,850
Whenever I look at these photoes, I would feel overjoyed.

532
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:14,540
I know you want to hear some sort of answer by coming over today.

533
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,560
But I don't want to lie to you.

534
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:21,460
From the time I sent you abroad until now,

535
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:24,060
everything that I've done to you

536
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,380
has been for revenging against your dad.

537
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:29,560
It's all to make him unhappy.

538
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:41,670
Do you know why I'm meeting you at this restaurant today?

539
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,020
I believe that you haven't forgotten it.

540
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:50,410
Ten years ago, the last dinner before I sent you to England

541
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:52,420
took place here.

542
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:55,910
You especially liked the steaks here.

543
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,010
Do you want to taste it today?

544
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:12,300
It looks like you don't have much of an appetite.

545
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:20,980
Xiao Xuan, I sent you away to England from here ten years ago.

546
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,870
Ten years later,

547
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,920
I will send you away once more from here.

548
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,590
Go ahead and leave.

549
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,800
Go back to England and live your own life.

550
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:50,600
Don't ever return.

551
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:05,650
I'll never forgive you in my whole life.

552
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:55,170
<i>[Dr. Xu]</i>

553
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:05,520
She's not answering the call.

554
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,150
Send a text.

555
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:12,430
- Do you think she'll come? 
 - She will.

556
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,850
<i>]12:38]</i>

557
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:19,050
<i>[Ge Hong is in a coma. Reply immediately when you see this text]</i>

558
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,160
Have the cancer cells metastasized?

559
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,540
Not for now. Her coma is due to a brain hemorrhage caused by high blood pressure.

560
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,990
It may be caused by emotional over-excitement.

561
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,830
It doesn't have any direction relationship with her breast cancer.

562
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:52,900
Brain hemorrhage? Is it severe?

563
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,890
Luckily she was sent here in time, so the hemorrhage has stopped.

564
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:58,050
It's not life-threatening for now.

565
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:06,710
I just saw her at noon.

566
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:09,460
At that time, she was still fine.

567
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:12,270
After you left, your mother fell unconscious.

568
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,910
The ambulance brought her from the restaurant.

569
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:21,230
Your mother's assistant said that she talked with you.

570
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,420
What are you trying to say?

571
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:26,930
I want to tell you that whatever she said was not true. Your mother actually loves you very much.

572
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:35,020
Dr. Bai, I know that you are a good doctor.

573
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:38,630
To save her, you've thought of many ways.

574
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:42,450
But things really aren't like what you think.

575
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:46,080
Whatever she told you, it's because she has cancer.

576
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:50,490
She doesn't want to burden you. She doesn't want you to get involved in the trouble between your dad and her.

577
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:54,230
She wants you to hate her, forget her, and start a new life.

578
00:41:56,140 --> 00:42:00,070
But she didn't understand that, the hatred toward someone

579
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:02,840
cannot let you begin a new life.

580
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,960
I find it impossible to believe what you're saying.

581
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,320
That's fine. I understand.

582
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:13,720
But I also believe there has to be someone by your side who knows the truth.

583
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:22,710
Your mother's condition has been worsening, and surgery is needed as soon as possible.

584
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:26,910
If the cancer cells spread, it'll be too late.

585
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:33,170
Li Xuan, your mother really needs you.
