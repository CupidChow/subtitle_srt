<i>[Episode 5]</i>

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,480
Teacher Bai, you're watching the patients' surgery video.

17
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,720
Can you recommend some websites for me to learn?

18
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,390
I asked you to read the textbook from start to end. Have you finished reading?

19
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,530
I've not finished reading yet.

20
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:18,360
Bai Zhu. Currently, the person who is the best at being haughty, cold and a maverick is Xiao Yan.

21
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,810
I advise you to change your persona as early as possible.

22
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,780
You still don't believe?

23
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,230
I ask you, do you, Tang Hua and that group of young nurses

24
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,150
think that Xiao Yan is mysterious and cold?

25
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,830
Doctor Xiao is mysterious indeed.

26
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,380
We all think she's a mystery.

27
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:38,200
You see. The people's eyes are sharp.

28
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,070
Then you tell me

29
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,520
which aspects of Xiao Yan do you feel is mysterious?

30
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,660
When she first came to the ER,

31
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:48,220
her outfit was like female knights' in movies.

32
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,600
Usually when doing consultation at work,

33
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,110
- she's like a white angel. It's like two different persons.
- How mysterious.

34
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:59,110
And you say, why does a woman like her always ride such a big motorcycle?

35
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:02,030
- It's difficult to understand.
- The thing that is the most difficult to understand is

36
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,600
why did she give up her job in Switzerland which has a bright future

37
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,290
and come back to the country to be an ER doctor?

38
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,590
There must be a reason behind this.

39
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,640
You two are performing Xiangsheng*?
<i>(T/N: traditional performing art in Chinese comedy)</i>

40
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,370
I'm telling you

41
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:17,510
you are not the only special person in Tongshan Hospital.

42
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,980
<i>[Ambulance]</i>

43
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,550
The patient fainted when she was strolling in the neighborhood. Now she has regained consciousness.

44
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,840
Her other vital signs are stable.

45
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,470
- Granny, what is your name?
- Xia Qing Yun.

46
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,350
- How old are you this year?
- 85 years old.

47
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,380
- 85.
- I was told that there are two patients.

48
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,980
Actually, there is only one patient.

49
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,070
I sprained my back because I was helping her.

50
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,560
I'm okay.

51
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,460
Slowly. Be careful. Pay attention to her head position.

52
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:07,290
Just now when she fell, she knocked her head.

53
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,620
Pei Hai, don't mess around for no reason.

54
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,320
Let the doctor concentrate on her work.

55
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,530
Granny, Grandpa's reminder is right.

56
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,120
We need to be more careful. Are you still feeling dizzy?

57
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,550
No. It's just that I don't have energy.

58
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,610
Okay. I'll check.

59
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,540
Doctor, I've checked on the ambulance. She's okay currently.

60
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,470
He used to be a doctor.

61
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,110
He likes to show off. You all forgive him.

62
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,790
Come, Granny. Hold my hand.

63
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,000
I feel that I can't raise my right hand.

64
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,410
Your right upper arm muscle strength has decreased.

65
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,080
You check my husband.

66
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,620
Just now, he fell himself when he was helping me.

67
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,860
He fell on the stairs.

68
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,490
He still didn't want to let go of my hands.

69
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,950
- How about this? I'll bring you to do a check-up later.
- I'm okay.

70
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,940
Just now, she regained consciousness 1.5 minutes after she fainted.

71
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,030
You do a brain CT scan for her.

72
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,950
You are professional.

73
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,860
I used to be a doctor at the Cardiac Surgery Department.

74
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,200
He's bragging again.

75
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,160
Who's asking you?

76
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,390
Don't tell them what to do.

77
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,840
This is a hospital. Since we are here,

78
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,970
we'll listen to the doctors and cooperate well.

79
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:27,930
Young Man, quickly check my husband's

80
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:30,360
- back.
- Don't worry.

81
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,630
- Grandpa, how about this? You follow me to the consultation room. I'll do a check.
- No need.

82
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,020
It's okay, it's okay.

83
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,070
Doctor, you need to an ECG for her

84
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:41,280
- and test for cardiac enzyme.
- Okay.

85
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,250
- I'm counting on you.
- Don't worry.

86
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,130
Lin Zhi, do a brain CT scan for Granny.

87
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,720
Okay.

88
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,110
Just now, I heard Granny call you Pei Hai.

89
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,410
If I'm guessing it right, you were the famous Cardiac Surgery Department specialist,

90
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,540
Teacher Shen Pei Hai.

91
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:03,220
- You know me?
- I don't just know you.

92
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,430
Your research results that year is our important study material.

93
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,980
Your name is well-known.

94
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,870
Young Man, you studied well.

95
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,830
You are my idol.

96
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,570
It's painful here.

97
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:21,270
I have a slipped disc.

98
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,880
It was very painful these past few days.

99
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,680
It's an old injury. I'll eat painkillers.

100
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,630
Okay, Teacher Shen. How about this?

101
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,480
I'll check your abdomen. Lie down there.

102
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,390
- Okay, okay.
- Come.

103
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,330
You also know to bend your knees.

104
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,820
It's a little painful.

105
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,630
Teacher Shen, you bear with it for a while more.

106
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,750
It's painful.

107
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,790
Okay, got it. I'm done.

108
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:22,190
Teacher Shen, I think pain in these two areas is not closely related to the slipped disc.

109
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,840
To be safe, I suggest to do a CT scan. What do you think?

110
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,450
Okay. After all, my wife said that

111
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:32,250
you are the doctor. I must listen to you.

112
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,540
The results of Granny's check-up is out.

113
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,130
Can I see the report?

114
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:49,910
Why are you getting in on it? You also don't know about the matters of the brain.

115
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,570
Doctors also study general medical care.

116
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,970
Young Lady, you tell us.

117
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,490
I and him are medical workers.

118
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:00,670
He's a doctor, and I'm a nurse.

119
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,060
We've seen a lot of things.

120
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,770
It's brain hemorrhage

121
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,920
with chronic subdural hematoma.

122
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,880
If we do not intervene, there will be an increase in blood loss. The decrease in muscle strength will get worse.

123
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,610
When the time comes, you will gradually lose self-care ability.

124
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,500
Other dangers might also happen.

125
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,860
- What if I do surgery?
- Usually this condition

126
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,880
we'll arrange for surgery at the neurosurgery department.

127
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,710
Can I recover after the surgery?

128
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,050
I won't lie on the bed and can't move, right?

129
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,470
This is expected.

130
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,770
- But...
- But what?

131
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,680
But we don't recommened you to go for surgery.

132
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,700
- Don't keep interrupting!
- Grandpa is right.

133
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,760
I personally don't recommend you to go for the surgery.

134
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,510
If the surgery is successful, it can indeed slow down the onset and reduce the sequelae.

135
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:54,560
But considering your age, the risk of the surgery is too big.

136
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,550
And I'm worried that there will be other complications after the surgery.

137
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,300
- So...
- So we are not doing the surgery.

138
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,470
- Don't talk. This is my matter.
- You have to listen to me on this matter.

139
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,740
If I listen to you, I will be bedridden.

140
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,290
- Who will take care of me? You?
- Me.

141
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,250
Why? What's wrong with it?

142
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,520
You can't even take good care of yourself.

143
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,170
We can hire a housekeeper.

144
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:20,510
You don't have to rush on this matter first. You can discuss again.

145
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:23,820
Young Lady, what's the results of his check-up? I also want to hear.

146
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,920
Teacher Shen's CT scan is not out yet.

147
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,600
We still don't know the exact condition.

148
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,990
But the early signs of a lot of conditions of the abdomen are abdomen pain and back pain.

149
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,170
So it's normal that Teacher Shen thought that it's a relapse of an old injury.

150
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,500
Later I bring Teacher Shen to do a blood test.

151
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,400
Okay, I'll listen to Doctor Bai.

152
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,250
I'll do whatever checks that Doctor Bai wants.

153
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,790
I won't do what Doctor Bai don't recommend.

154
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:50,300
You don't need to beat around the bush and insinuate.

155
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,710
I know what you mean.

156
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,930
This is my illness.

157
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:58,060
I make the decision for my illness.

158
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,730
This...

159
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:04,220
Young Lady, you don't know.

160
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,260
My husband can't do anything.

161
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:13,220
When it is cold, he can't even put on a sweater vest.

162
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,590
If an oil bottle topples, he won't stop it.

163
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:20,410
Ever since we retired and left the hospital,

164
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:24,610
we have not come again. Whatever I ask him,

165
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:29,160
he says I'm a doctor.

166
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,870
I can cure my illness.

167
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:37,730
Young Lady, you say,

168
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,720
if I don't do this surgery

169
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,810
and faint any day,

170
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:50,010
what should he do if I don't wake up?

171
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,810
You...

172
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:56,770
I really can't eliminate my worries about him.

173
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:04,400
If I let you do this surgery,

174
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,130
you might not get through tonight.

175
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:12,560
Have you... Have you thought of that?

176
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,440
Inauspicious mouth!

177
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,780
Have you thought it through?

178
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:23,670
How about this, Teacher Shen? I'll bring you to do a blood test first.

179
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:27,280
Quick, go. Listen to the doctor.

180
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,760
I understand my Old Lady the most.

181
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,730
She plans to convince that female doctor to give her surgery.

182
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,900
Are your children not in Shanghai?

183
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:50,910
It would be better from you and Grandma to talk to your family about this situation.

184
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,390
My son, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter are settled somewhere else.

185
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,560
I don't want to be a bother to them.

186
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,410
You is your leader here?

187
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:01,440
<i>[Tong Shan Hospital]</i>

188
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,590
Could you have them come and dissuade my stubborn old woman?

189
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:08,090
Teacher Shen, this is not something that leadership can decide.

190
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:12,430
Don't worry. We will be doubly cautious with her treatment plan.

191
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,620
Everything you have said, I understand.

192
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:19,000
But I also need to tell you, your situation right now...

193
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,580
I may not be able to withstand undergoing surgery, am I right?

194
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:29,030
I have been dealing with elders and operation tables for my entire life.

195
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:31,430
I have seen it all.

196
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,660
What is the study of medicine

197
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:37,110
if not doing one all can possibly do and the intervention of fate.

198
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:41,110
So, you still want to do surgery.

199
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:47,110
We met during our second year at work.

200
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:51,730
After getting married, over sixty years have passed.

201
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,830
When we were young

202
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:57,160
I passed him the scalpel. I passed him the hemostatic forceps.

203
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,710
Now that we are old, I pass him tableware and socks.

204
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,110
From the outside, it looks like he has a backbone.

205
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,230
But in reality

206
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:12,820
he will find me no matter what. He can't live without me.

207
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:21,070
-I understand.
-The person who gets to decide is me.

208
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:24,750
I will be ninety years old soon, there's nothing for me to be afraid of.

209
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,020
I don't want to

210
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,510
lay in bed, living day by day just counting the days.

211
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,960
I want to live for several more years healthily.

212
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,110
I want to take care of my husband for several more years.

213
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:40,950
No to mention, I want to go out myself

214
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,800
go to the park.

215
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:47,540
Grandma, you really love Grandpa.

216
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:52,270
What about love, I'm too embarrassed to talk about that.

217
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,310
About Grandpa over there.

218
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,690
Don't worry. I will tell him later.

219
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:00,920
He is a doctor. He understands respecting the patient's wishes.

220
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,270
Okay.

221
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:06,190
Then later I will organize your transfer to the EICU.

222
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,890
<i>[Shen Wei X]</i>
<i>[Male]</i>

223
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:14,470
Several days ago, the patient started having mild low back pain and abdominal pain.

224
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,590
He thought is was chronic lumbar vertebra

225
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:20,420
and only used pain medication. He never had any other symptoms.

226
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:25,040
Looking at the CT scan, he has pancreatic swelling and exudate.

227
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,550
The lab reports are back.

228
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:31,130
White blood cells, amylase, and lipase are all running high.

229
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:35,130
Then we are right. It is acute pancreatitis.

230
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:38,180
It seems like it really is. Do you want to confirm with Doctor Xiao?

231
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,490
What do we need to confirm? I am going to find Teacher Shen.

232
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:43,080
-They need to transfer him to EICU.
-I know.

233
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,050
How is Mr. Shen?

234
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:57,010
The patient suddenly suffered a cerebral hernia, he is at the operation room.

235
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:11,790
Teacher Shen? What happened with Grandma? How did she suddenly have a cerebral hernia?

236
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:15,780
It might be because she hit her head when she was dizzy.

237
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:19,290
At the time she didn't have any problems so I ignored it.

238
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,780
I didn't think...

239
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:25,230
Don't worry, Grandma won't have any problems.

240
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,010
You don't need to comfort me. Her situation is clear to me.

241
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,370
She is so old.

242
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,760
The hope I have that she will wake up is very small.

243
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:46,060
Teacher Shen, your situation right now is also very dangerous.

244
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:50,830
You need to return to the EICU with me immediately. Acute pancreatitis.

245
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:07,500
Mr. Shen, how are you feeling? Has your pain settled down?

246
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,130
I am great.

247
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:12,100
Thankfully you listened to Grandma and discovered it early.

248
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,740
But you are also old, and have multiple symptoms simultaneously.

249
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,560
You also need to be under surveillance for a short time.

250
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,820
Acute pancreatitis.

251
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:25,000
The disease is very dangerous. The death rate is is more that 60%.

252
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,990
I know

253
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:30,190
it was you who saved me, Young One.

254
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,650
You definitely gave me a difficult problem to solve.

255
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:36,560
Because the CT scan was relatively unclear, I had to research again.

256
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,980
The reason you developed back pain

257
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,140
was because of the pancreatitis exudation.

258
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,850
This exudate stimulated the retroperitoneum.

259
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,960
I also remembered this clinical characterization.

260
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:52,150
You are a good doctor.

261
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:56,270
-Bai Shu. I also remember you.
-Right.

262
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,840
I heard a nurse say

263
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,260
Pure blood oxygen saturation

264
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:08,460
have been very stable these last few days.

265
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:12,630
This stubborn Old Woman told her "right".

266
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,660
Grandpa says Grandma is stubborn.

267
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:19,060
Grandma says Grandpa doesn't listen. In reality you both love and care about each other.

268
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,770
I will continue to monitor

269
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:24,330
to prevent increased intracranial pressure.

270
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:26,820
She should be able to make it through the most dangerous period.

271
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,830
We cured and saved patients for our entire lives.

272
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,970
We relied on science. We relied on medicine.

273
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,120
But when people

274
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,210
face the separation of death

275
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:45,120
they inevitably expect a miracle.

276
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,120
Right.

277
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,860
She woke up.

Is there a place nearby called Smoke Alley?

Smoke Alley?

314
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,660
I don't know.

315
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:25,890
Then is there anywhere in the area that used to be called Smoke Alley?

316
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:28,120
I've lived here for nearly 60 years,

Maybe you should go ask around.

00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,960
- Thank you.

and she was always the one to take care of these things.

I'm not sure where she put it.

I don't want a dress.

Doctor.

Who let you feed her tangerines?

353
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,590
Don't you know that you can't eat tangerines if your potassium levels are high?

354
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,530
Our last doctor said that

00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:22,950
eating a little bit is okay.

356
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:26,020
Then you should take her to that doctor.

357
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:30,110
Miss Doctor, what's the matter?

358
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:36,930
Don't worry, Ming Ming. I just can't hold my temper when I run into bad people.

359
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:39,410
Miss Doctor, don't get angry.

360
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:43,660
My dad isn't a bad person. I won't eat tangerines anymore.

361
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:47,060
Okay. I'll buy other fruit for you to eat.

362
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:50,290
That's okay, Miss Doctor.

363
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:52,930
My dad said we shouldn't trouble others.

364
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,190
Why did you act like that to Ming Ming's dad?

365
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:05,380
He's selfish and cold-hearted. I treated him well enough.

366
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,860
Daddy,

367
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:14,820
why did the doctor say you're a bad person?

368
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:21,360
Because I am a bad person.

369
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:24,860
I'm unable to save you, Ming Ming.

Daddy, you're not a bad person.

You're the best dad in the world.

Doctor, I'm fine, right?

373
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,400
It's bronchitis. I wrote you a prescription.

374
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,420
Don't eat anything spicy and drink water. The prescription is for three days.

00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:58,380
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Go get your medicine.

Dr. Xiao, something's wrong with Ming Ming. Hurry over.

377
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:24,350
Sweetie, don't try to hold it in. Yell if it hurts.

378
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,530
The doctor will be here soon.

379
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:28,390
- What's wrong?
- Doctor, take a look.

380
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:31,050
She was fine a moment ago, but then her whole body started hurting.

381
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:33,320
I don't even know what's hurting.

382
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,460
Does this hurt?

383
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,100
Looks like it was triggered by an imbalance in calcium and phosphate levels.

384
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,810
Doctor, can you give her a pain reliever?

385
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:09,220
Sweetie, does it still hurt?

386
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,030
She's stable for now.

387
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,020
Do you mind stepping out? I'd like to speak with you privately.

388
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:28,360
Let's just talk here. I don't want to leave Ming Ming.

389
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,280
I think it's better if we step out.

390
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,370
Lin Zhi, stay to observe her. Call me if anything happens.

391
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:35,160
Okay.

392
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,550
Thank you.

393
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:39,320
Ming Ming, I'll be right back.

394
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:45,000
Dr. Xiao, tell me what's wrong.

395
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:49,260
Currently, Ming Ming's bones hurt because of a calcium and phosphate metabolism disorder.

396
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,660
The pain reliever only works temporarily.

397
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:55,790
In the future, we'll have to treat her for osteoporosis.

398
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,480
It may be...

399
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,890
Don't hesitate. If there's medicine, treat her.

400
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:04,330
With Ming Ming's condition, she'll need to come in for regular treatment.

401
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:07,830
Each session will cost about 5,000 to 6,000 dollars.

402
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,960
I want to hear your opinion.

403
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,630
I'll do it, no matter how much it costs.

404
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:14,660
You want to spend money now,

405
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:17,870
so why didn't you test for organ compatibility before?

406
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:21,320
Compatibility between immediate family is the highest.

407
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:26,390
You didn't even test for compatibility as her father. Do you deserve to be a father?

408
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:27,700
That's enough.

409
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,600
How dare you talk about my brother like that?

410
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,860
Do you know how much he suffered and sacrificed for Ming Ming over the years?

411
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:36,430
It's true that I don't know how much he suffered or sacrificed.

412
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,590
But right now, we're trying to save a person's life.

413
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:41,590
As her father, you won't even take a compatibility test.

414
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:44,160
Do you think he doesn't want to? He...

415
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,070
That's enough, Lan Lan.

416
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,320
I can't stand listening to them talk about you like that.

417
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,100
- This doesn't concern you. Go in.
- I won't.

418
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,290
I have to clarify everything right now.

419
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:58,230
They're treating you unfairly. I can't bear it.

420
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:01,340
Let me tell you. It's not that my brother won't do the compatibility test.

421
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:04,300
It's that he doesn't dare do it, because...

422
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:07,950
Because Ming Ming isn't his biological daughter. She's adopted.

423
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:11,110
- Lan Lan!
- Brother.

424
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:14,570
You've done so much for Ming Ming, but listen to what they're saying about you.

425
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:17,590
They're saying you don't deserve to be a father.

426
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:24,910
Several years ago, on New Year's Eve, my brother and his wife were returning home.

427
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:27,630
They found Ming Ming on the side of the road.

428
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:32,700
She was so cold that her body was blue.

429
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:37,250
She couldn't even cry. My brother and his wife took pity on her.

430
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:41,070
They brought her home to raise her.

431
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:45,220
They've always treated Ming Ming like their biological daughter.

432
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:48,670
They didn't plan on telling her the truth.

433
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:55,900
- That's enough. Stop.
- Brother, don't make me hold it in.

434
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:04,040
A few years ago, my sister-in-law passed away.

435
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,520
Ming Ming was only 5 years old then.

436
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:11,470
The other children told her that

437
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:15,670
her dad was going to remarry and then abandon her.

438
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:21,200
Ming Ming was so young and didn't understand. She got scared when she heard she was going to become an orphan.

439
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,590
She cried for days,

440
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:28,060
and then she got really sick.

441
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:33,730
Ever since, my brother decided to never tell Ming Ming about her past.

442
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:36,330
And he never remarried.

443
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:41,400
He didn't want to take the compatibility test because he was scared she would find out the truth.

444
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,740
Ming Ming's father, I've misunderstood you. I'm sorry.

445
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:51,030
No, no. I know that you're all looking out for my daughter.

446
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,640
Thank you.

447
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,700
The compatibility test doesn't test for parent-child relationships.

448
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:01,140
Even biological parents might not end up a match.

449
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,510
Then I'll take the test right now.

450
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,110
Don't.

451
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,540
It's too late.

452
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:36,100
Miss Doctor, where's my dad?

453
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,290
Mingming, you're awake?

454
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:43,850
Your dad and aunt had to go out today.

455
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,330
I'll keep you company.

456
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:48,770
Miss Doctor, you're so pretty.

457
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:53,280
Our Mingming is pretty too, you're going to be beautiful when you grow up.

458
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,770
I know I can't grow up.

459
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:00,550
Mingming, you can't give up hope.

460
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:03,970
Remember to tell someone if you're in pain.

461
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:06,390
That way your doctor can find out what's wrong and treat it.

462
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:09,500
Miss Doctor, I'm not in pain.

463
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,570
If I'm not uncomfortable, then I don't need to do dialysis.

464
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:18,140
If I don't do dialysis, then I can save Dad some money.

465
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,340
I don't want to burden Dad.

466
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,580
Mingming, don't think of it that way.

467
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:26,430
Your dad has said it before too. He can't leave you.

468
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:28,350
Miss Doctor.

469
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:31,390
Let me tell you a secret.

470
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,830
Okay.

471
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:37,530
But you have to promise me you won't tell anyone. Don't tell my dad.

472
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:38,850
Okay.

473
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:40,600
Pinky promise.

474
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:48,570
Miss Doctor, I've actually known for a long time now.

475
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:51,110
I was adopted by my dad.

476
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:04,000
When did you find out?

477
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,400
I found out a long time ago.

478
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,030
I heard my parents talking about it once.

479
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:14,320
But I've never told them.

480
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:19,200
Silly child. Why didn't you tell your dad?

481
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,430
Dad cares about me. I care about him too.

482
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,650
I didn't want to make him worry.

483
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:28,950
So I've always pretended I didn't know.

484
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:31,220
Dad has too much to handle.

485
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,830
I can't cause him any more stress.

486
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:40,200
Mingming, you're such a good child.

487
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:46,960
Miss Doctor, I know I'm different from other children.

488
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:52,660
Other children have a mom and a dad.

489
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:55,320
My family is just me and my dad.

490
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,640
So I need to be a really good kid.

491
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,660
I can't let my dad worry or get mad, even just a little bit.

492
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:07,790
But I wasn't able to do that.

493
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:10,020
No, no.

494
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:13,790
You did. And you did it so well.

495
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:15,740
Your dad is very proud of you.

496
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,610
Really?

497
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:37,260
Doctor Xiao, the results came back for the compatibility test on Mingming's father and aunt.

498
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,830
They aren't matches.

499
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,620
It was unlikely they would match in the first place.

500
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:53,660
Can Mingming hold out for the right donor?

501
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,940
Let's think of other ideas.

502
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:02,480
Sometimes I really don't want to be a doctor.

503
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,500
I can understand that.

504
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:08,450
It's hard to feel this helpless.

505
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:11,500
But our patients need us

506
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,740
so we need to be strong.

507
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,230
Let's go. Let's speak to Director Lu.

508
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,750
She really cares about Mingming.

509
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:25,100
Today a team of experts came in to look at Mingming,

510
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,730
I'm sure you are all familiar with the results.

511
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:30,770
She has almost lost all liver function.

512
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:33,360
The dialysis is keeping her alive.

513
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,050
But this isn't a viable long-term solution.

514
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:38,200
The situation will only get worse.

515
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,080
Doctor Xiao suggested an idea to me.

516
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,630
She wants me to approve it.

517
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:46,260
I decided to bring you all together

518
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:50,910
so that we can discuss about it. After all, this is a very typical case

519
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:56,010
as well as one that is difficult to solve.

520
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:58,410
I would like to hear everyone's opinions, alright?

521
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,580
Doctor Xiao, could you explain the situation?

522
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,130
I want to tell Mingming

523
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:09,260
what is happening to her.

524
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:14,550
I want to tell her that we can't do anything else for her.

525
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:19,500
Even though she is only eight years old, she has a right to know what is happening to her.

526
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,350
Death is the most important part of life,

527
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:24,600
and after spending some time with her

528
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,520
I've found her to be an extremely intelligent child.

529
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,290
- I know she will take it well.
- I disagree.

530
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:34,850
- What do you mean?
- No matter how smart she is, she is still just eight years old.

531
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:49,480
Even adults are scared of death.

532
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,540
How could a child deal with this news?

533
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:54,540
Doctor Xiao, I don't know if you have considered

534
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:57,380
whether the pressure of knowing she is about to die

535
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,400
will actually make her symptoms worse.

536
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,100
It will hasten her death.

537
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:06,200
I've considered that possibility.

538
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,080
But I am sure she can face death with courage.

539
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:12,030
Being honest with her is a form of respecting her,

540
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:14,130
respecting the person, respecting their life.

541
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:15,800
Life? Respect?

542
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,080
It all sounds very high and mighty, but are you actually thinking of her?

543
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:22,660
Will this help her condition?

544
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:26,260
If you ask me, you are just trying to prove how different you are to everyone else.

545
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:29,750
You'd even sacrifice this child's life for your own selfish gain.

546
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:32,690
Bai Zhu, you've gone too far.

547
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:35,720
This is a discussion, not a time for personal attacks.

548
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:39,080
I wasn't attacking her. I was just telling the truth.

549
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,930
No matter what, I oppose this.

550
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:43,150
A child shouldn't be expected to shoulder such a burden.

551
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:46,240
Doctor Bai, you should try trusting other people.

552
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,850
- Even if she is only eight years old...
- I only trust myself!

553
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:52,790
I am a doctor, I have the expertise.

554
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,730
Mingming's father...

555
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:05,360
Director, can I say something?

556
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,160
Come in, come in.

557
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,230
Say what you have to say

558
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:16,750
I heard what everyone was saying just now

559
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:21,350
It all makes sense. I know it's what's best for the child

560
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:27,360
Doctor Xiao, I want to thank you

561
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:31,130
Thank you for taking care of my child

562
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:34,160
What you said is right

563
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,950
Mingming is a strong and brave girl

564
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:39,730
The dialysis treatment is so painful

565
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:42,220
Yet, she was never scared

566
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:51,180
All these years, we've been running in and out of the hospital

567
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:54,750
To cure my child's illness

568
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:58,820
I've basically spent all of my life savings

569
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:05,050
But, only now have I realized

570
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:10,000
To help me save money

571
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,610
She wouldn't even tell me

572
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:17,050
when she was in pain

573
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:19,430
She'd just smile and comfort me

574
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:27,540
Just so we could save some money from doing less treatments

575
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,410
In the end...

576
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,620
This is on me

577
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:38,950
It's all my fault

578
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:46,130
Doctor Xiao, if dialysis was done earlier

579
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:49,740
Can we save my daughter?

580
