00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,239
(Thank You, Doctor)

(Adapted from Sheng Li's novel "ICU 48 Hours")

3
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,079
(Episode 35)

4
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:35,239
Dr. Xiao.

5
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,359
Dr. Xiao.

6
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,079
Come and have a seat.

7
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,480
Dr. Xiao.

8
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:55,280
When you were young, you really had a lot of pimples.

9
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:57,959
How did it get better after that? That's amazing.

10
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,840
Why did you kick me?

11
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,560
No. Who kicked you?

12
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:13,919
I'm done eating. You guys go ahead.

13
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:18,280
Ignore him. He's always like that.

14
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:20,810
Dr. Xiao.

15
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,400
You haven't answered my question.

16
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:37,879
- Excuse me. - Excuse me.

17
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:38,919
Make way.

18
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,120
- Doctor. - Excuse me.

19
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:41,199
- Doctor. - What's going on?

20
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,759
The patient is 33 years old. Temperature, 39 degrees Celsius.

21
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:43,759
She's having difficulty in breathing.

22
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,120
Doctor. Please save my wife.

23
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,800
- Don't move. - I won't...

24
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,680
I won't do it.

25
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,879
How can you not do it?

26
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,439
I don't want you to die.

27
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,719
You don't understand.

28
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,120
According to the judgment...

29
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,080
of an international authoritative organization,

30
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:58,840
30 percent of the world...

31
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,439
Just rest yourself.

32
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,560
Let me tell you again.

33
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:04,199
There's no basis for the data you're talking about.

34
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,719
You again?

35
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,039
Dr. Bai saved you.

36
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,759
I don't need it.

37
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,919
Huang Li Li.

38
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,159
Listen.

39
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,960
If you dare to pull the needle out, I'll divorce you.

40
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:24,039
According to the test results,

41
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,960
the patient has an infection in her lungs.

42
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,479
The infection index is very high...

43
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:28,960
and the shaded area of the spots...

44
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,960
on the two lungs is relatively large.

45
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,199
She's so sick.

46
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,520
Why didn't she come sooner?

47
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,159
If it weren't for her being too sick to move now,

48
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:35,599
I can't take her here at all.

49
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:36,960
Is it because of the juice?

50
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,000
Exactly.

51
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,080
She's obsessed with it.

52
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,120
What kind of juice is that?

53
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,360
It's all-natural juice.

54
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,599
It's said to be effective in detoxifying.

55
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,639
It can cure anything.

56
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:44,639
This year,

57
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,120
whenever she catches a cold or fever,

58
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:48,199
she refuses to take medicine or go to the hospital.

59
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:50,199
This time, she's so sick.

60
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,840
She still believes her lousy juice can detoxify...

61
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,080
and she'll get better on her own.

62
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,759
She has been sick for a few days.

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,120
She doesn't even eat.

64
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,319
She only drinks juice.

65
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,240
I guess she's brainwashed by the health supplement seller.

66
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,319
She didn't just drink it herself.

67
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,520
She also sells it to others.

68
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,639
Our house is going to become her storage room.

69
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,479
Those boxes are full of juice.

70
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,240
She even told people that this juice can do everything.

71
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,840
"Drink this all-natural juice when you have a cold."

72
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,639
"When you have a fever, drink this all-natural juice."

73
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:16,879
"If you have any health problems,"

74
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,680
"this all-natural juice will do the trick."

75
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,560
Tell me. Isn't this harming others?

76
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,680
How about this?

77
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,759
From now on,

78
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:26,610
don't let her drink the all-natural juice again.

79
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,730
She must be treated with medicine.

80
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,319
All right, I'll keep an eye on her.

81
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,000
You shouldn't have brought me to the hospital.

82
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,360
You have a high fever.

83
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,959
If you don't come to the hospital, you'll die at home.

84
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,519
Fever is a good thing.

85
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,519
Fever is a signal...

86
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,800
sent by the body's immune system...

87
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,759
to remove harmful substances from the body.

88
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:49,199
Stop talking.

89
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:50,879
When this high temperature...

90
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,680
makes it impossible for bacteria to replicate...

91
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,360
and stop multiplying,

92
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,000
That's the perfect time...

93
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:00,240
for the human body to eliminate the virus.

94
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:01,879
This fever...

95
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,439
can also remove toxins from the body,

96
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,680
increase metabolism,

97
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:08,439
and turn toxins into energy.

98
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:11,000
What kind of ridiculous logic is that?

99
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,120
It's scientifically proven.

100
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,199
If humans use antibiotics for a long time,

101
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,240
there will be a lot of side effects.

102
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:22,279
The human body's immune system will be weak...

103
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,050
and it will lose its ability to resist.

104
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,399
So what's the most important thing for a fever?

105
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,199
If you have a fever,

106
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,560
you must drink a lot of water...

107
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:33,680
and take a lot of vitamins and micronutrients.

108
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:37,680
This happens to be completely satisfied by my juice.

109
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,519
All right.

110
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:41,600
Stop it.

111
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,000
Do you mean if you get sick...

112
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,360
and come to the hospital for treatment...

113
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,879
will cause more serious consequences?

114
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,000
So the right way to do it is to drink your juice?

115
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,319
The sicker you are, the more you drink, right?

116
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,000
Yes.

117
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,959
Medical development nowadays...

118
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,120
is completely contrary to treating diseases...

119
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:59,720
and saving lives.

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,720
If that's the case,

121
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,600
since you drink this juice every day,

122
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,519
shouldn't you be healthy and totally fine?

123
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,439
How did you get pneumonia?

124
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:09,439
Why did you come to the hospital?

125
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,480
Don't you know?

126
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,319
I'm detoxifying.

127
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,240
Let me tell you.

128
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,480
When it comes to a product,

129
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:17,560
it can fool a person easily.

130
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,600
Do you think it can fool a group of people?

131
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,720
Many people around me drank it.

132
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,240
I drank it too.

133
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:26,399
That's because it's effective.

134
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:28,879
All right.

135
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,839
Try it when you get a chance.

136
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,720
Okay. You should get some rest.

137
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,720
Stop talking.

138
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,480
Let them try it.

139
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,519
Okay.

140
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,240
Dr. Xu.

141
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,759
This is the medication record for Bed Number 3.

142
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,839
Okay, thank you.

143
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,120
Take a guess.

144
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:57,000
How much does a bottle of this all-natural juice cost?

145
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,199
How much?

146
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,839
It's 388 yuan.

147
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,279
It's so expensive.

148
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,639
This is insane.

149
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:04,839
Who would drink this juice?

150
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,160
Look at the recipe.

151
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:09,920
Baby jackfruit, chestnut rose,

152
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,680
sea-buckthorn, and goji berries.

153
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:15,000
These fruits are higher in vitamin C and carotene.

154
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,319
But why is the juice so expensive?

155
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,759
Isn't it good to eat a few more carrots?

156
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:19,759
It only costs two yuan each.

157
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,879
Why are they drinking this?

158
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,240
Look at what's written on it.

159
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:26,439
"This juice is good for sore throat,"

160
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,160
"eczema, and chronic gastritis."

161
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,439
"It'll also make your eyes better."

162
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:35,079
Anyway, it's a cure-all.

163
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,279
It'll also detoxify you.

164
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,800
I think it's a toxin.

165
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,959
Social media nowadays...

166
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:44,519
is full of various articles on detoxification and health care.

167
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,399
Especially at my mom's age.

168
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,519
These two are the only things concerning her.

169
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:50,040
In fact, there are really a lot of people...

170
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,199
who are obsessed with detoxification in China.

171
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:55,079
They all talk about detoxification for beauty,

172
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:57,319
detoxification for weight loss, and detoxification for anti-cancer.

173
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:00,000
Each has its own method and product,

174
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,199
but none of them are scientific.

175
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,680
Let alone those gullible old people,

176
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,519
many high-quality young people in China...

177
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,839
are also obsessed with detoxification.

178
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,519
I just don't get it.

179
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,959
They take medicine when they are sick.

180
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,519
How is that called detoxification?

181
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,199
In fact, being able to do this...

182
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:16,079
is the one-sided exploitation of medical concepts...

183
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,079
by some bad companies...

184
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:19,839
to brainwash the people.

185
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,319
For example, fever.

186
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:24,040
In fact,

187
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,680
there is a set of relatively scientific theories in medicine.

188
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:28,800
They say that low heat below 38.5 degrees Celsius...

189
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,079
is good for triggering...

190
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,319
the body's ability to respond quickly.

191
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,720
In a short period of time,

192
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,450
it will produce a large number of immune cells in the human body.

193
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,480
So usually, for low fever below 38.5 degrees Celsius,

194
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:40,559
many doctors don't advocate antipyretic.

195
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:43,480
But this is the theory being exploited.

196
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,090
Later, some people even said that even if one has a high fever,

197
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,279
he should endure it as much as he can...

198
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:50,279
and don't give up this opportunity to increase autoimmune diseases.

199
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:53,279
At first, this statement was more popular on social media.

200
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:55,639
Later on, many parents believed it.

201
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,960
Even if their child was really sick and have a fever,

202
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,279
they didn't take them to the hospital.

203
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:00,759
This is harming people.

204
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,600
The fever doesn't go away.

205
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,720
There's a condition.

206
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:06,240
They should at least rule out other basic diseases.

207
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:07,600
Some people with low fever...

208
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:09,639
may also have other serious illnesses.

209
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,399
Fever is one of the most complex symptoms.

210
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,450
It shouldn't be categorized as a simple cold.

211
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,120
It should be up to the doctor to make a professional judgment.

212
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,840
If that's the case for low fever,

213
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,039
high fever shouldn't be regarded...

214
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,480
an opportunity to strengthen your immune system.

215
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,240
Have you noticed?

216
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,639
All these rumors have one thing in common.

217
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:28,600
That is to take advantage...

218
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,600
of the simple side of medical knowledge.

219
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,399
When it comes to the esoteric side, they won't mention it.

220
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,039
However, what they said was easy to understand.

221
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:36,159
For those articles you wrote to dispel rumors...

222
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,159
First, you need professional knowledge.

223
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,799
Second, it's not easy to explain.

224
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:42,679
Third, people don't bother to understand either.

225
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:46,279
It's easy to spread rumors,

226
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,330
but it's hard to stop rumors.

227
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,210
It's 38.7 degrees Celsius.

228
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:02,450
Your temperature is dropping.

229
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,450
Miss.

230
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:05,960
How much do you make a month?

231
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,159
Not much.

232
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,399
It's enough to support myself.

233
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:09,519
I'm content with what I have.

234
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,879
That's a good mindset.

235
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:14,090
Happiness in life...

236
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,759
is not something you can measure with money.

237
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:16,799
Right?

238
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,360
Miss.

239
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,480
Since you're younger than me, I'll call you my sister.

240
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,090
Sister.

241
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,639
What do you think is the most important thing...

242
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,330
for us as women in this life?

243
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,919
- What is it? - It's a career.

244
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,879
I have a career. Nursing is my career.

245
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,000
No.

246
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,039
Nursing is just your job.

247
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:36,279
It's not your career.

248
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,679
What is a career?

249
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,840
A career isn't how much money you make.

250
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,240
It's something that makes your life...

251
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:45,000
rich and wonderful.

252
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:49,919
Do you have your phone?

253
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:55,840
I'll add you as a friend and send you the information later.

254
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,840
All the sweat and tears I shed today...

255
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,519
will become a diamond in the rough one day.

256
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,440
Let's do this together.

257
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,639
What are you doing?

258
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:08,600
It's none of your business.

259
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,120
Don't listen to her.

260
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,919
Sister.

261
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,080
Did you see that?

262
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,759
Men are the obstacles on women's road to success.

263
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:20,919
Get some rest.

264
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,080
- I'll get going. - Read more when you have time.

265
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,159
I'll send it to you.

266
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:28,279
Jeez. It's so motivating.

267
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,480
Dr. Tang.

268
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,759
Do you have any movies...

269
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,080
that make people oppressed after watching them?

270
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,559
Recommend me one, please.

271
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:39,320
What's wrong with you?

272
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,960
I almost got all excited just now.

273
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,200
I need to watch a movie to neutralize it.

274
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,639
Are you still thinking about your wife?

275
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:57,399
Seeing her getting sicker and sicker,

276
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:58,840
I feel quite bad.

277
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,679
In the past, when she caught a cold or a fever,

278
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,559
she refused to take medicine or come to the hospital.

279
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,919
She wouldn't listen to me.

280
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,320
I thought it was the same this time.

281
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:09,639
She'll heal in a few days.

282
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,480
I really regret it now.

283
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,399
How did she know about this juice?

284
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:17,000
After she gave birth,

285
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,320
she has been taking care of the baby at home.

286
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,799
I don't know when...

287
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,240
she came into contact...

288
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,799
with this salesperson of all-natural juice.

289
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:23,960
At first,

290
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,799
she just occasionally said in front of me...

291
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,600
how good this all-natural juice was.

292
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,759
Then one day,

293
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,519
she told me...

294
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,279
that she wanted to sell this supplement.

295
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,679
She said it was her career.

296
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:36,840
I thought...

297
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,559
since it was something she liked,

298
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:39,559
so I should just let her do it.

299
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,000
Besides, it's juice.

300
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,279
It's a good thing.

301
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,639
That's true.

302
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,080
Who would have thought that...

303
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,519
the juice could cause so much trouble?

304
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,919
Later on,

305
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,840
I noticed that she started to change.

306
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,240
Not only did she not care about our kid,

307
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,679
but she also came home late.

308
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,000
She said...

309
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,759
she had classes, training,

310
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:04,320
and meetings with clients.

311
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:06,440
Later on,

312
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:08,080
she brought juice back home.

313
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:09,799
The most outrageous thing...

314
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,799
is that she now drinks juice as a meal.

315
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,159
She drinks it three times a day.

316
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,679
As long as she's awake,

317
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,399
she'll play their training recording very loudly.

318
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:18,799
Even when I drive,

319
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:21,200
I have to listen to health-related stuff.

320
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:24,759
It's useless no matter how much we argue.

321
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,679
She won't listen to me at all.

322
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:30,039
She doesn't care about the family.

323
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:32,720
Everyday day, she goes out early in the morning...

324
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,440
and comes back late in the evening.

325
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:37,679
She starts studying as soon as she comes home.

326
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,440
It's the same on weekends.

327
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:41,279
She doesn't even care about our kid.

328
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,720
This may sound absurd.

329
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,799
Even though we're married,

330
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,679
but I can only know...

331
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,399
where she's going and what she's doing...

332
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,519
through her friends.

333
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,000
This year,

334
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,799
I prepared the New Year's Eve dinner...

335
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,080
and texted her...

336
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,600
to come home for dinner.

337
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,840
However, I only got a reply from her after a long time.

338
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,399
She went for a team-building trip with her team.

339
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,639
I was abandoned at home with my kid.

340
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:10,720
That's how I spent the New Year.

341
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,320
The more I hear it,

342
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,480
the more it sounds like she has joined a pyramid scheme.

343
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,919
It's a pyramid scheme.

344
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,879
The problem is she believes in all this nonsense.

345
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,600
Did you call the police?

346
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,679
I did.

347
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,480
The police are investigating it.

348
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,759
They're collecting evidence.

349
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,799
I really hope the police arrest them as soon as possible...

350
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,840
so that my wife can see their true colors.

351
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:32,440
From what you said,

352
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,159
were you very busy at work during the time she gave birth?

353
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,240
Yes.

354
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:40,279
She stays home and takes care of the baby.

355
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,559
I have to earn more money to support my family.

356
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,279
So according to what you said,

357
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,519
she was exposed to juice...

358
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,120
when she was a full-time housewife at home...

359
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:51,679
after giving birth.

360
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,799
Have you ever thought...

361
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,120
that it's because she's at home with the baby...

362
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,639
and she's separated from society?

363
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:59,440
And you don't pay enough attention to her.

364
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,519
That's why she found...

365
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,080
her sense of existence through juice...

366
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,799
and says it's her career.

367
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:43,879
I really don't get it.

368
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,519
What's the magic of a pyramid scheme?

369
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,200
I mean, people are obsessed.

370
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,799
Exactly.

371
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:51,720
Even our happy-go-lucky Zhi Zhi was brainwashed.

372
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,399
Come to think of it, they're really something.

373
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,159
Even their own employees are convinced by their own product.

374
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,360
They take advantage of people's desires to the extreme.

375
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:02,639
What desires?

376
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,919
Human desires.

377
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,360
Simply put, two things.

378
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:07,200
Survival and reproduction.

379
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,679
To survive, you need to be healthy...

380
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:11,639
and reproduction requires money.

381
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,440
That's what they use in a lot of pyramid schemes.

382
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,120
And love.

383
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,039
They are particularly good at wrapping themselves...

384
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,480
with love and charity...

385
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:20,799
so that people can't refuse them.

386
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,759
The patient's husband told me this before.

387
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,799
Her wife sold a lot of juice to his colleagues.

388
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,320
All his colleagues think...

389
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,159
that his wife is the kind of person...

390
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,200
who's particularly kind and positive.

391
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:36,960
They hope the other party can live a better life,

392
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,039
so they can't refuse her at all.

393
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,799
Yes, that's the feeling.

394
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,159
They were really excited.

395
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,399
What's more,

396
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,279
they are particularly good...

397
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,039
at turning others' doubts into motivation.

398
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,480
The more people doubt them, the more confident they are.

399
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:53,320
In short,

400
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,200
once you're in the pyramid scheme pit,

401
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,840
it's hard to get out.

402
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,240
If there's nothing wrong,

403
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,279
you'll be discharged tomorrow.

404
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,599
You've missed a few days of homework.

405
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:13,839
You need to make up for it.

406
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:16,799
I'll ask Wang Chen to bring your homework and notes over.

407
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,240
I don't want to go to school.

408
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,559
What did you say?

409
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,000
I don't want to go to school.

410
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:23,920
What are you talking about?

411
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:25,559
How old are you?

412
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:26,759
How can you not go to school?

413
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,359
I don't want to go to school.

414
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:29,839
I don't want to go to school.

415
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:32,519
Qian Qian. Why are you throwing a tantrum?

416
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:35,559
I'm not throwing a tantrum.

417
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,170
I just don't want to go to school.

418
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,890
What do you want to do if you don't go to school?

419
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:41,200
What can you do if you don't go to school?

420
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,890
Be a parasite at home?

421
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:44,480
We've raised you for over 10 years.

422
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,279
Do you think we can support you for the rest of your life?

423
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:47,799
This child.

424
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:51,279
But they pretended to call me a beauty...

425
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:53,359
and said I was the campus belle of a century.

426
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,680
Wang Chen even set up a WeChat group secretly...

427
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,839
to discuss why I'm so ugly.

428
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,480
During the PE exam, I was in the last place.

429
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:03,119
I fell on my head,

430
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:04,890
but no one helped me.

431
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,920
Why didn't you tell us?

432
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:10,000
We don't know anything.

433
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,650
There's no point in telling you.

434
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,359
I'd only make you worry.

435
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:16,890
Good girl.

436
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,319
I didn't know you've suffered so much.

437
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:21,920
I'm sorry.

438
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,240
Don't cry anymore.

439
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,920
If you don't want to go to school,

440
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,200
we can go later.

441
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:27,359
Okay?

442
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:29,920
The test results are out.

443
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,319
Is there a problem?

444
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,599
The adrenal CT shows...

445
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:36,119
that there's a small adenoma in the left adrenal gland.

446
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:38,410
The X-ray shows a fractured tibia.

447
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,920
I think it's osteoporosis.

448
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,960
Adenoma?

449
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,039
Don't worry.

450
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,480
Adenoma is a common benign tumor.

451
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,240
However, it caused Qian Qian to have...

452
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,410
ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome.

453
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:51,559
It disrupts the hormonal secretion and causes the current symptoms.

454
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,720
Dr. Xiao.

455
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,839
Is this curable?

456
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:55,519
We'll schedule surgery as soon as possible...

457
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,839
to remove the tumor.

458
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:58,920
What about after the surgery?

459
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:01,039
Will I still be the same?

460
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:02,839
Don't worry.

461
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,240
Your condition will definitely improve.

462
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:08,650
What you need to do now is to rest well.

463
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:10,200
Don't think too much.

464
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,319
All right?

465
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:13,650
Listen to the doctor.

466
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:14,759
Good girl.

467
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:19,920
This is the brand.

468
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,920
I think it's really good.

469
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,359
It's 70 percent off now.

470
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:25,200
Hurry up and buy it. One for you and one for me.

471
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:26,759
You bought so many clothes. Can you wear them all?

472
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,599
Women don't complain about having too many clothes.

473
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,559
What's more, I worked so hard to lose weight.

474
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,890
Of course I have to buy more.

475
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:32,890
Is that so?

476
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:34,839
Right.

477
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,759
The patient with Cushing's syndrome...

478
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,410
will also lose weight after surgery.

479
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,480
Cushing's syndrome?

480
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:41,240
Then there's hope for her to get out of this nightmare.

481
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,680
People these days will do anything to lose weight and become pretty.

482
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,720
In the end,

483
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:46,839
beauty is a kind of wealth,

484
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:47,890
a kind of resource,

485
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,240
a kind of right, and a kind of dignity.

486
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:50,680
In addition to what God gave us,

487
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:52,890
it can now be obtained through surgery.

488
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:54,559
What a freak.

489
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:56,079
Don't you think so?

490
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,839
More and more people get plastic surgery.

491
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:00,170
Don't tell me...

492
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:01,359
they can change their lives...

493
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:02,680
with a fake face.

494
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:05,170
Surgical risks, maintenance costs,

495
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:07,440
and irresistible aging in a decade later.

496
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,839
You lose more than you gain. How foolish.

497
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:13,440
Eat up.

498
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:15,759
Do you have to do this?

499
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,440
You worked so hard just to sell facial masks.

500
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,519
Now you've hurt yourself.

501
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:19,599
If I don't work hard,

502
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:21,170
I won't be able to pay my plastic surgery loan.

503
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,039
You'll have to spend money to fix it if you ruin your face.

504
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,799
How many facial masks should I sell?

505
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,650
Why don't you work for me?

506
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:31,410
It's better than fighting alone.

507
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:32,839
Forget it.

508
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:36,359
Compared to your live streaming, selling facial masks is easier.

509
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:40,279
Do I look ugly now?

510
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,519
Very ugly.

511
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,000
Wen Jin Jin.

512
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:47,200
We're no longer friends from now on.

513
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,119
- Get Dr. Xiao to sign it. - I'm talking to you.

514
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:51,599
What are you looking at?

515
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,240
I'm really mad.

516
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:55,839
We can be friends later.

517
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,480
Miss.

518
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,000
Let me ask you something.

519
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:02,720
The handsome doctor who just passed by.

520
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,839
Which department is he in?

521
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,839
We're all from the Emergency Department.

522
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,480
The Emergency Department?

523
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:09,799
Dr. Xiao.

524
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,559
I need you to sign here.

525
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,920
The male doctor isn't the only one who's good-looking here,

526
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,720
the female doctor is also good-looking.

527
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,079
She's here to ask about Dr. Bai.

528
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,519
Dr. Bai is over there.

529
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,920
"Dr. Bai Shu."

530
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,759
Hello, I'm Wen Jin Jin.

531
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:35,799
That word is pronounced "Zhu".

532
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,240
Isn't it the same word?

533
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:45,119
All right. Pay at the counter.

534
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,960
Let's go.

535
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,359
We'll get going then.

536
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,319
See you next time, Dr. Bai.

537
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,400
Bye.

538
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:04,359
Lie down for a while.

539
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,680
Are you feeling better?

540
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:08,559
Dr. Xiao.

541
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,720
It's indeed an adenoma in the left adrenal gland.

542
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,240
The tumor has been removed.

543
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:13,640
The surgery was a success. Don't worry.

544
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,039
That's great, Dr. Xiao.

545
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,480
Thank you.

546
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,599
We did it.

547
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,319
I'll lose weight, right?

548
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,000
When your hormone levels go back to normal,

549
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,440
I'm sure you'll lose weight.

550
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:28,000
- You'll lose weight. - Mom.

551
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:30,799
I'll be able to wear those pretty dresses.

552
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:31,839
Yes.

553
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:32,880
When you get better,

554
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,599
I'll buy it all for you, okay?

555
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,279
Good girl.

556
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:39,880
Right now, I'm in Dr. Bai's office.

557
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:43,000
Look. Dr. Bai has a coffee machine.

558
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,559
That means this man loves life.

559
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:47,160
- This is... - What are you doing?

560
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:48,599
Dr. Bai.

561
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,319
Let's see the handsome Dr. Bai.

562
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:52,960
This is a doctor's office.

563
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,920
If you're not seeing a doctor, please leave.

564
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:58,920
I heard you're really good at making hand-ground coffee.

565
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,000
I want to try it.

566
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,119
Please leave.

567
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:05,039
I can see that you're very tired.

568
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:07,119
How about this? I'll make it for you.

569
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:11,160
I'm going to make coffee for Dr. Bai.

570
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:17,519
Hello, is this the Security Department?

571
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,960
This is Bai Zhu from the Emergency Department.

572
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,000
Please come here.

573
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,400
Okay.

574
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,680
Dr. Bai.

575
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:26,559
That's not necessary.

576
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,240
Well, we don't have fresh milk here.

577
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:37,359
Why don't I make...

578
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:38,799
my hand-brewed coffee for Dr. Bai...

579
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,079
another day?

580
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,240
Dr. Bai is working hard.

581
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,279
Look at him.

582
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:49,240
He's totally ignoring me,

583
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:52,400
but I think guys like him are more attractive.

584
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,000
All right.

585
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,559
Let's make coffee for Dr. Bai some other time.

586
00:23:58,119 --> 00:23:59,920
Take another look at Dr. Bai.

587
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,720
Dr. Bai. I have a case here.

588
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,039
I don't talk about work when I eat.

589
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,480
Let's not talk about work then.

590
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,279
Let's talk about this.

591
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,880
Dr. Xu, is that a new phone?

592
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,240
What's with that look?

593
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:15,640
Did you give me money to get a new phone?

594
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,119
I wonder what this woman sees in you.

595
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,319
What woman?

596
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,640
Who has a crush on Dr. Bai?

597
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,680
Who?

598
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,960
Who would be blind enough to like him?

599
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:31,519
You're biased against Dr. Bai.

600
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:33,079
Look at Dr. Zheng from the clinical laboratory.

601
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,880
She likes Dr. Bai to death.

602
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:36,640
She can't be blind, can she?

603
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,279
Her eyesight isn't that good.

604
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:42,400
As for Wen Jin Jin's live stream,

605
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,200
she calls it My Daily Life with My Prince Charming.

606
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:51,440
My friend, Ning Xiao, fell during the live broadcast,

607
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,440
so I have to take care of her.

608
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,039
I thought I was going to have a hard time.

609
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:02,720
I didn't expect to meet a handsome guy like Dr. Bai.

610
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,759
I really want to tell Ning Xiao this.

611
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,039
I've raised you all these years, but it was all for nothing.

612
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,519
Good riddance.

613
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,400
It's her.

614
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,160
- Who is it? - Dr. Bai, you're amazing.

615
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,799
- Who? - That...

616
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:19,599
She's the one who chased after Dr. Bai.

617
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,039
They are indeed a perfect match.

618
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,400
There's an old deer in my heart.

619
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,680
The moment I saw Dr. Bai,

620
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,759
it asked me if I was going to crash.

621
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:38,680
Then I'll definitely say yes.

622
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,559
I'll accept it even if I'm dead.

623
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:41,759
She's good with words.

624
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,680
Lin Zhi, look. There are over 20,000 comments.

625
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,599
That's nothing. Look what I just looked up.

626
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,880
Wen Jin Jin. She's a famous influencer.

627
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,599
She has a lot of female fans.

628
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:51,680
On Weibo,

629
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,079
they're reading the story of her courting Dr. Bai...

630
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:54,319
like a romance novel.

631
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,480
They even created a topic for her and Dr. Bai.

632
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,559
It's trending now.

633
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:58,599
Then...

634
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,640
Is Dr. Bai going to be famous?

635
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,480
Unfortunately, it's because of a plastic surgery girl.

636
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,240
What's wrong with plastic surgery?

637
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:08,119
I think Wen Jin Jin is quite interesting.

638
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:10,920
Do you want to consider her?

639
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:14,559
There are so many people who admire me.

640
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:15,839
Do I have to consider all of them?

641
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,559
I'm not trying to discourage you.

642
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,160
Don't take it so seriously.

643
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,920
She just wants something new.

644
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,680
It'll die down in a few days.

645
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,440
Dr. Xu.

646
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,079
Why do I feel like you're a little jealous?

647
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,559
You're such a womanizer.

648
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,400
You look down on others to elevate yourself.

649
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,880
How pathetic.

650
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:38,440
How pathetic.

651
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,759
Indeed, how...

652
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,920
The girl who likes Dr. Bai is quite pretty.

653
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:00,400
Really?

654
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,440
I think she's so-so.

655
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:04,599
She's a broadcasting major. She can't be that ugly.

656
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,279
I don't know about that.

657
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:08,160
Anyway, I don't dare to compliment her for what she did.

658
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,480
And that Bai Zhu.

659
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,880
Instead of treating patients, he's always flirting with girls.

660
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,799
- I can't stand it. - Dr. Bai isn't like that.

661
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:16,599
You've been brainwashed by him.

662
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:17,680
No.

663
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,759
I was tempted by Dr. Bai's beauty,

664
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,319
yet I was willing to be tempted by him.

665
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,279
What a fangirl.

666
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,079
Dr. Xiao. Talk some sense into her.

667
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,720
She's biased against Dr. Bai.

668
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:31,160
How dare you ask Dr. Xiao.

669
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,599
Maybe Dr. Xiao hates Bai Zhu even more than I do.

670
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:34,599
Right, Dr. Xiao?

671
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,920
Dr. Bai and I are just colleagues.

672
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,960
I don't hate him.

673
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,039
Did you hear that?

674
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:41,039
Dr. Xiao doesn't hate Dr. Bai at all.

675
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,400
You're lying.

676
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,079
Even if Dr. Xiao hates him,

677
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,160
she may think it's impolite to say it.

678
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,240
All right, let's go.

679
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:49,039
Dr. Bai.

680
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:51,119
The patient in Bed Number 2 is a little irritable.

681
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:52,880
Give her some Valium.

682
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:54,440
Dr. Bai.

683
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,640
Do you have a girlfriend?

684
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,319
Does it have anything to do with you?

685
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,920
Why are you so bad at chatting?

686
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,200
If you say you don't,

687
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,680
I'll ask "Would you mind having one?"

688
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:07,240
If you say you do,

689
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,079
I'll ask "Would you mind having another?"

690
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,000
It's okay.

691
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,079
It's fine if you don't want to answer...

692
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:14,480
because I asked before and you don't have a girlfriend.

693
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,440
So would you mind having one?

694
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,559
Give me the medical records of Bed Number 3.

695
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,759
Look at me.

696
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,960
I'm a pretty girl, aren't I?

697
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,880
I have a house and a car.

698
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,000
Although I'm not a good person,

699
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,759
I don't have any improper relationships before.

700
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,079
Usually, I gain some popularity on the Internet...

701
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,559
to do live streaming and sell things.

702
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:36,799
I earn enough every month.

703
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:39,599
A girl like me is pursuing you.

704
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,720
What's your problem?

705
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,200
Ms. Wen.

706
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,319
Is it fun to live stream the story of you pursuing me...

707
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,559
on the Internet?

708
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,559
You saw it?

709
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,759
This is going to be awkward.

710
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,799
I'll remind you one last time.

711
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,200
This is a hospital.

712
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:01,799
We treat illnesses and save people.

713
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:04,240
If you're not sick, then don't disturb our work.

714
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,880
Don't worry.

715
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,359
I promise I won't disturb you.

716
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:19,400
Ms. Wen.

717
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:21,200
I know why you're doing this.

718
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:23,680
It's your way of living. I respect that.

719
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:25,839
But I'm a doctor.

720
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,880
My profession is not only...

721
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,880
related to my personal work and life,

722
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,559
but it also concerns many people.

723
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,279
Please respect me too.

724
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:39,920
All right then.

725
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,039
Although it's a pity,

726
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:43,960
I respect your decision.

727
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,039
However, you're wrong about one thing.

728
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:53,880
I'm not being unreasonable.

729
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:56,160
I really admire you.

730
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,440
Goodbye, Dr. Bai.

731
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:07,359
Do you enjoy the show?

732
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,799
Dr. Bai is working hard.

733
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:11,799
Look at him.

734
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,480
He's totally ignoring me,

735
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,720
but I think guys like him are more attractive.

736
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:18,400
All right.

737
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,920
Let's make coffee for Dr. Bai some other time.

738
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:22,920
You're slacking off at work.

739
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,039
I'll report you.

740
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,119
I care about you, yet you want to report me.

741
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:29,480
Don't you have anything better to do?

742
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,039
Wen Jin Jin is really strange.

743
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,920
I thought she just wanted something new...

744
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,119
and she'd stop after two days.

745
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:38,039
I didn't expect her to be so enthusiastic.

746
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:39,440
What are you going to do?

747
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:40,559
I've settled it.

748
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:44,720
Let me tell you. Don't take it lightly.

749
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:47,559
If this goes on,

750
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,880
you're not the only one in trouble.

751
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:51,119
Our department's work will be affected too.

752
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,119
I have to think of a way.

753
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,680
Think carefully.

754
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:04,079
Use heparin in the early stage of anticoagulant treatment...

755
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:06,000
and use warfarin to maintain in the later stage.

756
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,079
Xiao Yan.

757
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:09,039
I have something to discuss with you.

758
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,640
Tang Hua.

759
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,119
I need to discuss something with Xiao Yan.

760
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:18,519
Let's talk in private.

761
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:20,119
What is it?

762
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:23,319
Perhaps you've heard about it.

763
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,079
It's a friend of the patient.

764
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,960
She's quite good-looking.

765
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,039
She fell in love with Bai Zhu at first sight.

766
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,240
She keeps pursuing and pestering him.

767
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:35,079
So?

768
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:40,119
This behavior of hers has troubled Bai Zhu greatly.

769
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,559
It also greatly affected the work of our department.

770
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,039
I want this person to know when to quit.

771
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,680
That's why I hope...

772
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,440
I hope you can pretend...

773
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,640
I mean pretend.

774
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:53,400
I hope you can pretend to be Bai Zhu's girlfriend.

775
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,079
Dr. Xu.

776
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:57,319
Dr. Bai and I are colleagues.

777
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:01,200
Also, I don't want to cause unnecessary misunderstandings.

778
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,880
Please tell him...

779
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,279
that he should solve his own affairs by himself.

780
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:05,400
I can't help him with that.

781
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,400
No, Xiao Yan.

782
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,759
Let me finish. This is my...

783
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,640
What did you say to her?

784
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,039
I think I made things worse.

785
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,720
What do you mean?

786
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:31,920
I told her to pretend to be your girlfriend.

787
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,839
Are you out of your mind?

788
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,079
Calm down.

789
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:36,119
You haven't made any progress.

790
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:37,200
I'm worried about you.

791
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,920
What did she say?

792
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:43,599
She...

793
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,640
I don't think she agreed.

794
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,200
You can't do anything right.

795
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:11,920
What Xu Yi Ran said to you...

796
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,200
is not what I meant.

797
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,200
I know.

798
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:47,160
Dad.

799
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,279
You've been rejected once...

800
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:50,720
and now, you're drowning your sorrows...

801
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:51,880
and being so dramatic.

802
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:54,680
Are you still the arrogant dad I used to have in my heart?

803
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,359
What you're doing right now is a disgrace to the Bai family.

804
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,160
For having you as my dad, I feel embarrassed and ashamed.

805
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,240
How dare you.

806
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:08,079
Dad. A man should be strong.

807
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,480
Dad, what are you doing?

808
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:27,679
I'm going to take a cold shower.

809
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,000
I need to clear my head.

810
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,199
Dad.

811
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:37,809
Face the waves arrogantly

812
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:41,400
Passionate...

813
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,079
Don't blame me if you catch a cold.

814
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,519
You didn't listen to your child and you're at a disadvantage now.

815
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,360
Drink the medicine.

816
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:11,840
You can't take cold medicine when you're drunk.

817
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,679
Let's see if you dare to drink again.

818
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,289
All right. Get some rest.

819
00:35:15,289 --> 00:35:16,480
Don't get sick later.

820
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,400
Go to sleep then.

821
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,559
Remember to take your cold medicine tomorrow.

822
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:37,519
- Hello? - Hello, Ms. Xiao.

823
00:35:37,809 --> 00:35:38,809
Xiao Guang, what's wrong?

824
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:41,809
Ms. Xiao. My dad is unreliable.

825
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:43,679
He's not just drunk.

826
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,119
He caught a cold too.

827
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:47,159
Can you help me take a look?

828
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,000
He's drunk?

829
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:50,679
Where's Xu Yi Ran?

830
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,360
I called him, but he didn't pick up.

831
00:35:54,769 --> 00:35:57,440
Ms. Xiao. I haven't had dinner yet.

832
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,679
I'm a bit hungry.

833
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:01,769
How about this?

834
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,960
I just got off work.

835
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:04,440
I'll bring you some food.

836
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:06,119
Thank you, Ms. Xiao.

837
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:07,679
I'll wait for you at home.

838
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,679
Ms. Xiao.

839
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:18,880
Please come in.

840
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,960
I'm so sorry to bother you so late.

841
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:23,360
Don't mention it.

842
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:24,599
This is for you.

843
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:26,639
Where's your dad?

844
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,289
My dad is in the bedroom.

845
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:31,519
You can eat first. I'll go check on him.

846
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:32,599
Okay.

847
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:15,639
Xiao Yan.

848
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,159
Xiao Yan.

849
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,559
Hello, Ms. Zheng.

850
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:22,639
Xiao Guang.

851
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:23,769
Where's your dad?

852
00:38:23,809 --> 00:38:25,039
I sent your dad a message.

853
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:26,329
Why isn't he replying?

854
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,519
My dad...

855
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:30,599
He's sick.

856
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:33,000
Why is he sick?

857
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,519
Is it serious?

858
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,809
It's quite serious.

859
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:38,679
Okay, wait for me. I'll be right there.

860
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,079
Ms. Zheng, don't.

861
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:41,679
Hey, Ms. Zheng.

862
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:43,159
Ms. Zheng.

863
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,199
Xiao Guang, do you have honey at home?

864
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:50,360
It's over there.

865
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,840
Your dad is fine.

866
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,840
He just caught a cold.

867
00:39:08,809 --> 00:39:10,000
When he wakes up,

868
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:13,289
you can give him some honey water.

869
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,769
Remind him to take his medicine tomorrow.

870
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,239
- Got it? - Yes.

871
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:20,960
If there's nothing else, I'll get going.

872
00:39:21,289 --> 00:39:22,440
Bye, Ms. Xiao.

873
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,519
- Bye. - Bye.

874
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,289
Bye, Ms. Xiao.

875
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:34,239
Ms. Zheng.

876
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,920
Where's your dad? How is he?

877
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,119
My dad fell asleep in his room.

878
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,519
Why is it so hot?

879
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,039
Did he take any medicine?

880
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:57,159
He drank, so he shouldn't take cold medicine.

881
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,599
He drank?

882
00:39:59,769 --> 00:40:01,119
Why would he drink?

883
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,360
Maybe it has something to do with Ms. Xiao.

884
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:10,840
Is that all you've got?

885
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:13,329
That's what I told him.

886
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:16,639
But when he's agitated, he insisted on taking a cold shower.

887
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,809
That's why he caught a cold.

888
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:24,039
All right.

889
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:25,289
It's late. You should go to bed.

890
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:26,360
I'll take care of him.

891
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:29,809
Ms. Zheng, that's not appropriate.

892
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,239
Why not?

893
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,000
By the way, Xiao Guang, do you have ginger at home?

894
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,880
I want to make some ginger soup for him.

895
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,880
Bai Zhu, raise your head.

896
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,079
Open your mouth.

897
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:33,719
One more time.

898
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,480
Bai Zhu.

899
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,000
Do you like me?

900
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:13,119
I like you too.

901
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:21,599
You're a jerk.

902
00:42:26,679 --> 00:42:28,809
There's an old deer in my heart.

903
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:30,809
The moment I saw Dr. Bai,

904
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,840
it asked me if I was going to crash.

905
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:35,840
Then I'll definitely say yes.

906
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,769
I'll accept it even if I'm dead.

907
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,480
Do you like me?

908
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I do like you.
