1
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,439
(Thank You, Doctor)

2
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:30,000
(Adapted from Sheng Li's novel "ICU 48 Hours")

3
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,079
(Episode 15)

4
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,480
That Hao Jia Jia.

5
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:37,920
She's so shameless.

6
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:42,640
Fish don't swim in clear water.

7
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,079
Dr. Xiao.

8
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,040
Tang Hua.

9
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,959
You've been exposed on the Internet.

10
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,239
Aren't you worried about yourself?

11
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:53,719
What's wrong? I'm not afraid of being famous.

12
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,000
That's a good attitude.

13
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,079
I'm sure everyone has seen the video and Weibo.

14
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,719
I won't go into detail then.

15
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,159
Just like what I always say.

16
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:06,920
Everyone, focus on your work.

17
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,879
Don't let your mood get affected by such matters.

18
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:12,279
The hospital has filed a police report.

19
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,599
I believe this will be resolved soon.

20
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,560
On that note,

21
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:23,598
I'd like to discuss a small issue with all of you.

22
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,599
Regarding our jobs...

23
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,090
and personal lives as doctors.

24
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,879
Xiao Yan has been known...

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,159
as the wild female doctor...

26
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,159
on the Internet.

27
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,000
Maybe to the general public,

28
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,680
a doctor shouldn't ride a motorcycle.

29
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,560
In other words, it could be implied...

30
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,759
that a doctor who rides a motorbike...

31
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:47,960
might not be a qualified doctor.

32
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,319
Of course, I think this concept is very one-sided.

33
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:56,120
I don't know what you think about this...

34
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:59,879
from your perspective.

35
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,479
I don't think there's a problem.

36
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,840
Life is life.

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,280
Work is work.

38
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,758
As long as our personal life doesn't affect anyone,

39
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:12,479
I don't think anyone has the right to criticize me.

40
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,439
Of course. There's nothing wrong with riding a motorbike.

41
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:19,719
But it's somewhat dangerous.

42
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,560
I'm worried it will affect your career.

43
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:24,879
I think you're worried that...

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,360
it will affect your promotion?

45
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,840
All of you.

46
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,599
All of you are led astray by him.

47
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,120
I'm not trying to interfere with your private lives.

48
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,598
I'd like to remind you...

49
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,080
from the perspective as your acting chief,

50
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,879
before we take any action,

51
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,359
we must always keep in mind...

52
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,800
the characteristics of our profession.

53
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,120
We're doctors after all.

54
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:54,639
Well, we can ride bikes.

55
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,360
But you must be careful.

56
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,360
I know. Thank you, sir.

57
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:10,159
Then...

58
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,639
All right. Well...

59
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:12,960
Let's get back to work.

60
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,800
- Just get to work. - Goodbye, sir.

61
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,730
Just how much time does he have on his hands?

62
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,199
Dr. Xiao.

63
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,519
Don't you look too cool?

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,120
How did they take that video? So cool.

65
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,959
That's pretty cool.

66
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,170
What are you looking at?

67
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,360
I'm looking at leather jackets.

68
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,920
Dr. Xiao looked so cool wearing it on her motorbike.

69
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,610
I want to buy one too.

70
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,610
These brands are all good.

71
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:41,519
Dr. Xiao, help me pick one too.

72
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,170
This one. It's pretty.

73
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,240
I'll place the order then.

74
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,799
When the jacket arrives,

75
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,360
I want you to take me for a ride.

76
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:53,079
With Dr. Xiao's speed,

77
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,800
you'll be scared to tears.

78
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,198
Let's go together next time and see who cries first.

79
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,609
- Sure. - Whoever cries is a puppy.

80
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,839
- Sure. - Hello?

81
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,000
If you call me again, I'll call the police.

82
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What's going on?

83
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,439
I don't know him.

84
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:18,240
He told me I don't deserve to be a doctor.

85
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,639
That must be someone who read Hao Jia Jia's Weibo.

86
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,879
There's another one?

87
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,360
Hello?

88
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:29,000
We're doing great.

89
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,959
Thank you for your concern. My family is fine.

90
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,319
We should all turn off our cell phones for now.

91
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:46,560
They got your phone numbers and posted them on Weibo.

92
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:48,639
This is outrageous.

93
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,319
This is cyberbullying.

94
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,759
What else does he want?

95
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,119
What's next?

96
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,639
They will hunt down our home addresses,

97
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,360
alma mater, and work addresses.

98
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,800
- Who are these people? - That's hard to say.

99
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,600
Look at the man who was exposed.

100
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,078
They found out his address...

101
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,959
and even splashed paint on his door.

102
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,839
You two need to be careful these days.

103
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,800
Tang Hua, you should be fine.

104
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:12,879
You're a local.

105
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,560
Dr. Xiao.

106
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,519
You're always alone.

107
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:17,839
Will you be okay?

108
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,000
Why don't you stay at my place?

109
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,559
Or mine. I live alone.

110
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,560
I could use some company.

111
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,920
I'm fine.

112
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,398
If anyone calls again,

113
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,839
I'll call the police.

114
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:27,439
Don't worry.

115
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,279
Let's eat.

116
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,639
Why don't you two eat at that table?

117
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,319
Dr. Xu.

118
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,680
It can't be that someone is really after them?

119
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,638
Those keyboard warriors just badmouth them online.

120
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,360
Those who dare to stir up trouble are just troublemakers.

121
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,759
All keyboard warriors have nothing better to do.

122
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,600
Mr. Bai, sir.

123
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,079
Don't call me "sir".

124
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,360
I didn't teach you anything.

125
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,079
What would you like to drink?

126
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,319
Cappuccino.

127
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,079
Excuse me.

128
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,000
Hello, what would you like to order?

129
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:24,439
A cappuccino.

130
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,519
Okay, please wait a moment.

131
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,920
Well...

132
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,040
- Let's start now. - Okay.

133
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,800
I thought reporters like you...

134
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,680
are all old-fashioned.

135
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,399
You're right.

136
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:39,639
Those people, they are old-fashioned indeed.

137
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,000
Actually, I'm not a reporter.

138
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:47,879
I'm a doctor from Tongshan Hospital.

139
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,879
I'm a doctor from the ER, Bai Zhu.

140
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,518
This is the CCTV footage of you...

141
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:57,079
getting treatment in our hospital.

142
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,639
Hello. Here's your coffee.

143
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,720
Enjoy.

144
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:13,040
The coffee here is good. Have a seat and try it.

145
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:25,000
Dr. Xiao, the doctor who treated you is a good person.

146
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,560
She kept stopping me...

147
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,439
from revealing this video clip.

148
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,120
She wanted to give you a chance to mend your ways.

149
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,919
There are two totally different consequences...

150
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,120
for apologizing willingly and being exposed.

151
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,799
So she asked me to talk to you.

152
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:45,519
It's okay.

153
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:48,000
You can think about it over coffee.

154
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:50,090
I'm off today. I have plenty of time.

155
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,240
This is already the 20th prank call.

156
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:05,210
That's why I've told you, regarding this matter,

157
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,210
it's much more serious than we thought.

158
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,720
Everyone, don't let your guard down.

159
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,000
Be cautious. You can't be more careful.

160
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:15,879
How about this?

161
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,359
After work tonight,

162
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,798
Xiao Yan, we're going the same way.

163
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,120
I'll give you a ride home.

164
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,559
There's really no need for that.

165
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,039
Safety first.

166
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,479
Which of you go the same way home as Tang Hua?

167
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,480
Escort her home.

168
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:28,039
No need to have them escorted.

169
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:30,159
Tell me if you have any insider news.

170
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:32,120
Hello, everyone.

171
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,519
I'm on Weibo as...

172
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:36,000
"Hao Jia Jia Needs A Boost." My name is Hao Jia Jia.

173
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,360
Today,

174
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:38,759
to all the netizens out there,

175
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,039
I'd like to set the record straight.

176
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:43,090
First, I'd like to clarify that...

177
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,879
I was not assaulted.

178
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,559
The man was not drunk either.

179
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,679
We just had a bit of an argument.

180
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:57,159
The bloody photos on Weibo were photoshopped by me.

181
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:59,679
Secondly, because the doctors...

182
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:01,480
turned down my request to exaggerate my injuries,

183
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,210
I spread malicious rumors...

184
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:05,039
and slandered them in spite.

185
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:08,120
Hereby, I'd like to express...

186
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,639
my most sincere apologies...

187
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:11,000
to the doctors and the netizens out there.

188
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,559
This is so sudden.

189
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:18,120
This matter is over, just like that?

190
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,600
Or what?

191
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,279
Dr. Xiao.

192
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:32,090
The patient in Bed Number 13,

193
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,519
the toxic encephalopathy patient from yesterday,

194
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,638
he had three more spasms.

195
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:36,000
Should we increase the meds?

196
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:38,090
Some of the meds don't work that fast.

197
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,359
Let's observe him for one more day.

198
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,450
Okay.

199
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,240
Did you know?

200
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,799
Hao Jia Jia has been arrested.

201
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,039
Really?

202
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,840
There's a notice from the police.

203
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,329
"Ms. Hao will be detained for five days..."

204
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,679
"for spreading falsified rumors."

205
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,279
How satisfying.

206
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,330
Both of you. You're gossiping at work again.

207
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,759
I was watching the news during my break.

208
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,840
And do you know?

209
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,439
The netizens have started...

210
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,559
and Internet manhunt on Hao Jia Jia now.

211
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,759
They want her to pay the price for cyberstalking.

212
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,080
In the end, she got herself in trouble.

213
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:12,759
Cyberbullying is quite serious nowadays.

214
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,559
Come on. Let's check on the patient you just mentioned.

215
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:16,799
Okay.

216
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,600
How did you handle Hao Jia Jia?

217
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,399
There are cameras in the hospital.

218
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,720
You're really something.

219
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:38,039
What if she actually asked to see the content?

220
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,279
What are you going to do?

221
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,038
From the moment she saw me,

222
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:42,639
I knew she'd take my words for real.

223
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,360
I just wanted to know how you can be so confident.

224
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:48,240
I can't help it. I was born with it.

225
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
Dr. Bai.

226
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:53,039
Thank you.

227
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,840
You're welcome.

228
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,919
Okay, I know you're awesome.

229
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,240
I'm glad you know.

230
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:04,840
What a jerk.

231
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:14,919
You want the ER to send someone to appear on a television show?

232
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,080
Yes.

233
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,320
The online rumors about our hospital have quieted down.

234
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:24,000
But the debate on whether EICU fees are reasonable or not...

235
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:26,399
is still ongoing.

236
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:29,199
I was thinking, if we don't respond to it,

237
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,840
maybe after a while, it will just quiet down.

238
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,120
But if we appear on television,

239
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,200
I wonder if the EICU will be the center of attention again?

240
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:36,840
That might stir up trouble.

241
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:38,398
Misunderstandings happen when people can't understand.

242
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,480
That's why they question us.

243
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,639
Since the public has misunderstandings about EICU,

244
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,120
we can't just ignore it.

245
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,480
We have a responsibility and an obligation...

246
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,038
to explain this to the public.

247
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:49,840
We should clear up misunderstandings from the source.

248
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,159
Also, in the long run,

249
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:55,600
this will benefit your work.

250
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:57,799
Dr. Jiang, you're right.

251
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,918
On one hand, we can clear the air...

252
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:01,480
about EICU fees.

253
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,559
On the other hand,

254
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:05,840
we can also impart EICU knowledge with everyone.

255
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,399
It's killing two birds with one stone.

256
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:10,759
I also plan to suggest it to the television station...

257
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,200
about doing a few episodes on lectures regarding the EICU.

258
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,679
So that everyone can learn about it.

259
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,480
Right.

260
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,679
The television station wants us...

261
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:21,639
to send two doctors to their show.

262
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,480
Do you have anyone in mind?

263
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:25,919
Let's send Xiao Yan...

264
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,200
and Bai Zhu.

265
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,399
I'm not surprised that you chose Dr. Xiao.

266
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,039
As for Bai Zhu, do you think he's suitable?

267
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:36,440
Bai Zhu is a bit naughty,

268
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:37,999
but to be honest, in terms of competence,

269
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,639
he really is pretty good.

270
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:43,039
Besides, aren't good looks the top priority these days?

271
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,759
Maybe, after he's on the show,

272
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,839
it might attract more female viewers...

273
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,039
to watch this program.

274
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:51,120
You sure are progressive.

275
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,639
It seems like your impression of Bai Zhu has changed.

276
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,120
In short, it's showing off what everyone is good at.

277
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,799
As long as the ER and EICU are working well,

278
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,919
that's what I should do as the acting chief.

279
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:03,559
Dr. Lu.

280
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,200
I've been very impressed by you...

281
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,799
since EICU was first established.

282
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,720
Well...

283
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,480
It's all thanks to your leadership and your support.

284
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:25,279
That's all.

285
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,360
Off you go.

286
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:29,840
Okay, I'll get going to work on the new task.

287
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,120
Goodbye, Dr. Jiang.

288
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,320
Dr. Lu, right now,

289
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:40,799
I have so many patients to juggle.

290
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:43,039
I really don't have the time to go on some program.

291
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,120
As for the patients, I'll get other doctors to help.

292
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:49,079
Don't worry. Their treatment won't get delayed.

293
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,080
No, I...

294
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,039
You have to go on the show.

295
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,159
This is a direct order from Dr. Jiang himself.

296
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,600
One more thing.

297
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:58,840
Many people are now...

298
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,440
questioning our EICU on the Internet.

299
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,240
Go on the show to respond to those questions.

300
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,159
This is doing a good deed for our EICU.

301
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,320
Okay.

302
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:10,399
Okay.

303
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:12,799
What about you?

304
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,320
I don't ever take part in anything like this.

305
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,200
But if I don't,

306
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,679
I guess the ratings will be low for this episode?

307
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,360
Okay. I'll leave it to you two then.

308
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,840
Let's move it forward a bit?

309
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Okay.

310
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,840
Dr. Xiao, Dr. Bai.

311
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,960
Please don't be nervous.

312
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,279
We'll start recording soon.

313
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,000
Think of me as your patient.

314
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,559
Okay.

315
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,240
Let's fix your makeup.

316
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,279
Who knew that Dr. Xiao who can ride a motorbike up mountains...

317
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,960
does get nervous at times?

318
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,080
How about this?

319
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,840
Change your name today.

320
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:14,159
Call yourself Black Cat.

321
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,360
Why?

322
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,600
Because...

323
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,279
"Black Cat Sheriff."

324
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:25,000
Black Cat, skittish.

325
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:28,080
What the heck?

326
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:31,240
If you're ready, let's begin.

327
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,480
Okay.

328
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,678
Hello, everyone.

329
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:38,038
Good evening.

330
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,600
I'm He Zhi Shu, the host of this program, "We Wish You Well."

331
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:42,158
For today's segment,

332
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:43,839
we've invited Tongshan Hospital's...

333
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,758
ER doctors,

334
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,600
Dr. Xiao Yan and Dr. Bai Zhu.

335
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,679
Dr. Xiao and Dr. Bai.

336
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,200
Please greet our audience.

337
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:57,559
Hello, everyone.

338
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm an attending physician at Tongshan Hospital's ER department.

339
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,080
My name is Xiao Yan.

340
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:04,079
Hello, everyone. I'm Dr. Xiao's colleague, Bai Zhu.

341
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,919
This may be your first time on television.

342
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,838
But you're really amazing.

343
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,650
I knew it. Outstanding people excel in everything they do.

344
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:11,839
You're too kind.

345
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,479
Thank you both for joining us.

346
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,890
I'll talk to you more next time.

347
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,119
- Okay. - Thank you for your hard work.

348
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:19,000
- Take care. - Thank you.

349
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:25,240
Be careful when scratching your ear on your motorbike.

350
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,410
Thank you for calling me Black Cat Sheriff.

351
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,359
My motorbike is in maintenance.

352
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:33,359
Although we're not going in the same direction,

353
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,720
I don't mind giving you a ride.

354
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,920
It's okay.

355
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:38,000
I'll take a taxi home.

356
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:39,650
You should go home and rest.

357
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:41,119
Bye.

358
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,960
Taxi?

359
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:17,359
Please give me a ride.

360
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:19,440
I'm at your service.

361
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:20,920
Please fasten your seat belt.

362
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:30,559
I didn't expect to trouble you in the end.

363
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,000
Trouble? It's indeed a bit troublesome.

364
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:35,359
But I ran into you.

365
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,960
We're colleagues after all.

366
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:40,000
If you catch a cold from the rain and call in sick,

367
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,650
it's like burdening me with more work.

368
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:46,000
So it's better to give you a ride.

369
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,759
Anyway, I wanted to thank you.

370
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:52,440
Lately, you've been thanking me a lot.

371
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,920
Back at Smoky Alley,

372
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,920
you told me...

373
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,200
I'm not what you think I am.

374
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,839
I'm saying it back to you today.

375
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:08,890
You're also totally different from what I imagined.

376
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,599
Very different.

377
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,000
Don't stop. Keep going.

378
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,079
Just like what Xu Yi Ran said,

379
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:19,000
you're actually a very kind person.

380
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,799
But you like putting yourself in that...

381
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:25,480
arrogant and vicious shell.

382
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,440
Xu Yi Ran. He thought he knew me well.

383
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:32,599
I thought so too.

384
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:34,920
Everyone has their own shell.

385
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:36,519
Aren't you the same?

386
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:39,279
When you ride a motorbike,

387
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:40,559
when you're at work,

388
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,680
and when you were at Smoky Alley,

389
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:45,170
searching for your memories,

390
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:47,319
which is the real you?

391
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
No!

392
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:08,200
I won't let you treat me!

393
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,440
Get me another doctor.

394
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:11,279
- But we don't have... - How about this?

395
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:13,798
I'll pay double.

396
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:15,079
- What does that... - Triple.

397
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,079
If not, five times.

398
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:18,519
I have the money.

399
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,319
- This is... - What's going on?

400
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:21,650
Dr. Xu.

401
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:24,000
This patient fell off his horse while riding.

402
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,410
I was going to treat him, but he won't let me.

403
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,200
You're a doctor too?

404
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:29,650
What's your zodiac sign?

405
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,440
I'm asking about your zodiac sign.

406
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,599
I was born in the Year of the Ox. Why?

407
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,599
That's good.

408
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:40,319
You can treat me.

409
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,599
Dr. Xu, the patient said that...

410
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,720
my zodiac sign is incompatible with his.

411
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,319
You're a Tiger and I'm a Goat.

412
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,960
If you treat me,

413
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,359
am I not walking into a tiger's den?

414
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,599
But cows are different.

415
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,960
Cows and goats are good friends.

416
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,759
You're so superstitious.

417
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,480
Pick a doctor from zodiac signs?

418
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:05,799
That's so ignorant.

419
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,759
That's right. What if no doctor is compatible with him?

420
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:09,839
Will he refuse treatment today?

421
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,170
That's not all.

422
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,649
His shoulder blade is broken.

423
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:13,650
He needs surgery.

424
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,199
I told him to stay in the observation room.

425
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,440
But he even wanted to pick his own spot.

426
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:20,598
You shouldn't let him have his way.

427
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:23,119
If you indulge him, he'll take advantage of you.

428
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,650
Chen Zhi.

429
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:28,680
Dr. Xu.

430
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,920
Come and sit.

431
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:46,559
Enjoy your meal.

432
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:47,799
I'm full.

433
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,920
Is it spicy?

434
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,680
It's not spicy.

435
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,279
Keep going.

436
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:11,519
This won't do.

437
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:13,359
You have to keep your cool.

438
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:17,599
I mean,

439
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,078
you have to remain calm...

440
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,400
to face the difficulties in life.

441
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,440
Don't act as if you're bearing a huge grudge and writhing in pain.

442
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,720
But I can't do it, Dr. Xu.

443
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,480
Here's a proverb for you.

444
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:31,119
"What you gain is your fortune, but what you lose is your fate."

445
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:33,519
Write it down on a piece of paper and hang it by your bedside.

446
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:35,400
Recite it ten times every night before you go to bed.

447
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,079
Try to relate to it.

448
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,639
"What you gain is your fortune,"

449
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,359
"but what you lose is your fate."

450
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,279
"What you gain is your fortune..."

451
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:53,640
Your surgery is scheduled in the afternoon, two days from now.

452
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,519
You need a family member here.

453
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,200
No. Definitely not.

454
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,039
- Why? - I...

455
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,960
The psychic read my fortune.

456
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,839
This Sunday is a good day for surgery.

457
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,279
It's an auspicious day.

458
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,880
Any other day is unacceptable.

459
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,920
You should reschedule it for me.

460
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,720
But Sunday is still a few days away.

461
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:15,720
That's right. Your shoulder blade is broken.

462
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:17,039
If we don't operate on it in time, there will be problems.

463
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,318
Don't worry.

464
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:20,959
That psychic is amazing.

465
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,680
He said it's an auspicious day.

466
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,599
It must be an auspicious day.

467
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,279
That psychic also said, the auspicious time for surgery...

468
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,720
is between 7 and 9 am on that day.

469
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,480
That's the Hour of the Dragon.

470
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:34,919
The wound will heal quickly...

471
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,519
if the surgery is performed then.

472
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,359
There won't be any aftereffects.

473
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,240
But here's what I think.

474
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,318
Since you came to the hospital,

475
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:45,640
you believe in medicine.

476
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,679
You believe in medicine.

477
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,200
Then you should listen to us doctors.

478
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,799
There's no need to specify a certain date for the surgery.

479
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,039
Of course, I believe in doctors.

480
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,559
But I can't ignore what my psychic says, right?

481
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,279
Nothing matters more than your own health.

482
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,079
I know you mean well.

483
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,200
But I've made up my mind.

484
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,960
I suggest you reconsider.

485
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,160
Get some rest.

486
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,440
Let's go.

487
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,279
We can't agree to this patient's request.

488
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,680
Of course not.

489
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,559
I think that psychic is a scammer.

490
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:23,079
Those who believe in him are either crazy or stupid.

491
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:25,480
But he won't let us schedule the surgery.

492
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,038
Have you met that psychic?

493
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:29,118
No.

494
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:30,720
We only heard of him, but he never visited.

495
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,079
The one who caused it should be the one to undo it.

496
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:35,359
What do you mean?

497
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,839
What Dr. Bai is saying is...

498
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:38,480
you want to persuade the patient to undergo surgery.

499
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,000
Then we must find that psychic.

500
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,279
How about this?

501
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:45,759
Yi Ran, Chen Zhi.

502
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,559
You two try to find a way...

503
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,440
to contact that so-called psychic, okay?

504
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,920
All right, I'll think of something.

505
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:53,079
How about this?

506
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,279
Leave it to me.

507
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,079
After I finish my shift, I have nothing to do.

508
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,480
Dr. Xiao.

509
00:24:58,481 --> 00:24:59,559
After you get off work,

510
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:01,079
why don't you join me if you have nothing to do?

511
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,640
I can do it.

512
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:03,799
It's in the patient's best interests.

513
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:05,839
Fine.

514
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,920
It's decided then.

515
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,119
This time, I won't make decisions on my own again.

516
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,279
How did it go?

517
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,240
Did your supervisor agree to it?

518
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:32,640
Our supervisor said that he has to look into it.

519
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,240
It's just surgery, isn't it?

520
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,599
What's there to look into?

521
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,599
Let me introduce you.

522
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,720
This is our hospital's...

523
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,039
Dr. Bai and Dr. Xiao.

524
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:44,920
The two of them are here to ask you for a favor.

525
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,279
A favor?

526
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,680
Here's what.

527
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I got it!

528
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,799
Dr. Bai...

529
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,759
and Dr. Xiao...

530
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,960
are a married couple, right?

531
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:02,758
You must have been married for years,

532
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:04,039
but you don't have children.

533
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,960
You want to ask my psychic...

534
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:09,279
to grant you a child.

535
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:17,358
Xiao Yan. I overheard you saying...

536
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:18,960
what's-his-name,

537
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,839
just how great he is.

538
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,160
He made Wang Lin Guo compromise.

539
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,480
What a good sword.

540
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:27,559
I think you want to get stabbed.

541
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:30,440
Do you remember the information we just rehearsed?

542
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,719
Name, age, and birthday.

543
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,759
I'm not here for a blind date.

544
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,000
Dr. Xiao. We're husband and wife now.

545
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,639
You have to put on an act, right?

546
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,319
This psychic is really something.

547
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,279
He's even so good at picking out a meeting place.

548
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,720
He must have scammed a lot of people.

549
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,160
Hello, sir.

550
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,240
Please have a seat.

551
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,880
You...

552
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,119
You must be Mr. Yi.

553
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:17,720
There's 100,000 yuan in this card.

554
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,000
I can't say it's a reward for you.

555
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,680
It's just a token of appreciation from us both.

556
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:24,599
Please have mercy...

557
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,839
and help us out.

558
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:31,079
Thank you.

559
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,279
Right?

560
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,039
- Right? - Password, six ones.

561
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:46,119
Forget it.

562
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,799
Helping others is the foundation of cultivation.

563
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:51,680
For you, I'll make an exception.

564
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:53,119
I'll help you with this once.

565
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,639
- Thank you. - Thank you.

566
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,680
Thank you.

567
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:57,920
Remember, just this once.

568
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,240
- Of course. - Of course.

569
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,000
Today is the third day of the month.

570
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,519
The Supreme Venerable Sovereign is on duty.

571
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,720
All right!

572
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,359
Water.

573
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:15,039
Okay.

574
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,000
How was it? Did you record it?

575
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,160
It was very clear.

576
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,160
When he did that...

577
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,440
That was so funny.

578
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:02,959
It was like radio calisthenics.

579
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,200
That psychic is so silly.

580
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:06,559
An empty card has exposed his true colors.

581
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,118
I just called the police.

582
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:09,359
The police are on their way.

583
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,200
It has been a pleasure working with you.

584
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:18,079
It has been a pleasure working with you.

585
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,200
Let's go. We should stall him.

586
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:37,839
Sir.

587
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,160
You wanted to see us?

588
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,880
Yes.

589
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,720
I just wanted to thank you in person.

590
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,000
You've let me know he's a scammer.

591
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:49,799
Thank you.

592
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,599
You're welcome. We want you to get treatment soon.

593
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,440
We'll schedule your surgery.

594
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,039
Okay.

595
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,480
Xiao Yan.

596
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,720
Wang Lin Guo has agreed to the surgery.

597
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,720
I know you two did it.

598
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,640
What do you mean?

599
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,119
It should be that we pulled it off.

600
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:19,559
I'll make my rounds.

601
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,279
Dr. Bai.

602
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,480
How did you and Dr. Xiao make him...

603
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:24,720
show his true colors so quickly?

604
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:27,079
Figure it out yourself.

605
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:47,079
Doctor.

606
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,960
Am I okay?

607
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,559
The surgery was successful.

608
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,079
But you still need to be monitored for a few days.

609
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,400
That's great.

610
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:58,319
It's all thanks to you doctors.

611
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,839
Dr. Lu, let's eat.

612
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:09,720
You go first. I'm in the middle of something.

613
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,240
Hurry up then. It's going to be crowded later.

614
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,400
Okay.

615
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,519
Dr. Lu. You haven't eaten, right?

616
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:19,599
No, Ms. Jiang. Did something happen?

617
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,680
That's great.

618
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:23,039
I made some food.

619
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:25,240
The food in our canteen is bland.

620
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:26,599
You like strong flavors, so you don't like their food.

621
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:28,160
I made braised hairtail today.

622
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,839
So I brought you some.

623
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:31,480
This is...

624
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,720
Xian Yu told me to.

625
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:37,639
Here.

626
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,119
You shouldn't have.

627
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:40,599
Don't mention it.

628
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:42,799
Mr. Pan,

629
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,559
he's hardworking and agile.

630
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,960
Xian Yun is quite pleased.

631
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:47,960
We've always wanted to thank you.

632
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,400
But we don't know how.

633
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,319
Xian Yun heard that you love alone,

634
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:52,599
so you rarely watch what you eat.

635
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,240
He told me to bring you some food.

636
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:56,000
Try my homemade food.

637
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,240
You shouldn't have.

638
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,400
Well, don't mention it.

639
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,319
Thank Xian Yun for me.

640
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,558
You're welcome.

641
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:02,680
I'll get going then.

642
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:04,599
Thank you.

643
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,480
You're welcome. Try it.

644
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:22,519
Dr. Lu.

645
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:25,039
I really didn't expect Ms. Jiang to cook so well.

646
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:26,559
It's really good.

647
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,759
I'm glad you like it.

648
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,079
I'll cook for you again.

649
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:31,000
I've always liked greasy food.

650
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,759
I know it's not healthy, but old habits die hard.

651
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,559
- I can't help it. - It has been years.

652
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,680
It takes time to make changes.

653
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:37,559
I'll make you something light the next time.

654
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,759
You'll get used to it slowly.

655
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,440
Dr. Lu, Dr. Jiang is looking for you.

656
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:43,440
Okay, I'll be right there.

657
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,880
I have to go. Right.

658
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:48,240
Tell Xian Yun that you don't have to make me...

659
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:49,519
lunch again the next time.

660
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:51,799
What's wrong?

661
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,400
I'm afraid someone might see us.

662
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,079
It won't be good for you.

663
00:32:57,839 --> 00:32:58,839
I'll get back to work then.

664
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Let us go through.

665
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:17,598
- What's the patient's condition? - The patient is 35 years old.

666
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:19,400
Seven months pregnant. Fainted while strolling.

667
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,480
Atrial fibrillation, 170. Blood pressure, 110 over 70.

668
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,400
Dr. Xiao.

669
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,240
Has she been like this before?

670
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:30,039
No. It's the first time.

671
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,480
Doctor, is my wife okay?

672
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,240
She has a serious arrhythmia.

673
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:37,240
Does she have a medical history of heart diseases?

674
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:39,319
No. Never.

675
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:42,159
By the way, doctor,

676
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,039
is it because she's a vegetarian?

677
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,798
- Vegetarian? - Here's the thing.

678
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:47,240
After we got married,

679
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,318
we hadn't been able to have kids.

680
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:49,920
I don't know who she heard it from,

681
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:52,039
but it's said that our family have taken too many lives.

682
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,920
You see.

683
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,240
We were butchers.

684
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,559
But in order to have children,

685
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,759
she stopped me from being a butcher.

686
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:00,839
She wouldn't let me eat meat.

687
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,440
She wouldn't eat it either?

688
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,640
She wouldn't even smell it.

689
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,519
But then she really got pregnant.

690
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,880
She believed it even more.

691
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,289
But when she was pregnant,

692
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:12,039
how can she get enough nutrients if she's a vegetarian?

693
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,559
Run standard blood and urine tests,

694
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:15,840
coagulation and biochemical tests.

695
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:17,920
Get her an echocardiogram.

696
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:20,559
Five milligrams of Verapamil through the IV.

697
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,329
And then we'll get an obstetrician to do an ultrasound.

698
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:25,289
- Okay. - I don't want injections.

699
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,480
Don't worry.

700
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:29,079
Verapamil is relatively safe for you and the baby.

701
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,239
I won't do it.

702
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,679
Doctor, I forgot to tell you.

703
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,199
She doesn't eat meat...

704
00:34:35,329 --> 00:34:36,329
and after she got pregnant, she doesn't even take medicine.

705
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:38,329
The medicine is full of chemicals.

706
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,519
It's not good for the baby.

707
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,289
But right now, with your condition,

708
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,769
you need this medicine.

709
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,839
If we can't keep your arrhythmia in control,

710
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,079
the baby will be in danger.

711
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,808
That's why we need to do an ultrasound first...

712
00:34:47,809 --> 00:34:49,199
to see how the baby is doing.

713
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:50,880
I'm not doing an ultrasound.

714
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,439
Radiation from the ultrasound will affect...

715
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,000
the development of the baby's nervous system.

716
00:34:54,329 --> 00:34:55,440
The ultrasound will be safe.

717
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,439
You want to know if the baby is healthy,

718
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,599
you have to do an ultrasound.

719
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:09,840
How far along are you?

720
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:11,639
Just another three days and it's seven months.

721
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,840
Seven months?

722
00:35:14,769 --> 00:35:16,920
The fetus looks five months big at most.

723
00:35:17,329 --> 00:35:18,440
How is that possible?

724
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:20,039
It does look just five months old.

725
00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:22,039
No way. You're not mistaken, are you?

726
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:23,880
My wife is indeed seven months pregnant.

727
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,329
This patient's condition is quite stable.

728
00:35:30,289 --> 00:35:32,399
- Keep an eye on his blood pressure. - I will.

729
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,289
- Dr. Xiao. - The results are out.

730
00:35:40,289 --> 00:35:41,920
Anemia and a lack of vitamins.

731
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:43,239
Renal dysfunction.

732
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,840
I've asked her.

733
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,960
No family history of difficult birth.

734
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:47,480
No history of genetic diseases.

735
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,809
I think it's because she has been a vegetarian for a long time.

736
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:52,480
It's caused by her absorption disorder.

737
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,880
Doctor. How is she?

738
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,000
The fetus has trouble developing.

739
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:05,960
It's likely caused by insufficient nutrients and an unbalanced diet.

740
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,479
No way.

741
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,400
All I eat is green and clean food.

742
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:11,678
Yes. She likes celery the most.

743
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:12,920
Or spinach.

744
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,959
In the test results,

745
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,599
you now lack iron and protein.

746
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,000
Therefore, a seven-month-old fetus...

747
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:21,329
appears to be only five months old.

748
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:24,359
What we'll do next is to give her some fluids.

749
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,599
I don't do injections.

750
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:27,119
It's full of chemicals.

751
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:29,769
Your baby is severely malnourished.

752
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,559
Maybe I'm not eating well enough.

753
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,199
This is just nutritional fluid.

754
00:36:36,329 --> 00:36:37,480
I don't want any shots.

755
00:36:45,809 --> 00:36:48,119
You really need to have a good talk with your wife.

756
00:36:48,769 --> 00:36:49,960
It's good to eat healthy.

757
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:51,559
But you also need to have a balanced diet.

758
00:36:51,769 --> 00:36:54,000
Also, she has to take medicine when she is ill.

759
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,599
Even if it's not for her sake,

760
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,039
she has to think about her child.

761
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,440
Yes.

762
00:36:58,769 --> 00:36:59,769
You don't know...

763
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,079
just how many times I've already talked to her.

764
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:03,809
It's pointless. She gets mad at me whenever I talk to her about it.

765
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:05,239
What about her parents?

766
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:06,919
Can't they do something?

767
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,880
My parents-in-law are back in their hometown.

768
00:37:09,289 --> 00:37:10,289
They're not well-educated.

769
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,159
She doesn't heed their words all the more.

770
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,769
What are we to do about her health...

771
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,159
in this situation?

772
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,960
Yes.

773
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,999
She wasn't like this.

774
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,159
Ever since she got pregnant,

775
00:37:21,329 --> 00:37:22,329
she became more and more stubborn.

776
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:23,769
All she thinks about is that...

777
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
vegetarianism is healthy and medicine is harmful.

778
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:27,880
No one can get through to her.

779
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,559
As for her condition,

780
00:37:31,809 --> 00:37:34,559
if we don't get her arrhythmia under control soon,

781
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,039
at this rate,

782
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:37,598
we have to consider asking the obstetrician...

783
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:39,159
to give her an emergency C-section.

784
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,960
That's the only way to ease the burden on her heart.

785
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:45,519
Is there anything I can do?

786
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,289
You're her family.

787
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,679
You really need to talk to her about the severity of this matter.

788
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,559
And considering her current condition,

789
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,679
something unexpected might happen at any time.

790
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:00,039
We suggest we transfer her to EICU to be monitored.

791
00:38:00,809 --> 00:38:02,239
Who said you can give me these fluids?

792
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,679
Are you trying to kill my child?

793
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,329
Honey, calm down.

794
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:07,960
If you don't get treated,

795
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,329
it's on you that your child suffers any mishap.

796
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:11,840
I saw your test results.

797
00:38:12,329 --> 00:38:13,480
You have severe arrhythmia.

798
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:14,809
If it's left untreated...

799
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,329
and it deteriorates,

800
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:18,960
not only will it affect your child's development,

801
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,679
but also threaten your own safety.

802
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:23,769
By then, we'll have to call for an obstetrician...

803
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:25,199
to do an emergency C-section.

804
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,480
You don't have to scare me.

805
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:28,559
I don't do C-sections. And I don't do anesthetics.

806
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:30,719
- Do you still want to be treated? - How could you say that?

807
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:31,809
I'm going to file a complaint against you.

808
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Excuse me.

809
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,519
What Dr. Bai said just now is just a possibility.

810
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,768
As long as you cooperate with our treatment,

811
00:38:37,769 --> 00:38:39,328
your body will be back to normal.

812
00:38:39,329 --> 00:38:40,329
You won't have to undergo those surgeries.

813
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:41,769
Cooperate? How?

814
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,079
By taking pills and getting fluids?

815
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:44,559
This is for your own good.

816
00:38:44,809 --> 00:38:46,159
How is this for my own good?

817
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:47,880
You're forcing us.

818
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
The baby is mine.

819
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:50,239
I'm the only one who truly wants what's best for him.

820
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,769
I really want to protect him.

821
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,328
You just want to sell us medicine.

822
00:38:53,329 --> 00:38:54,480
You just want to make dirty money.

823
00:38:55,289 --> 00:38:56,480
I want to see your boss.

824
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,920
I've looked into the patient's condition.

825
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:03,480
It's not looking good.

826
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:06,238
But without the patient's consent,

827
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:07,920
we can't give her fluids.

828
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,359
So you're saying,

829
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,999
we'll just let her put her life in danger...

830
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
while we do nothing to help?

831
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,559
Director, don't worry.

832
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:16,239
The patient said she's filing a complaint against me.

833
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:17,599
It won't affect you.

834
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:19,880
If that's what you think, listen up.

835
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:21,400
It doesn't affect me personally.

836
00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:23,329
It will affect the Department of Emergency Medicine.

837
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:25,159
You're an ER doctor.

838
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,809
Everything you say and do represents the ER.

839
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,960
Do you understand?

840
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:29,039
Dr. Lu.

841
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:30,400
Don't be so angry.

842
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,039
Dr. Bai is doing this...

843
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:34,559
for the patient's best interests.

844
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,679
Have you lost your principles?

845
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,329
That's not without principles.

846
00:39:38,769 --> 00:39:40,558
Dr. Xiao is a good and responsible doctor.

847
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:41,679
That's enough. Stop it.

848
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,480
What is the patient's mental state?

849
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:46,519
Is there anything abnormal?

850
00:39:46,809 --> 00:39:47,809
The patient is fine.

851
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:50,039
She's just too stubborn.

852
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,518
If she refuses to take the medicine,

853
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:53,719
are we just going to do nothing?

854
00:39:56,559 --> 00:39:58,809
Without the patient's consent, we can't force her.

855
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:00,639
It's not just about her.

856
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,119
She's pregnant with a child.

857
00:40:09,769 --> 00:40:11,719
How about this? I'll go talk to her now.

858
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,400
Okay, go ahead.

859
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:22,559
Dr. Lu.

860
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,400
How was it?

861
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,598
After much persuading,

862
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:27,839
she's finally not filing a complaint...

863
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,920
against Dr. Bai and the ER.

864
00:40:29,769 --> 00:40:31,559
What about the nutritional fluids and medication?

865
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,480
- Is that a yes? - No.

866
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,079
She's so stubborn.

867
00:40:35,329 --> 00:40:36,679
I get anxious watching her.

868
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,039
The patient is still very persistent.

869
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,079
She keeps warning us...

870
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,199
that if this happens again,

871
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:44,599
she'll really file a complaint.

872
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,638
I tried to talk her into staying at the hospital...

873
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:48,769
to be monitored for a few days.

874
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,400
Right. You're her attending physician.

875
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:53,480
You should think of a way too, okay?

876
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,719
Make sure she and the baby are both safe and healthy.

877
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:01,000
You really can't go on like this.

878
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:02,880
When can I be discharged?

879
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,599
Your health is still deteriorating.

880
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,920
You can't be discharged.

881
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,559
Don't scare me.

882
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:10,039
I won't use drugs.

883
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,809
I also won't use those fluids that's packed with chemicals.

884
00:41:13,289 --> 00:41:14,920
Even if you don't care about yourself,

885
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:17,519
can't you consider your baby's best interests?

886
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,960
I have to do this for him.

887
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:24,199
I'm tired. Please leave.

888
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:28,039
Let's go.

889
00:41:33,289 --> 00:41:34,639
She's so stubborn.

890
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:36,960
Whether she or her baby is in danger,

891
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:38,329
that's so sad.

892
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,039
Dr. Xiao!

893
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:41,480
Lin Li Xia's blood pressure suddenly dropped.

894
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:51,519
Her heart rate is too high. Her blood pressure keeps dropping.

895
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,039
My chest hurts.

896
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:54,639
The doctor is here.

897
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:55,679
Don't panic.

898
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:58,599
Decreased fetal movement.

899
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:00,289
Increased arrhythmia.

900
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,599
Ten mg of diltiazem.

901
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:04,289
Increase oxygen to six liters.

902
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:05,719
Okay, I don't want any drugs.

903
00:42:06,329 --> 00:42:07,329
No shots.

904
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:10,329
I'll sue you.

905
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:12,769
Your baby is in danger.

906
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,360
We must perform a cesarean section now.

907
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:15,679
I don't want a cesarean section.

908
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:16,919
I don't want an anesthetic.

909
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,880
I said your baby is in danger.

910
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,599
No way.

911
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,328
Honey. Let's listen to the doctor.

912
00:42:22,329 --> 00:42:23,559
No.

913
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:26,809
The heart rate is dropping.

914
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:30,119
See? It's okay.

915
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,239
- I told you it would be okay. - Your heart was overworked.

916
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,329
We used medicine to stabilize it.

917
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:37,719
If you don't get that baby out, he's going to die.

918
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,440
- Contact the obstetrician. - Okay.

919
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:41,329
You're forcing me into surgery?

920
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:42,880
I'll sue you!

921
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,920
Ma'am. Your baby is in danger.

922
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:46,959
Please calm down. Listen to the doctor.

923
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,480
- Don't touch me. - Ma'am, please calm down.

924
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:50,559
Leave me alone.

925
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:52,638
- Honey, what are you doing? - If you want your child to die,

926
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:53,718
go ahead and leave now.

927
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:55,840
- Don't scare me. - I'm not.
