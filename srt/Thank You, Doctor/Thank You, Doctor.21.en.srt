00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:27,200

(Adapted from Sheng Li's novel "ICU 48 Hours")

3
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,000
(Episode 21)

4
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,480
No matter what,

5
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,040
you shouldn't have taken him away without discussing it with me.

6
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,280
That's very wrong.

7
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,959
About that,

8
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,480
I didn't think it through.

9
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,519
I apologize.

10
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,159
Okay.

11
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,400
That's a good attitude.

12
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,120
Remember that.

13
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,400
Don't do that next time.

14
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,319
Is there anything else?

15
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,079
After thinking about it again,

16
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,200
I think that what you said this afternoon...

17
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:03,480
makes sense a little.

18
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,719
What did I tell you this afternoon?

19
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,199
You said that you knew I want what's best for Xiao Guang,

20
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,479
but I get too involved with everything.

21
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,759
I control everything and restrain him.

22
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,759
He needs space to grow.

23
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,159
You even said...

24
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,000
that he should have a normal childhood.

25
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,960
Anyway,

26
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,919
your point was...

27
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:28,759
if he's unhappy,

28
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,680
it's meaningless no matter how long he lives.

29
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:36,199
You remember quite well.

30
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,370
Then do you think I'm right?

31
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,840
Well, it didn't feel good to hear it,

32
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:41,960
but it makes sense.

33
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,039
Just a little.

34
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,000
You should give Xiao Guang more space.

35
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,759
As long as it's safe,

36
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,240
let him grow up freely.

37
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,879
That's how he can live happily, right?

38
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:54,120
I'm his dad. I understand that very well.

39
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,800
That's good.

40
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:58,199
It's late. Get some rest.

41
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,840
You'll go bald if you stay up late too often.

42
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,400
Bye.

43
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,280
Hello?

44
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,080
Go bald?

45
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:26,919
You were right about Yu Ming Ming's issue.

46
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,800
She's just a child.

47
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,159
But she's also an individual.

48
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,080
She has the right to know what she's about to face...

49
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,439
and what has happened to her.

50
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,759
Dad, it's already so late.

51
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,360
What's wrong with you?

52
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,520
Why did you come to my room instead of sleeping?

53
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,840
Are you trying to scare me?

54
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,520
Yes.

55
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,039
I wanted to scare you.

56
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,480
But you found out.

57
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,050
Actually,

58
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,920
I wanted to apologize to you.

59
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,399
There's something...

60
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,120
I've been keeping from you for a long time.

61
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,079
Did you find a mom for me?

62
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,560
Don't be ridiculous.

63
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,639
Dad, no matter what you did wrong,

64
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,839
I'll forgive you.

65
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,120
Actually,

66
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,730
it's about your illness.

67
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:59,480
I didn't tell you the truth before.

68
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,680
Your illness...

69
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,399
It's thalassemia.

70
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,639
It's severe too.

71
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,680
I know.

72
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,800
I've done some research online.

73
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,439
I already knew it was incurable a long time ago.

74
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:20,759
The doctor said I would die when I was 3 and 6.

75
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,800
But Dad, look.

76
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,240
I'm eight years old now.

77
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,680
I'm still alive and well.

78
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:29,000
When did you find out?

79
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:30,680
When I was six.

80
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:37,040
Come on, Dad. It's no big deal.

81
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,680
If you feel sorry,

82
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,720
take me to the amusement park one more time.

83
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:44,399
You little brat.

84
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,519
Don't push your luck.

85
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,639
I knew you wouldn't give in so easily.

86
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:54,480
But Dad, I'm really happy.

87
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,319
You finally told me about this.

88
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,759
There are no more secrets between us now.

89
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,519
Are you hiding something else from me?

90
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:07,439
I finally don't have to pretend that I don't know.

91
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,040
You have no idea how hard it was to act dumb.

92
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,639
So you mean...

93
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:16,959
I should give you...

94
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,439
the Best Performance Award.

95
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,720
Of course.

96
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
That's correct.

97
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,759
One more thing, Dad.

98
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,399
How did you finally come around?

99
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,279
Who made an iron tree like you bloom at last?

100
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:34,399
Who did you learn your idioms from?

101
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,759
Who are you calling an iron tree?

102
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:38,519
Are you the flower on the tree?

103
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,639
I'm not the flower.

104
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,839
Ms. Xiao is the flower.

105
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,040
Come, let me hug you.

106
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,160
Hello?

107
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,360
I told Xiao Guang everything just now.

108
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,959
I was quite surprised.

109
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:38,120
Are you free now?

110
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,240
Let's meet and talk.

111
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:47,360
Hello, what would you like to drink?

112
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,319
- A cup of coffee, please. - Okay, please wait a moment.

113
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,480
What did Xiao Guang say?

114
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,360
He told me...

115
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,519
that he knew about his condition a long time ago.

116
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,959
He had been acting in front of me all these years.

117
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,839
That makes sense.

118
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,040
Xiao Guang is a smart kid.

119
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,079
It's hard to hide it from him.

120
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:17,279
There's something we doctors in the ER always say.

121
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:18,959
A doctor is also a patient's family member...

122
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,399
once he takes off his gown.

123
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:23,480
So regarding Xiao Guang's matter,

124
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,439
I understand your reasoning.

125
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,120
Thank you.

126
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:32,039
Previously, the two of us argued...

127
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,330
about Yu Ming Ming's treatment.

128
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,480
At that time,

129
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,399
I actually kept thinking...

130
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:39,120
whether I should tell Xiao Guang the truth or not.

131
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:41,519
Hello, miss. This is your coffee.

132
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:46,799
But when you're facing your own family,

133
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:49,519
it's really hard.

134
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,000
On the way here, I kept thinking.

135
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,480
Xiao Guang and I have been living together for so many years.

136
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:03,000
I've always thought that we were very close...

137
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,039
and we had no issues between us.

138
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,159
Little did I know,

139
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:10,090
being overprotective actually gave him more pressure.

140
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,639
The way I see it,

141
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,210
Xiao Guang is such a kind kid.

142
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,720
When he was playing along with you,

143
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,039
I'm sure he was also very happy.

144
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,559
You just need to talk it out.

145
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:45,210
If you like Xiao Guang so much,

146
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,279
why have you never asked me about his mom?

147
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,679
Why should I ask about that?

148
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,159
Everyone has their own secrets that they don't want to talk about.

149
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,279
You'll tell me when you want to.

150
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,399
Actually, Xiao Guang is my brother and sister-in-law's child.

151
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:07,360
He was born with a severe case of thalassemia.

152
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:11,279
Sometimes, I wonder...

153
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,519
why his fate is so cruel.

154
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,879
When he was two years old,

155
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,090
my brother and his wife passed away in a car accident.

156
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,450
Since that day,

157
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,960
I've been raising him as my own son.

158
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:28,919
When he was six,

159
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,840
his condition worsened...

160
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,519
and he almost didn't make it.

161
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:37,360
But he's a strong kid.

162
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:39,120
He has been hanging in there until now.

163
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:47,879
I...

164
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,480
I believe that everything will turn out fine.

165
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,090
This is also something we must learn from Xiao Guang.

166
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:57,759
No matter what happens,

167
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,840
he faces it all with such a positive attitude.

168
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,840
Thank you for telling me about Xiao Guang.

169
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:07,840
Since you know one of my secrets now,

170
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,120
shouldn't you...

171
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,799
tell me one in exchange too?

172
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:24,639
I'll...

173
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,000
tell you when there's a chance.

174
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:28,399
Cheers.

175
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:31,639
Thank you for the coffee, Dr. Bai.

176
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:47,639
Excuse us.

177
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:48,720
Please make way.

178
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:49,960
Excuse us.

179
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:51,840
Move aside.

180
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,879
The patient is a female. She's 43 years old.

181
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:56,960
She fainted in her home.

182
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,399
She's unconscious and has a high fever.

183
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,440
Her neck is stiff.

184
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:04,360
She's unconscious and has a high fever.

185
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,720
Her central nervous system could be infected.

186
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,399
We should request meropenem for the patient.

187
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,480
Take her to the EICU...

188
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:11,039
and have a neurologist come for consultation.

189
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,480
Okay.

190
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:18,080
We can't wait for the guardian.

191
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,200
We need to do a lumbar puncture...

192
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,240
for a definitive diagnosis as soon as possible.

193
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,519
Report it to the medical office.

194
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,639
Thank you.

195
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,279
Dr. Xiao.

196
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,240
How is it?

197
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,960
The report shows a low possibility of a CNS infection.

198
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,279
What about the other tests?

199
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,320
Are there any abnormalities?

200
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,240
The blood test shows high levels of C-reactive protein.

201
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,320
Her liver and kidney functions are not bad.

202
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,120
According to her chest and abdomen CT scan,

203
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:42,320
there's leakage in the perirenal space.

204
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:43,960
So it's still an infectious disease,

205
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,720
but the infected area is unknown.

206
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:54,559
Her respiration rate and heart rate have increased.

207
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:56,720
The respiration rate is 30 and the heart rate is 130bpm.

208
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,360
The blood pressure is 80 over 40.

209
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,039
The patient is experiencing chills.

210
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,840
It's septic shock.

211
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,879
The source of the infection may be the urinary system.

212
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:04,919
Ms. Jiang.

213
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,840
I need 1,000ml of saline solution.

214
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,120
- Go and get it. - Okay.

215
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,879
- What about her blood oxygen? - It's 85 percent.

216
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:13,279
Dial up the oxygen flow meter to 5L per minute.

217
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,759
Both lungs sound low-pitched.

218
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,519
Moist rales can be heard.

219
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,840
The patient may also have acute respiratory distress syndrome.

220
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,840
Tang Hua.

221
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:28,399
Run a blood gas analysis on her.

222
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,799
- Okay. - Ms. Jiang.

223
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:30,840
Prepare for intubation.

224
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,840
Okay.

225
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:37,720
Sorry. The subscriber you dialed cannot be reached.

226
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,600
Sorry. The subscriber you dialed...

227
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,200
You still couldn't get in touch with Xu Han Wei's family?

228
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,279
No, Ms. Jiang.

229
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,600
I'm so anxious.

230
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,799
- Keep calling. - The subscriber you dialed...

231
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,679
Dr. Xiao. The test results are out.

232
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,080
Partial pressure of oxygen is 47mmHg.

233
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,519
The oxygen saturation is 81mmHg.

234
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:03,919
Thank goodness we intubated her right away.

235
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,399
Otherwise, the patient would've been in danger.

236
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,799
But the problem now...

237
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,240
is her illness is evolving too fast.

238
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,600
If it's sepsis caused by a urinary tract infection,

239
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,480
acute respiratory distress syndrome shouldn't develop this quickly.

240
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,679
Then where could the infection be?

241
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:25,200
Infective endocarditis?

242
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,480
Let's do another bedside ultrasound.

243
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,039
The ejection fraction is 50 percent.

244
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,600
I don't see any vegetation on the heart valves.

245
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,960
The overall activity is fine.

246
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:45,000
Then why?

247
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,320
What should we do next?

248
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:55,039
Let's run the biochemical tests again.

249
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,879
Check her brain natriuretic peptide levels and blood culture.

250
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,320
Take a partial blood sample...

251
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,559
and send it for next-generation sequencing.

252
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:10,879
Dr. Xiao.

253
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,879
Xu Han Wei's biochemical tests are done.

254
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,600
The results will be out in the afternoon.

255
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:16,039
You still haven't reached her family yet, have you?

256
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:17,279
Not yet.

257
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,559
It's probably due to the time difference.

258
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:19,879
No one has been picking up.

259
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:21,919
It was her neighbor who discovered that she fainted at home...

260
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:23,000
and brought her to the hospital.

261
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,080
According to her neighbor,

262
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,919
it seems her husband took their daughter abroad...

263
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:28,360
for a winter camp.

264
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,639
Xu Han Wei's company has been busy.

265
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:30,879
She couldn't get time off,

266
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:32,039
so she didn't go with them.

267
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,240
Who knew this would happen?

268
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,360
I hear the patient's condition is quite serious.

269
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,919
If she passes away,

270
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:40,639
they might not be able to see her for the last time.

271
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,080
Touch wood.

272
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,840
Can't you hope for the best?

273
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,600
Besides, with Dr. Xiao's medical skills,

274
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,600
I believe the patient will definitely make it through.

275
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,720
I believe in you, Xiao Yan.

276
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:58,240
Can't you say something too?

277
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,639
Do you have nothing better to do?

278
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:04,120
You're always taking sides.

279
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,440
Keep calling her family in the afternoon.

280
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:09,840
When the report comes out,

281
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:11,600
there will be things that we have to discuss with them.

282
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,679
Okay.

283
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,679
How are her vital signs?

284
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:22,320
Her blood pressure has been critical.

285
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:23,879
It's 92 over 65.

286
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:26,120
Her respiration rate is 30.

287
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,440
And her heart rate is 130bpm.

288
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,759
Her temperature is 39.2 degrees.

289
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:29,960
What about her blood oxygen?

290
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,600
Her blood oxygen has been sitting around 92 percent.

291
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,200
She's already intubated,

292
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,679
but her blood oxygen is still so low.

293
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,840
How about this?

294
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,039
Arrange a beside chest radiograph for her...

295
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,240
and do a blood gas analysis.

296
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,440
Okay.

297
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,410
The X-ray looks good.

298
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,799
There are no obvious signs of pneumonia or pulmonary edema.

299
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,279
The place where the tracheal intubation tube is...

300
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:10,359
looks fine too.

301
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,559
Arrange another bedside ultrasound.

302
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,599
Okay.

303
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,000
The cardiac muscle's overall activity is weak.

304
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:22,119
The entire heart is basically in peristalsis.

305
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:26,119
Her ejection fraction is only about 25 percent.

306
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,240
There are still no signs of vegetation.

307
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Dr. Xiao.

308
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:31,359
The test results are out.

309
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:35,119
The patient's inflammation levels are too high.

310
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,480
Her liver, kidney, and heart are progressively deteriorating.

311
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:45,599
The partial pressure of oxygen is still only 61mmHg.

312
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:48,359
This isn't good.

313
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,240
Her cardiac muscle is deteriorating too fast.

314
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,480
I don't think the ventilator alone can maintain oxygenation in her.

315
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,839
We need to call the Thoracic Department...

316
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,170
and a cardiac specialist...

317
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:59,240
to work together to perform extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

318
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:01,319
We need to discuss this with Dr. Lu.

319
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,599
Request third-line antibiotics for the patient.

320
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:05,599
Okay.

321
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:06,650
Look at this.

322
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:07,650
Dr. Lu.

323
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:10,960
We received a patient in the day today.

324
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:13,720
This patient is suffering multiple organ failure.

325
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:14,920
And worst of all,

326
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,519
she has severe myocardial suppression.

327
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:19,039
Septic shock and cardiogenic shock...

328
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:20,480
could cause the patient to go into cardiac arrest at any moment.

329
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,650
We want to put the patient on ECMO.

330
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:25,410
But we can't get in touch with the patient's family.

331
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:28,079
Before we connect the machine to the patient,

332
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:30,240
I think we need to explain the situation to her family...

333
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:31,650
and get their consent.

334
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:33,799
This patient has a very high chance of dying.

335
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:36,480
I think at this point, we should save the patient first.

336
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:38,039
But it's too expensive.

337
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,410
And this patient's condition is a special case.

338
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:44,079
The success rate of treatment is only 20 to 30 percent.

339
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,799
Whether the patient's family can bear such a high expense...

340
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:49,759
and the high risk is a problem.

341
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,240
Yes.

342
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,720
You're both right.

343
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,079
Let's do this.

344
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,720
Before we put the patient on ECMO,

345
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:59,359
we'll keep trying our best to contact the patient's family.

346
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:01,650
I'll submit a request to the hospital right away.

347
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,079
During this period of time,

348
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:06,839
try your best to maintain the patient's vital signs, okay?

349
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,279
- Okay. - Okay.

350
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,960
Dr. Xiao, we got in touch with the patient's family.

351
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:17,279
They've agreed to put her on ECMO first.

352
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,839
They also ask that we take a curative care approach.

353
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:21,759
- Let's begin. - Come on.

354
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:36,559
Dr. Xiao, it's ready.

355
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:38,119
Do a bedside ultrasound.

356
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:39,279
Okay.

357
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,410
Dr. Xiao.

358
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,650
The patient's ejection fraction is only 25 percent.

359
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,440
The patient's upper extremity temperature is too low.

360
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:05,680
ECMO can't maintain the blood supply to the patient's vital organs.

361
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,960
If we can't solve the blood supply problem,

362
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,119
it could cause upper extremity necrosis...

363
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:11,119
and brain damage.

364
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,839
The only thing the patient can rely on now...

365
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:16,279
is an intra-aortic balloon pump.

366
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,920
I'll consult with a cardiologist...

367
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:20,799
about performing bedside intra-aortic balloon pump therapy.

368
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,410
Ms. Jiang.

369
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:23,650
In the meantime,

370
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,650
the patient's platelets and hemoglobin...

371
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,319
will progressively decline.

372
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,480
If her blood supply isn't maintained,

373
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:32,039
the patient's risk of death may increase.

374
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:34,240
So you need to contact the blood bank.

375
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:35,680
You need to secure a supply of platelets,

376
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,240
red blood cell suspension, and other blood products.

377
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:39,759
I'm on it.

378
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Tang Hua.

379
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,920
During this time, monitor her invasive blood pressure,

380
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,799
ambulatory EEG, and her coagulation status.

381
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:46,839
Okay.

382
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:08,359
You've had a long day. Have a cup of coffee.

383
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:20,079
Thank you.

384
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:23,319
How is Xu Han Wei?

385
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,039
After we connected her to an ECMO,

386
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:29,000
we inserted an intra-aortic balloon pump in her aorta.

387
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:31,359
We've also contacted the blood bank.

388
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:32,720
She is stable for now.

389
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,170
By the way, according to Xu Yi Ran,

390
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,890
you contacted the patient's family whenever you had time today.

391
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,680
You were the one who reached them.

392
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:43,559
Thank you.

393
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:45,599
You're welcome.

394
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:54,880
This machine is called ECMO.

395
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:58,279
It pumps the blood from the patient's body,

396
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:00,240
which is then oxygenated by the machine...

397
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,720
and is pumped back into the patient's body.

398
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,720
Doctor.

399
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,000
My wife will wake up, right?

400
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,240
Don't worry.

401
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,440
The patient's condition is getting better.

402
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,880
If everything goes well,

403
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,400
we should be able to take her off the ECMO.

404
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:11,599
Thank you, doctor.

405
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:12,799
Thank you.

406
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:15,319
Thank you.

407
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:19,480
We did next-generation sequencing on the patient's blood sample.

408
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:22,400
E. coli and the human herpes virus was detected.

409
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,200
We think the urinary tract was the source...

410
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,599
of the E.coli infection,

411
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:29,799
leading to septic shock.

412
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,680
Moreover, this patient has long-term type 2 diabetes,

413
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:36,039
so her immune system is extremely weak.

414
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:38,000
Immunoparalysis activates the viruses...

415
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:41,920
lurking in tissues and cells,

416
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,839
such as the glands, ganglia, and B cells.

417
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:47,559
This caused an apparent infection,

418
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:49,680
leading to fulminant myocarditis...

419
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:51,160
induced by human herpesvirus.

420
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,759
It then triggered myocardial suppression.

421
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,599
We quickly gathered the Thoracic and Cardiac Departments...

422
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:56,799
to perform emergency surgery.

423
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,920
Eventually, the patient's vital signs recovered.

424
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:06,119
I heard...

425
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,279
Xiao Yan and Bai Zhu had an argument.

426
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:09,839
I wouldn't call it an argument.

427
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,599
Everyone just has different perspectives.

428
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:15,759
Xiao Yan felt that we should get the family's consent...

429
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:18,079
before performing ECMO.

430
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,680
But Bai Zhu felt...

431
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,759
that treating and saving the patient should come first.

432
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:22,839
But in the end,

433
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:24,599
the two of them came to an agreement...

434
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:25,839
and found a compromise.

435
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,440
I guess they found a common ground.

436
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,000
The two of them are becoming more and more in sync.

437
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:34,480
So with everyone's joint efforts,

438
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,359
we saved the patient's life.

439
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:40,599
The patient's family also expressed their gratitude to us.

440
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,839
They highly approved our treatment plan.

441
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,079
The two of them discussed Jiang Xian Yun's case the other day.

442
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,759
It stirred up a lot of emotions.

443
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,400
I heard he was lost for a while.

444
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,240
- Yes. - It's all right now.

445
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:57,359
He has thought things through...

446
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:58,640
and he knows how to put himself in other people's shoes.

447
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,640
This is a good start.

448
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,880
Dr. Lu.

449
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,279
Congratulations.

450
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:06,000
You got two formidable doctors.

451
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:08,960
It's all thanks to you, Dr. Jiang.

452
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:17,839
Mr. Jiang.

453
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:20,519
It has been raining for the past few days.

454
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:21,960
I know even if you don't tell me.

455
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,480
You must be uncomfortable.

456
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,160
It just so happens to be sunny today.

457
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,079
I'll take these bedsheets...

458
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:31,519
and your blanket...

459
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,319
and wash them for you.

460
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,880
When you sleep on clean sheets,

461
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:39,039
you'll surely feel comfortable.

462
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,160
When you're comfortable, you'll be in a good mood.

463
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,559
When you're in a good mood, you'll have a good appetite.

464
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:45,920
What do you want for lunch?

465
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:48,599
Mr. Jiang.

466
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:55,079
He fell asleep.

467
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:29,640
(Jiang Xian Yun)

468
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:57,359
Dr. Lu.

469
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,720
This is a letter...

470
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,480
that Mr. Jiang gave to me a long time ago.

471
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:04,640
He told me to give it to you...

472
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:06,400
when he is no longer around one day.

473
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,680
(To Dr. Lu Ping An)

474
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:33,559
- What's the situation? - The patient is 58 years old.

475
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,720
She suddenly felt chest pain and a shortness of breath...

476
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,960
when she was square dancing.

477
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:37,039
She couldn't breathe.

478
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:39,359
But her blood pressure, pulse, and breathing are normal.

479
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,440
Ma'am, can you hear me?

480
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,640
Yes.

481
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,400
Your breathing sounds normal too.

482
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,680
Why do you have chest pain and shortness of breath?

483
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:03,799
Ma'am, how long have you been feeling like you can't breathe?

484
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,119
- I... - Xu Yi Ran.

485
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,720
The result of the bacterial culture for bed seven is out.

486
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,559
- My goodness. - Mom.

487
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,039
- Mom? - Mom, what's wrong?

488
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:12,720
- Tang Hua. - What's wrong with my mom?

489
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,240
She suddenly felt chest pain and a shortness of breath...

490
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,240
when she was square dancing.

491
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,240
She couldn't breathe.

492
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,160
Did you examine her? What's the cause?

493
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,519
Don't worry. We're examining her right now.

494
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:20,519
She should be fine.

495
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:22,759
Why do you suddenly feel chest pain and shortness of breath?

496
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:25,200
Tang Hua, I don't know either.

497
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:27,359
It just happened.

498
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,039
Mrs. Tang, you'll be fine.

499
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:31,319
Tang Hua.

500
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:34,119
I suggest you bring your mom to get a thorough checkup.

501
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,039
Mom, let's go for a checkup now.

502
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:39,599
Her chest X-ray and ECG look fine.

503
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,680
The are no problems with her lungs or heart.

504
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:43,799
Dr. Xu.

505
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,599
- Tang Hua. - How is it?

506
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,359
Her blood test is normal. It's not anemia.

507
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,559
What could be wrong with her?

508
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,079
Mom.

509
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:53,960
Aside from the chest pain and shortness of breath,

510
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,279
do you feel any other discomfort?

511
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,160
I can't breathe.

512
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,799
My chest feels too tight.

513
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:04,200
I feel like I'm dying.

514
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,720
Mom.

515
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,119
Can you stop talking about dying?

516
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:09,200
We're examining you right now.

517
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:12,640
Should we check her BNP and D-dimer levels?

518
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,160
Okay.

519
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,519
Dr. Xu already told me.

520
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:20,400
The results of her BNP and D-dimer test will be out soon.

521
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,400
Mom.

522
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,359
Stop humming. Aren't you tired?

523
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,640
You'll be fine.

524
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:29,839
Dr. Tang.

525
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:31,039
Your patient is here for a follow-up.

526
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,400
Okay.

527
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,799
Tang Hua, you go ahead.

528
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,119
I'll take care of Mrs. Tang for you.

529
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,480
Mom.

530
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,039
I'll go and take a look first.

531
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:40,359
I'll be right back.

532
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,119
You're pretty much all recovered now.

533
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:45,640
I'll prescribe another course of medication for you.

534
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,680
Take them again when you get home.

535
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,039
After that, come back for another follow-up.

536
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:50,559
You should be fine after that.

537
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,720
Thank you, Dr. Tang.

538
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,599
All right. Go and get your medicine.

539
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,400
We have the test results.

540
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:03,559
Everything is normal.

541
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,079
Everything is fine,

542
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:09,480
but why does she have chest pain and shortness of breath?

543
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:11,279
Mrs. Tang is getting older now.

544
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:13,799
Having functional chest pain...

545
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,039
is normal.

546
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,319
Don't be too nervous.

547
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,680
Do you think my mom should undergo other checkups?

548
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,200
Young man.

549
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:29,599
How is Tang Hua's performance at work?

550
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:32,799
Is she getting along with everyone?

551
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,359
Don't worry, Mrs. Tang.

552
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,279
She gets along with everyone very well.

553
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,400
Mrs. Tang, I would like to ask you something.

554
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:41,279
What kind of men does Tang Hua like?

555
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,720
Tang Hua.

556
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,680
Chen Zhi, go out.

557
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:47,960
I'll be at the door then.

558
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,440
Call me if you need anything.

559
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,480
Don't worry about it.

560
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,200
Dr. Xu, what are you doing here?

561
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:06,920
Why are you out so soon?

562
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,839
You can spend more time with Mrs. Tang.

563
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:10,799
Go away. It's none of your business.

564
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,920
Chen Zhi is just trying to be nice.

565
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,720
Go back to work.

566
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:18,599
Okay.

567
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,920
You should get back to work too.

568
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,279
I'll take care of Mrs. Tang for you.

569
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:35,480
There's so much drama every day.

570
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:38,599
Mrs. Tang.

571
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,680
Are you feeling better now?

572
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,079
Here, have some water.

573
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,240
- Thank you. I feel much better. - Don't mention it.

574
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,640
Your surname is Xu. What was your name again?

575
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:49,319
Mrs. Tang, my name is Xu Yi Ran.

576
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,279
"Yi" as in number one, and "Ran" as in "then".

577
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,400
Just call me Xiao Xu.

578
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:53,960
Xiao Xu.

579
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,240
Xiao Xu, do you have a girlfriend?

580
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,200
Give me the medication record for bed five.

581
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,079
Tang Hua.

582
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,079
What's wrong with my mom?

583
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,920
Give me some water first.

584
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:11,519
What's wrong with my mom?

585
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,559
She's fine, but I'm not.

586
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,200
What's wrong with you?

587
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,680
Slow down.

588
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:21,160
In that short period of time,

589
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:26,160
your mom almost asked about my entire family tree.

590
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,400
If I didn't come out,

591
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,079
she probably would have found out about my dad's first love.

592
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,559
(Doctor's Office 3)

593
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:45,720
Are you all right now, Mom?

594
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,519
I'm fine now.

595
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,160
I'll get you a taxi.

596
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:51,119
Wait.

597
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,519
I have something to tell you.

598
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,720
Listen to me.

599
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:57,640
Okay, go ahead.

600
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,440
First, Dr. Lu doesn't really suit you.

601
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,799
Dr. Lu?

602
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:05,240
Mom, what are you thinking?

603
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,920
Calm down.

604
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:10,079
I have to start analyzing from the highest rank, right?

605
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,519
I've asked around about Dr. Lu.

606
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,559
He's a good person, steady, and down-to-earth.

607
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,519
He has quite a bright future.

608
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,359
But he has been married before.

609
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,480
He's also too old.

610
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,480
He's over 10 years older than you.

611
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,039
He's probably only a few years younger than me.

612
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,599
Dr. Lu is indeed a pretty good man.

613
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,960
You can consider him.

614
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,119
Do you want a spanking?

615
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,039
How can you joke about your own mom like that?

616
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,200
I think you're the one who's joking with me.

617
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,319
Dr. Lu really isn't suitable for you. Am I right?

618
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:38,359
He's divorced...

619
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:40,039
and he has a kid with his ex-wife.

620
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,480
It's unfair to you if you end up with him.

621
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,319
So I've eliminated him.

622
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:47,559
Gosh, thank you so much.

623
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:48,759
You're welcome.

624
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,799
Also, there's that Chen Zhi.

625
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,759
He's quite handsome,

626
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:55,920
but his family is too poor.

627
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:57,559
He can't even afford to buy his own place.

628
00:32:58,359 --> 00:32:59,759
He's also a bit slow-witted.

629
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,119
He's not very capable.

630
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,799
If you marry a man like him,

631
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,839
the rest of your life will be hopeless.

632
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:07,640
That's why I've eliminated him too.

633
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,119
Thank you again.

634
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,400
You're welcome again.

635
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:13,039
And Dr. Bai...

636
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,920
I didn't get to see him.

637
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,240
The inspection on him is pending.

638
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,640
Mom, your analysis today is especially accurate.

639
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:22,119
Now, I'll take your bag...

640
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:23,640
and send you home first. Come on.

641
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:25,039
There's no rush.

642
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,559
Here, have a seat.

643
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,599
Next,

644
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,160
we're going to talk about the biggest catch of the day.

645
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:36,119
Don't tell me you have your eye on Xu Yi Ran.

646
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,519
Our minds are in sync.

647
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,960
Xiao Xu is really great.

648
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,160
Mom.

649
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,200
Do you know what we call Xu Yi Ran?

650
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,599
A casanova. He's a playboy.

651
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,200
As long as you're a female...

652
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:51,599
from the age of 7 or 8 to the age of 70,

653
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,880
if you go over to him,

654
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,240
he'll run over immediately.

655
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,960
He'll ask you what you need and try to get friendly with you.

656
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,799
He's the last person you should have your eye on.

657
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,160
Don't try to fool me.

658
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:03,799
I've met enough people in my lifetime to know.

659
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:05,839
Xiao Xu is great.

660
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:08,809
He is handsome and nice.

661
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,360
He comes from a good family and he is well-liked.

662
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,239
His career is promising too.

663
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,719
Everything about him is great.

664
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:16,079
Mom.

665
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,329
I have something to do later.

666
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:18,719
I won't argue with you anymore.

667
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,639
Go home and rest.

668
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:21,809
I'm quite busy here.

669
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:23,289
Don't worry about other things.

670
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,360
I have my own plans.

671
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,599
I'll wait for you to finish work.

672
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,960
Chen Zhi.

673
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,360
Did you hear everything that my mom and I said just now?

674
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,360
I...

675
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,119
- What did you say? I just... - Stop pretending.

676
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,329
Regarding you,

677
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,000
I actually agree with my mom for once.

678
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,440
From now on, focus all your energy on work.

679
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,519
I believe you'll become a good doctor.

680
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,559
(Tongshan Hospital)

681
00:35:02,329 --> 00:35:03,360
- Here. - Thank you, Dr. Xu.

682
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,360
Goodbye.

683
00:35:22,769 --> 00:35:23,769
What's wrong?

684
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:25,769
Why are you looking at me like that?

685
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:31,119
What happened?

686
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:32,679
Dr. Xu.

687
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,809
Tang Hua's mom likes you.

688
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:36,679
She wants you to be her son-in-law.

689
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:38,199
She likes me?

690
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,360
Mrs. Tang has good taste.

691
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:46,199
But that's normal.

692
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,119
Dr. Xu, what do you mean by that?

693
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,440
Don't worry.

694
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,599
I don't have any feelings for Tang Hua at all.

695
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,599
But for your sake, I need to think...

696
00:35:58,809 --> 00:36:01,239
about how to make her mom completely give up on me.

697
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,599
Dr. Xu, what is it?

698
00:36:32,289 --> 00:36:33,329
Lin Zhi.

699
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:36,880
Have you ever dated anyone?

700
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:41,329
Dr. Xu.

701
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,199
What do you want?

702
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:47,239
Help me out.

703
00:37:02,289 --> 00:37:03,329
I'm afraid I can't do this.

704
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,519
I've never done this before.

705
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,039
It's okay. It's my first time too.

706
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:08,289
Why don't you consider someone else?

707
00:37:08,329 --> 00:37:09,440
No, you're the one.

708
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,480
I...

709
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,440
- Xiao Xu, you're here. - Mrs. Tang.

710
00:37:16,289 --> 00:37:17,639
I'm here to do some other checkups on you...

711
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:18,679
to see if I missed anything.

712
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:19,769
Have a seat.

713
00:37:19,769 --> 00:37:20,809
You're so thoughtful.

714
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,119
I'll take your blood pressure, okay?

715
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,199
Okay.

716
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:25,329
Lin Zhi, check Mrs. Tang's blood pressure.

717
00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:26,329
Okay.

718
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:27,440
Mrs. Tang, you have to take off your jacket first.

719
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,920
Okay. That's right.

720
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,000
Okay.

721
00:37:34,769 --> 00:37:36,039
Didn't I tell you to take Mrs. Tang's blood pressure?

722
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:37,239
Why are you coming to me?

723
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:41,159
I see that you're sweating.

724
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,440
I'm concerned about you.

725
00:37:44,809 --> 00:37:46,639
What are you doing? Mrs. Tang is here.

726
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,000
Take her blood pressure.

727
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:49,079
Okay.

728
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,039
Mrs. Tang, have a seat. It's okay.

729
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:53,289
I'll sit.

730
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:56,239
Mrs. Tang, I'm taking your blood pressure now.

731
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:57,329
Okay.

732
00:37:57,719 --> 00:37:58,769
Xiao Xu.

733
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:02,519
Does Ms. Lin work in the Emergency Department?

734
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,400
Yes, she works in our department too.

735
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,159
Why have I never seen her before?

736
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:08,719
She has always been here.

737
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,960
Ms. Lin.

738
00:38:12,769 --> 00:38:14,329
You're young and pretty.

739
00:38:16,289 --> 00:38:17,719
Mrs. Tang, your blood pressure is normal.

740
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,360
Thank you.

741
00:38:22,809 --> 00:38:23,809
Xiao Xu.

742
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,960
Come here.

743
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,440
Xiao Xu.

744
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,599
Tell me the truth.

745
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,119
Are you and Ms. Lin...

746
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,559
in a relationship?

747
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,400
No.

748
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,199
We have...

749
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:42,039
a pure work relationship.

750
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,239
You're not telling me the truth.

751
00:38:45,329 --> 00:38:47,519
You can't fool my sharp eyes.

752
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:51,480
Mrs. Tang, it's clear that you've been through everything.

753
00:38:51,769 --> 00:38:53,289
No one can hide anything from you.

754
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,289
I'll tell you the truth then.

755
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,039
Lin Zhi is my fiancée.

756
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,679
We're getting married.

757
00:39:03,289 --> 00:39:05,079
You're getting married?

758
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Yes.

759
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,480
I didn't hear anyone in your department say that.

760
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:14,719
We want to keep it a secret,

761
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:15,840
so we didn't tell anyone in the department.

762
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,289
It will be a surprise.

763
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,679
Mrs. Tang. You have to keep it a secret for us.

764
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:21,519
A secret...

765
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,199
I'll keep it a secret.

766
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:24,920
What a pity.

767
00:39:25,769 --> 00:39:26,880
What did you say, Mrs. Tang?

768
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,289
Nothing.

769
00:39:29,289 --> 00:39:31,440
I'm saying you have to cherish each other.

770
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,599
- Cherish each other. - We'll cherish each other.

771
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:35,880
Mrs. Tang, if there's nothing else, we'll get going.

772
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,000
Okay.

773
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:43,199
What a pity.

774
00:39:46,769 --> 00:39:48,440
She probably won't be interested in me now.

775
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,480
Dr. Xu.

776
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:51,639
Please don't ask me to do such a thing again.

777
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:53,119
It will be so embarrassing if others find out.

778
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:55,639
I'm just too popular with people's moms.

779
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,480
Dr. Xu, you're becoming more and more like Dr. Bai now.

780
00:39:58,519 --> 00:39:59,519
Stop.

781
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:01,400
You can say I'm like anyone but him.

782
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,159
I don't want to be hated.

783
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:18,809
The hot pot in front of you is almost overcooked.

784
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:20,119
Dr. Xu.

785
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:32,329
Every time you get upset about Tang Hua,

786
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:34,239
you look half-dead.

787
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,360
Can't you do something new?

788
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:38,559
Chen Zhi.

789
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:40,599
Dr. Xu.

790
00:40:40,769 --> 00:40:42,920
How can I make Tang Hua accept me?

791
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,039
Love can't be forced.

792
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,719
I told you a long time ago.

793
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,239
You two don't suit each other.

794
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,199
No one is born as a good match.

795
00:41:01,769 --> 00:41:04,559
We can become suitable as we spend more time together.

796
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:07,599
It's like how I couldn't eat spicy food before.

797
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,199
But after spending more time with you guys,

798
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,880
I can handle it now.

799
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,079
Why are all young people so stubborn?

800
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:56,119
They say...

801
00:41:56,119 --> 00:41:57,679
stubborn people don't turn back until they hit a wall.

802
00:41:58,289 --> 00:41:59,880
You've already hit the wall so many times.

803
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,199
Why won't you give up?

804
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:03,769
Is Tang Hua that charming?

805
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,079
Forget it.

806
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:08,769
You're already like this.

807
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:10,679
Hitting your head on the wall one more time won't hurt.

808
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,480
I'll give you some advice to save you from suffering.

809
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,000
Are you willing to help me, Dr. Xu?

810
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,039
I'm not helping you. I'm giving you advice.

811
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,559
I'll tell you about my experiences so you don't take the wrong path.

812
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:26,769
Do you know...

813
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,329
what's most important when it comes to pursuing girls?

814
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,440
Sincerity.

815
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,400
Everyone has that. No one cares.

816
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:36,289
Pursuing a girl...

817
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,519
takes skills.

818
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:41,239
But no matter how many methods there are,

819
00:42:42,039 --> 00:42:43,239
the principle is the same.
