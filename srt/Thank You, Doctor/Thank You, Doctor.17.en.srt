00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,878
(Thank You, Doctor)

(Adapted from Sheng Li's novel "ICU 48 Hours")

3
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,040
(Episode 17)

4
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,560
Dr. Xiao.

5
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,959
Can you do me a favor?

6
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,560
What's wrong?

7
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,200
A water pipe broke at my place.

8
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:43,079
I'm going back to open the door for the maintenance workers.

9
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:44,359
But Xian Yun...

10
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,120
You should go. I'll keep an eye on him.

11
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
If it's convenient,

12
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,280
can you talk to him for me?

13
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,000
I'll talk to him. Go.

14
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:55,879
Thank you.

15
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:03,799
Ms. Jiang looks a couple of years older.

16
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:28,759
It's hard to get a taxi at this hour.

17
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,759
I'll give you a ride.

18
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,039
Thank you, sir.

19
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,799
I happened to run into Tang Hua.

20
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,919
She said you were in a hurry.

21
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,800
So I thought it'd be faster if I give you a ride...

22
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,039
and you can come back early to take care of Xian Yun.

23
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:54,159
Thank you.

24
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,360
Don't mention it.

25
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:00,120
Don't overwork yourself.

26
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,360
Taking care of the patients is a long-term process.

27
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,039
You need to know how to adjust yourself.

28
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,158
Think about what will happen to Xian Yun...

29
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,159
if you collapse.

30
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,879
I'll take note of that.

31
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,360
By the way,

32
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:16,879
I've asked the cafeteria...

33
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,599
to take special care of you and Xian Yun.

34
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,198
Once the food is ready,

35
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,519
Chen Zhi will bring it to you.

36
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,400
- Sir. - All right.

37
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,840
Enough of the niceties.

38
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:27,719
The Emergency Department needs you.

39
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,879
Take care of yourself.

40
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:56,800
Mr. Jiang.

41
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,999
I'm Ms. Jiang's colleague.

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,039
My name is Xiao Yan.

43
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,919
Your water pipe broke,

44
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,159
so she went back to take care of it.

45
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,560
She asked me to take care of you.

46
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,360
You must be in a lot of pain.

47
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,800
Everyone told me not to die.

48
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,169
They told me to fight this illness...

49
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,240
and stay strong.

50
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,519
However, no one asked me...

51
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,839
if I'm in pain.

52
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:27,610
Humans are insignificant.

53
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:31,319
Especially in the face of pain caused by serious illnesses.

54
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,439
We're not you.

55
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,759
We can't imagine how much this hurts.

56
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,078
However, I'm sure you understand...

57
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:40,079
that everyone hopes...

58
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,000
you can pull it through.

59
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,079
So...

60
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,730
Are you also here to persuade me not to give up?

61
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,279
We only live once.

62
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,730
If you give up, you'll have nothing left.

63
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:57,199
Dr. Xiao.

64
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,000
Do you also think that I'm a coward?

65
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,679
I couldn't take the pain.

66
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,729
I took things too hard...

67
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,170
and I wanted to set myself free as soon as possible.

68
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,610
It's not easy for you to have persevered for so long.

69
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,480
Moreover,

70
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:11,800
I believe...

71
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,759
it was not an emotional decision...

72
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,399
when you decided not to receive an emergency rescue.

73
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,800
You must have thought about it for a long time.

74
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:24,240
You agreed with me?

75
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,170
I think...

76
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,959
everyone has the right to decide their own life.

77
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:35,000
I'll try to convey your thoughts to others,

78
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,199
but before that,

79
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:40,040
I hope you can hang in there a little longer...

80
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,399
and live well.

81
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,240
It's not only for yourself,

82
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,319
but also for Ms. Jiang.

83
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:59,519
Bai Zhu.

84
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,239
The chief asked us for a meeting.

85
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,398
What meeting?

86
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,079
I think it's about Ms. Jiang's husband.

87
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,560
His condition is stable now. What's there to discuss?

88
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,040
You'll know when you get there.

89
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,199
Sir.

90
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,399
All right, everyone is here.

91
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:19,160
Let's have a meeting.

92
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,758
I want everyone to talk...

93
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,319
about their views on Ms. Jiang's husband,

94
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,519
Mr. Jiang.

95
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,720
The patient's condition is more stable now.

96
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,120
What's there to discuss?

97
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,879
We're not talking about the patient's condition.

98
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,920
We're talking about the patient's request.

99
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,360
The patient's request?

100
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:38,000
The patient requested that we let him die.

101
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,199
Can we say yes?

102
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,800
The patient asked not to resuscitate him.

103
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,278
He didn't ask to let him die.

104
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,279
Does it make a difference?

105
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,000
Of course it makes a difference.

106
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,600
Fine.

107
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,240
I'll leave this meeting to you.

108
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,480
I'll leave.

109
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,480
Dr. Bai, I haven't said my opinion yet.

110
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,839
You're afraid that I'm right and you can't face it, right?

111
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,319
Okay, go ahead.

112
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,958
Whether it's from a humanitarian point of view...

113
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,518
or from a rational perspective,

114
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,360
we should all respect the patient's will.

115
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,959
The patient has terminal cancer.

116
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,040
He has multiple severe internal and external injuries.

117
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,160
His lower extremities are paralyzed.

118
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,480
The pain caused by the illness is beyond our imagination.

119
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,559
It's inhumane to let the patient live in pain...

120
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,639
without considering the patient's will.

121
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,399
So what you're saying is...

122
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,439
in the future, when a patient tells us...

123
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,199
that it hurts so much that he doesn't want to live,

124
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,559
we should give up on the treatment...

125
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,720
and let him die, right?

126
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,000
Respecting the patient's will...

127
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:52,000
is not about letting the patient make his own choice.

128
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,240
We're doctors. We should make our own judgments.

129
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,120
Last night,

130
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,959
something happened at Ms. Jiang's house.

131
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:04,839
She asked me to take care of the patient.

132
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,359
I can feel that...

133
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,480
he didn't make such a decision...

134
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:08,920
on impulse.

135
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:10,959
Instead, it's after much consideration.

136
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,040
Letting him live in pain like that...

137
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,079
is torture for both him and Ms. Jiang.

138
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,199
We can't relate to how hard it is for him,

139
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,839
but we should respect his choice.

140
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,039
It's the greatest respect for life.

141
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,198
He got carried away for a moment...

142
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,040
because he was in pain and he couldn't take it anymore.

143
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,600
But as doctors,

144
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,198
we can't give up the patient's life because of his moment of weakness.

145
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,279
Dr. Bai.

146
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,279
Choosing death doesn't mean he's weak.

147
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,480
Every life has its own value.

148
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:39,799
A patient who's about to die...

149
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:41,399
has the right to decide...

150
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,120
to live in pain...

151
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,450
or to die with dignity and value.

152
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:47,330
Dignity? Value?

153
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:48,879
In my opinion,

154
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:52,210
to be alive is the greatest dignity and value.

155
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:53,960
If that's not the case,

156
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:56,450
why did you try so hard to save Fang Nan back then?

157
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,399
You said it yourself.

158
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:01,879
Doctors are a bunch of people who race against death.

159
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,159
Sometimes, we win.

160
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,210
Sometimes, we lose.

161
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,240
Sometimes, we're doomed to fail.

162
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,039
However, we still have to do our best until the very end.

163
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:12,210
This is the best way to respect life.

164
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,480
But what are you doing now?

165
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:19,840
Standing at the starting line,

166
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,879
you surrender to death and admit defeat.

167
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,330
What a coward.

168
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,240
- What I said about... - That's enough.

169
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,360
I don't think we need to discuss this further.

170
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,600
Jiang Xian Yun is my patient.

171
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,038
I have the final say in his treatment.

172
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,639
- Dr. Bai. - Bai Zhu.

173
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:50,399
Xiao Yan.

174
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:54,000
About your argument just now,

175
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,279
I was very touched.

176
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,759
- I believe everyone... - Sir.

177
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:01,519
Let's say Jiang Xianyun is your patient.

178
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,039
What would you do?

179
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,450
My choice...

180
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,840
is probably the same as Bai Zhu.

181
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,559
What about you guys?

182
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:21,159
I think I'm the same as Dr. Bai.

183
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,330
I'm the same as them.

184
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,039
Me too.

185
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,240
Xiao Yan.

186
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,639
Maybe in your opinion,

187
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:37,559
staying alive and living are two different things.

188
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,120
But here,

189
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,330
there's an old saying.

190
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:43,360
It's called living is better than dying.

191
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,519
There's no right or wrong with these two choices.

192
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,359
It could be...

193
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,559
that the treatment concepts of East and West are different.

194
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,919
In traditional Chinese medical concepts,

195
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:54,840
keeping the patient alive...

196
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,919
is the most important thing.

197
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:59,119
There's one more thing.

198
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,480
We should also consider the will of the patient,

199
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,158
including his family.

200
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,159
Don't you agree?

201
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,600
You came back from abroad.

202
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,159
You've given us a lot of new perspectives.

203
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:08,679
- That's... - Sir.

204
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,440
Thank you for telling me all this.

205
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:12,960
However, I feel devastated right now.

206
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,679
It's not because you all can't accept my ideas.

207
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,480
It's just that I feel terrible...

208
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,480
thinking that Jiang Xianyun...

209
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:22,240
will continue to live in pain.

210
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:24,759
I'll get back to work.

211
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,320
Hello.

212
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,399
I'll be right there.

213
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,720
Don't move.

214
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,720
- Don't... - What happened?

215
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,398
He's pulling out all the tubes on his body.

216
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,440
Help me.

217
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,798
Restore venous access.

218
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:44,799
Infusion of 5mg Valium.

219
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:49,879
It could be a pneumothorax.

220
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,918
Prepare for closed chest drainage. Double-check the ultrasound.

221
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:53,960
Okay.

222
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,000
Dr. Bai.

223
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,079
What's going on?

224
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,518
What happened?

225
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:07,839
He pulled out all the tubes.

226
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,120
It could be a hemopneumothorax.

227
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,759
We need to do closed chest drainage now.

228
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:11,960
Xian Yun.

229
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:13,360
What are you doing?

230
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,799
Ms. Jiang, let's go out first.

231
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:17,759
Come in.

232
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,519
He's fine for now.

233
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,320
Xian Yun.

234
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,320
Ms. Jiang.

235
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:41,759
I'm not trying to criticize you,

236
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,720
but the patient is in such a condition...

237
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,320
and you shouldn't have left him alone.

238
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:47,480
Yes. I was careless.

239
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,759
No, it's my fault.

240
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,758
Ms. Jiang went to pay the bill and she asked me to look after him.

241
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:54,518
However, I was too busy taking another patient's temperature.

242
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:56,360
- I forgot about it. - All right.

243
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,240
I'm not trying to hold you responsible.

244
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,159
Fortunately, the patient is fine.

245
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,638
But you must never leave his side...

246
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:03,679
from now on.

247
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,120
I won't let him have any more problems.

248
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,479
Ms. Jiang, I'm sorry. I...

249
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,558
It's fine.

250
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:13,758
It's not your fault.

251
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:14,759
Get back to work.

252
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:27,440
I know you love your husband very much.

253
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:29,559
I also understand your feelings for each other.

254
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:31,360
However,

255
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,279
we're both professional medical staff after all.

256
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:34,960
So...

257
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,279
I know what you want to tell me.

258
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:40,919
Dr. Xiao.

259
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:42,679
I know...

260
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:45,240
you think of me as a friend.

261
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,679
That's why you're telling me this.

262
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,320
Yes.

263
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,399
We should know better than ordinary people...

264
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,679
how painful they are now.

265
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,120
In the end...

266
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,840
But I'm just an ordinary patient's family now.

267
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,720
I want my husband to live.

268
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:19,879
I'm fine.

269
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,879
Get back to work.

270
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,320
Dr. Xiao.

271
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,799
Are you sure you can watch the patient give up just like that?

272
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:15,720
For many patients,

273
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,159
this is also an option.

274
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,399
Before this,

275
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:27,359
I thought we were the same.

276
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,558
It's normal that we have different medical philosophies.

277
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:30,559
That's right.

278
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,398
It's different for everyone.

279
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,720
It's normal to have different philosophies.

280
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,038
But from now on,

281
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,840
please don't apply your ideas to me and my patients.

282
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:05,759
You're picking a fight with Xiao Yan again.

283
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,480
I saw you two getting closer some time ago.

284
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,039
I even thought you've come to your senses.

285
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,720
I didn't expect it to turn out this way again.

286
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,320
If we walk different paths, we can't work together.

287
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:25,799
Well, you don't have to do so.

288
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,399
After all,

289
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,759
it's just a difference in medical philosophies.

290
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,639
Just a difference in medical philosophies?

291
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:34,120
You were at the meeting, weren't you?

292
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:36,320
It's a human's life.

293
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:37,799
She's giving up a life.

294
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,879
Honestly, I agree with your decision.

295
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,879
But what Xiao Yan said is not wrong either.

296
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:49,798
From what I know,

297
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:50,799
many doctors abroad...

298
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,999
will make the same choice as Xiao Yan...

299
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,879
when encountering such a situation.

300
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,199
That's why the usage of feeding tubes overseas...

301
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,240
is much lesser than ours.

302
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:58,960
I don't care about overseas cases.

303
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,279
I don't care about others.

304
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,440
Anyway,

305
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:03,840
I won't give up on any patient.

306
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,799
But you didn't have to make things more difficult, right?

307
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,890
Both of you are the backbone of the EICU.

308
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,359
Conflicts will affect our work.

309
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,799
Do you really think you're Mom Lu?

310
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,319
Hey.

311
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:27,599
Hey.

312
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:39,039
The water is warm. Have a sip.

313
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,759
Let me rub your belly.

314
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,000
How is he?

315
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,319
Come to me if you have any questions.

316
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,279
Xian Yun.

317
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:36,920
Have some more water.

318
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:50,890
I heard...

319
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:52,799
Ms. Jiang's husband is in a bad mood.

320
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:55,919
No matter what Ms. Jiang says to him,

321
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,920
he doesn't respond.

322
00:18:57,519 --> 00:18:58,759
In the past, it was pain.

323
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:00,890
But now, his eyes are filled with hatred.

324
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:04,720
Ms. Jiang is having a really hard time.

325
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,118
I don't even know...

326
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:09,519
if Dr. Bai did the right thing by saving him.

327
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,319
I don't like Bai Zhu,

328
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:13,410
but this time,

329
00:19:13,411 --> 00:19:14,440
I think he did the right thing.

330
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,680
We can't just let him die.

331
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,920
Dr. Xiao.

332
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:21,798
About what you said earlier,

333
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:23,650
I can understand it rationally.

334
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,799
But emotionally, it's too hard.

335
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,889
Saving people is also a doctor's instinct.

336
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,999
Also, if he dies like this,

337
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,200
I feel so bad for Ms. Jiang.

338
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,960
A long time ago,

339
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:41,039
I talked to Ms. Jiang about this.

340
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:43,519
She said,

341
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:45,319
"To us,"

342
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,920
"life and death are never a matter of one person."

343
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:56,039
Stop thinking about it.

344
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,200
Let's eat.

345
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:30,890
Do you regret it?

346
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:34,890
I'll regret it if I don't save him.

347
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,799
Maybe Xiao Yan is right.

348
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,480
No one can relate to how hard it is for him.

349
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,200
His illness...

350
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,000
is torture...

351
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,519
to himself...

352
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,920
and to Ms. Jiang.

353
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,650
Dad.

354
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:15,920
I think you should get it checked.

355
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:18,410
You promised.

356
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:19,839
I'm here to get some medicine.

357
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,759
You're changing your mind now? I'll get going then.

358
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,000
Dad.

359
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:25,239
Look, we're already here.

360
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,278
Just listen to me.

361
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:27,890
Let's go for a checkup. All right?

362
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,409
I'm not sick.

363
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,559
Why should I go for a checkup?

364
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,758
I don't think you're sick either.

365
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:32,838
You don't think I'm sick?

366
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:34,078
Why did you bring me here for a checkup?

367
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:35,410
Are you very rich?

368
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:37,890
Isn't it just for peace of mind?

369
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:39,039
Think about it.

370
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,318
Once the test results are out,

371
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:42,279
I'll know that you're fine.

372
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:44,000
Isn't that a relief?

373
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:47,039
Let me tell you.

374
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,039
In this hospital,

375
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:50,199
even if you are not sick, they'll say you're sick.

376
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,720
Then it'll become a serious illness.

377
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:52,838
- That's enough. - Dad.

378
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:54,119
You're avoiding medical treatment.

379
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,799
You have to believe in doctors and science.

380
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,240
Believe in whom?

381
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:00,920
Doctors nowadays only care about money.

382
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:04,079
Dad, if that's the case,

383
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:05,720
I won't go to work anymore.

384
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,920
I'll follow you every day.

385
00:22:06,921 --> 00:22:08,519
Why would you follow me?

386
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:09,879
You should focus on your work.

387
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,079
You're my dad.

388
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,359
I can't let anything happen to you.

389
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:15,519
You don't want to get a checkup.

390
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,279
Then I'll have to follow you every day.

391
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:20,758
If something happens,

392
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:22,240
I can be there to take care of you in time.

393
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,400
It's up to you.

394
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,119
When your mom was alive,

395
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:27,559
she always said that I was stubborn.

396
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:29,118
I think you're more stubborn than I am.

397
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:30,400
You're as stubborn as a mule.

398
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:32,799
Fine. I'll go for a checkup.

399
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:36,720
Where do you feel unwell?

400
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,519
I feel fine anywhere.

401
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,880
Why don't you ask her?

402
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,598
I'm sorry, doctor.

403
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:43,599
Here's the thing.

404
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,118
In the past few months, my dad has been feeling nauseous.

405
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:47,839
Sometimes, he even vomits a lot.

406
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:51,480
Has he had a checkup before?

407
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:54,079
He had an examination in our hometown's hospital.

408
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:55,160
They said there was a stomach polyp.

409
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:56,920
Then he had surgery to remove the polyp.

410
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,640
After the surgery, he's still nauseous and vomiting...

411
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,519
and it's getting worse.

412
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:03,200
After removing the polyp,

413
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,799
I don't think it'll cause nausea and vomiting.

414
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,959
That's right.

415
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,400
That was why I brought him here for a checkup.

416
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,758
How about this?

417
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:11,239
I'll run a few tests on him.

418
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,279
Let's see how it goes.

419
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:14,599
I knew it.

420
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,559
We have to pay to check again.

421
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,680
There's so much to check.

422
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:21,519
You can't find anything and it cost money.

423
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,039
Here's the thing.

424
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,720
These tests are necessary.

425
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:28,799
We can only make the most accurate judgment...

426
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:31,119
through the test results.

427
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:33,599
- Fine. - Doctor, don't listen to my dad.

428
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:35,358
He's afraid of spending money.

429
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:36,879
Just run the tests.

430
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,919
I'll bring him there to get them done.

431
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,000
Okay.

432
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,920
I told you.

433
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:43,960
I'm not sick, am I?

434
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,200
But there are still some problems with several indicators.

435
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,920
For example, protein and blood sodium are relatively low.

436
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:51,359
Yes.

437
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,719
That's what the doctor said...

438
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,959
when we checked in the hospital...

439
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,200
in our hometown previously.

440
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:58,000
Low blood sodium may indeed cause nausea and vomiting.

441
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,160
What causes it?

442
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:02,440
There are many possibilities.

443
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:05,278
The most common one is problems in the liver and lungs.

444
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,279
Doctor.

445
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,318
My lungs and liver are fine.

446
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:09,399
There's nothing wrong with me.

447
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,519
Dad, listen to the doctor first.

448
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,480
Doctor, what happened to my dad?

449
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:15,839
Don't worry.

450
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,160
It's just an example.

451
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,839
Based on the test results, I don't see anything abnormal.

452
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,639
But just in case,

453
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,960
I suggest you get a thoracic and abdominal CT scan.

454
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,440
After all, CT scans are clearer.

455
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,359
I don't want to get CT scans.

456
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,119
I won't do the CT scans.

457
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,640
- Let me explain it to you. - Doctor.

458
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:32,680
There's radiation in the CT scan, right?

459
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:34,440
It causes cancer.

460
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:36,480
It's true that there's radiation in the CT scan.

461
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,680
But the examination time is short.

462
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,038
The radiation level is very low.

463
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:42,000
Even if it's low, it still has radiation.

464
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,640
At first, I wasn't sick.

465
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:45,720
What if I get sick after the scans?

466
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:46,838
Whose fault is this?

467
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:49,839
Hospitals all over the world use CT scans as routine inspection.

468
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,319
It's perfectly safe.

469
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:53,599
So you don't need to worry about that.

470
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:54,838
That's right, Dad.

471
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:55,879
Listen to the doctor.

472
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,039
Let's do a CT scan.

473
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,519
Isn't the test result showing that I'm all right?

474
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,118
Why do I need a CT scan?

475
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:02,278
I'll include it in the treatment plan first.

476
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:03,640
- Okay. - No, doctor.

477
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,160
Wait for a while. Don't waste your time.

478
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,558
Didn't you just want us to spend more money...

479
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:07,639
after all the hassle?

480
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,640
I'm not doing it.

481
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:09,880
I have things to do.

482
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,160
Dad.

483
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:15,079
Dad, don't go.

484
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:17,200
Your medical records.

485
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,719
I'm sorry, doctor.

486
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,799
Go get your dad.

487
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,999
If he still feels unwell, be sure to come back for a checkup.

488
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,079
Okay, thank you.

489
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,279
What are his symptoms?

490
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:29,960
He won't do a CT scan no matter what.

491
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:31,359
He has been nauseous and vomiting.

492
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,720
His protein and blood sodium are low.

493
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,519
Other tests found nothing.

494
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,319
You're still not feeling well?

495
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,440
Doctor.

496
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:47,440
My dad is still nauseous.

497
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:49,518
He throws up several times a day.

498
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:50,599
How about this?

499
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,480
Let's do the last tests again.

500
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:54,559
In addition, I still recommend...

501
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:56,479
doing a thoracic and abdominal CT scan.

502
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,598
I don't want a CT scan.

503
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:58,679
No.

504
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,720
Dad.

505
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:01,319
Stop calling me.

506
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,480
If you want me to live two more years,

507
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:05,279
then don't force me take the CT scan.

508
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,159
It's just a CT scan.

509
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,758
What's the big deal?

510
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:09,838
Who cares?

511
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:10,960
I don't want a CT scan.

512
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:14,558
Dr. Xu.

513
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:15,559
Dr. Xiao.

514
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:20,119
I think this gentleman's concern...

515
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:21,960
makes sense.

516
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,680
How about...

517
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:27,518
you do the other checkups...

518
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,039
and let the family pay first?

519
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:31,759
Okay, I'll do the other checkups first.

520
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:44,200
Come on, let's go pay the bill.

521
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,559
Let your dad stay here.

522
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,640
He'll wait for you.

523
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,680
Okay. Thank you, doctor.

524
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:50,920
Dad, wait for me.

525
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,279
Dr. Xu.

526
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:56,599
Get me some water.

527
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:58,359
Okay.

528
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:03,400
Doctor.

529
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,799
Don't you also want me to get a CT scan?

530
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,279
I can tell...

531
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:10,879
- Thank you. - It's not like...

532
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,440
you don't have any medical knowledge.

533
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,359
You actually know it well whether a CT scan...

534
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:16,759
is harmful to your body...

535
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,480
and how harmful it is.

536
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,000
You don't want to do the CT scan.

537
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,039
You have your reasons, right?

538
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,440
I'll tell you this then.

539
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,359
I don't think you should hide it from us doctors...

540
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,240
from all perspectives.

541
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,440
Think about it.

542
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:34,079
We don't know anything.

543
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,199
You keep coming to the hospital.

544
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,920
You're doing the same checkups over and over again.

545
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:39,920
It's a waste of money and time.

546
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,240
It's meaningless.

547
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:42,358
She's right.

548
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:43,960
I don't even dare prescribe medicine for you.

549
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:48,200
Doctor.

550
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:51,799
I'm not...

551
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:54,039
an unreasonable man.

552
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:58,200
What you just said makes sense.

553
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,200
If I tell you this,

554
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,440
can you keep it a secret?

555
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,879
Don't worry.

556
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,759
We will respect your wishes.

557
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:16,079
Well,

558
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,960
I have terminal lung cancer.

559
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:23,400
So it's the substances...

560
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,119
secreted by the lung cancer tumor body...

561
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,240
that causes the decline in blood sodium and protein.

562
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,680
Low blood sodium...

563
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,920
makes you feel sick and want to vomit.

564
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,039
I know.

565
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,319
Just take a CT scan and you could tell.

566
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:36,720
Your daughter doesn't know about it.

567
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,319
I didn't tell her.

568
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:41,199
That's a serious illness.

569
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,559
She'll find out sooner or later.

570
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:44,440
She'll find out as long as she can.

571
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,559
That's all the more reason for you to tell her.

572
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:48,160
I can't tell her.

573
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,640
I only have one daughter.

574
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,920
Her mom passed away when she was young.

575
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,039
She's always been sensible.

576
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:58,680
She's very filial.

577
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:00,960
We're not locals.

578
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:03,319
We're not well-off.

579
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:05,440
After my daughter graduated from college,

580
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,440
she stayed in Shanghai to work.

581
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,599
It wasn't easy for her to save this much money.

582
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:11,160
Look.

583
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:12,440
She's almost 30.

584
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,519
She's so busy that she doesn't even have time to date.

585
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:18,000
If she knows I have lung cancer,

586
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,240
she'll definitely try her best to treat me.

587
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:21,920
Doctor, as you know,

588
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:25,519
terminal lung cancer is incurable.

589
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:27,920
By then, all the money will be gone...

590
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
and I'll be gone too.

591
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,920
What about my daughter?

592
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,559
Instead of spending the money on this hopeless illness,

593
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,960
I might as well...

594
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:41,960
let my daughter save the money to buy a small house...

595
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:43,519
and marry a good guy.

596
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:46,480
At least, she'll have someone to rely on.

597
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:49,319
I understand how you feel,

598
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,079
but you need to be treated.

599
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:52,960
You can't give up just like this.

600
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:54,799
I can't be cured anyway.

601
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:57,599
What's the point of spending money?

602
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,119
That's my daughter's...

603
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:04,240
hard-earned money.

604
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,759
Nevertheless,

605
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:09,359
I still suggest you get a CT scan...

606
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:12,359
and a series of lung cancer-related tests.

607
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:13,599
Don't worry.

608
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:15,479
We'll respect your wishes.

609
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,039
We won't tell your daughter about this.

610
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:19,639
We just want to make sure.

611
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,200
Because even if it's lung cancer,

612
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,039
there's a possibility of misdiagnosis.

613
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,720
Yes.

614
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,920
Let's check again.

615
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:27,279
It could be a misdiagnosis.

616
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,039
All right.

617
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:32,799
Come here in the afternoon.

618
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,039
We'll arrange the tests for you.

619
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,038
They are the most effective indicators...

620
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,200
to diagnose lung cancer.

621
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:39,518
It won't cost much.

622
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:41,279
I'll do as you say.

623
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:43,960
I'll check again.

624
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,039
The bill has been paid, doctor.

625
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,559
Dad. Let's go for a check-up.

626
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:54,799
Remember.

627
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:56,399
Don't forget what the doctor said.

628
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,440
Okay.

629
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,200
Doctor.

630
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:04,119
Thank you.

631
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,440
Dad.

632
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:17,039
What did the doctor say?

633
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,200
As usual,

634
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:22,559
they told me to watch my diet.

635
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,279
I'm sure there are a lot of people doing tests there.

636
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,440
Let's go.

637
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,119
Whenever I'm in a situation like this,

638
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:33,558
I don't know if I should...

639
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:34,599
persuade the patient to continue the treatment.

640
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,559
What if the money is spent and the patient dies?

641
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,359
Is that the right thing to do?

642
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,798
We're doctors.

643
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:42,919
We just need to be more insistent.

644
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,960
Do your best to save the patient's life...

645
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,239
while respecting the patient's wishes...

646
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,839
as much as possible.

647
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:48,439
In fact,

648
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,960
I think the choice of this old man...

649
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:51,439
is no different from the choice...

650
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,440
of Ms. Jiang's husband.

651
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,319
No. I think there's a difference.

652
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:55,680
Tell me about it.

653
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:58,680
This old man chose not to get unnecessary treatments,

654
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,519
while Ms. Jiang's husband chose not to resuscitate.

655
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:04,479
Doctors might be able to accept a patient...

656
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,879
who has no chance of survival to not be treated,

657
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,839
but it's hard to watch a patient die without rescuing him.

658
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,200
Rationally, they are no different.

659
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:15,519
But the problem is humans are never rational animals.

660
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:18,200
It's always emotions and instincts that have the upper hand.

661
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,640
Doctors are humans too.

662
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:23,920
After all, we have undergone many years of professional training.

663
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:26,279
We have to be rational.

664
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:29,279
Why are we discussing such a serious question?

665
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,959
Right.

666
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,039
How did you figure out that old man has a story to tell?

667
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,598
That's normal.

668
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:36,079
Behind one's stubbornness,

669
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,480
I'm sure they all have skeletons in their closets.

670
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,359
Bai Zhu is a typical example.

671
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,640
You're so insistent on your philosophies.

672
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,720
Is there a reason too?

673
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,440
When that old man comes this afternoon,

674
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:51,839
please let me know.

675
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,640
All right.

676
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:15,119
Doctor.

677
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,559
How is it?

678
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,559
You have hairy, glass-like nodes in both your lungs.

679
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,680
Your mediastinal lymph nodes are enlarged.

680
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,440
It's basically certain that it's lung cancer.

681
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I'm sorry.

682
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:35,839
The diagnosis of your local hospital is very accurate.

683
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,599
This is fate.

684
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:41,880
But doctor,

685
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,599
I have to thank you.

686
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,599
Let us prescribe you some medicine.

687
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,240
There's no need.

688
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,799
This can't be cured.

689
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,440
I don't want to waste the money.

690
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:55,240
I only prescribed you cheap medicine.

691
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:56,639
It's not very effective,

692
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,079
but it can relieve the pain.

693
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:00,759
Well, I appreciate it.

694
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,960
Thank you.

695
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:12,679
Sometimes,

696
00:34:13,329 --> 00:34:14,360
when it hurts,

697
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,639
I feel like dying.

698
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,920
Give it to me.

699
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,288
Let's go.

700
00:34:20,289 --> 00:34:22,039
I'll pay the bill with you and get the medicine.

701
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,960
Thank you.

702
00:34:25,769 --> 00:34:26,840
Doctor.

703
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:28,679
Thank you.

704
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,480
You can take the medicine according to the manual.

705
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:42,079
Come back if you don't feel well.

706
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,079
Thank you, doctor.

707
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,769
The doctors here...

708
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,400
- are all good people. - Dad.

709
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:51,519
Why did you come to the hospital alone?

710
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,999
Aren't you busy?

711
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,078
I'm done with the checkup in the morning.

712
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,198
There's something I don't understand,

713
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,360
so I came to ask the doctor.

714
00:34:57,079 --> 00:34:58,198
Didn't the doctor say...

715
00:34:58,199 --> 00:34:59,518
you're low on protein and blood sodium?

716
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:00,769
Was there anything abnormal?

717
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,159
What don't you understand?

718
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:04,559
Well...

719
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:06,960
Here's the thing.

720
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:10,840
There are many reasons for low protein and blood sodium.

721
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:14,639
Your dad doesn't know, so he came to me for advice.

722
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,079
What are the reasons, doctor?

723
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,118
Some people are just born with it.

724
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:21,440
Their protein and blood sodium are low.

725
00:35:21,809 --> 00:35:23,479
I think that's what happened to your dad.

726
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,480
It's nothing serious.

727
00:35:24,769 --> 00:35:26,809
What medicine did you prescribe my dad?

728
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:30,559
It's mainly for nausea and vomiting.

729
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:31,769
There's also medicine for hyponatremia.

730
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:33,598
Dad.

731
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:34,678
You can ask me...

732
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:36,079
to come to the hospital with you in the future.

733
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:37,839
You're out of breath after just a few steps.

734
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,399
It's not safe to do it alone.

735
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,400
All right, my dear.

736
00:35:40,401 --> 00:35:41,480
I got it.

737
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,639
(Emergency Department)

738
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,559
His condition is stable now.

739
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,039
But he's still not cooperating.

740
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:21,239
He won't talk either.

741
00:36:22,289 --> 00:36:23,519
I don't know what to do with him.

742
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,719
Hey, this is my car.

743
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:51,809
I'm having my car washed. I'll hitch a ride.

744
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:53,119
Don't you know how to take a taxi?

745
00:36:53,329 --> 00:36:54,399
Your house is so far away.

746
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,400
I'll need to take a detour.

747
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:56,719
Stop it, please.

748
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,000
Let's go.

749
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:15,119
Say what you want to say.

750
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:18,880
I don't have anything to say.

751
00:37:19,329 --> 00:37:20,400
What do I have to say?

752
00:37:30,809 --> 00:37:31,840
Well,

753
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,079
Dr. Xiao and I took a patient.

754
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:36,559
He's an old man.

755
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,518
He has terminal lung cancer...

756
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:39,599
and he's keeping it from his daughter.

757
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:43,079
He doesn't want her daughter to spend money on his treatment.

758
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:45,400
He can't be cured.

759
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,920
He doesn't want to be a burden to his daughter.

760
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:52,199
Dr. Xiao and I think that we should respect his opinion.

761
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:55,360
We didn't tell his daughter about his condition.

762
00:37:56,809 --> 00:37:58,440
I think Dr. Xiao is right.

763
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:02,119
We have undergone many years of professional training.

764
00:38:02,809 --> 00:38:04,809
We should try to be rational...

765
00:38:05,809 --> 00:38:08,289
and not let our instincts and emotions take over our heads.

766
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:13,480
Are you...

767
00:38:14,289 --> 00:38:15,880
betraying us?

768
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,289
I don't want you to suffer.

769
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:24,118
Ms. Jiang's husband whines day and night.

770
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:25,119
He's in so much pain.

771
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:27,360
It's hard for anyone to watch.

772
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,719
It's even harder for Ms. Jiang.

773
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:32,119
But in my opinion,

774
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:34,480
you're the one who suffers the most.

775
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:37,199
You saved him...

776
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,329
so that he could avoid the pain of death.

777
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:42,639
But now, you made him suffer even more.

778
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,159
That's not what you want.

779
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,880
It's also something you can't accept.

780
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:47,809
You did nothing wrong,

781
00:38:48,329 --> 00:38:50,329
but your patient is in more pain and despair.

782
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:53,808
That's why...

783
00:38:53,809 --> 00:38:55,039
I think you feel bad more than anyone else.

784
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,880
I didn't do anything wrong,

785
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,480
so I don't feel bad.

786
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,198
Facing your pain head-on doesn't make you weak.

787
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:08,440
But it does let some people take advantage of it.

788
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:11,400
Are you having persecutory delusions?

789
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Ms. Jiang.

790
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:35,679
Xian Yun is asleep?

791
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:37,239
Why are you here?

792
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,400
I really want to sleep like this forever.

793
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:44,639
Here's the thing.

794
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,360
My relative from the countryside...

795
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,809
gave me some bitter gourd he grew himself.

796
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:50,329
They are green and pollution-free.

797
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,328
I'll send them to the cafeteria...

798
00:39:52,329 --> 00:39:54,158
and ask them to make some for Xian Yun every day.

799
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,199
Thank you, sir.

800
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:56,808
I'm dying,

801
00:39:56,809 --> 00:39:58,329
but I still have to suffer every day.

802
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:06,159
Well, if Xian Yun doesn't want to eat it,

803
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:08,000
I'll tell them not to cook it.

804
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:09,919
No, sir.

805
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,999
That's what Xiao Bai said.

806
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,360
He needs to eat something cool.

807
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:13,639
Thank you.

808
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,960
You're welcome.

809
00:40:15,809 --> 00:40:17,000
I'll get going then.

810
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,880
Take me for example.

811
00:40:48,881 --> 00:40:50,519
When I was working as a rescuer without borders,

812
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,920
I remember the medical conditions were very bad.

813
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,238
We often encountered problems...

814
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:57,288
when the equipment was not in place...

815
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:58,919
and we couldn't do anything about it.

816
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,399
For patients...

817
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,400
Dad.

818
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,400
You're on TV.

819
00:41:02,401 --> 00:41:03,439
Come here.

820
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,329
There's also Ms. Xiao Yan.

821
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:06,679
You...

822
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:08,359
Come on, Dad.

823
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,480
Get over here.

824
00:41:10,329 --> 00:41:12,839
But they have the most advanced equipment in the world.

825
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,769
The best treatment can be given to the patients right away.

826
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:17,198
I also hope that I can spread it...

827
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:18,288
to the entire Shanghai...

828
00:41:18,289 --> 00:41:19,328
and even the whole country...

829
00:41:19,329 --> 00:41:20,960
through the EICU of Tongshan Hospital.

830
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:24,880
Dad, why does your face look so big on TV?

831
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,679
Can't you talk nicely?

832
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,559
The TV uses a 16 to 9 aspect ratio.

833
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,840
If you're on it, your face will be bigger than mine.

834
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,960
You're lying.

835
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:36,400
Ms. Xiao Yan looks good on TV.

836
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,598
The most common cases are severe lung infection,

837
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:40,678
acute exacerbation...

838
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:41,679
of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,

839
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,768
pulmonary embolism,

840
00:41:42,769 --> 00:41:43,880
and thrombosis.

841
00:41:44,289 --> 00:41:45,480
Various peripheral nerves and muscles...

842
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,440
As for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction,

843
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:49,598
a temporary installation is required.

844
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,879
Dr. Xiao. You look so good on TV.

845
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,559
Both you and Dr. Bai could be in an idol drama.

846
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,960
A sad love story.

847
00:41:56,329 --> 00:41:57,718
That's a good idea, Lin Zhi.

848
00:41:57,719 --> 00:41:58,769
Yes.

849
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,198
It's time for rounds.

850
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:01,199
Don't talk nonsense.

851
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:02,639
That's not necessarily nonsense.

852
00:42:02,769 --> 00:42:03,840
What nonsense?

853
00:42:04,809 --> 00:42:05,880
An idol drama.

854
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:07,289
It's a sad love story.

855
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,559
What drama are you talking about?

856
00:42:09,769 --> 00:42:10,769
Let's go for a house call.

857
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:13,039
Your book is upside down. Here, keep this.

858
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,079
Dr. Bai.

859
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:26,239
You did well on the show.

860
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,158
You're not that bad yourself.

861
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:30,480
You lived up to my expectations.

862
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:34,559
Bai Zhu.

863
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:38,880
Ms. Jiang's husband wants to talk to you.

864
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:40,198
What's there to talk about?

865
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:41,559
I won't agree to it anyway.

866
00:42:41,769 --> 00:42:43,199
He said it's not what we talked about last time.

867
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:45,000
You should come.
