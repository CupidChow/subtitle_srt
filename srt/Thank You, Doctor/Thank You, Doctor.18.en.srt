1
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,399
(Thank You, Doctor)

2
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,000
(Adapted from Sheng Li's novel "ICU 48 Hours")

3
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,000
(Episode 18)

4
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,120
Xian Yun.

5
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,280
I invited Dr. Bai here for you.

6
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,599
I'll let you two talk.

7
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,400
You should also step outside.

8
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,920
Don't worry.

9
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,519
He's probably not in a good mood now.

10
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,760
Talk to him again when he feels better.

11
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,810
Chen Zhi said he brought you food, but you didn't eat.

12
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,919
You can't be like this.

13
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,879
If you can't hold yourself together,

14
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,439
how can you look after Xian Yun?

15
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,919
I don't have an appetite.

16
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,400
Have you forgotten what we always remind the patients?

17
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:21,960
Even without any appetite,

18
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:25,319
you still have to eat.

19
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,530
Am I right?

20
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:27,840
I'm worried about Xian Yun.

21
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:30,919
He doesn't even say much to me in a day.

22
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:33,530
He's keeping it all bottled up.

23
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,159
Dr. Bai.

24
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:36,919
Don't be nervous.

25
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:38,919
I don't want to die now.

26
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:42,639
Tell me.

27
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,479
I don't want much.

28
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:46,919
Just one million yuan.

29
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,199
I know that a million yuan...

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,199
isn't a big deal for Tongshan Hospital.

31
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:57,560
First of all,

32
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,240
I can't make this decision on behalf of the hospital.

33
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,639
Secondly,

34
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:04,400
even if I could, I wouldn't agree to it.

35
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,479
When we were trying to save you,

36
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,599
be it me or Tongshan Hospital's Emergency Department,

37
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,000
we made no mistakes.

38
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:12,280
So you won't be compensated.

39
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,080
You didn't make any mistakes?

40
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,400
Didn't Mr. Pan tell you not to save me?

41
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,039
But you still insisted on resuscitating me.

42
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,360
I have terminal pancreatic cancer.

43
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,158
I have pains from cancer, fractures,

44
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,319
and massive bleeding from falling from height.

45
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,400
I'm better off dead.

46
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,840
And you said you didn't do anything wrong.

47
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,719
If you insist that we're at fault,

48
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:39,159
you can apply for medical malpractice investigation.

49
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,360
I'll cooperate with the investigation.

50
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:42,759
But I still have to tell you.

51
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,759
I have a clear conscience.

52
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:45,960
Let me ask you one thing.

53
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:49,120
Seeing how I live until now,

54
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,438
do you still think that saving my life back then...

55
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,439
was the only option?

56
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,879
- Of course... - You don't have to answer.

57
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:00,039
I can already see you hesitating.

58
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,159
- I didn't hesitate. - You don't have to explain.

59
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,719
You hesitated.

60
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,199
That means...

61
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,360
you already understand how I feel.

62
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,610
Get some rest.

63
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,319
What did he say?

64
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,360
He still thinks I shouldn't have saved him.

65
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,680
He wants compensation.

66
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,759
Compensation?

67
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,240
What compensation?

68
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,610
One million yuan.

69
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
I didn't agree with it.

70
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,199
Hang on.

71
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:41,730
Get back to work.

72
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,170
Leave this to me.

73
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,680
What is he thinking?

74
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,680
Xian Yun.

75
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:56,879
What did you tell Dr. Bai?

76
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:58,519
Nothing much.

77
00:04:58,879 --> 00:04:59,879
I just want some money.

78
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,920
I know this is your department.

79
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,399
But that's a different matter.

80
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:04,959
I must have this money.

81
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,278
Dr. Bai saved you.

82
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:08,438
- Why are you asking him for money? - All right, stop talking. Sit down.

83
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:10,800
Ms. Jiang. Calm down and have a seat.

84
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,399
I'll have a talk with Xian Yun.

85
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,240
Xian Yun.

86
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:21,519
There are regulations for medical malpractice compensation.

87
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,199
The Medical Malpractice Committee...

88
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,730
has to first determine it as malpractice.

89
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,920
With the approval of the committee,

90
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,800
the compensation process can then proceed.

91
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,438
Don't try to fool me.

92
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:33,879
You get to decide whether to compensate or not, don't you?

93
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,360
I really don't have the power.

94
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,600
Not even Dr. Jiang.

95
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,720
Fine. I don't care which of you have the authority or not.

96
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:45,120
All I want is one million yuan.

97
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:46,439
Xian Yun.

98
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,639
Shut up.

99
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,920
Dr. Lu.

100
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,680
I heard that a while ago,

101
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:56,879
Dr. Bai. and Dr. Xiao were on television.

102
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,759
They've made Tongshan Hospital's Emergency Department...

103
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,120
into a role model.

104
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,800
And I heard that the viewers were quite moved by it.

105
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:11,680
If I expose my case on a television show as well,

106
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,839
I wonder what the viewers will think.

107
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,638
I'll show them...

108
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:18,079
the miserable and pathetic me that's better off dead.

109
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,360
I believe there will be some audience...

110
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,560
who will sympathize with me.

111
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,360
For the sake of cure rate...

112
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:29,839
and for the sake of satisfying...

113
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,800
some doctors' obsessions with saving lives,

114
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:35,119
Tongshan Hospital disregarded the patient's will...

115
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,439
and put him in endless suffering.

116
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,519
I think, by then,

117
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,879
the viewers will regard Tongshan Hospital...

118
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,759
as a representation of cruelty and cold-bloodedness.

119
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
Dr. Lu.

120
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,959
You don't want that either. Right?

121
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,319
If it comes to that,

122
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,439
even a few million yuan won't fix the issue, right?

123
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,040
Xian Yun.

124
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,319
When I first met you,

125
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,800
you were fighting against your illness.

126
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,879
I admire your perseverance...

127
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,759
and your courage in facing sufferings.

128
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:13,439
Dr. Lu. I admire myself too.

129
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:16,120
At that time, I felt proud and brave.

130
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,560
But I understand it now.

131
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:21,480
That's because I haven't faced real hardship yet.

132
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:22,958
Don't talk to me...

133
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:25,079
about strength, perseverance, and courage anymore.

134
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:28,040
Right now, I want money.

135
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:30,199
Jiang Xian Yun.

136
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,680
Do you even know what you're saying?

137
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,199
Ms. Jiang.

138
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,399
Xian Yun, if that's the case,

139
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,519
I'll make sure to relay your request to the committee.

140
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:41,879
Okay?

141
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,279
But there's one thing...

142
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,399
I want to tell you.

143
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,279
It's almost impossible.

144
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,800
Let me tell you something too.

145
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,399
I won't die anytime soon.

146
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:03,120
I have all the time in the world.

147
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,119
If one day, you find me annoying,

148
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,600
you might just let me die.

149
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,759
Dr. Lu.

150
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,279
I'm sure Xian Yun didn't do it for the money.

151
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,039
He must be in too much pain.

152
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,799
He's not someone who covets money.

153
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,879
I know.

154
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,039
Xian Yun is doing this...

155
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:37,000
for your sake.

156
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:38,639
Me?

157
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,799
If I'm not mistaken,

158
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,559
I think he wants to leave you some money.

159
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:51,330
He no longer wishes to live.

160
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,960
What does he want the money for?

161
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:14,960
Don't feel too bad.

162
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,639
Take good care of him.

163
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,279
What's wrong?

164
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:56,840
I embarrassed you, didn't I?

165
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:13,919
Xian Yun.

166
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:17,330
Ever since I met you,

167
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:20,360
you've never been someone who covet money.

168
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:26,679
Look at me.

169
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,159
You're asking for a million yuan...

170
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,399
to leave it to me, right?

171
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,360
They made me suffer so much.

172
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,240
I deserve a million yuan.

173
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,240
I don't want the money.

174
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:07,720
I just want you to live.

175
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Xiao Shan.

176
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,759
You've been through a lot with me.

177
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,840
Let me love you one more time.

178
00:11:58,279 --> 00:11:59,960
That's against the rules.

179
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,679
Besides, this has never happened in our hospital.

180
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,240
That's what I told him.

181
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:06,080
But he insisted.

182
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,639
We can't make an exception.

183
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,240
I know it's impossible.

184
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,758
It's just that he's in so much pain.

185
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:13,879
I feel bad for him.

186
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:15,279
Besides,

187
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,199
Ms. Jiang is one of us.

188
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,200
I know.

189
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:20,960
We can offer maximum assistance...

190
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,599
in paying for his medical bills...

191
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,799
and in her job as the head nurse.

192
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,359
But we can't allow compensation.

193
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,720
Otherwise, from now on,

194
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,720
our doctors won't dare to make any decision.

195
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:36,679
Besides, Dr. Bai didn't do anything wrong.

196
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:38,399
Dr. Lu.

197
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,159
The doctors are the foundation of our hospital.

198
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:44,919
We have to do our best to protect them.

199
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,720
Regarding this matter,

200
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,559
I trust that you'll take care of it.

201
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,080
I will.

202
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,480
Dr. Jiang. Let me ask you one thing.

203
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:57,679
Sure.

204
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:00,200
If you were in Bai Zhu's shoes,

205
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,519
what would you do?

206
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,240
When a patient could die at any moment,

207
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,559
I think...

208
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,600
I'll choose to do what Bai Zhu did.

209
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,639
But if I think rationally,

210
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,000
Dr. Xiao wasn't wrong either.

211
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,120
It's just that every doctor has a different view.

212
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,559
They make different choices.

213
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,080
That's right.

214
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:40,360
Everyone makes different choices.

215
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:43,399
There might be regrets regardless of the outcome.

216
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,759
Exactly.

217
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,600
By the way,

218
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,879
Dr. Xiao and Dr. Bai's television show was aired.

219
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,960
The feedback was good.

220
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,360
Directors from other hospitals called to ask me for advice.

221
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,720
Dr. Lu.

222
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:02,720
The doctors I assigned you...

223
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,399
aren't too bad, right?

224
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,519
Their work is impeccable.

225
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:10,279
It's just that they have quite strong personalities.

226
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:13,759
Talented people have their own personalities.

227
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:16,399
The key is, how do you use them?

228
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:19,120
In terms of staffing,

229
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,039
I still have a lot to learn from you.

230
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,279
This way.

231
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,480
- I... - This way.

232
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,200
- Okay. - I won't see you out.

233
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,360
I'll get going then.

234
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:34,799
He wants one million yuan?

235
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,639
Why is he asking for money now?

236
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,960
This issue really can't be resolved now.

237
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:43,559
Good timing.

238
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:44,719
You're both here.

239
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,519
Listen, this afternoon,

240
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:50,559
there's a conference on hospitals' public image.

241
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,558
Dr. Jiang specifically asked for Bai Zhu and Xiao Yan...

242
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,919
to attend it.

243
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,080
I don't have time.

244
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,600
I have a patient in the afternoon.

245
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,679
You have to be there no matter what.

246
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:02,960
This concerns the survival of EICU.

247
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:06,639
Get me one.

248
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,840
You all know...

249
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,240
how hard it was for us to establish the EICU.

250
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,759
At the general committee meeting,

251
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:14,679
I promised to enforce strict disciplinary action...

252
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,679
in front of Dr. Jiang and all the medical personnel.

253
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,639
During the one-year trial,

254
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:21,000
if anything goes wrong,

255
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,200
we'll have to shut it down.

256
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:26,000
In a blink of an eye, it has already been so long.

257
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,480
Let me give you a hint.

258
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:29,320
After the hospital evaluation,

259
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,519
our Emergency Department might rank last.

260
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,039
If we don't achieve any results in other aspects,

261
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,320
how will I face Dr. Jiang and the medical personnel?

262
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,600
Let's just close down the EICU.

263
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,799
That's why I want you two to attend this conference.

264
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,159
It's an opportunity to promote our EICU.

265
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:50,679
Our performance assessment might be below average,

266
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:52,720
but we have a good social influence.

267
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:53,919
Am I right?

268
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,200
By then,

269
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,879
I don't think the hospital will shut us down so easily.

270
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,799
I think Dr. Lu has a point.

271
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,200
Look, for the sake of our department and the EICU,

272
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:05,639
you have to attend it.

273
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,120
As for the patients,

274
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,559
there are so many of us who can take care of them.

275
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,440
Exactly.

276
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:14,200
All right, I'll go.

277
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:18,360
Bai Zhu, what about you?

278
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:22,279
If I were still in Cardiac Surgery, I wouldn't get such random tasks.

279
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:24,279
Allow me to translate what Dr. Bai means.

280
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:25,679
He's going.

281
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:29,399
Okay, that's great.

282
00:16:57,919 --> 00:16:58,919
Are they moving or not?

283
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,600
What's up ahead?

284
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:02,360
I heard there was an accident.

285
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,960
It seems pretty serious.

286
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,599
What happened up ahead?

287
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,359
I heard there was an accident. A lot of people got hurt.

288
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,839
- Is it serious? - It's quite bad.

289
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,119
When can we get through?

290
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,519
Is anyone there? Anyone?

291
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,170
- Help! - My wife was hit by a car.

292
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:34,199
- She's not breathing! - Save my son! Help!

293
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,078
- Help! - Where's the doctor?

294
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:37,890
- We need help! - There's a serial car crash...

295
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,200
on Xifeng Expressway. I estimate a dozen casualties.

296
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,519
Send backup immediately.

297
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:42,799
Dr. Bai. Let's take one side each.

298
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,170
Come on.

299
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:48,079
There was a serious car accident on Xifeng Expressway.

300
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,480
Chen Zhi and Tang Hua, come with me.

301
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,079
As for all other medical staff,

302
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,279
get in position. Hurry up.

303
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,000
- Okay. - Let us through. Thank you.

304
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:55,649
Anyone, help!

305
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,839
- What's wrong? - My dad. Help my dad.

306
00:17:58,359 --> 00:17:59,359
Sir!

307
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:01,240
Sir, can you open the door? Sir!

308
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:03,720
- Help! Take a look at my child. - Don't worry. I'm a doctor.

309
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,170
Hey, kid.

310
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,119
Miss, are you injured?

311
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,650
Answer her.

312
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:20,279
Sir. You can't move your neck, right?

313
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,920
- I can't move it. - What about your hands? Fingers?

314
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,410
Good, you can.

315
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:28,519
Miss.

316
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,079
Your dad could have a spinal fracture.

317
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:31,649
And if it's serious,

318
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:32,799
it could lead to paralysis...

319
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:33,890
or death.

320
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,039
I have to find something to hold him in place.

321
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,278
You have to help me out.

322
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:38,679
- Okay. - Use your hands...

323
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,559
to stabilize his neck. Can you do that?

324
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,278
Yes. I'm a nursing student.

325
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:43,650
- I can do it. - Give it a try.

326
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:45,679
Don't move.

327
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,680
Wait for me.

328
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,650
His wounds are all dressed.

329
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,558
- The ambulance will be here soon. - Doctor?

330
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:55,559
Dr. Bai!

331
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,240
Make sure the injured get a tentative diagnosis.

332
00:18:58,519 --> 00:18:59,519
I'm moving forward.

333
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:03,960
Is anyone there?

334
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,720
Anyone there?

335
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,279
- What's wrong? - I can't move my leg.

336
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,599
Stay calm.

337
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,200
Can you move your leg a little?

338
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:23,650
You can't?

339
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:25,890
I think you might have a fracture.

340
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:28,319
I'll get you something solid to hold it in place.

341
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:34,359
A tennis racket.

342
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:35,890
Would a tennis racket do?

343
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,799
- Yes. - There's one in the trunk.

344
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:39,599
Just give me a second.

345
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:47,440
Miss, have you learned cervical spine fixation in school?

346
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,480
Yes.

347
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,799
Hold this.

348
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:53,680
Hang in there.

349
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:10,440
Until the ambulance comes, don't move around.

350
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:12,359
Doctor! Please save my wife.

351
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,480
- My wife is dying! - Help!

352
00:20:13,481 --> 00:20:14,559
Please save her!

353
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,119
Wake up.

354
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:17,680
- Lay her down first. - Okay.

355
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:23,650
It's done.

356
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,720
Sir.

357
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:26,279
Sir.

358
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,170
His pulse is getting weaker.

359
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:32,759
His breathing is weak too.

360
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:35,319
Honey.

361
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,799
She's having a cardiac arrest.

362
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,319
I'm going to give her CPR.

363
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,799
Watch carefully. You'll have to do it later.

364
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:48,839
This is bad.

365
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,680
I can't hear any breathing sounds in his right lung.

366
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It should be pneumothorax.

367
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:56,650
Needles...

368
00:20:58,890 --> 00:20:59,890
Xiao Yan!

369
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,680
Xiao Yan! Do you have needles?

370
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:02,839
Needles!

371
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,119
I don't have them!

372
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,480
Hey, how long are you going to take?

373
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:18,799
Come on, let us through!

374
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:20,410
Let us through!

375
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:21,839
Let us through!

376
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:23,799
Go faster.

377
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,200
Align your body and press straight down...

378
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,240
with your upper body weight.

379
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:27,890
Put your hands together like this.

380
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,650
Press down with the root of your palm.

381
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,479
Keep your arms straight. You can't bend your elbow.

382
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,000
After 30 compressions, give 2 rescue breaths.

383
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:36,650
When giving the rescue breath,

384
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,759
you have to hold her nostrils shut with your hands.

385
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,480
- Do you understand? - Yes.

386
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:43,890
This is a syringe. It won't do.

387
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:46,079
I'm a doctor from Tongshan Hospital. Please trust me.

388
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:47,650
It will be too late if we wait.

389
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,039
Okay.

390
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:51,880
You can't stop until the ambulance gets here.

391
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:53,558
- Okay. - You do it.

392
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:55,440
Miss, come and take a look at us.

393
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,480
My husband is injured too.

394
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:01,640
- Let me take a look. - It hurts here.

395
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,440
Straighten your legs.

396
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,880
Dad.

397
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
Dad.

398
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,359
- Dad. - He's breathing.

399
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,640
Miss. Call me if your dad needs help.

400
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,000
Okay. Thank you, doctor.

401
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,839
Your internal organs might be wounded.

402
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,599
Don't worry. The ambulance will be here soon.

403
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,160
Okay. Thank you.

404
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,920
- What's the situation? - One of them is critical.

405
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,680
More people are wounded over there.

406
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:22,160
Thank you for your hard work.

407
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:30,759
Don't worry.

408
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:32,720
Thank you, doctor.

409
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:45,039
Luckily, you and Bai Zhu were able to save them in time.

410
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,960
These critical patients' lives have been saved.

411
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,240
Thank you.

412
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,720
Be careful.

413
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,160
Thank you, Dr. Xiao.

414
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:53,640
Let's go back to the hospital.

415
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,279
Right. I already told Dr. Jiang.

416
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,359
You don't have to attend the conference in the afternoon.

417
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,200
As for the follow-up treatment for the injured,

418
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,319
I still need you and Bai Zhu.

419
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:18,160
(Operating Room, Anesthesiology)

420
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,358
- Doctor, how is my dad? - I'm sorry. I'm not sure.

421
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:21,839
Another doctor will talk to you later.

422
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,960
Doctor. How is my dad?

423
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:25,160
Your dad's surgery was successful.

424
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,960
Will he be paralyzed?

425
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,440
No. He was treated in time.

426
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,440
Thank you so much, doctor.

427
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:32,358
He'll be sent to the EICU.

428
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:33,359
We'll observe him for a while.

429
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,960
You can go to the nurses for the paperwork.

430
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,720
Okay, I got it. Thank you.

431
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,480
What a busy day.

432
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,480
The injured are all taken care of.

433
00:24:58,599 --> 00:24:59,759
They're all taken care of.

434
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,119
It was such a huge accident.

435
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,039
It's a miracle...

436
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,359
that no one died.

437
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,279
Of course.

438
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:09,680
Don't get cocky.

439
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,920
I heard...

440
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,599
that you only treated one patient.

441
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,480
The rest was saved by Xiao Yan.

442
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:19,159
Do you think saving the wounded is like a gang fight?

443
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,400
The more, the better?

444
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,880
I saved a life.

445
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,919
That's because she helped you treat the other patients.

446
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,079
Am I right, Dr. Xiao?

447
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,240
Xiao Yan.

448
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:32,200
What's on your mind?

449
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:39,880
I'm still thinking about today's accident.

450
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,359
Dr. Bai did a great job seeing to the wounded...

451
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,279
and made a good judgment.

452
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,279
But...

453
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,759
if Dr. Lu and the others hadn't arrived in time,

454
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,400
I don't think...

455
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:56,440
I could have handled so many injured people on my own.

456
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,119
If you were on your own...

457
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,759
But in the end,

458
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:06,480
all the wounded were taken care of.

459
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:11,599
Dr. Xiao, you did great today.

460
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,319
I'm sorry I couldn't help you.

461
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,400
That's not what I meant.

462
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,680
I just don't want any patients...

463
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:23,200
to miss the chance to be rescued.

464
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:26,160
Because you don't know how fragile life is...

465
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,880
or how helpless a doctor is until you've lost someone.

466
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,000
Lost what?

467
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:36,839
Good work today, everyone.

468
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,440
Get some rest.

469
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:46,480
Get back to work.

470
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,880
What did you do to her?

471
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,960
Sweetie, wake up.

472
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,720
- Wake up, sweetie. - What's going on?

473
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,199
The girl has had a fever since last Monday.

474
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,480
She has had headaches, fatigue, and sore throat.

475
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,400
She took cold medicines and fever reducers. It didn't work.

476
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,640
She passed out last night. Her family just brought her in.

477
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:44,400
She had a high fever for a week. What took you so long?

478
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,799
What kind of a parent are you?

479
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:48,159
I thought it was just a cold and a fever.

480
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,279
- It was nothing serious. - Little girl.

481
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,920
Can you hear me, little girl?

482
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,799
They would just prescribe her the same medicine at the hospital.

483
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:56,400
There's no need to waste money.

484
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,759
Fever can be a sign of acute illnesses.

485
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,278
If there's any delay in treatment,

486
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:01,480
do you know what will happen?

487
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:03,358
Doctor, please take a look at her.

488
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:05,240
What's wrong with her?

489
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,079
Sweetie, Mom is here.

490
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,480
Doctor. What's wrong with my kid?

491
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:12,559
Why didn't you come earlier?

492
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,799
She had a fever for a week.

493
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,359
Mom. I've always told you not to scrimp and save.

494
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,319
We work so hard to make a living.

495
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,799
Isn't it so we can spend it on her?

496
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,358
Why are you so frugal?

497
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:25,960
Try not to be so harsh.

498
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,239
Sweetie.

499
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,640
You think I want to talk about this?

500
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,599
When have you ever cared about anything at home?

501
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,720
That's enough. Stop being so annoying.

502
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,200
Am I the one being annoying?

503
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,680
If you want to argue, do it outside. This is a hospital.

504
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:36,839
Get out.

505
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:38,440
Hang on, doctor.

506
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,839
Can't you be more polite?

507
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,319
We're here for treatment. It's not like we're not paying.

508
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,160
Why are you scolding us? What did we do wrong?

509
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:48,160
Why are you yelling at the doctor?

510
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,039
He's treating your kid now.

511
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,640
If you're so good, why don't you treat her?

512
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:54,720
Doctor, I'm sorry.

513
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,159
- Gloves. - We'll be right out.

514
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,559
We won't disturb you.

515
00:28:58,039 --> 00:28:59,240
Go on. Get out.

516
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:08,119
Doctor.

517
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,440
What's wrong with this child?

518
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,680
It's not a big deal, is it?

519
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:14,599
Don't panic. There's no point in worrying.

520
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,880
Wait outside.

521
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:22,839
Dr. Bai.

522
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,400
Don't be displeased at me for saying this.

523
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:28,079
Her family is in the wrong,

524
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:30,799
but aren't you being too rude?

525
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,640
Should I give her a fever reducer as the standard procedure?

526
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:46,079
No.

527
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:57,639
She had a high fever for a week.

528
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,640
Her lymph nodes were swollen.

529
00:29:58,641 --> 00:30:00,880
She took antibiotics at home, but it didn't help.

530
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,440
Let's run an urgent standard blood test first.

531
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,559
Give me the medical records for bed four.

532
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:06,839
- Yes, Dr. Xue. - Thank you.

533
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,279
It's time. Let's eat.

534
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,039
No, I'll pass.

535
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,400
Dr. Bai is in a bad mood today.

536
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,640
I have to be careful with him.

537
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,920
What's wrong with Dr. Bai today?

538
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,558
A little girl had a fever.

539
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,799
Dr. Bai was mad that her family brought her in late.

540
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,240
He told them all off.

541
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,240
Why? Doesn't he usually ignore the patient's family?

542
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,480
What's wrong with him today?

543
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,000
Go ahead and eat.

544
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:28,159
The test results will be out soon.

545
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,640
I have to hand it to Dr. Bai.

546
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,359
You guys go ahead and eat. I'll wait here.

547
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,880
Doctor.

548
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:39,880
What does the result say?

549
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,519
Why is she transferred here?

550
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,960
I just ran a specific checkup.

551
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,359
It's almost certain...

552
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,919
that the child is infected with herpes simplex virus, HSV.

553
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,240
What kind of illness is this?

554
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:48,759
Can it be cured?

555
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:50,960
I told the parents just now.

556
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,759
It's not difficult to treat.

557
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,640
It happens more often in toddlers.

558
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,240
But there's one thing I have to emphasize to you.

559
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,240
HSV is also known as the kissing virus.

560
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,880
It is transmitted through saliva.

561
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:03,559
Unhealthy and unhygienic habits...

562
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,519
make children more prone to being infected.

563
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:09,000
For example, tasting the food before feeding it to her,

564
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:10,400
blowing on her rice,

565
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:12,880
sharing utensils with her,

566
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,839
or kissing the child all the time.

567
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:17,799
I'm sure you did a lot of that while raising her, right?

568
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:21,720
I see.

569
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,319
A lot of viruses might not affect adults much.

570
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,440
But a child's immune system is underdeveloped and vulnerable.

571
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,759
Besides, she has been sick for a week.

572
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:31,960
What took you so long to bring her here?

573
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,160
Fortunately, her symptoms are still in the early stages.

574
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,680
If she had come a few days later,

575
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,239
she could have complications in her heart,

576
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,240
liver, spleen, lungs, and kidney.

577
00:31:41,241 --> 00:31:42,319
Her life would have been in danger.

578
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,519
I hope you will be more cautious as her guardian.

579
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:46,759
When you get home,

580
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,920
read up more on children's health.

581
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,278
The patient needs to rest now.

582
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:53,640
You should wait outside.

583
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:55,160
Thank you.

584
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,680
Just listen to me. It's decided.

585
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,880
Mom is coming out.

586
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:11,799
Mom.

587
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,359
Just now, Zhou Lei and I had a discussion.

588
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,200
We'll look after our child instead of troubling you.

589
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,559
What do you mean?

590
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:21,559
You won't let me look after her?

591
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:25,359
- We... - Mom, don't get us wrong.

592
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,440
Don't think too much.

593
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:28,719
You've been taking care of her for so long.

594
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,960
It must have been hard on you.

595
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:31,599
After all, you're old now.

596
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,920
You should rest.

597
00:32:32,921 --> 00:32:35,640
But you two are always busy.

598
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:37,640
When will you have time for her?

599
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:40,079
She has to go to the kindergarten during the day.

600
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,239
If we can't get home in time,

601
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,319
we'll just hire a nanny.

602
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,400
A nanny?

603
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,400
Will she be as good as me?

604
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,759
I know.

605
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,839
This is all my fault.

606
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:25,200
I won't keep kissing her, okay?

607
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,079
She was just so cute,

608
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,319
so I kept kissing her.

609
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,680
I've learned a lesson.

610
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,559
I also remember everything the doctor said.

611
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,960
Excuse me.

612
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:37,319
This...

613
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,279
belongs to your child, right?

614
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:40,839
Yes.

615
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,519
This is her favorite toy.

616
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:45,759
She carries it with her everywhere she goes.

617
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:49,039
I'm just worried she might panic...

618
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:51,160
if she doesn't see it when she wakes up.

619
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:53,359
I just brought it from home.

620
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,960
Ma'am.

621
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:57,119
When you look after a child,

622
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,160
you should pay attention to your personal hygiene.

623
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,759
But don't worry.

624
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:04,240
This contamination of this virus can't be prevented 100 percent.

625
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,119
When you get home, separate your utensils from the child's.

626
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:09,440
Encourage her to eat on her own.

627
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,519
Try not to kiss her on the mouth.

628
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,079
Just take extra care.

629
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:16,289
- Okay. - Same with the parents.

630
00:34:16,769 --> 00:34:18,480
Don't blame it all on the elder.

631
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:22,079
I can see that the child is close to her grandma.

632
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,329
Actually, what the kids need is not just scientific parenting.

633
00:34:27,809 --> 00:34:30,000
What they need is a loving family.

634
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,039
Dr. Bai.

635
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,679
You're not quite yourself today.

636
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,119
Am I?

637
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:06,880
Although you usually get angry easily,

638
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,000
it's unlike you to reprimand Lin Lin's parents...

639
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,360
like you did today.

640
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:21,000
Children are a lot more vulnerable than we think.

641
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,960
Sometimes, the slightest slip-up can cause an irreversible outcome.

642
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:28,880
But you lost your temper today. That was a bit too much.

643
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,719
Not all children are born healthy...

644
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,769
and grow up well like Lin Lin.

645
00:35:36,769 --> 00:35:38,288
I got mad at her family...

646
00:35:38,289 --> 00:35:39,809
seeing that she got ill because of their negligence.

647
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,919
But do you know?

648
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,559
When a child is sick,

649
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,519
the family suffers the most.

650
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,519
Your harsh words might affect their mood and judgment.

651
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:50,809
Of course I know that parents suffer the most.

652
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:52,559
I know that better than anyone.

653
00:35:56,599 --> 00:35:57,719
But you're right.

654
00:35:58,559 --> 00:35:59,679
It's my fault...

655
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,239
that I couldn't control my emotions.

656
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:06,480
Why do you know that better than anyone else?

657
00:36:09,769 --> 00:36:11,519
Dr. Bai, do you already have a child?

658
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:21,769
- What's the patient's condition? - Thalassemia.

659
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,039
He fainted during PE class.

660
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:25,039
Xiao Guang?

661
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:26,639
Do you know him?

662
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:28,719
He's Bai Zhu's son.

663
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,329
He'll be fine after the blood transfusion.

664
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:41,719
Xiao Guang.

665
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,118
Don't worry.

666
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,360
Xiao Yan has given Xiao Guang a blood transfusion.

667
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,519
He should be fine now.

668
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,518
Thank you.

669
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:49,039
You must be Xiao Guang's dad.

670
00:36:49,809 --> 00:36:51,000
I'm his PE teacher.

671
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,719
I couldn't reach you just now.

672
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,239
- I'm really sorry. - It's fine.

673
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,440
I was busy just now. I'm sorry for the trouble.

674
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,079
He's showing signs of a cold.

675
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:01,440
It's best to observe him for a few days in the EICU.

676
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:03,199
Yes.

677
00:37:03,329 --> 00:37:04,839
Xiao Guang has thalassemia.

678
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,960
He's very weak.

679
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:07,599
It will be more troublesome if he catches a cold.

680
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,289
I'll get the paperwork done.

681
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:25,880
Are you surprised?

682
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,960
Someone like Bai Zhu can also be vulnerable.

683
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,598
The way he looked at Xiao Guang just now...

684
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:32,719
reminded me of my dad.

685
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:35,599
I've told a lot of people.

686
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:39,079
Bai Zhu is actually a kind and vulnerable person.

687
00:37:39,289 --> 00:37:42,880
He likes to lock himself away in a shell of arrogance and malice.

688
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:44,599
But a lot of people don't believe me.

689
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:46,199
I do.

690
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:48,239
But sometimes, he's just too stubborn.

691
00:37:48,289 --> 00:37:49,809
He's too persistent when it comes to his values.

692
00:37:50,289 --> 00:37:52,360
I think you're both just the same.

693
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,480
Did Xiao Guang's condition affect Bai Zhu's medical principles?

694
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,360
Of course.

695
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,039
When Xiao Guang was born,

696
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,079
he had severe thalassemia.

697
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,809
At that time, all the doctors told Bai Zhu...

698
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,599
that he wouldn't make it to his first birthday.

699
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:17,558
But under Bai Zhu's careful watch,

700
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:19,119
Xiao Guang had a narrow escape from death...

701
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:21,329
again and again.

702
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,599
When Xiao Guang was 3 to 6 years old,

703
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:26,559
Bai Zhu was told that Xiao Guang wouldn't make it.

704
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,769
But Bai Zhu didn't give up.

705
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,519
Xiao Guang is eight years old now.

706
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:38,289
I also came across a similar case when I was abroad.

707
00:38:38,769 --> 00:38:41,639
A little girl had severe thalassemia.

708
00:38:42,289 --> 00:38:44,239
The hospital had given her the best treatment.

709
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,039
But the little girl...

710
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:48,559
still passed away when she turned three.

711
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,960
Bai Zhu has put great efforts into caring for Xiao Guang.

712
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:58,119
He devotes almost all of his time and energy outside of work...

713
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,289
to Xiao Guang.

714
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:02,480
Bai Zhu has never given up on Xiao Guang.

715
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:04,960
Because he didn't give up,

716
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,599
Xiao Guang created a miracle of his own.

717
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,039
Staying alive...

718
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:13,329
is the greatest value of life.

719
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,239
I finally understand...

720
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,000
why he believes so much in miracles...

721
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:23,639
and why he never gives up any chances of survival.

722
00:39:24,519 --> 00:39:25,679
Even if it's against the patient's will,

723
00:39:25,769 --> 00:39:26,880
he still wants to save him.

724
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:34,599
You're awake.

725
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:40,039
Dad.

726
00:39:40,289 --> 00:39:41,599
Why am I in the hospital?

727
00:39:41,769 --> 00:39:43,199
Why do you think you're in the hospital?

728
00:39:44,769 --> 00:39:45,880
Didn't I tell you?

729
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:48,118
When other kids are in the PE class,

730
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,719
just stay in the classroom.

731
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:51,440
Who told you to go to the playground?

732
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:53,598
They were playing soccer, but I wasn't.

733
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,769
I was watching.

734
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:56,039
Then why did you pass out?

735
00:39:56,289 --> 00:39:57,289
I don't know.

736
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,480
You don't know?

737
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,840
You just don't listen, do you?

738
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:02,239
I'm confiscating your allowance this week.

739
00:40:02,329 --> 00:40:03,840
- What? - What?

740
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:06,039
You'll be in the hospital this week anyway.

741
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:07,559
You won't be able to spend the money.

742
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,599
Xiao Guang. You're awake?

743
00:40:13,289 --> 00:40:15,719
This is my colleague, Ms. Jiang.

744
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,840
Hello, Ms. Jiang.

745
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,039
How are you feeling?

746
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:19,400
Do you feel unwell?

747
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,880
I feel much better.

748
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,840
Ms. Jiang.

749
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:25,519
Aren't you a doctor?

750
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:27,360
Why aren't you wearing a doctor's gown?

751
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:30,639
I'm a nurse.

752
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:33,679
Ms. Jiang's family is sick and hospitalized.

753
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,840
So she took a leave to take care of her family.

754
00:40:36,329 --> 00:40:37,839
Ms. Jiang, don't worry about me.

755
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,400
Go and take care of your family.

756
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:41,679
Okay, sure.

757
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:43,639
We're right next to you.

758
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:45,440
We're right next door.

759
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,118
We're neighbors.

760
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,119
So...

761
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,960
what's wrong with him?

762
00:40:51,769 --> 00:40:52,769
Bai Ji Guang.

763
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,960
Listen up.

764
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:55,719
You must behave yourself during this period of time.

765
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,239
Don't disturb others.

766
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,920
- Do you understand? - Yes.

767
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:00,400
It's not my first time being hospitalized.

768
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:01,880
You little brat.

769
00:41:02,289 --> 00:41:03,719
Every time I finish a sentence,

770
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:05,289
he talks back right at me.

771
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,769
He's my role model.

772
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:12,159
All right. Get some rest.

773
00:41:12,329 --> 00:41:13,440
I'll get you some food.

774
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:16,920
When you're discharged, I'll take you back to our hometown.

775
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:18,119
We'll visit your grandparents.

776
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:19,199
Okay.

777
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,239
Who knew that Dr. Bai's son was so grown up?

778
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:23,400
When did he get married?

779
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:25,119
Why didn't I know about this?

780
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,559
That's how he is, isn't it?

781
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:29,289
He just wants to stir things up.

782
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,639
Whether he tells us or not, that's his privacy.

783
00:41:32,769 --> 00:41:34,039
It has nothing to do with us.

784
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:38,000
You guys should stop gossiping behind his back.

785
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,239
I heard his son has severe thalassemia.

786
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:45,199
There's no knowing when he won't pull through.

787
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,840
He's still so young. Poor thing.

788
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:51,119
Do you have the MRI result for bed nine?

789
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,440
Bai Zhu.

790
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,440
Yi Ran has told me about Xiao Guang.

791
00:42:06,769 --> 00:42:08,920
- Let me know if you need time off. - It's fine.

792
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,599
He's in the EICU, so he's close to me.

793
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:13,639
I guess...

794
00:42:13,769 --> 00:42:16,079
we're not showing enough concern for our young doctors.

795
00:42:16,809 --> 00:42:19,440
I didn't know anything about Xiao Guang.

796
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:21,239
It's okay. You're our leader.

797
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:22,920
You worry about important matters.

798
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:25,119
Thank you for asking.

799
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:42,079
Dr. Bai.

800
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,519
Has Xiao Guang woken up?

801
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:52,329
I'm here...

802
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,960
to apologize to you.
