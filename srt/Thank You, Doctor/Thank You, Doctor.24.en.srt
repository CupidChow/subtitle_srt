(Adapted from Sheng Li's novel "ICU 48 Hours")

00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,000
(Episode 24)

4
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,200
Mom.

5
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,959
The doctor made it very clear just now.

6
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,519
If Dad gets a nasogastric tube,

7
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,799
he'll be able to live for another half a year.

8
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,840
Mom.

9
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,920
No matter what,

10
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,120
we don't want Dad to give up on treatment.

11
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,959
I understand how you feel.

12
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:46,159
That's your dad lying there.

13
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,079
He's also my husband.

14
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,280
Of course I don't want him to leave us.

15
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:51,920
I know all these years,

16
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,560
taking care of Dad has been hard on you.

17
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,680
Don't worry.

18
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:55,959
From now on, Xiao Jie and I...

19
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,319
will come back whenever we have time.

20
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,359
We'll take good care of him together.

21
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:03,239
You know how many hospitals we've moved to.

22
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:05,480
We've consulted so many specialists.

23
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,799
They all said your dad's illness is irreversible.

24
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,599
You love your dad.

25
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,120
You can't bear to part with him.

26
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,439
But following what your elders want...

27
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,879
is also a part of filial piety.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,039
At this point,

29
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,039
why should we let him live and suffer?

30
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,090
Mom.

31
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,919
Why can't you put yourself in your dad's shoes?

32
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,840
Mom, it's not that we're not filial.

33
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,039
It's not that we want to make Dad suffer.

34
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,680
If the doctor told me...

35
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,879
that Dad can't hang in there anymore...

36
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:29,000
and that he can't be saved,

37
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,370
we would accept it.

38
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:33,039
But he still has six months to live.

39
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,530
What kind of six months would that be?

40
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,370
What kind of quality of life would he have?

41
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,370
Mom.

42
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,560
That's enough.

43
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,759
Come with me.

44
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,039
Let's go.

45
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,759
Mom.

46
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,479
Why did you drag us back here?

47
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,280
What do you want to show us?

48
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,639
- Why is Dad's hand like this? - Be gentle.

49
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,919
What kind of hospital is this?

50
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,759
- I'm going to look for them. - Xiao Jie.

51
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:09,719
Keep it down. We're in a hospital.

52
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:11,319
Have some manners.

53
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,560
The doctors have done everything they can.

54
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,960
They really can't find...

55
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,240
any other place to give him injections.

56
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,840
Look at his ankle.

57
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,080
It's bandaged like this too.

58
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,319
Over the past decade,

59
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,639
your dad has been sick all the time.

60
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,599
He never stopped taking medicine or getting injections.

61
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,240
That's why his body was overwhelmed long ago.

62
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,840
After he got Alzheimer's,

63
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,560
you didn't come home much,

64
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,159
so naturally, you also don't know much.

65
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,840
You have no idea...

66
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,120
how much he has been suffering.

67
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,520
Your dad told me more than once...

68
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,080
that if he ever becomes terminally ill,

69
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,319
I must not listen to the doctors and save him.

70
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,680
The result of that...

71
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,120
would just be living a life without purpose.

72
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,599
It's meaningless.

73
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:10,840
Look at his face.

74
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,400
It's filled with pain.

75
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,439
He had already lost the ability to speak...

76
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,560
more than 600 days ago,

77
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:23,480
but...

78
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,319
I could hear him crying inside.

79
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:31,399
"Set me free."

80
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,439
Please, you two.

81
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,639
Don't let your dad suffer anymore.

82
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:52,360
Mom.

83
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,170
This...

84
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,680
concerns my dad's life.

85
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,610
It's really hard for us to decide.

86
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:04,120
Please give us some more time.

87
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,240
We'll think about it.

88
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,319
I'm actually struggling inside too.

89
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,050
During this time,

90
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,170
I hope we can maintain basic treatment for him.

91
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,519
Okay?

92
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,560
Dad.

93
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:40,920
You've suffered a lot.

94
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:06,639
With Dad's condition like this,

95
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,879
what should we do?

96
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,560
I don't know.

97
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:14,839
Let me think about it.

98
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,079
Let me think about it some more.

99
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,079
Dad. What are you doing here?

100
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:58,680
Go to sleep.

101
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,759
I'm looking for something.

102
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:01,800
You're making so much noise here.

103
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,360
I can't sleep.

104
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,680
For your birthday last year,

105
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:10,319
I gave you a neck pillow.

106
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,319
Where did you put it?

107
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,319
They're all in that bin.

108
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,120
All the birthday presents you bought for me...

109
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,199
are all in there.

110
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,839
Dad.

111
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,120
Why are you taking this?

112
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,839
You never used this, right?

113
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:26,519
That's right.

114
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,600
You claimed that you especially bought it for me in Germany.

115
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,920
Do you think I don't know...

116
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,240
that you just bought it for me at the airport...

117
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,279
for the sake of looking good?

118
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,639
It was even several sizes too big.

119
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,840
I couldn't use it at all.

120
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:36,879
That's why...

121
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,399
this is fate.

122
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,639
What fate?

123
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,639
What fate?

124
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,759
You can't use it anyway. It's too big.

125
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:45,360
I'll take it then.

126
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,519
Dad, it's my business whether I use it or not.

127
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:51,480
You have to get my permission before taking it.

128
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,600
What are you talking about?

129
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,600
I bought this for you.

130
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,679
You gave it to me,

131
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:58,210
so it's mine now.

132
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,330
Everything in this house is mine,

133
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,840
including you.

134
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,120
Go to sleep now.

135
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,240
Go to sleep.

136
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:11,039
My goodness.

137
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,210
It was a gift.

138
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,360
How can he take it back?

139
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,210
I did a follow-up ECG for the patient.

140
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,960
There's no typical myocardial ischemic change.

141
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,159
The cardiac enzymes are also normal.

142
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,480
I'm going to do another chest, abdomen, and artery CT scan on him.

143
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:28,450
Where are you going?

144
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:37,840
What is it, Dr. Bai?

145
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,120
Xiao Guang wanted me to give this to you.

146
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:43,159
He wants to thank you for taking him to the amusement park.

147
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,090
Xiao Guang?

148
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,330
How did he know that I have a bad cervical spine?

149
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,879
That kid has been spending a lot of time with Xu Yi Ran lately.

150
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:55,480
Maybe Xu Yi Ran told him.

151
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:57,090
Try it. See if it fits.

152
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,120
It fits perfectly.

153
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,600
Xiao Guang is quite thoughtful.

154
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:08,919
Please thank him for me.

155
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:09,919
Sure.

156
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,639
Okay, I'll get back to work.

157
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,679
Thank you.

158
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,120
What's with Dr. Bai?

159
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:27,159
Who knows what's wrong with him?

160
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:31,879
Dr. Xiao, let's go and eat.

161
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,120
Did you buy a neck pillow?

162
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:35,559
Is it good?

163
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:36,559
It's quite comfortable.

164
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,679
My neck has been sore lately.

165
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,279
Where did you buy this? I want one too.

166
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,960
Xiao Guang gave it to me.

167
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,799
What a sweet boy.

168
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:45,360
He's already so good with girls at such a young age.

169
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,399
Imagine how he'll be when he's grown up.

170
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:47,919
Why do I feel like...

171
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:50,120
this neck pillow probably isn't from Xiao Guang?

172
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:51,919
I think it's from Bai Zhu.

173
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,519
Why is that?

174
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,240
Think about it.

175
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,919
Xiao Guang is just a kid.

176
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:59,159
How would he know that Dr. Xiao has a bad neck?

177
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:00,799
Moreover,

178
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:03,240
you also saw how excited Bai Zhu was just now.

179
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,559
This neck pillow must be from him.

180
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,639
Yes.

181
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:08,279
Dr. Bai was indeed very excited just now.

182
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,440
But why did Dr. Bai give Dr. Xiao a neck pillow?

183
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:15,519
I'm going to make my rounds.

184
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:18,879
You're not going to eat?

185
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:23,759
We'll go then.

186
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:43,639
Ms. Lin.

187
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:45,639
Ms. Lin.

188
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:47,559
I made pear soup with white fungus.

189
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:49,200
Have some while it's hot.

190
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:51,480
I have no appetite.

191
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,559
You look terrible.

192
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:57,679
Why don't you go home and get some rest?

193
00:11:58,879 --> 00:11:59,879
No.

194
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,879
Shi Lei needs me.

195
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,720
You can't do this to yourself.

196
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,120
Watch him for me.

197
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,279
I'm going to the restroom.

198
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,720
What's wrong?

199
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,720
Are you okay?

200
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm fine. I just feel a little dizzy.

201
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,120
Let me help you up.

202
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:36,879
I'll take a look at you.

203
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:39,320
You're just too tired.

204
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,360
We're giving you some glucose.

205
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,159
You'll be fine after some rest.

206
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:45,080
Dr. Xiao.

207
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,120
Have a seat.

208
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,639
It has been a long time since I saw Shi Lei smile at me.

209
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,120
We've been together for 40 years.

210
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:03,320
In these 40 years,

211
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,440
we've given to each other...

212
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:06,840
and protected each other.

213
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:10,720
We've always given each other our warmest smiles.

214
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:15,159
We always shared even the bits and pieces...

215
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:16,919
of our work and lives.

216
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,039
We had endless topics to talk about.

217
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,399
Even if there were occasionally some small frustrations,

218
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:28,879
they garnished our lives.

219
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,960
Were we too lavish before...

220
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,000
and used up all of our happiness?

221
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,600
I wonder if their children have made up their minds.

222
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,919
What is there to think about?

223
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,960
They're disrespecting their elders' wishes.

224
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,840
How is that disrespect?

225
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,960
I think they're disrespecting life.

226
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,080
You have no idea.

227
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,360
Lin Ruo Yu and Li Shi Lei's love story...

228
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,879
is as romantic as a TV drama.

229
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,480
The scene back then...

230
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,559
is etched in my mind forever.

231
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:03,799
Shi Lei and I...

232
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,799
met in an accident.

233
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:07,320
It was an unexpected fate.

234
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,080
I traveled to Shanghai on my own,

235
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,039
but I got acute appendicitis.

236
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,399
Shi Lei was my attending physician.

237
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:18,399
I didn't know anyone here.

238
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,919
I was filled with fear and worry.

239
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:22,639
The first time I met Shi Lei,

240
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:24,080
it felt like...

241
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,600
I had known him for a long time.

242
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:33,000
As a doctor,

243
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,279
his professionalism, sense of responsibility,

244
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,120
patience, and thoughtfulness...

245
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,840
was the light...

246
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,120
that saved me from danger...

247
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,559
when I fell into an abyss.

248
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,919
Later on, we talked a lot.

249
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,679
The more we talked,

250
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:53,000
we felt like we were soulmates.

251
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:56,840
He can read my mind.

252
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,600
He's the one who understands me the most.

253
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,240
She's kidnapping him in the name of love.

254
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,919
Why are you so worked up?

255
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,440
No wonder she's always talking...

256
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,279
about the wind, earth, sky, clouds, rain, and stuff.

257
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,360
That's a sign that she's closing herself off.

258
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:14,240
She is too immersed in her own world.

259
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,799
Then what happened?

260
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:21,600
It was just a one-chance encounter.

261
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:23,159
They couldn't wait to get married right after that?

262
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,960
You don't even know what love is.

263
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,039
Her relationship with Li Shi Lei is true love.

264
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,799
- I don't believe that. - I believe it.

265
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:32,519
Anyway, after that,

266
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:33,840
Lin Ruo Yun came to Shanghai.

267
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,320
With his own ability and experience,

268
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,720
Li Shi Lei became an excellent internal medicine doctor.

269
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,759
As the two of them admired,

270
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:42,320
respected, and relied on each other,

271
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,440
their love deepened.

272
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,879
Later on, you know that Li Shi Lei got pneumonia.

273
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:47,080
His children were busy with work.

274
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,120
Lin Ruo Yun took care of him every day.

275
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:51,000
She fed him medicine and changed his dressing every day.

276
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:52,679
Lin Ruo Yun found it increasingly hard...

277
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:53,799
to be apart from him.

278
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,679
She felt he was so precious.

279
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,960
Ever since we met,

280
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:01,240
Shi Lei has put all of his heart into taking care of me.

281
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,919
He protected me from all obstacles...

282
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,320
and gave me his all.

283
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,080
I remembered it all...

284
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,440
and kept it in my heart.

285
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:15,000
Even though we went on to have two kids...

286
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,320
and no longer had time to ourselves,

287
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,159
we still loved each other just the same.

288
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:25,519
They had their eldest son Li Song...

289
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,840
in the second year of their marriage.

290
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,840
They had their youngest daughter in the fourth year.

291
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,600
Her name is Li Jie.

292
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,240
Although they have children,

293
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,120
they maintained a romance...

294
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,799
like one out of a fairy tale.

295
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,919
Lin Ruo Yun advocates the concept of Western education,

296
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,039
so she lets her kids run free and be independent.

297
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,519
She's a teacher herself,

298
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,919
so she had summer and winter vacations every year.

299
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,159
So every year,

300
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:45,919
she would travel with her husband twice.

301
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:48,279
Her exact words were,

302
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,519
"We have to walk through..."

303
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,360
"every corner of the world while we're still young."

304
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,799
Shi Lei liked to give me flowers.

305
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,159
Every year on my birthday,

306
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,000
I would get fresh flowers...

307
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,799
that he would choose especially for me.

308
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,410
There were hundreds of them.

309
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,559
Blooming red roses...

310
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:13,559
would fill the entire house.

311
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,039
On the other hand, he often forgot...

312
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,890
the kids' birthdays.

313
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:26,480
He also liked to take me on trips.

314
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,559
We took a walk...

315
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,839
on Golden Beach in Australia.

316
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:36,650
We saw the snow in Hokkaido together.

317
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,559
We admired the wildflowers on the roads together,

318
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:44,759
the fresh green leaves on the trees,

319
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,410
the flowing water,

320
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,519
the vast land,

321
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,410
and the sunset on the horizon.

322
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,170
Life is finite,

323
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,680
so we really cherished each other.

324
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,440
We seldom fought...

325
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,559
and rarely separated.

326
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,119
Over the past 40 years,

327
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,200
our love for each other has grown stronger.

328
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,599
It never changed with time.

329
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:20,200
But now,

330
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:25,519
the one who understands me the most...

331
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:28,440
is slipping further away from me day by day.

332
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,759
He's leaving me by forgetting me.

333
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,480
Dr. Xiao.

334
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:43,410
Do you also think...

335
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:46,039
I'm a heartless woman?

336
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:51,519
I can tell...

337
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:54,319
that you really love him.

338
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,240
Thank you, Dr. Xiao.

339
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:07,279
Thank you for listening to me.

340
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,920
Get some rest.

341
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:28,680
Unfortunately,

342
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,319
no matter how romantic and beautiful a relationship is,

343
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:32,279
you still have to face the torture of death.

344
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,759
It's someone else's love story.

345
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,240
How do you know it so well?

346
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,650
Are you his family?

347
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:38,650
Lin Ruo Lin shared...

348
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,559
their love story online.

349
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:43,480
I accidentally saw it...

350
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:45,039
when I was on the Internet.

351
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,680
Accidentally?

352
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:50,000
I think it was intentional.

353
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:51,359
Ms. Jiang.

354
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:52,920
Are you criticizing me again?

355
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:55,079
We're nurses,

356
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:56,599
not a gossip magazine.

357
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,200
Tell me.

358
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,319
Is talking about our patients' privacy...

359
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,440
an appropriate thing to do?

360
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:02,650
No.

361
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,839
Have you forgotten the lesson you got last time?

362
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:04,890
No, I didn't.

363
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:11,440
Poor thing, hurry and eat.

364
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,519
Remember it.

365
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:21,920
Mom.

366
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:23,079
Mom.

367
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:25,759
What are you doing?

368
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:27,279
We're inserting a nasogastric tube into him.

369
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:28,410
Mom.

370
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:30,960
About Dad's condition, we've already decided.

371
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:32,119
I don't agree.

372
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,720
Dr. Tang.

373
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,240
I'm Li Shi Lei's attending physician.

374
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,680
You should have told me...

375
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,759
that some of his family members...

376
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:40,410
requested for nasogastric intubation.

377
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:41,920
You acted on your own.

378
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,559
Who will take responsibility if something goes wrong?

379
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,319
But they're the patient's children.

380
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:49,650
The patient's wife didn't agree to it.

381
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,960
The family hasn't come to a consensus.

382
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,410
As doctors, how can we decide this on our own?

383
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,480
Dr. Tang.

384
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,920
We should separate our likes and dislikes...

385
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,119
from our profession as a doctor.

386
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,279
Dr. Xiao.

387
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:16,200
It's my mistake.

388
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:19,680
Dr. Xiao.

389
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,410
What should we do now?

390
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:27,200
Let's wait for the family's decision.

391
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:39,480
You've been together for decades.

392
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,279
You know him very well.

393
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:43,960
My dad has never been one to give up so easily.

394
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,759
Whether it's his work or his health,

395
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,650
as long as there's still hope for him,

396
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,799
he won't give up.

397
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:52,880
We also visited many doctors in the past two days.

398
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:54,960
That's how we came to this decision.

399
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:57,359
So your decision...

400
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,119
is to torture him with these cold tubes?

401
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:04,880
Mom.

402
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,119
I don't think our disagreement...

403
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,319
lies in whether Dad should be intubated or not.

404
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,960
It's about...

405
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,720
whether it's worth it for him to keep living.

406
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,200
How will he keep living?

407
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,640
What kind of quality of life will he have?

408
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:23,240
Didn't the doctor already tell you?

409
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,480
Most of his brain tissue is already dead.

410
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,880
His heart and lungs are starting to fail.

411
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,039
That means his life has reached its final stages.

412
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,119
We're educated people.

413
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,680
Can't you respect science?

414
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,440
Didn't the doctor also say...

415
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,319
that he still has half a year to live?

416
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:37,359
Never mind half a year,

417
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,559
but even if Dad is leaving us tomorrow,

418
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:42,160
we have to get through today with him.

419
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,920
We absolutely won't give up.

420
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:49,640
I won't give up either.

421
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,640
Mom.

422
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,079
It has been hard on you to take care of Dad all these years.

423
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:06,680
From now on,

424
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,799
Xiao Jie and I will take care of him.

425
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,519
Go home and get some rest.

426
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:25,839
I'm really sorry.

427
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,599
If your family cannot come to a consensus,

428
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:30,400
I can't insert a nasogastric tube in the patient.

429
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:31,599
Please understand.

430
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,440
Okay then.

431
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:34,960
I'll contact another hospital.

432
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:37,359
I hope you can cooperate and let us transfer hospitals.

433
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,920
As a doctor,

434
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:41,240
I don't recommend transferring the patient now.

435
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:44,480
The patient is very weak.

436
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:46,759
His life will be in danger if anything goes wrong.

437
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,960
If you think I'm trying to scare you...

438
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,039
and you don't trust me,

439
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,200
you can go to another hospital...

440
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,640
to consult another doctor.

441
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Dr. Xiao.

442
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:58,039
Do you also think the same as my mom?

443
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,279
Do you think we're torturing my dad?

444
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,279
In my opinion, neither you nor Ms. Lin...

445
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,880
is right or wrong.

446
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,400
Your ways of love are just different.

447
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,519
As for whether a nasogastric tube should be given to the patient,

448
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,319
your family should discuss it again.

449
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:15,759
I will respect your decision.

450
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:17,680
I'll get back to work then.

451
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:35,240
So? What did she say?

452
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:41,119
Li Song.

453
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,319
Let's find another hospital for Dad.

454
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,759
Hello, Dr. Zhang.

455
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,119
This is Li Song.

456
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,680
I'd like to consult you about my dad's condition again.

457
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,720
Hello.

458
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:11,799
Dr. Xiao.

459
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,200
This is Lin Ruo Yun.

460
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,960
I'd like to meet you.

461
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,000
I'm sorry about the nasogastric intubation.

462
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:23,799
It's not your fault.

463
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,559
I just didn't expect...

464
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:27,279
he would suffer so much...

465
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,240
in the last moments of his life.

466
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,559
I'm also helpless in the face of all of this.

467
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,200
That's what pains me the most.

468
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:37,599
I understand.

469
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,240
To your family,

470
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,279
the patient leaving you...

471
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:42,359
is an unbearable pain in your lives.

472
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,799
They've just made a different choice than you.

473
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:48,440
So don't blame yourself.

474
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:49,799
I know.

475
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,680
Neither of our ideas is right or wrong.

476
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:54,880
They want Shi Lei to live.

477
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,640
I don't want him to be stuck in a living nightmare.

478
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,839
I also promised Shi Lei...

479
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,920
that I wouldn't let him suffer in the last moments of his life.

480
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:14,599
For Shi Lei,

481
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,079
I must be brave.

482
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,480
I must persevere.

483
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:19,559
Dr. Xiao.

484
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,240
If you or your hospital...

485
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:23,319
is affected throughout all of this,

486
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,279
I'll apologize to you in advance now.

487
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:40,400
Dr. Song and Dr. Zhang said the same thing.

488
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,480
They don't recommend letting Dad leave the hospital.

489
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:43,839
Li Song, look.

490
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,920
What is it?

491
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,319
Stop taking photos.

492
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:53,839
- Be quiet. - Be quiet for a while.

493
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:55,359
- Be quiet for a moment. - If you have any questions,

494
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:58,000
you can go to our hospital's communication room.

495
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,839
They'll answer your questions there.

496
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:02,000
- Everybody, be quiet. - Please be quiet.

497
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,880
Be quiet, okay?

498
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,920
- We can't answer you right now. - What's going on?

499
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,680
Lin Ruo Yun went to the media and accused her son and daughter...

500
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,079
of torturing Li Shi Lei.

501
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:12,119
It's a trending topic now.

502
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,440
She's stirring up the public.

503
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,960
You're affecting our patients, okay?

504
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,599
We can't work with you here.

505
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:19,599
Regarding the decision...

506
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:20,680
of whether to insert the nasogastric tube or not,

507
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:22,400
you handled it well.

508
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:25,319
A doctor shouldn't get involved in the family's disputes.

509
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,240
You can only guide them toward a solution.

510
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:30,559
Whether the family chooses curative care...

511
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:32,440
or to let things go with the flow,

512
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,720
we are in no place to criticize them.

513
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,559
As doctors,

514
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,160
we must respect the opinions of our patients...

515
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,359
and their families...

516
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:40,119
and give them all the help they need.

517
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,720
A lot of times,

518
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:44,640
a person's journey to death...

519
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,960
is very long and painful.

520
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,640
But the family's opinion...

521
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,839
is to save them if we can.

522
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:53,119
So in a way,

523
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,880
this kind of behavior...

524
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,720
actually prolongs the patient's suffering.

525
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,960
Sometimes, it's really hard to make a decision.

526
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:03,279
Life's biggest frustration...

527
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,640
is not being able to choose life and death.

528
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:08,920
If the patient's family...

529
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,559
still cannot come to an agreement after some time,

530
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,920
I'll talk to them.

531
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,240
Does that sound good?

532
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,640
Don't let this get in the way of your work.

533
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,440
Go on.

534
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:08,599
Mom.

535
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,200
You want to keep the promise you made to Dad.

536
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,279
We understand that.

537
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,759
You want to reminisce about the love you had with Dad.

538
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:16,000
We have no objection to that.

539
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:17,759
What we can't accept...

540
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,079
is you exposing our family's private matters online.

541
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:23,599
When I see those netizens, who don't even know the truth,

542
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:25,599
continuously liking, sharing our story,

543
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:26,799
and criticizing us,

544
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:28,599
it feels like they're telling us,

545
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:31,119
"Why don't you let your dad hurry up and die?"

546
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,480
"You're making your parents suffer like this."

547
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,640
I find it so ridiculous. Do you understand that?

548
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:38,559
They're not talking about anyone else.

549
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:40,240
They're talking about our dad.

550
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:43,519
Mom.

551
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,079
You exposed our family matters to the public...

552
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,599
and let them judge us.

553
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,200
Is this what you call love?

554
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,440
Mom.

555
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,599
You worked hard to take care of Dad.

556
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,039
We acknowledge that.

557
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,519
Xiao Jie and I also ran around and wore ourselves out...

558
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:06,640
for Dad's health.

559
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,680
Your love is a child's love for his parents.

560
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,720
What we have is romantic love.

561
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,920
It's different.

562
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:15,720
So we just have to watch Dad die?

563
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,599
Mom. Why must you compete with us?

564
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,160
I don't want to compete with you.

565
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,720
I just want to tell you this.

566
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,000
If you insist on inserting a nasogastric tube in him,

567
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,279
I'm also going to tell the press and do interviews.

568
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,759
As long as I'm alive,

569
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,200
I won't allow you guys to do this.

570
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,480
Do you really have to do this?

571
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:33,799
Yes.

572
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,240
I wonder how their discussion is going.

573
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:44,920
I can't stand stubborn people...

574
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,079
who won't listen to others.

575
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,440
Aren't they tired?

576
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,960
Don't say that.

577
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:52,160
You don't know what they've been through.

578
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:54,599
You're judging them with your own moral values.

579
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:57,160
Besides, they've been together for 40 years.

580
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,759
They must really love each other.

581
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,079
Even if they do,

582
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,240
this isn't just about the two of them anymore.

583
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,759
Since they have children,

584
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:07,039
they should try their best to understand them...

585
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,440
and respect the ideas and thoughts of the next generation.

586
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,119
She told the public about their family matters...

587
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,759
just because she is at odds with her children.

588
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:14,559
This kind of love is too selfish.

589
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,200
What is it?

590
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:23,119
I think you're really cute.

591
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,160
How's my dad?

592
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:31,359
It's acute heart failure.

593
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:32,359
He's being resuscitated now.

594
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,160
Dr. Xiao.

595
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,119
The patient's condition is stable now.

596
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,359
Have you decided?

597
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:46,359
Mom.

598
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:48,519
Are you just going to watch Dad die?

599
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:51,279
- Mom, say something. - Mom.

600
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,200
Mom, can you bear to see him leave? Mom.

601
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:57,240
Insert the tube in for him.

602
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,640
Insert the nasogastric tube.

603
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,680
Insert the nasogastric tube.

604
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,759
I'd like to be alone with him for a while.

605
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:15,359
Is that okay?

606
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,000
Thank you.

607
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,640
A year ago,

608
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,200
when I held your hand like this,

609
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,000
you could respond to me.

610
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,640
I won't be able to get a response like that anymore.

611
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
The hardest thing to face in life is death.

612
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,359
I can't believe your life and death...

613
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,200
keep tearing my heart apart...

614
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,480
time and time again.

615
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:14,000
I'm sorry.

616
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:18,680
I tried one last time but failed again.

617
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:25,400
I can't do anything else for you anymore.

618
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:28,400
I can't cry or call out for you.

619
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,759
I hope it's like the doctor said.

620
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:35,319
You don't have me in your heart anymore.

621
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:38,599
But you...

622
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:42,200
will live in my heart forever.

623
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:46,920
Goodbye, Shi Lei.

624
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:59,559
Wait for me in the next life.

625
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:15,480
- Mom. - Mom.

626
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,880
These are the daily necessities that Shi Lei needs...

627
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,159
and precautions to take note of.

628
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,119
I'll leave him to you.

629
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:34,599
Mom.

630
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:35,679
All these years,

631
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,719
you've always taken care of Dad.

632
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,119
It has been hard on you.

633
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,329
Xiao Jie and I will take care of him from now on.

634
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,239
Go home and rest well.

635
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:44,679
If anything happens here,

636
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,079
I'll tell you right away.

637
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,599
I hope you can take care of Shi Lei the same way I did.

638
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:50,639
Mom.

639
00:34:50,809 --> 00:34:51,840
Don't worry.

640
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:54,039
Taking care of a patient like this...

641
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,159
is more difficult than you think.

642
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,519
It might even break you.

643
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,599
You must take care of yourselves.

644
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,239
These are sleeping pills.

645
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,960
They'll be of use to you.

646
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:13,329
Mom, don't worry.

647
00:35:55,809 --> 00:36:03,719
(Doctor's Office 2)

648
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,159
After that long struggle,

649
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:06,599
there's finally some peace and quiet.

650
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,960
In a way,

651
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:10,480
I think this is a good thing.

652
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:13,159
A good thing?

653
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:14,159
Think about it.

654
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:15,719
This was the patient's family matter.

655
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,519
Now, because the children's argument with their mom...

656
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:19,679
was posted on the Internet,

657
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,079
it became a social topic...

658
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:22,679
that garnered a lot of attention.

659
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,000
China is an aging society now,

660
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,199
so their medical case...

661
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:29,880
is actually very typical.

662
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:32,880
There are actually a lot of families and patients...

663
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,360
who face decision dilemmas...

664
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,159
and need society's help and support.

665
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,289
There are many discussions based on their case online.

666
00:36:40,329 --> 00:36:43,360
For example, how to take care of Alzheimer's patients...

667
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,840
and how to face eventual death.

668
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:48,719
So...

669
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:51,079
this chaotic family...

670
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:54,329
ended up bringing something positive and valuable.

671
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,329
Now that you mention it,

672
00:36:56,329 --> 00:36:57,840
it does sound like a good thing.

673
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:22,559
What are you thinking about?

674
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:26,769
I heard...

675
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:29,679
the matter with Lin Ruo Yun and her husband is settled.

676
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:31,769
The family has come to a consensus...

677
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,329
and agreed to nasogastric intubation.

678
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:38,119
Speaking of which,

679
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:39,599
if this had happened in the past,

680
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:41,960
I would've fought until the end with the children.

681
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:43,769
I told you.

682
00:37:43,769 --> 00:37:45,599
I've been unknowingly brainwashed by you.

683
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,239
Living in pain is still better than death.

684
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,289
That's how a lot of people think.

685
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:55,719
But there's also a small group of people...

686
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,239
who are like Lin Ruo Yun.

687
00:37:57,719 --> 00:37:59,079
They choose to face reality.

688
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:02,480
There's no right or wrong when it comes to these things.

689
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:13,679
Look.

690
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,559
These are the comments on her Weibo.

691
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:24,239
So many people are arguing,

692
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:25,440
but there's no result.

693
00:38:25,809 --> 00:38:28,000
So just let it go.

694
00:38:42,289 --> 00:38:44,809
Tang Hua's mom arranged a lot of blind dates for her?

695
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:47,199
Two of them even ran into each other.

696
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,519
It was quite awkward.

697
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:49,880
No matter how anxious Mrs. Tang is,

698
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,360
she can't do this.

699
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,039
I guess Mrs. Tang is so anxious that she doesn't care anymore.

700
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:56,119
But from what I see,

701
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,079
Mrs. Tang won't stop.

702
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,119
Who knows what other trouble there will be?

703
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,769
You're purposely sending these people to disgust me, right?

704
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,039
If they keep coming to mess around,

705
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,809
I'm cutting ties with you.

706
00:39:13,329 --> 00:39:14,329
Tang Hua.

707
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,559
Stop showing up in front of me.

708
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:17,559
I'm annoyed right now.

709
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:18,809
I know you're annoyed.

710
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,199
I have a way to free you of your troubles.

711
00:39:20,289 --> 00:39:21,599
You have a way?

712
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:22,960
What can you do?

713
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,039
The reason Mrs. Tang is doing so much...

714
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:26,400
is actually quite simple.

715
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:28,880
She just wants you to find a boyfriend as soon as possible.

716
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:30,639
If you fulfill her wish,

717
00:39:30,809 --> 00:39:32,329
then she'll stop.

718
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,239
I knew I couldn't count on you.

719
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:35,639
If I had a boyfriend,

720
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:36,880
would I be so troubled?

721
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,239
What I mean is...

722
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,000
you can get a fake boyfriend.

723
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:44,480
Get a fake boyfriend?

724
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,480
Get lost.

725
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,809
I was in a drama club when I was in college.

726
00:39:47,809 --> 00:39:48,960
My acting is not bad.

727
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:51,329
If I got a boyfriend like you,

728
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,079
my mom would jump in a river.

729
00:40:02,289 --> 00:40:03,360
What's the matter?

730
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,679
Why do you look so glum?

731
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:06,719
You haven't been yourself all morning.

732
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,239
Last night,

733
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,840
my mom talked to me for half the night.

734
00:40:11,329 --> 00:40:13,159
I was in a daze the whole day.

735
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,559
I almost made a huge mistake.

736
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,159
If she continues this,

737
00:40:16,329 --> 00:40:17,960
I really don't know what to do.

738
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:19,329
That can't be.

739
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,769
I think Mrs. Tang will only do this once in a while.

740
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,239
She's getting on in years.

741
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:24,519
If she doesn't get any sleep at night every day,

742
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:25,599
she won't be able to handle it.

743
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,360
Don't underestimate my mom.

744
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:30,199
My mom was a night owl when she was young.

745
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:32,079
She's retired now.

746
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,119
She has plenty of time to catch up on sleep during the day.

747
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,519
She's prepared for a long-term battle with me.

748
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:39,400
If this goes on, I'll go crazy first.

749
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,039
Then why don't you consider Chen Zhi's suggestion?

750
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:46,360
In his dreams.

751
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,599
I didn't say you have to find Chen Zhi.

752
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:50,519
He's not the only guy in our department.

753
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:51,920
Then who do you think...

754
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,000
is suitable for me?

755
00:40:58,239 --> 00:40:59,840
What are you two talking about, pretty ladies?

756
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,840
Why are you so mysterious?

757
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:08,159
Dr. Xu.

758
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,440
You've been working too hard these days.

759
00:41:12,329 --> 00:41:14,400
Have some cola to perk yourself up.

760
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,039
Most importantly,

761
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:18,289
we need your help.

762
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,440
Of course.

763
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,480
Tell me.

764
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:23,119
What needs to be moved in the department this time?

765
00:41:23,329 --> 00:41:24,329
Xu Yi Ran,

766
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:25,679
I want you to be my boyfriend.

767
00:41:28,329 --> 00:41:29,769
This sip really woke me up.

768
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:32,199
Really?

769
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:33,239
No.

770
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,809
I mean, my fake boyfriend.

771
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,119
Did you have to react like that?

772
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,769
I feel very sorry for your situation,

773
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:39,960
but I'm afraid I can't help you.

774
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,809
Dr. Xu, why are you being like this?

775
00:41:41,809 --> 00:41:43,000
I even helped you when you asked me...

776
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,199
to pretend to be your fiancée.

777
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:45,599
That's exactly the point.

778
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,920
Think about it.

779
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:48,519
Just a few days ago,

780
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:49,960
I put on an act in front of Mrs. Tang...

781
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:51,880
and told her Lin Zhi was my fiancée.

782
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:53,199
But just a few days later,

783
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,239
I've become Tang Hua's boyfriend.

784
00:41:55,809 --> 00:41:58,289
Mrs. Tang would kick me out right away.

785
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,289
How could I forget that?

786
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:02,329
You can't fool her forever.

787
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:03,920
I suggest you just find a real one.

788
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,440
It might even be easier than finding a fake one.

789
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:07,880
I don't care about "forever" right now.

790
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,559
I just care about this moment now.

791
00:42:09,719 --> 00:42:11,769
Actually, if you have to find a fake one,

792
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:14,239
it's not like there isn't a suitable candidate.

793
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,119
Are you talking about Chen Zhi?

794
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:17,639
I wouldn't ask him even if it's just a fake boyfriend.

795
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:18,920
I'm annoyed every time I see him.

796
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:20,519
You may be annoyed,

797
00:42:20,769 --> 00:42:23,000
but first, Chen Zhi will definitely be willing to help you.

798
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:26,159
He'll listen to everything you say.

799
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,519
I still won't choose him.

800
00:42:28,769 --> 00:42:30,360
Then you can only choose...

801
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:32,519
between Mom Lu and Bai Zhu.

802
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:34,679
Just kill me.

803
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,440
I can't help you.

804
00:42:49,719 --> 00:42:50,769
Chen Zhi.

805
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,880
I'll give you a chance.

806
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,880
Be my fake boyfriend.
