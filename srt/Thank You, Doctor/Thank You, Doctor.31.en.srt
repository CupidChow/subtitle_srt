00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,080
Xiao Rui.

5
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,839
Xiao Rui!

6
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:03,800
Can I have a word with you?

7
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,479
If you want to blame someone, blame me.

8
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,880
I apologize to you.

9
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,000
Mom.

10
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,280
I know.

11
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,800
You did that...

12
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,160
because of what happened to your mom.

13
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,839
But you can't leave your dad to die...

14
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:25,000
just for this one thing.

15
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,199
Mom.

16
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,199
You didn't do anything wrong.

17
00:02:28,839 --> 00:02:30,079
You don't need to apologize.

18
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,479
Su Rui.

19
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:34,759
Are you crazy?

20
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:37,519
Don't you know what the situation was back then?

21
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,079
Your mom thought my dad couldn't make money,

22
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,919
so she got on with her boss.

23
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,239
It became a mess and she wanted to divorce my dad.

24
00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:45,799
Then her boss didn't want her anymore,

25
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,560
so she wanted to reconcile with my dad.

26
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,039
Is that possible? You're a man too.

27
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,280
Would you be able to accept it?

28
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:53,160
My dad met my mom after he divorced your mom.

29
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:55,239
My dad felt terrible that your mom got sick and passed away.

30
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,410
Do you know how long he was sad for?

31
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,280
- Shut up! - Let me tell you, Su Rui.

32
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,639
This all started because of your mom.

33
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,919
It's your mom's fault!

34
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,359
- No... - What are you doing?

35
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,160
This is a hospital.

36
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:13,560
Xiao Rui.

37
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,440
It's bad blood of the previous generation.

38
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,400
It's all in the past.

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,039
Now,

40
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,759
you're the only one...

41
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:25,400
who can save your dad.

42
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,799
I'm begging you.

43
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,560
Mom, please get up.

44
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,160
Please save him.

45
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:46,079
- Mom, get up. - Xiao Rui.

46
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,319
Save him!

47
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,440
Mom.

48
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,000
Xiao Rui!

49
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,720
Xiao Rui.

50
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,639
Do you want your dad to die?

51
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,759
Xiao Rui.

52
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:01,639
I'm begging you.

53
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,840
Please save your dad.

54
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,680
I'm begging you...

55
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:20,680
This is what he chose.

56
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,560
Xiao Rui!

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,359
Xiao Rui, come back.

58
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,680
Ma'am, please get up.

59
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,960
We'll think of something else.

60
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:33,079
Mom.

61
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:40,999
It's 38.5 degrees Celsius.

62
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:49,559
Dr. Bai, the test results are out.

63
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:53,879
The CT scan result shows no obvious abnormalities.

64
00:04:56,359 --> 00:04:57,600
CKIs are elevated.

65
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,879
Protein is low.

66
00:04:59,239 --> 00:05:00,400
There's a problem with his heart.

67
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,520
Ultrasound.

68
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,439
Decreased heart valve activity.

69
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:18,559
His spleen is enlarged.

70
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,879
He also has a high fever...

71
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,770
which is causing hypoproteinemia.

72
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,999
Is it an autoimmune disease?

73
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,239
It's possible.

74
00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:27,280
We'll do this.

75
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,330
Run another antibody test for the patient.

76
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,119
How is Xiao Rui?

77
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,999
Dad.

78
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,479
He doesn't care whether you live or die.

79
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,280
Why do you still care about him?

80
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:51,400
Don't talk to your dad like that.

81
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,359
He was fine.

82
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:57,479
Why did he faint?

83
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,559
Did the doctor say...

84
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:01,720
if it's serious?

85
00:06:02,119 --> 00:06:03,359
He deserved it.

86
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,479
Get out.

87
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
Go.

88
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:12,239
I just asked the doctor.

89
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,999
They don't know what it is yet...

90
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,479
and still need to run some tests.

91
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,679
I hope it's nothing serious.

92
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:23,799
I don't know how things turned out like this.

93
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,559
Ming Jun.

94
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,999
You should worry about yourself.

95
00:06:29,999 --> 00:06:33,239
When his mom passed away,

96
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,559
I should have taken him with me.

97
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,919
He suffered so much...

98
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,080
while living with his uncles.

99
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,999
I was too selfish.

100
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,799
It's not your fault.

101
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:56,039
It's mine.

102
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,799
When I was pregnant with Xin Xin,

103
00:06:59,679 --> 00:07:01,280
I was afraid I couldn't take care of Xiao Rui...

104
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,679
if he came.

105
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,879
I didn't know it would be like this.

106
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,520
The person he should hate the most is me.

107
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,799
It's me.

108
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:33,640
The patient's son is so cruel.

109
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,879
I know.

110
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:37,280
First, he agreed to the transplant and gave him hope.

111
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,600
At the last minute,

112
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:39,999
he pulled out.

113
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,160
He said it's the punishment for what the patient did back then.

114
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:43,520
That's too cruel.

115
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,960
Else, how could he...

116
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,999
a president of such a big company at such a young age?

117
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,799
Cruelty is a skill too.

118
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,200
Ya Jie.

119
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:54,200
If your Bai Zhu is also that cruel,

120
00:07:55,119 --> 00:07:56,359
would you still want to marry him?

121
00:07:57,799 --> 00:07:59,679
Bai Zhu has the softest heart.

122
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,799
He'll never be this cruel.

123
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,999
Seems like you won't be able to do anything big in this life.

124
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,679
For richer or for poorer,

125
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,080
I will be with him for the rest of my life.

126
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:17,359
The wedding vows are out.

127
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,799
There's no point in being jealous. This is called being a fool.

128
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,879
Hello.

129
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,760
Okay, I got it.

130
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,960
The test results are out. Let's go.

131
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:31,200
I'll go take a look too.

132
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,720
You're all leaving?

133
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,919
Boring.

134
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:45,960
How is it?

135
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,960
The antibody test showed...

136
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,320
that it's not an autoimmune disease.

137
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,999
Could it be an infection then?

138
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:59,440
Run another blood test and a CT scan.

139
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,519
Okay.

140
00:09:03,479 --> 00:09:04,840
Based on the results,

141
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,050
I think it's an infection.

142
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,840
There are so many kinds of pathogens that can cause infections.

143
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,999
Which one could it be?

144
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,519
Based on the test results and symptoms so far,

145
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,639
I don't see any abnormalities.

146
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:15,930
I can't tell which one it is.

147
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,720
Should we send for a sputum culture and blood culture test?

148
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:20,720
But the cultures take time to cultivate.

149
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,440
I'm afraid it'll take about a week...

150
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,690
for the results.

151
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,279
The patient can't wait that long.

152
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,720
Do you have a better idea?

153
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:30,810
I'm sure there is.

154
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:35,690
Let's do a sputum smear first.

155
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,320
Maybe we'll find something.

156
00:09:38,479 --> 00:09:39,600
Let's go to the lab.

157
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:45,519
Okay, you can get the medicine.

158
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,879
Okay. Thank you, Dr. Bai.

159
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,479
We found a matching bone marrow.

160
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,639
Heping Hospital just uploaded...

161
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:53,690
a bone marrow donor's profile.

162
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:55,359
It's not a perfect match.

163
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:56,690
For Human Leukocyte Antigen testing,

164
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,359
four out of six can be a match.

165
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:00,999
Half-match transplants can cause severe rejection.

166
00:10:00,999 --> 00:10:02,050
At least,

167
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,519
it'll give him a chance to live.

168
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,810
He will live the rest of his life in pain.

169
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,200
Just like Jiang Xian Yun.

170
00:10:07,479 --> 00:10:09,560
No, there's a critical problem.

171
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:12,320
He doesn't have time to wait for a perfect bone marrow match.

172
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,759
I've uploaded his information...

173
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:14,810
to the foreign bone marrow bank.

174
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,119
They'll get back to us soon.

175
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,720
Let's put aside the low probability of a successful match.

176
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:21,050
Even if, we find a suitable bone marrow donor,

177
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:22,159
they are abroad.

178
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,810
Can they come for the transplant in time?

179
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:25,960
We can't joke around with the patient's life.

180
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,519
I'm not joking.

181
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:29,479
I'll contact the donor later...

182
00:10:29,479 --> 00:10:30,810
and tell them to be prepared.

183
00:10:30,999 --> 00:10:32,239
But this is my last option.

184
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,440
I'll emphasize this once more.

185
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,440
The patient has only a few days left.

186
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,840
- Let's not... - Don't argue with me.

187
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,639
I'm his attending doctor. Listen to me.

188
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:43,720
Okay, listen up.

189
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,930
He's no longer your patient.

190
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,720
I'll take on this patient myself.

191
00:10:51,119 --> 00:10:52,119
Sure.

192
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:53,930
Take him on if you're so good.

193
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,359
Take them all.

194
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,810
A half-match transplant...

195
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,600
could lead to serious rejection.

196
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,930
So we'll put this plan at the end.

197
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:06,279
Until then,

198
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:08,399
we'll keep looking for a suitable bone marrow.

199
00:11:08,479 --> 00:11:09,479
Doctor.

200
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,200
You just said that if he's unlucky...

201
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,639
and no pathogen can be detected,

202
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,479
Xiao Rui won't make it.

203
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,759
I was talking about your condition.

204
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,200
Tell me.

205
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:27,359
Is Xiao Rui in danger?

206
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:32,680
The culture results aren't out yet.

207
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,840
For the time being, we can only administer medication empirically.

208
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,800
Is there anything I can do?

209
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,279
Sometimes, diagnosing takes time.

210
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:41,680
We have to observe...

211
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:42,840
the development of his condition...

212
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,840
and give him a few more tests...

213
00:11:44,999 --> 00:11:47,239
to see what caused the disease.

214
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,519
Let's say someone has the same sickness.

215
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,680
They're sicker...

216
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,960
and have more symptoms.

217
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,320
Could you be able to find out...

218
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,680
the cause of the disease faster?

219
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:01,359
Well, it's possible.

220
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,920
Then I'm willing to be infected.

221
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:06,519
What?

222
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,080
This could be the chance...

223
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,920
God is giving me to atone for my sins.

224
00:12:12,119 --> 00:12:14,359
If you're infected with the pathogen in your condition,

225
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,479
there will be no hope for you.

226
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,279
A life for a life.

227
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,080
If my death...

228
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
can save my son,

229
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,720
I'll accept it.

230
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,359
Don't think too much.

231
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,879
We won't let you do that.

232
00:12:27,119 --> 00:12:28,239
Don't be too pessimistic.

233
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,560
As for the bone marrow,

234
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:30,759
we'll continue to find it for you.

235
00:12:30,999 --> 00:12:32,080
Have a good rest.

236
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,359
My illness...

237
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,639
is incurable.

238
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,440
If I could find the right bone marrow,

239
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,279
I would have found it a long time ago.

240
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,239
I have leukemia.

241
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,080
It has come and gone for three times.

242
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:52,080
I don't want to suffer anymore.

243
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,639
Doctor.

244
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:56,879
Please let me die in peace.

245
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,200
Let me do something for Xiao Rui.

246
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:06,399
First of all, we don't know what the disease is yet.

247
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,680
The site and route of infection are also unclear.

248
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,960
Besides,

249
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:11,720
that is against medical ethics.

250
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,080
We would never do that.

251
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:14,399
Don't think like that anymore.

252
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,879
- Doctor. - All right, stop talking.

253
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,119
Rest well.

254
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:19,159
Rest well.

255
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,560
- Dr. Lu. - Dr. Lu.

256
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,999
- You two. - What is it, Dr. Lu?

257
00:13:27,999 --> 00:13:29,159
Has the source of the disease been found...

258
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,320
for the son of the leukemia patient?

259
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:32,800
The result of the culture smear is not out yet.

260
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,720
It's full of these patients these days.

261
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,440
What a headache.

262
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,279
You have to be careful.

263
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:41,600
Don't let anything go wrong.

264
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,560
Don't worry. That's Bai Zhu's patient.

265
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,560
There won't be a problem.

266
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,080
He's the one I'm most worried about.

267
00:13:46,119 --> 00:13:47,159
Dr. Lu.

268
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,399
A patient is asking for you.

269
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,600
Me?

270
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:52,800
Shadow in right lower lung.

271
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,159
Common pneumonia.

272
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,639
Take some medicine to fight the infection first.

273
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,960
- Are you done here? - What is it?

274
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,320
Come to my office when you're done.

275
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,560
Why does the leukemia patient...

276
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,119
insist on infecting the pathogen?

277
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,279
Do you think...

278
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,119
I ordered the patient to do that?

279
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,999
Dr. Lu, didn't the patient say?

280
00:14:24,359 --> 00:14:26,440
He went to you because Bai Zhu didn't agree to it.

281
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:28,560
Doesn't that mean Bai Zhu didn't make him do it?

282
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,239
Dr. Lu, it's true that Dr. Bai rejected the patient's request.

283
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:34,920
If he hadn't said anything,

284
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,239
the patient wouldn't have had such a thought.

285
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,560
The patient thought of it himself indeed.

286
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,960
So what if the patient came up with it?

287
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:43,479
I already told you.

288
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,119
Pay attention...

289
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:46,519
to how you communicate with the patients.

290
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,479
You might say something you don't mean...

291
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:49,840
but they will take it to heart.

292
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,119
In whatever you do,

293
00:14:53,119 --> 00:14:54,759
don't only think of quick success.

294
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:56,479
Who's more impatient here?

295
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:57,639
Enough.

296
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:58,879
I'm the patient's attending doctor.

297
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:00,720
The treatment is for me to decide.

298
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,840
Listen up, Bai Zhu.

299
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,840
I'm the chief of EICU.

300
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,440
Yet you're barking up the wrong tree.

301
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,639
Watch what you say.

302
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,159
I think you just want to be better than others.

303
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,479
That's why you're using unscrupulous ways.

304
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,359
Let me tell you.

305
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:15,920
Always put the patient's safety as your responsibility.

306
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,440
That's how a doctor should be.

307
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:20,279
All right.

308
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:21,960
Dr. Lu, what you said makes sense. He knows it all.

309
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,999
But it's really not his fault this time.

310
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,560
Look, Bai Zhu.

311
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,560
As long as you're in the EICU,

312
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,840
you have to listen to me.

313
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,560
Otherwise, please leave this place.

314
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,879
I don't need a black sheep like you here.

315
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,720
Talk to each other again...

316
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,560
when you two have calmed down.

317
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:02,359
What do you think?

318
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,600
What do I think?

319
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,759
He said I'm impatient and unscrupulous.

320
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,040
I think you both were worked up...

321
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,320
and said things out of anger.

322
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,879
It doesn't matter if I said things out of anger.

323
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,080
What do you think?

324
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:19,519
I think...

325
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,320
Dr. Lu has your best interests at heart.

326
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:35,359
Come in.

327
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,600
Dr. Jiang.

328
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:40,040
Good timing. I was looking for you.

329
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:41,200
I'm leaving the EICU.

330
00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:42,440
Sit down.

331
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:45,720
You already know?

332
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,720
I know your bad temper.

333
00:16:48,119 --> 00:16:49,999
Dr. Lu told me about your performance lately.

334
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:51,159
I knew...

335
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,399
that you'd pull some kind of trick.

336
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,239
- Then do you agree? - No.

337
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,960
Staying in the EICU is just a waste of my life.

338
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,040
An argument at work is a waste of life?

339
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,759
I asked around about the patient...

340
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:05,960
asking to be infected.

341
00:17:06,239 --> 00:17:07,600
Regardless if it was intentional,

342
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,040
this only happened...

343
00:17:09,239 --> 00:17:10,999
because of you.

344
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,960
Let alone Dr. Lu,

345
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:14,960
I'd scold you too if f it were me.

346
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,639
- But I was just telling the truth. - All right.

347
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,840
Having an argument at work is normal.

348
00:17:19,999 --> 00:17:21,399
We're not discussing this today.

349
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,279
Tell me.

350
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,600
What's the real reason...

351
00:17:25,639 --> 00:17:26,919
you want to leave the EICU?

352
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,159
Staying in the EICU...

353
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,359
is a waste of my time and skills.

354
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,250
Tell me the truth.

355
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:44,840
Does it have something to do with Xiao Yan?

356
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,800
What does it have to do with her?

357
00:17:49,639 --> 00:17:51,320
Dr. Jiang, did you hear something from someone?

358
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,490
Look at you all flustered.

359
00:17:54,399 --> 00:17:55,840
Everyone in the EICU could tell.

360
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,159
And I'm not blind or deaf.

361
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,679
I don't need anyone to tell me what's happening.

362
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,560
I don't care if she's related to this or not.

363
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,919
You know it better than I do.

364
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,359
I'm your teacher.

365
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,399
No one in this hospital...

366
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:16,770
knows you better than I do.

367
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:20,250
You look arrogant on the outside.

368
00:18:20,439 --> 00:18:22,250
But on the inside,

369
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,490
you're very fragile.

370
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:26,770
Who's fragile?

371
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:29,250
Sit down.

372
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,490
I sent you to the EICU...

373
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,800
to let you practice in the most boring...

374
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,320
and difficult place.

375
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,919
You're a diamond in the rough.

376
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,879
I want to make you shine.

377
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:50,080
You still have a long life ahead of you.

378
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,199
You'll go through many trials and tribulations.

379
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:56,520
If you can't even handle...

380
00:18:56,919 --> 00:18:58,119
a small setback in love,

381
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,359
then how will you...

382
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:01,119
face the diseases calmly?

383
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:03,919
It'll be impossible for you...

384
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,439
to face the cruel deaths all the more.

385
00:19:07,199 --> 00:19:09,439
How will you become an outstanding doctor?

386
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:15,399
I'm sorry for disappointing you.

387
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,679
Don't be sorry.

388
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:22,770
Bai Zhu.

389
00:19:27,439 --> 00:19:28,490
Have you ever thought...

390
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,919
of becoming a great doctor?

391
00:19:38,199 --> 00:19:39,800
I want to be a great doctor.

392
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:41,959
That has always been my dream.

393
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:45,840
I still remember when I was in school.

394
00:19:46,639 --> 00:19:48,399
In the first class you gave me,

395
00:19:49,199 --> 00:19:51,159
you introduced us to a lot of great doctors.

396
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,719
At that time, I thought,

397
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,800
"Bai Zhu."

398
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:58,840
"One day,"

399
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,879
"you'll be like them."

400
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,119
"You'll save lives..."

401
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,560
"and leave a mark in this world."

402
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:07,879
You can't give up halfway.

403
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,250
I won't allow you to.

404
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:16,600
Go back.

405
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,520
Apologize to Dr. Lu.

406
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,679
He's your superior after all...

407
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:23,159
and also your senior.

408
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,919
Show some respect.

409
00:20:26,399 --> 00:20:27,399
Okay.

410
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:28,770
Go.

411
00:20:33,439 --> 00:20:34,520
Bai Zhu.

412
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,719
You're the best and most talented young doctor...

413
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:39,600
I've ever met in my life.

414
00:20:42,639 --> 00:20:43,840
Don't let me down.

415
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,879
I know that.

416
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,119
Close the door.

417
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,439
(Human doctors)

418
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,010
You're really here.

419
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:19,490
You went to see Dr. Jiang...

420
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,840
after arguing with Mom Lu?

421
00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:24,010
You want to quit?

422
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,119
But based on my guess,

423
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,800
I don't think Dr. Jiang agreed to it.

424
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,560
In the entire Tongshan Hospital,

425
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,919
the only person who can control your monkey ways...

426
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,719
is the Buddha, Dr. Jiang.

427
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,600
No.

428
00:21:39,439 --> 00:21:40,560
There's one more person now.

429
00:21:45,199 --> 00:21:46,280
Dr. Jiang said...

430
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:49,399
I have the potential to become a great doctor.

431
00:21:51,639 --> 00:21:53,040
Dr. Jiang thinks highly of you.

432
00:21:58,119 --> 00:21:59,399
I know that.

433
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,280
Look at you.

434
00:22:10,639 --> 00:22:11,639
Doctor.

435
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:14,600
Are the test results out?

436
00:22:16,439 --> 00:22:17,719
What illness do I have?

437
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,320
Is it serious?

438
00:22:21,199 --> 00:22:22,280
This is karma.

439
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,280
It's you.

440
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:29,320
- What are you doing here? - Scared?

441
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:31,600
That's because you've done too many bad things.

442
00:22:34,879 --> 00:22:36,040
Are you here to threaten me again...

443
00:22:36,879 --> 00:22:38,240
because you failed to beg?

444
00:22:39,639 --> 00:22:40,719
Listen.

445
00:22:41,719 --> 00:22:43,800
I won't be his donor.

446
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:47,359
Never.

447
00:22:52,399 --> 00:22:54,480
My dad visited you every year.

448
00:22:54,879 --> 00:22:57,159
But your uncles would never let him past the door.

449
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,719
The birthday presents he bought you...

450
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,800
never once got to you.

451
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:03,240
He could only bring them back with him...

452
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,600
and put them in a special cabinet.

453
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:08,119
He thought he could give them to you altogether one day.

454
00:23:09,199 --> 00:23:11,919
But he never had the chance even until you entered college.

455
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,800
He said "Transformers" was your favorite.

456
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,399
So most of the gifts were "Transformers".

457
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,080
Then you grew up.

458
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,159
He didn't know what you liked.

459
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:28,000
I could only buy things that all boys like,

460
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,560
like game consoles, soccer ball, and basketball.

461
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,639
One time,

462
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:35,080
he even bought tickets...

463
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,000
to Ronaldo's meet-and-greet in China.

464
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:38,439
- He wanted... - That's enough.

465
00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:41,760
It's useless to come at my emotions.

466
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,639
Ever since he abandoned me and my mom,

467
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,159
I've felt nothing for him.

468
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,240
Wait. The doctor is busy.

469
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,879
Don't get in the way.

470
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,760
Mom, what's wrong with Dad?

471
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:20,040
He's unconscious.

472
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,919
Family members, please wait outside.

473
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,040
Calm down.

474
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,359
Contact the donor from Heping Hospital.

475
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:27,919
- Get ready for an examination. - Okay.

476
00:24:33,879 --> 00:24:35,119
- It's over there. - Okay. Thank you.

477
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:36,119
Dr. Bai.

478
00:24:36,879 --> 00:24:38,040
I got it.

479
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:39,199
What did you find?

480
00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:42,320
Su Rui's pathogenic test was a fungal infection.

481
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:43,800
It's histoplasma capsulatum.

482
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:45,639
That would explain...

483
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,639
the opening in the lung.

484
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:00,560
You're lucky.

485
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,560
It didn't take long to find the cause of your infection.

486
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,280
We'll give you an antifungal treatment...

487
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,560
with amphotericin.

488
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,359
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

489
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:12,480
Thank you.

490
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:18,919
How's Su Ming Jun?

491
00:25:19,639 --> 00:25:21,560
His problem is more serious now.

492
00:25:21,879 --> 00:25:23,199
He's now in a coma.

493
00:25:23,879 --> 00:25:26,000
We'll also prepare the donor for surgery...

494
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,240
and operate as soon as possible.

495
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,119
But it's not a perfect match.

496
00:25:30,439 --> 00:25:31,560
After the surgery,

497
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,320
he'll suffer a lot and be in a lot of pain.

498
00:25:34,639 --> 00:25:36,520
But at least, he gets to live.

499
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,800
We know...

500
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,800
you don't want to get too involved...

501
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:48,240
with your dad.

502
00:25:48,719 --> 00:25:50,040
But your dad couldn't do that.

503
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:53,159
When he knew you had a serious illness...

504
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:55,719
where your life might be in danger and we couldn't find the cause,

505
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,600
he told us...

506
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,480
he wanted to get infected by the same pathogen...

507
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:00,879
and have the same illness...

508
00:26:01,439 --> 00:26:03,840
to help us doctors find out the cause of the disease faster.

509
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:05,439
But don't worry.

510
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,320
We wouldn't let him do that.

511
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,520
To a patient with advanced leukemia,

512
00:26:11,719 --> 00:26:13,119
it's equivalent to suicide.

513
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:15,359
But your dad insisted.

514
00:26:15,719 --> 00:26:17,520
He found a bone marrow donor,

515
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:19,080
although not a perfect match,

516
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:20,639
he'll live at least.

517
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,359
But he...

518
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:25,359
is willing to give up his own life to save you.

519
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,639
He said it's because you're his son.

520
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,480
He owes you too much.

521
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,320
As a dad, he has to do that.

522
00:26:36,439 --> 00:26:37,560
Actually,

523
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:39,639
after these few days,

524
00:26:39,719 --> 00:26:40,800
we can tell...

525
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:42,240
that you and your dad...

526
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,719
still care about each other.

527
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,439
Mr. Su, have you ever thought...

528
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:48,719
about why...

529
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,320
your love for your dad is out of place?

530
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,560
He's at that age...

531
00:26:53,639 --> 00:26:55,520
to wait for his children's gratitude.

532
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,359
But you've been waiting for your dad's apology.

533
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,320
There's an old saying that goes,

534
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:03,879
"When the child wants to repay, the parents are no longer around."

535
00:27:05,399 --> 00:27:06,560
As doctors,

536
00:27:06,639 --> 00:27:08,679
we've seen too many life and death.

537
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,119
We've felt too many regrets that were never expressed.

538
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,399
You and your dad still have time.

539
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,959
You have a chance.

540
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:18,280
Why don't you cherish it?

541
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:29,959
Dr. Xiao.

542
00:27:32,199 --> 00:27:33,600
If I do the transplant now,

543
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,800
will it be too late?

544
00:27:41,719 --> 00:27:42,879
He really agreed?

545
00:27:44,199 --> 00:27:45,919
Is he trying to trick us again?

546
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:46,959
Don't worry.

547
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:48,560
Once his condition stabilizes,

548
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,800
I'll have the hematologist...

549
00:27:49,879 --> 00:27:50,879
start the evaluation right away.

550
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:53,719
That's great!

551
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,359
Ming Jun.

552
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:58,879
You can be saved.

553
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,639
You can be saved, Ming Jun.

554
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,040
Dr. Bai.

555
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,080
You're not leaving, are you?

556
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,080
Where to?

557
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,760
Didn't you say you're leaving the EICU?

558
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:13,000
Who told you that?

559
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,560
So you're not leaving?

560
00:28:14,719 --> 00:28:15,760
Don't listen to nonsense.

561
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,359
That day, I wanted to tell you...

562
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:19,119
that I believe you.

563
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,879
Too late. It doesn't count.

564
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,199
I'm here to apologize.

565
00:28:39,959 --> 00:28:41,000
Earlier,

566
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:42,280
I was too impulsive.

567
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,639
I shouldn't have said that about you.

568
00:28:47,639 --> 00:28:49,320
Actually, you don't have to apologize to me.

569
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,959
You were right.

570
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,399
Sometimes,

571
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,840
I indeed...

572
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,879
want to show off my skills.

573
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,719
But it can't be helped.

574
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,119
Excellent people...

575
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,560
have high expectations of themselves.

576
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:08,119
But...

577
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:10,600
I should apologize to you too.

578
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,000
I was rude before.

579
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:15,240
Okay.

580
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,520
Let's put this behind us.

581
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,439
There are still many things to do.

582
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:23,679
Get back to work.

583
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,280
Xin Xin.

584
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:00,040
Your dad is awake.

585
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,480
Dad.

586
00:30:28,719 --> 00:30:33,719
(Xiao Rui is fine.)

587
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,119
Brother.

588
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:25,800
Thank you.

589
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:34,399
Let's go.

590
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:46,520
Okay. Is everyone here?

591
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:48,399
I have something to announce.

592
00:31:48,639 --> 00:31:50,919
This year's Hospital Development Conference...

593
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:51,959
is being held.

594
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,520
This conference...

595
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,280
has garnered great attention...

596
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,639
from the national media.

597
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,600
It is the most grand industry event...

598
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:00,959
of the year

599
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:03,000
Is our department taking part? I'll sign up.

600
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:05,800
We've had too many patients lately.

601
00:32:05,879 --> 00:32:07,760
We won't assign any staff to take part.

602
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,040
According to hospital regulations,

603
00:32:09,439 --> 00:32:11,840
tomorrow, a committee of the Hospital Development Conference...

604
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,080
will come to our department...

605
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:15,439
for a survey visit.

606
00:32:15,639 --> 00:32:17,080
Everyone must take it seriously.

607
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,760
Is bowing down to them...

608
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:20,199
and flattery enough?

609
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,520
Don't joke around.

610
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,320
Well...

611
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,679
Don't worry, everyone.

612
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,399
Just see your patients...

613
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:29,080
and work as usual.

614
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:30,639
Yes, Yi Ran.

615
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:32,760
You'll be in charge of welcoming the committee tomorrow.

616
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:33,919
No.

617
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,119
It's decided.

618
00:32:35,879 --> 00:32:37,280
That's it. Dismissed.

619
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,000
- Get back to work. - No, Dr. Lu.

620
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,320
Come. Come with me...

621
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,520
to see the patient in bed five.

622
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,280
Have you looked for his family?

623
00:32:44,439 --> 00:32:45,480
Yes.

624
00:32:51,879 --> 00:32:54,080
Isn't welcoming the committee a good thing?

625
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,760
It's easy to get to know the elites in the industry.

626
00:32:57,199 --> 00:32:59,280
Why does Dr. Xu look so unhappy?

627
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:01,240
So materialistic.

628
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,320
Don't you know?

629
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,560
Know what?

630
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,840
Dr. Xu's dad...

631
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,199
is the director of Ruirong Hospital...

632
00:33:08,199 --> 00:33:10,199
and the secretary-general of the Medical Doctor Association.

633
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,199
He's also the one leading the survey team.

634
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,040
The director of Ruirong Hospital?

635
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,320
That's one of the best hospitals in Shanghai.

636
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,840
I didn't know Dr. Xu...

637
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,719
came from such a sophisticated family.

638
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,080
Stop being so emotional.

639
00:33:23,199 --> 00:33:24,639
Go and kiss his ass when you have time.

640
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,520
No.

641
00:33:27,879 --> 00:33:29,560
I was just emotional for a moment.

642
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:32,919
Then...

643
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,600
This person is Dr. Xu's dad.

644
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:37,679
Why is Dr. Xu so upset?

645
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:39,719
I heard from my friends in Ruirong...

646
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,359
that the father and son don't get along.

647
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,199
Director Xu always thinks of Dr. Xu as useless.

648
00:33:51,719 --> 00:33:53,119
This is not a good sign.

649
00:33:54,959 --> 00:33:56,639
He hasn't contacted you for so many years.

650
00:33:56,879 --> 00:33:57,879
Why is he suddenly coming here?

651
00:33:59,439 --> 00:34:01,560
He must be targeting you.

652
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,439
He still wants me to go to Ruirong.

653
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,959
That's good too.

654
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,600
Go back and continue to be the son of the boss.

655
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,719
It's much cooler than...

656
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,040
being a doctor here.

657
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,800
Since it's so impressive,

658
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:16,040
I'll recommend you.

659
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,000
My dad is quite interested in you.

660
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,159
Forget it.

661
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,520
I'm not interested in him.

662
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:25,199
So what now?

663
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,760
Have you come up with a plan?

664
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:28,959
Yes.

665
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:30,199
What is it?

666
00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:31,480
I'll cross the bridge...

667
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:33,369
when I come to it.

668
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,600
Si Si.

669
00:34:37,759 --> 00:34:39,369
Give me the lab results for the patient in bed nine.

670
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:40,369
Okay.

671
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:42,409
Thank you.

672
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:43,929
Yi Ran.

673
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,560
Dad.

674
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:53,409
When will you understand how I feel?

675
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,319
You'll have a position in Ruirong.

676
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,600
Do you know...

677
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,000
what that position in Ruirong means?

678
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,560
It's something people can't get...

679
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,000
no matter how hard they try.

680
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,119
But what are you doing?

681
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,520
Can you just throw it away like that?

682
00:35:11,929 --> 00:35:13,759
Have you thought about my feelings?

683
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,560
My reputation?

684
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,480
My situation?

685
00:35:18,759 --> 00:35:20,239
I know you're talented...

686
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:21,369
and you work hard.

687
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,839
But in this place,

688
00:35:22,839 --> 00:35:25,279
just talent and hard work is not enough.

689
00:35:28,279 --> 00:35:29,679
I've gone from being a clinical specialist...

690
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,080
to a hospital administrator.

691
00:35:32,889 --> 00:35:34,639
I've been up and down.

692
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:37,319
I never dared to slack off.

693
00:35:37,319 --> 00:35:38,319
Why?

694
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,080
Did I do it for myself?

695
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,679
It's for you!

696
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:45,520
So that you could get a better starting point.

697
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:47,000
For your future,

698
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,929
I paved the way for you.

699
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,369
- Dad. - All right.

700
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,560
I don't want to hear your excuses.

701
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,639
Go to Jiang now...

702
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:55,719
and quit your job.

703
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:56,839
I'm not trying to make excuses.

704
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:58,759
And I won't quit either.

705
00:35:58,759 --> 00:36:00,600
Do you hate Ruirong that much?

706
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,369
Or do you hate me?

707
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:04,799
I don't hate Ruirong or you.

708
00:36:05,279 --> 00:36:06,889
I'm an adult.

709
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,119
I don't want to live under your rules all the time.

710
00:36:09,279 --> 00:36:11,159
I want to do things my own way.

711
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:12,839
You have no right to decide for yourself.

712
00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:20,369
Yi Ran.

713
00:36:21,409 --> 00:36:22,679
What can you learn...

714
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:24,199
by staying here?

715
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:26,409
If you like the emergency department,

716
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,000
you should go to Ruirong's emergency department.

717
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,369
Ruirong's emergency department...

718
00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:33,480
is one of the best in the nation.

719
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,799
Compared to Ruirong,

720
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:37,319
I like here better.

721
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,040
The people I work with here are nice.

722
00:36:41,759 --> 00:36:43,889
I've learned a lot from them.

723
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,929
I see more people and things here...

724
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,839
and the gap between my reality, ideals, and goals...

725
00:36:49,929 --> 00:36:51,440
as a doctor

726
00:36:51,889 --> 00:36:54,440
I see myself growing and improving every day.

727
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:57,239
My mindset is constantly maturing.

728
00:36:57,319 --> 00:36:58,409
Mature?

729
00:36:58,839 --> 00:37:00,520
I think it's childish.

730
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:03,279
There is no room for discussion.

731
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,279
Nor can you negotiate.

732
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:08,440
You must do it.

733
00:37:08,799 --> 00:37:10,719
And you must do it my way.

734
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:11,929
Dad, listen to me.

735
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:13,560
Report to Ruirong at the end of this month.

736
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:29,960
How did the talk with your bossy CEO go?

737
00:37:30,279 --> 00:37:31,440
Not well.

738
00:37:31,929 --> 00:37:33,960
He wants me to return to Ruirong by the end of this month.

739
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:37,369
No crap and direct order.

740
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,759
Your dad is still the same.

741
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,759
Why do I always meet people like you?

742
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,119
Only your way of thinking is right.

743
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,719
Others can only obey.

744
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:49,560
You think I'm like your dad too?

745
00:37:50,279 --> 00:37:51,369
Get lost.

746
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:54,679
One day, Bai Zhu will be just like Director Xu...

747
00:37:54,889 --> 00:37:57,119
and become the president, secretary-general, or whatever.

748
00:37:57,319 --> 00:37:59,440
It's because you've never lived...

749
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,719
with control freaks like them.

750
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:02,319
If you really marry him,

751
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:03,480
I guarantee that within three months,

752
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:05,560
you'll ask to die.

753
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,000
You're just jealous of Bai Zhu.

754
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:10,799
Bai Zhu, don't worry.

755
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,560
No matter what you become, I'll still like you.

756
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,679
I can't stay here anymore.

757
00:38:16,319 --> 00:38:17,929
- Are you free... - No.

758
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:19,960
- I haven't told you. - I have a patient to see.

759
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,679
No, Bai Zhu.

760
00:38:21,889 --> 00:38:22,960
I...

761
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:27,279
If only I studied nursing...

762
00:38:27,369 --> 00:38:28,679
instead of lab testing.

763
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:30,889
I could've worked with him every day.

764
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,369
You still have to make it.

765
00:38:32,799 --> 00:38:33,799
Xu Yi Ran.

766
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:43,159
Doctor.

767
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:46,080
How is my daughter?

768
00:38:47,799 --> 00:38:48,960
It's severe pancreatitis.

769
00:38:50,799 --> 00:38:51,839
She's...

770
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,119
not looking well.

771
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:54,520
Let's admit her into the EICU first.

772
00:38:55,409 --> 00:38:56,440
How's her temperature?

773
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,639
Constant high fever.

774
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,199
Based on the X-ray,

775
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,520
the area of abscess didn't continue to expand.

776
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:04,279
But it's still dangerous.

777
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,960
Doctor.

778
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,719
Let's operate on her.

779
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,040
I've consulted her condition...

780
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,679
with the chief of general surgery.

781
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:13,520
She can't undergo surgery right now.

782
00:39:13,889 --> 00:39:15,369
If we force it,

783
00:39:15,799 --> 00:39:17,369
her life might end at the operating table.

784
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,080
Then...

785
00:39:22,889 --> 00:39:25,369
when can she do it?

786
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,480
We'll have to wait and see.

787
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,960
She'll die if she doesn't get surgery.

788
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,560
She'll die if she doesn't get surgery.

789
00:40:02,409 --> 00:40:04,440
I feel so bad for this family.

790
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,080
It's one after another.

791
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,560
What do you mean?

792
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:11,369
Before you come to Tongshan three years ago,

793
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:13,960
his wife passed away at our hospital.

794
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:15,839
It was severe pancreatitis,

795
00:40:16,279 --> 00:40:17,929
exactly like his daughter now.

796
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:24,960
Supposedly, severe pancreatitis...

797
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,369
is not a hereditary disease.

798
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,409
It should be related to their eating habits.

799
00:40:28,409 --> 00:40:29,440
The eating habits of a family...

800
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,889
- are somewhat similar. - Dr. Xiao.

801
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,080
Please sign here.

802
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,239
Speaking of hereditary genes,

803
00:40:37,889 --> 00:40:40,119
when I was an intern at another department,

804
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,600
there was a mother who died of ovarian cancer.

805
00:40:43,409 --> 00:40:45,040
At that time, we advised her daughter...

806
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:46,409
to get tested for tumor suppression genes.

807
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,520
It came back positive.

808
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,600
So we did...

809
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:52,480
a preventive salpingo-oophorectomy.

810
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,719
But her condition worsened shortly after the surgery.

811
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,839
We removed her uterus.

812
00:40:57,369 --> 00:40:59,279
Even so, she passed away.

813
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,319
I remember that her daughter...

814
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,839
already had a child of her own.

815
00:41:05,929 --> 00:41:07,480
Coincidentally, it was also a girl.

816
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:09,159
She wasn't even 15 then.

817
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:11,889
How is the girl now?

818
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:13,279
I don't know.

819
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,520
She was also tested for tumor suppression genes.

820
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,520
It was positive.

821
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:17,960
- I feel bad for them. - Dr. Xiao.

822
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,639
The patient in bed five has worsened abdominal pain.

823
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,239
The patient's severe pancreatitis...

824
00:41:41,369 --> 00:41:42,480
is progressing too quickly.

825
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,560
Liver, kidney, and lung failure have occurred.

826
00:41:45,929 --> 00:41:47,369
So much blood is still draining...

827
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,520
from the abdominal cavity

828
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
It's most likely intestinal paralysis and necrosis.

829
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:54,440
Please be prepared.

830
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,600
Mesenteric ischemia,

831
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:03,199
and intestinal infarction and necrosis.

832
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,639
It's impossible to cure.

833
00:42:05,759 --> 00:42:07,759
The family of bed five is acting strange.

834
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,639
What is it?

835
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,369
That's his daughter.

836
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,369
But there isn't any reaction at all.

837
00:42:14,759 --> 00:42:15,799
Look at him.

838
00:42:15,929 --> 00:42:17,000
He's so calm.

839
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:21,040
It has happened before. So maybe...

840
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,889
he has prepared himself for this.

841
00:42:37,279 --> 00:42:39,199
One milligram of epinephrine IV.

842
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,279
I'm sorry.

843
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,080
Thank you.

844
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:15,839
You've worked hard.
