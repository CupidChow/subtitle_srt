1
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,159
(Thank You, Doctor)

2
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:30,079
(Adapted from Sheng Li's novel "ICU 48 Hours")

3
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,040
(Episode 23)

4
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,959
To be honest, as a friend,

5
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:38,840
I hope that you and Dr. Xiao could work things out.

6
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:41,879
It's not easy for you to take care of Xiao Guang alone...

7
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:42,920
all these years.

8
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:46,319
It's time for you to think about your own life.

9
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:49,959
Let me tell you.

10
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,719
I think Dr. Xiao is not bad.

11
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,120
Can't you make the first move?

12
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:58,359
Don't care only about your pride, okay?

13
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,560
Is your pride more important...

14
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,239
or finding someone you love more important?

15
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,159
Nowadays, it's not easy...

16
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,560
to find the right person.

17
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,120
You too.

18
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,560
Don't miss the right person.

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,400
You're suddenly so serious.

20
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,919
I'm not used to it.

21
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:23,919
Right?

22
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:26,240
I'm trying my best...

23
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,599
to barely keep up with your hypocrisy.

24
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,400
This feels right.

25
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,400
All right. Let's do our best tomorrow.

26
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,090
This is so lame.

27
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,560
Come on. Give me your hand.

28
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:42,120
Just tell me if you don't feel well.

29
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,319
We're in the hospital.

30
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,400
If you don't feel well, you have to tell me.

31
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,199
I'll keep this toy for you.

32
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,400
No, this is a hospital. You can't keep it with you.

33
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,759
- What's the patient's condition? - Come on.

34
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,560
Accidental ingestion of albuterol.

35
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:55,800
Albuterol?

36
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,639
It's a selective beta-2 receptor agonist.

37
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,719
It has a strong bronchodilator effect...

38
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,960
and a weak agonist effect on the heart.

39
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,120
It is a safer and commonly used asthma medicine.

40
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,400
It's rare that people get poisoned by it.

41
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,680
How much did he ingest by mistake?

42
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,520
He ate a hundred 2mg pills.

43
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,039
Insert a gastric tube and prepare for a lavage.

44
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,080
Hey, don't be scared.

45
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,319
What's wrong with him?

46
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,800
He's autistic.

47
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,240
He can't communicate.

48
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,599
- Autistic? - Yes.

49
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:22,479
He has been receiving treatment at our hospital.

50
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:23,639
Have you contacted his family?

51
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,520
No, we've been calling them.

52
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,159
We can't wait any longer. Let's intubate first.

53
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,080
Hey, kid.

54
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,159
Come on. Relax.

55
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,520
You'll feel a little uncomfortable.

56
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,000
However, if you relax,

57
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,080
you'll be fine.

58
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,120
What are you doing here?

59
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,159
Hold it.

60
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:38,159
Okay.

61
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,560
Come on.

62
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,560
All right.

63
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,039
Let's relax.

64
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,759
- Kid, don't be scared. - Come on.

65
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:45,120
- Don't be scared. It won't hurt. - Come on.

66
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,560
- Open your mouth. - Kid, open your mouth.

67
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,000
Open your mouth.

68
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,319
You...

69
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,560
- Why did you bite him? - Let me see.

70
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,080
How are you?

71
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,759
- Let's treat your wound first. - I'm fine.

72
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:58,879
We won't intubate him.

73
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,840
Mannitol, 200ml. Laxative.

74
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,680
- Propranolol hydrochloride by oral. - Okay.

75
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:04,759
Go get the medicine.

76
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:06,800
You'll be all right.

77
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,759
You go first. I'll take care of him.

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,079
Were you bitten by a patient?

79
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,170
- By an autistic child. - Let me see.

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,050
In this world,

81
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,170
I can deal with anyone...

82
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:45,000
except for autistic people.

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,079
Let me do it.

84
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,730
Let me help you.

85
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,360
Let me disinfect it first.

86
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,079
If you feel pain, just let me know.

87
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,560
Pain is a human's...

88
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,759
It's a subjective feeling.

89
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,240
It depends on the person.

90
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:07,879
Coincidentally, I'm one of those who aren't afraid of pain.

91
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:19,399
If it hurts, just shout out loud.

92
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,959
Why would it hurt?

93
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:28,959
Does it hurt?

94
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,959
No.

95
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,160
Do you need help?

96
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,240
With what?

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,160
Here. Tian Rui.

98
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,680
- Hey, kid. - Let's take the medicine first.

99
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:49,920
- Hey, kid. - Stop messing around.

100
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,959
Let's take the medicine.

101
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,279
You'll get better after you take the medicine.

102
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,279
Tian Rui.

103
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,839
His symptoms of autism are quite serious.

104
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:55,839
Let me try.

105
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,519
Yi Ran, here.

106
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:58,839
Here, Tian Rui.

107
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,079
Here, take the medicine.

108
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:02,240
- Yi Ran. - Be careful.

109
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,759
- Open your mouth. - Open your mouth.

110
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,879
Why does he bite?

111
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,079
Say thank you.

112
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,480
Thank you.

113
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,519
You have been through a lot.

114
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,519
It's so hard to feed him.

115
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,639
Let me try.

116
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:16,480
Dr. Xiao, he bites.

117
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:17,759
Be careful.

118
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,639
Look at me.

119
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:28,680
Good job.

120
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,560
Look at me.

121
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,839
- Here. - Mirror neurons are activated.

122
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:44,319
Primates are the best at mimicking their own kind.

123
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,519
Dr. Xiao.

124
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:46,720
Well done.

125
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,120
That's for sure.

126
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,639
Our Dr. Xiao...

127
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:52,120
is from the rain of bullets in West Asia.

128
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,759
She has encountered all kinds of patients and situations.

129
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:57,800
I've indeed encountered similar patients before.

130
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,000
Dr. Bai.

131
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:01,560
Hang in there.

132
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:12,959
Tian.

133
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,279
What happened?

134
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,000
It's nothing. I had a fall.

135
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,959
Why did you fall?

136
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:23,480
We were working...

137
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,040
and I didn't notice there was water on the floor.

138
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,319
I just fell.

139
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,319
I'm fine.

140
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,560
Where did you hurt? Is there a fracture?

141
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,759
I'm fine.

142
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,759
I'll get the doctor to take a look...

143
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:31,839
and ask him to give me some medicine.

144
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,040
Did you take an X-ray?

145
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,560
- No. - I see.

146
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,040
I'll write you a checkup list.

147
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:38,480
Go and have a check.

148
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:39,920
Why do I need to take an X-ray?

149
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,120
It's troublesome and costs money.

150
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,319
It's okay.

151
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,600
Dr. Xu.

152
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,399
You've been taking care of me.

153
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,000
Thank you.

154
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:49,439
Actually...

155
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,319
My son is hospitalized here.

156
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,560
I'm here to visit him.

157
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,120
He's here?

158
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:57,240
What's your son's name?

159
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:58,680
Tian Rui.

160
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,519
The toxicology report shows...

161
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,800
that the patient's blood contains...

162
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,279
4.6mg L of albuterol.

163
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,879
He needs hemoperfusion and dialysis.

164
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:07,920
How about this?

165
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,959
I'll arrange for it later.

166
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,040
Tell him to come tomorrow.

167
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,759
Thank you so much.

168
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,199
I'm sorry for the trouble.

169
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:16,360
It's fine.

170
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,680
This is an unusual case.

171
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,720
When I go to work,

172
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,399
I'll leave him at my neighbor's house.

173
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,240
Who knew this kid...

174
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,680
took the old man's medicine for asthma?

175
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,079
By the time I found it,

176
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:29,639
the bottle was empty.

177
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:31,959
It has been hard for you.

178
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,480
I'm his dad after all.

179
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:34,679
It's nothing.

180
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,720
It's not hard at all.

181
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:45,480
Well,

182
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,090
it seems that he's fine.

183
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,159
Why don't...

184
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,799
Where are you going?

185
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:53,960
It's time to work.

186
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,240
If I don't work today,

187
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,759
I won't make any money.

188
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,159
From what I can see, Rui Rui is fine now.

189
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,159
Why don't you take care of him for me?

190
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,279
Can you?

191
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:06,679
Can't you wait for him to wake up first?

192
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,559
He's autistic.

193
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:10,480
What he needs the most is the company of his parents.

194
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,559
He hasn't seen you all day.

195
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:14,399
You should think about his feelings.

196
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,450
Tang Hua.

197
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,330
Well,

198
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,879
I'll stay here for a while then.

199
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:23,679
As his parent,

200
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,559
you should be more responsible.

201
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,960
Otherwise, your child wouldn't be that sick.

202
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,519
I also wish I could stay by his side,

203
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:40,639
but treatment costs money.

204
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,159
I have to earn money to treat him.

205
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,090
To treat my son,

206
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,210
I went to many hospitals.

207
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:49,639
His medical fees are getting higher and higher.

208
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,210
I used to work in transportation.

209
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,159
I was able to earn some money.

210
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:56,399
Now, in order to be with my child,

211
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,919
I can't even go outside.

212
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:59,120
Look.

213
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,480
I run a barbecue stall near the hospital.

214
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:02,919
That's how...

215
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:05,679
I barely cover our daily expenses.

216
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,090
Tian.

217
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,450
Where's Tian Rui's mom?

218
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:15,559
Don't even get me started.

219
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,480
In order to treat our child,

220
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:19,799
me and Tian Rui's mom are about to get a divorce.

221
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:21,559
Is she not willing to treat her child?

222
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,679
I don't blame her.

223
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,559
My wife...

224
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,240
has a younger brother.

225
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,039
He has always been autistic.

226
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:35,240
She lost him when she was very young.

227
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,159
That's why she was traumatized.

228
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:39,879
She didn't dare to have children.

229
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:42,330
However, I insisted...

230
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,399
that she give birth to Rui Rui.

231
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,399
In the end,

232
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,000
I failed her.

233
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:55,519
This child is all grown up now.

234
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:00,080
I can't just...

235
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,519
leave him alone.

236
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,240
I thought...

237
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:12,120
I'll work hard to earn money.

238
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,759
I'll earn money to treat Rui Rui.

239
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,159
I hope...

240
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:20,440
that Rui Rui will get better one day.

241
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:25,799
Don't worry.

242
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,360
The kid is with us.

243
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:28,759
We'll take care of him.

244
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,440
It's time to work.

245
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,120
Well...

246
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,600
Thank you so much.

247
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:39,679
I'll get going then.

What's wrong with Rui Rui?

He's fine.

254
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,960
He was asleep when I left.

255
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:04,879
You scared me.

256
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:06,639
Are you done for the day?

257
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,039
Yes, I just got off work and passed by your place,

Look at me.

All I can think about is Rui Rui.

It's free. Just take it.

273
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,720
How can it be free?

you purposely buy food from me.

I think this has nothing to do with albuterol poisoning.

It's caused by something else.

00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,879
The main cause of pleural effusion...

338
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,159
could be infection, parasites, and cancer.

339
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:21,320
The routine blood test shows...

340
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,159
that his white blood cells and C-reactive protein are low.

341
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,399
Also, he has no fever.

342
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:25,919
It doesn't look like an infection.

343
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,039
What about the parasite test?

344
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:30,600
The fecal sample came back negative.

345
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,639
That means it can only be cancer.

346
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:35,759
How cruel.

347
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,440
He's still so young, but he has autism and cancer.

348
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,120
How about this?

349
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:42,960
Let's do a pleural fluid analysis,

350
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,000
pleural fluid culture,

351
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,279
and exfoliative cytologic examination.

352
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,279
Okay.

353
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,360
We have a long way to go.

354
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,399
I hope it goes well.

355
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:57,279
Dr. Xu.

356
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,480
It's not cancer, is it?

357
00:15:58,679 --> 00:15:59,919
We'll have to wait for the test results.

358
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,159
It's all my fault.

359
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:04,799
My child is innocent.

360
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:06,600
- Go ahead and torture me. - Calm down.

361
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:07,799
It might not be cancer.

362
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:09,120
Dr. Bai, the result is out.

363
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,320
- So? - It's not cancer.

364
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,440
It's not cancer.

365
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,879
Thank goodness.

366
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,240
There's something strange in the fluid.

367
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,639
What is it?

368
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,360
Macrophages.

369
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:21,639
Why are there macrophages?

370
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,720
What are you talking about?

371
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,480
Don't worry.

372
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,840
It's just a little abnormal now.

373
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,480
Okay.

374
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,440
I still don't understand.

375
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,519
Why do macrophages appear in pleural fluid?

376
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,120
Cancer cells...

377
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,480
can enter the pleural fluid through the lymphatic system.

378
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:43,519
Macrophages are not cancer cells.

379
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,360
But what's the difference...

380
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,399
between cancer cells and macrophages?

381
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:49,799
Cancer cells can pass through the walls...

382
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,200
but macrophages can't.

383
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:52,960
Cancer cells are damaged.

384
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,879
If macrophages are also damaged for some reason...

385
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,200
That's right.

386
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,639
If macrophages are also damaged,

387
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:01,960
theoretically,

388
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:03,360
they can also pass through the inner wall...

389
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,519
and enter the lymphatic system.

390
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,720
In this case,

391
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,519
it can explain the pleural effusion and even the heart problem.

392
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:09,759
Cirrhosis of the liver.

393
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,170
Let's do a liver biopsy.

394
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,200
It could be cirrhosis of the liver.

395
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,240
Okay.

396
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,920
Doctor.

397
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,319
What's wrong?

398
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,410
Rui Rui.

399
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,559
- What's wrong? - Doctor!

400
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:22,799
- What's wrong with him? - Please wait outside.

401
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,440
Please wait outside.

402
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,440
Ventricular fibrillation.

403
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,440
Prepare the defibrillator.

404
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,410
Rui Rui.

405
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,480
Rui Rui.

406
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,319
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

407
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:44,920
The defibrillator is ready.

408
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,359
Disjointed, 50J.

409
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,039
Charged to 50J.

410
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,720
Charged.

411
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:53,119
Clear.

412
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,480
One more time, 75J.

413
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,920
Charged.

414
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:08,410
Clear.

415
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,680
0.5mg of epinephrine.

416
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,680
Okay.

417
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:22,410
Done injected.

418
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:48,599
It's back.

419
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:54,410
We have a pulse.

420
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,559
Tian Rui had an atrioventricular block,

421
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,359
but he's stable now.

422
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:10,839
Dr. Bai.

423
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,039
What's wrong with him?

424
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,170
Liver damage.

425
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:16,240
Pleural effusion is affecting his lung function.

426
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,650
But the liver biopsy didn't show cirrhosis.

427
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:22,559
The stool sample showed that there was a lot of manure.

428
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,039
Do you think...

429
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:26,119
he could have eaten some random stuff?

430
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:27,839
It's possible.

431
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:29,650
The patient is autistic.

432
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:31,680
He even took albuterol by mistake.

433
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,920
He could have eaten anything.

434
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,960
How about this?

435
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:36,759
Discuss with the patient's family...

436
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:39,200
and see if you can go to his house to find some relevant clues.

437
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:40,410
Okay.

438
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,519
Hold on.

439
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:46,480
Take some photos of their home inside out.

440
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,559
Okay.

441
00:19:58,559 --> 00:19:59,559
Dr. Bai.

442
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,170
- How was it? - Did you find anything?

443
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,000
I've checked. It's a rented house.

444
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:07,240
There's nothing unusual.

445
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,440
What should we do?

446
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,319
If the patient isn't autistic,

447
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,000
we can just ask him directly.

448
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,440
Did you take any photos?

449
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:15,079
Yes. I've sent them to you.

450
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:26,039
Have you ever seen your child eat anything weird before?

451
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,720
Do you mean the asthma medicine?

452
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,920
No.

453
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:33,170
Other stuff like matches or wood.

454
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,960
Doctor, I'm sorry.

455
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:41,559
I'm too busy.

456
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:43,119
I don't spend much time...

457
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,480
with my child.

458
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,720
You're just trying to make money to treat him.

459
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,039
Rui Rui.

460
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,480
What did you eat at home?

461
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,799
Doctor.

462
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,279
He can't speak.

463
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:07,119
Rui Rui.

464
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:08,359
Look.

465
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:10,440
This is your bathroom.

466
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,839
This is the corridor.

467
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:15,650
This is your bedroom.

468
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,960
This is the kitchen.

469
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,170
This is the living room.

470
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:23,599
This is the yard downstairs.

471
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:26,799
What have you eaten in these places?

472
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,039
You can tell me.

473
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:29,079
Doctor.

474
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,119
He doesn't know.

475
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,839
He doesn't know what you're saying to him.

476
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:35,359
Rui Rui, you have to tell me...

477
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:36,839
so that I can cure you.

478
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:38,759
- Rui Rui. - Doctor.

479
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:40,319
Don't force him anymore.

480
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,920
He doesn't understand.

481
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,680
Rui Rui.

482
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,319
It's ocular paralysis.

483
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,240
It's not paralysis.

484
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:57,079
It's a pirouette rotation.

485
00:21:58,039 --> 00:21:59,400
Multiple sclerosis...

486
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:02,519
or a microscopic tumor.

487
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,880
It could be a microscopic tumor.

488
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:06,359
It started in the lungs and causes a pleural effusion.

489
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,400
Then it spreads to the liver and causes hepatocyte dropout.

490
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:09,880
Finally, it reaches...

491
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,200
the back of the eyeball of the brain,

492
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,079
causing ocular paralysis.

493
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,039
Both of you are going too far.

494
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,400
Dr. Bai. Did we analyze it wrong?

495
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:22,920
Based on your analysis,

496
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:25,160
the patient's eye needs to be removed.

497
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,359
He's autistic and one eye is missing.

498
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:31,160
How cruel.

499
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:34,480
Tell me what you know.

500
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:36,680
It's not a tumor. It's a roundworm.

501
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:38,200
A roundworm?

502
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,720
It's swimming in his eyes.

503
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:42,359
Where did the roundworm come from?

504
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,759
When I saw those photos,

505
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:45,640
there was a pile of sand in front of their house.

506
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:48,880
His dad said he likes to play on the sand.

507
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:50,720
I'm sure all the cats and dogs in that area...

508
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:52,279
poop on it.

509
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,000
Perhaps he ate it by mistake.

510
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:58,640
But the fecal parasite test is negative.

511
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,160
You really don't know when to give up.

512
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,400
Look at this.

513
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,279
Raccoon roundworms...

514
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:09,000
won't be excreted by a human host.

515
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:10,559
I've checked the pile of sand.

516
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,559
It was in there.

517
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,559
Raccoon roundworms?

518
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:15,880
The raccoon roundworm spread from the digestive tract...

519
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,240
to other parts.

520
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,920
It invaded his lungs and caused a pleural effusion.

521
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,559
It invaded his liver...

522
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,440
and caused the dead liver cells to follow the lymphatic flow.

523
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,960
Finally, it attacked his eye and cricoid muscles...

524
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,400
and caused his eyeball to roll back.

525
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,720
You're a fast learner.

526
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:33,640
Let's go.

527
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,880
High-dose of benzimidazole to kill the roundworm...

528
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,039
and laser photocoagulation to treat his eyeball.

529
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,119
I hear you have three barbecues a day.

530
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,079
Seriously? You're my role model.

531
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:47,799
A comfortable and luxurious life.

532
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:49,000
That's my dream.

533
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:51,119
Doctor.

534
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,279
I want to ask you something.

535
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:54,319
Where is the EICU?

536
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,519
Are you a family member?

537
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,559
My son is in the EICU.

538
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,559
He has autism.

539
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:01,920
Tian Rui?

540
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,920
Do you know who he is?

541
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,000
How is he?

542
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,319
The patient is out of danger.

543
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,200
Let's go. Come with us to see your child.

544
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,000
Come on.

545
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:17,279
No.

546
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,640
I'll get softhearted if I see him.

547
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:27,839
Here, have some water.

548
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:28,920
Thank you.

549
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,200
Doctor.

550
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,839
Tell me the truth.

551
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:34,839
My son has autism.

552
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,680
Can he be cured?

553
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,119
Autism is hard to cure.

554
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,240
In order to treat...

555
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:45,319
this illness for our child,

556
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:48,200
we went to all the hospitals in the city.

557
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:51,279
I even sold my house in my hometown.

558
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:54,400
We really did our best.

559
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:56,519
Now, because of the child,

560
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,319
his dad and I are quarreling so much...

561
00:24:58,319 --> 00:24:59,400
that we're going to get a divorce.

562
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,599
I just want to know this.

563
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,359
Is there any point...

564
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:07,440
for us to spend money...

565
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:10,599
on our child's treatment?

566
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,200
The point is correlative,

567
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,200
but you need to have faith.

568
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,079
There's no cure then.

569
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,839
You're the one who gave birth to the child.

570
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,240
What else can you do?

571
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,319
I also don't know what to do.

572
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:30,440
I can only take him back to our hometown.

573
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:34,000
I'll endure as many years as I can.

574
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:37,440
If my husband and I can have children,

575
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:41,559
I'll have another child.

576
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,400
I can't let this child...

577
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:49,319
ruin our family...

578
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,240
and lives.

579
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,519
I think about it every day.

580
00:25:56,519 --> 00:25:59,000
I wish I hadn't given birth to this child.

581
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:04,880
I don't know why I'm having this thought.

582
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,480
This...

583
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:10,039
This thought of mine is terrible.

584
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,279
I don't deserve to be a mom.

585
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,160
I don't deserve to be a mom.

586
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,079
Every time I see him,

587
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,599
do you know how much I want to convince myself?

588
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,039
I told myself...

589
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,680
that Rui Rui will be fine.

590
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:33,319
Rui Rui will be fine.

591
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,519
But now...

592
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,079
There is really nothing we can do now.

593
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:44,640
- Doctor. - Tian.

594
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:45,960
Don't listen to her.

595
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,319
What are you doing here sneakily?

596
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:51,920
Tell me.

597
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,279
We've tried our best.

598
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,359
What else can we do?

599
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:55,359
We'll earn money to treat his illness.

600
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,000
I can earn money...

601
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:00,759
to treat Rui Rui.

602
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,440
This has nothing to do with you.

603
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:05,960
If you don't agree,

604
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:08,559
I'll divorce you.

605
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:09,920
I'll take care of the child.

606
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,039
He can only live on like a fool.

607
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,039
He can't be cured.

608
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,559
He'll suffer just to live.

609
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,480
We're the ones who gave birth to him.

610
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:23,599
We have to be responsible.

611
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:26,319
I'm Rui Rui's dad.

612
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,039
I want to earn money to treat his illness.

613
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,799
I can't bear such a big responsibility.

614
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:36,079
I don't want to be tortured like this even for a minute.

615
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,079
Let's get a divorce.

616
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,319
Fine.

617
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:49,559
Let's get a divorce.

618
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:51,440
The child will be living with me.

619
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:53,359
You're still young.

620
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,440
You can find a better man.

621
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:17,559
Ms. Xiao.

622
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:21,039
Xiao Guang, why are you here?

623
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,480
I'm here for a follow-up checkup.

624
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,720
Where's Dr. Bai?

625
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,240
He couldn't care less about me.

626
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:30,359
That's true.

627
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,440
There are a lot of patients in the hospital these days.

628
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,880
Dr. Bai is very busy.

629
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,240
No, he's not.

630
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:36,839
My dad has someone else in his heart.

631
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,400
That's why he doesn't care about me.

632
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,559
Who can be more important than you in his heart?

633
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,440
Ms. Xiao, come here.

634
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,000
Are you going to examine me?

635
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,799
Ms. Xiao.

636
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:53,160
I don't have the skills.

637
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,480
Let me tell you.

638
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,799
You have to believe me.

639
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,640
To my dad,

640
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,160
that person is more important than me.

641
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,160
He was with me when I was taking blood just now.

642
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:04,720
But when he heard that person was in trouble,

643
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,920
he left me right away...

644
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,680
to help that person solve her problem.

645
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,680
Ms. Xiao.

646
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,640
Think about it.

647
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,359
Can't you tell?

648
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,160
I accidentally told Ms. Xiao that you like her.

649
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:29,720
- Dad, I was wrong. - You...

650
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,400
- You told Dr. Xiao that I like her? - I accidentally told her the truth.

651
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,440
I'm sorry, Dad.

652
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,720
You...

653
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,680
Do you call that being honest?

654
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:38,960
Dad, don't yell at me.

655
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,240
I'm a patient.

656
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:46,799
Tell me.

657
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,720
Who told you...

658
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,559
that I like Dr. Xiao?

659
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,119
Is it that big mouth, Xu Yi Ran?

660
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,039
Don't accuse Mr. Xu.

661
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,079
I'm not blind.

662
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:57,240
I can tell.

663
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,240
All right, Dad.

664
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,319
Don't be stubborn.

665
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:03,440
Look at yourself.

666
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:05,000
Ms. Xiao is pretty.

667
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,720
She has a good personality and can drive a motorcycle.

668
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,920
She's more than good enough for you.

669
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:14,119
She's more than good enough for me?

670
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:16,799
Let me ask you. What is my standard?

671
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,279
You're a primary school student.

672
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:20,920
What are you thinking all day?

673
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,279
Dad, let me tell you.

674
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:23,359
If you get too close, you'll turn bad.

675
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,720
You're banned from surfing the Internet for a month.

676
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,799
Dad.

677
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:27,240
Have you learned Chinese idioms before?

678
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,720
You can't do that.

679
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:31,599
Seriously.

680
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:32,759
You're a control freak.

681
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:36,680
Let me make this clear to you.

682
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,400
I'm a control freak.

683
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:39,799
Let me tell you something.

684
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:41,279
In the future

685
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,640
don't talk nonsense to others.

686
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,960
Especially...

687
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:45,960
to Ms. Xiao.

688
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,960
Don't talk nonsense.

689
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,160
Or I'll ban you from surfing the Internet for a year.

690
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,759
If you try to cover it up, you'll draw attention.

691
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:53,319
Do you know what that means?

692
00:30:58,559 --> 00:30:59,599
Eat more fruit.

693
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,799
I don't want to.

694
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,480
It's nutritious.

695
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:04,079
Have one first.

696
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,359
Here.

697
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,759
Let me feed you.

698
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:10,359
Hurry up and eat.

699
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:14,920
Tian.

700
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:18,400
Dr. Xu.

701
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:21,160
This is the contact information of Dr. Song...

702
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,440
from Zhongji Hospital's Pediatrics Department.

703
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,559
Zhongji Hospital's Pediatrics Department...

704
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,000
is experienced in the treatment of autism.

705
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:27,720
There might be a chance for a cure.

706
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,319
I've already contacted him.

707
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,720
You can talk to him directly.

708
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,119
That's great.

709
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,480
Thank you.

710
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,559
Thank you.

711
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:36,920
I'll definitely take him there.

712
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:43,480
Is there really hope?

713
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,279
We must have faith.

714
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:48,640
I used to have a mentor who specialized in autism.

715
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,720
He told me that there's no cure for autism for now.

716
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:56,240
We can't even define what the boundaries of healing are.

717
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,359
This is indeed the case for people with autism.

718
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,720
However, for the patient's family,

719
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,079
the hope for a cure is everything.

720
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:14,079
You have severe bronchial asthma.

721
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,400
Fortunately, you were rescued in time.

722
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,720
The weather is cold now.

723
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,839
You should dress warmly.

724
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,039
Let's keep an eye on her for now.

725
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:21,200
Let me know if there's anything wrong.

726
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,279
Okay.

727
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:27,119
Dr. Bai.

728
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,680
Patients nowadays...

729
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,720
rather be fashionable than comfortable.

730
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,720
Yes.

731
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,880
There are a lot of asthma patients during this season.

732
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:43,039
Although there's no effective treatment for asthma,

733
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,559
as long as we adhere to long-term standardized treatment,

734
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:47,279
the symptoms of asthma...

735
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,799
can be well controlled...

736
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,240
and recurrence can be reduced.

737
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,720
Dr. Bai.

738
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,920
Why did you want to see me?

739
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,480
As you know,

740
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,799
kids say the darndest things.

741
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,160
If Xiao Guang said anything to you,

742
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,200
don't mind him.

743
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:13,839
He's getting out of hand.

744
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:14,920
Don't worry.

745
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,480
I'll be strict with him from now on.

746
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:27,039
Dr. Bai.

747
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,680
The pneumonia patient in Bed Number 3 has a fever again.

748
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,119
I'll get back to work.

749
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,640
He was with me when I was taking blood just now.

750
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,960
But when he heard that person was in trouble,

751
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,440
he left me right away...

752
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,079
to help that person solve her problem.

753
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,839
The person in my dad's heart...

754
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:57,240
is you.

755
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,920
Doctor.

756
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,839
Why isn't he waking up?

757
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:10,159
Shi Lei.

758
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,519
Shi Lei.

759
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,679
You are...

760
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,679
His wife.

761
00:34:15,769 --> 00:34:16,769
I'm sorry.

762
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,480
How's the patient?

763
00:34:18,769 --> 00:34:20,000
It doesn't look good.

764
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:22,769
The patient has Alzheimer's disease.

765
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:26,559
This time, he had a stroke and his brain has necrosis.

766
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,880
It's likely he'll never recover.

767
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,809
Will he wake up?

768
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,519
It's very unlikely.

769
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,360
There's something more serious.

770
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:38,920
The patient is quite old.

771
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,599
Other than cerebral infarction,

772
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,199
his cardiopulmonary function is not good.

773
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,920
So even with aggressive treatment,

774
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:46,719
I don't think it'll last long.

775
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,039
The family members have to be prepared...

776
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:50,360
for the patient's departure.

777
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,159
Also,

778
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,119
the patient is unconscious.

779
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:55,769
He can't eat on her own.

780
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,329
We need to intubate a nasogastric tube.

781
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,880
There's no need.

782
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:07,159
You don't seem to understand.

783
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:10,559
Only by doing so can the patient have enough nutrition.

784
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,360
I don't want him to suffer anymore.

785
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:14,920
Without the nasogastric tube,

786
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,960
he can't get enough nutrients.

787
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,880
The patient may have already starved to death...

788
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:19,809
before his condition worsens.

789
00:35:19,809 --> 00:35:20,809
Doctor.

790
00:35:20,809 --> 00:35:22,679
I understand what you're saying.

791
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:28,519
When my husband was conscious, he made it very clear to me.

792
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:32,039
He said that once he became critical,

793
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,719
we shouldn't try to resuscitate him just to barely keep him alive.

794
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:37,119
He used to be a doctor.

795
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:39,000
He knows it very well.

796
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,809
He thinks it's meaningless.

797
00:35:40,809 --> 00:35:42,809
He wants to leave in peace.

798
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:45,079
He wants to leave with dignity.

799
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,119
Just do as he says.

800
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:53,199
We can continue with the treatment after intubating a nasogastric tube.

801
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:55,039
If it doesn't work,

802
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:56,039
I'll take it out again.

803
00:35:56,329 --> 00:35:57,519
So we suggest...

804
00:35:57,559 --> 00:35:58,960
Thank you, doctor.

805
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,039
There's really no need.

806
00:36:02,289 --> 00:36:03,639
About the nasogastric tube,

807
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,289
I think you should reconsider.

808
00:36:05,809 --> 00:36:07,199
We'll leave now.

809
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:08,639
Shi Lei.

810
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,400
Shi Lei.

811
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,119
You won't leave me alone, right?

812
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:22,920
What's wrong with his family member?

813
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:24,360
They don't agree to intubate a nasogastric tube.

814
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,599
Do you think they don't want to save him?

815
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:26,809
Of course not.

816
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,199
She and her husband love each other.

817
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:29,289
Didn't you hear what she said?

818
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:31,239
She respects her husband's opinion.

819
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:32,639
She doesn't want him to suffer.

820
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,079
Respect?

821
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,199
I think she just came up with a story...

822
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:40,400
to convince herself and to tell everyone.

823
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:43,000
You weren't directly involved. How do you know?

824
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:44,159
Were you directly involved?

825
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:45,920
But from what she said,

826
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:47,920
I could feel her passionate love for her husband.

827
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:49,329
Passionate love?

828
00:36:49,809 --> 00:36:52,239
Why do I feel awkward listening to her?

829
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,769
How is this awkward?

830
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:55,719
What if she's an intellectual?

831
00:36:55,719 --> 00:36:57,599
It's normal for her to talk poetically.

832
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,809
Who doesn't know how to beautify themselves?

833
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,000
You promised me.

834
00:37:07,289 --> 00:37:08,639
You won't go before me.

835
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:11,079
How could you break your promise?

836
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,360
Do you know?

837
00:37:14,769 --> 00:37:16,880
In the days and nights when I lost you,

838
00:37:17,329 --> 00:37:19,559
I'll be forever alone.

839
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,289
I'll be forever longing for you.

840
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,769
I really don't want you to leave me like this.

841
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:30,159
However,

842
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:34,360
I can't let you suffer more because of my weakness.

843
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:40,000
Watching your life being taken away...

844
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:43,289
bit by bit every day...

845
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:49,000
is a huge punishment for me.

846
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:18,679
Thank you.

847
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,239
I heard there's a patient's family won't intubate a nasogastric tube.

848
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,039
She's just being respectful to her husband's will.

849
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:29,159
Speaking of which,

850
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,239
the patient's family is a language teacher.

851
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:32,599
She's good at writing.

852
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:36,599
She used to publish articles in the journals.

853
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:38,239
Her thinking kind of keeps up with the times.

854
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:40,239
One of her articles discussed death with dignity.

855
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:43,639
I just realized I've been brainwashed by you.

856
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:48,199
Even though I knew I couldn't save that patient...

857
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:50,809
and I also knew that the patient doesn't want to suffer,

858
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:52,719
I still can't give up.

859
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,840
I've been trying to persuade his family...

860
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:57,289
so that she agrees to intubate the nasogastric tube.

861
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,360
But if I were the patient's doctor,

862
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,480
I would choose...

863
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,039
to not intubate him.

864
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,519
Why?

865
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:06,360
I wasn't the only one who brainwashed you.

866
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,559
You brainwashed me too.

867
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:10,840
If there's no hope for the patient,

868
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,360
I'd choose to respect the patient's will.

869
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,000
You said it before.

870
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,440
That's the greatest respect for life.

871
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:19,239
I'm impressed.

872
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:23,329
Dr. Xiao.

873
00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:25,199
Here come two more family members of Li Shi Lei.

874
00:39:25,289 --> 00:39:26,289
They want to see you.

875
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:28,880
Okay. I'm coming.

876
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:42,199
Dr. Xiao, these are the patients' children.

877
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:44,329
We just came back from out of town.

878
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,440
Dr. Xiao.

879
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,079
Can't you do something about my dad's illness?

880
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,960
Although the patient is in the final stage of his life,

881
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,840
with aggressive treatment,

882
00:39:53,289 --> 00:39:55,039
I think it's possible for him to live longer.

883
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:56,119
Of course.

884
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:57,719
It's up to your family's wishes.

885
00:39:57,719 --> 00:39:59,809
Aggressive treatment, of course.

886
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,920
Please help us, doctor.

887
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,809
If the patient and his family all agree to aggressive treatment,

888
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:07,769
we'll surely do our best.

889
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:09,239
Now,

890
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:12,079
the family members need to get on the same page.

891
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:13,519
Get on the same page?

892
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:16,199
Mom.

893
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:18,880
The doctor was going to intubate a nasogastric tube on him.

894
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,039
I didn't agree with it.

895
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:21,239
- Well... - Why not?

896
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:25,440
Didn't your dad tell you when he was conscious?

897
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:27,639
Doctor.

898
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:28,679
Tell me.

899
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,000
My dad is in such a condition.

900
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,119
Do we need to insert a nasogastric tube?

901
00:40:32,289 --> 00:40:34,960
If it's for life-sustaining purposes,

902
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:36,769
we'd recommend intubating a nasogastric tube.

903
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,079
What if we don't?

904
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:39,360
What will happen to him?

905
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,920
If we don't intubate a nasogastric tube...

906
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:43,880
and just rely on an IV drip to maintain his nutrition,

907
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,809
it can only be until the patient...

908
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,239
can't hold on any longer...

909
00:40:48,329 --> 00:40:49,360
and passes away.

910
00:40:49,769 --> 00:40:51,559
That means my dad will be starved to death.

911
00:40:52,329 --> 00:40:53,440
Doctor, you just said...

912
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:55,039
that if we go with aggressive treatment,

913
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:56,199
he can still sustain for a while.

914
00:40:56,639 --> 00:40:58,039
For how long?

915
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,360
Optimistically, it should be about six months.

916
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:02,159
Okay, I got it.

917
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,519
Mom.

918
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,360
The tube needs to be inserted.

919
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,360
I know you want the best for your dad.

920
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,440
However,

921
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:13,199
he already told us that.

922
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,000
I remember it clearly, Mom.

923
00:41:15,289 --> 00:41:17,039
Dad told us this when he was conscious.

924
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,440
If he is in critical condition,

925
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:20,809
don't send him to the intensive care unit...

926
00:41:20,809 --> 00:41:22,809
and don't resuscitate him just to barely keep him alive.

927
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,679
Then listen to him.

928
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,960
But the doctor said he can live for half a year.

929
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:29,289
How can this be considered critically ill?

930
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:30,679
Mom.

931
00:41:30,809 --> 00:41:32,400
I can't let my dad go like this.

932
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:34,079
I can't bear to see him go either.

933
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,519
Mom.

934
00:41:35,769 --> 00:41:37,239
No matter what, I won't agree with it.

935
00:41:37,809 --> 00:41:38,880
Mom.

936
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,239
Let's talk outside.

937
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,559
His children actually...

938
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:51,769
agree to intubate a nasogastric tube.

939
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:54,639
For the patient's family,

940
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,960
it's really hard to give up treatment.

941
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,079
After all,

942
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:01,519
the children care more about Li Shi Lei...

943
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,039
compared to Lin Ruo Yun.

944
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:06,960
Her husband was terminally ill and she wanted to give up.

945
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,360
Maybe...

946
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,519
Ms. Jiang.

947
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:14,519
I'm not talking about you.

948
00:42:14,809 --> 00:42:16,159
We all know...

949
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:18,880
that it was Mr. Jiang himself who doesn't want to get treated.

950
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:20,360
That mouth of yours.

951
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:22,519
I'll seal it for you sooner or later.

952
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,719
Dr. Xiao, this is the medical record you asked for.

953
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:27,809
Thank you.

954
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:35,719
Mom.

955
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,769
The doctor already made it very clear.

956
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,159
If we intubate the nasogastric tube,

957
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:40,440
Dad can live for six more months.

958
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,480
Mom.

959
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,769
No matter what, we don't want Dad to give up on treatment.

960
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:45,329
You love your dad.

961
00:42:45,769 --> 00:42:46,840
You can't bear to part with him.

962
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,159
However, as a filial child,

963
00:42:48,329 --> 00:42:49,719
you should do as he wishes.

964
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,599
Mom, it's not that we're not filial.

965
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,079
If the doctor tells me...

966
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:54,329
that Dad wouldn't be able to make it...

967
00:42:54,329 --> 00:42:55,480
and we can't save him anymore,

968
00:42:55,769 --> 00:42:56,809
we'll accept it.
