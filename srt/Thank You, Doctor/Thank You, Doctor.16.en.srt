00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,518
(Thank You, Doctor)

00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:30,159
(Adapted from the novel "ICU 48 Hours" by Sheng Li)

3
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,079
(Episode 16)

4
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,680
Heart rate's coming down.

5
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,040
- Told you it'd be okay. - Your heart was overloaded.

6
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,040
We stabilized it with medication.

7
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:42,479
If you don't get your baby out, it's going to die.

8
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,078
- Call OB-GYN. - Okay.

9
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,000
You're still going to force surgery on me?

10
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,439
I'll sue you.

11
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,719
- Ma'am, your baby is in danger. - What are you doing?

12
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,000
Don't touch me.

13
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,159
Please calm down.

14
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:54,239
- Leave me alone. - Honey, what are you doing?

15
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,400
If you want your child to die, you can leave now.

16
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,719
- Don't scare me. - I'm not scaring you.

17
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,760
Do you know how serious your condition is right now?

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,159
Listen.

19
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,959
I've worked...

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,120
in a very tough medical environment before.

21
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,479
There was a pregnant woman.

22
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:12,400
She had prenatal bleeding at nine months of pregnancy.

23
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,959
In such a difficult situation, she still trusted us...

24
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,090
and cooperated with us.

25
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,719
In the end, the baby was delivered.

26
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:21,599
Pregnant women are seriously...

27
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,280
Listen up.

28
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,719
There are many war-torn places in the world.

29
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,599
For the women there,

30
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:32,000
giving birth to a child is not an easy thing to do.

31
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:35,319
There's no good medical environment.

32
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,719
They don't get supplements anytime, anywhere.

33
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,240
Yet you won't cherish such a good environment.

34
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,520
Honey.

35
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,520
- Let's listen to the doctor. - Please trust us.

36
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:48,960
Trust us. The baby will be fine, okay?

37
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,280
Take her to the OB-GYN.

38
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:51,680
Pull up a flatbed.

39
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,840
I know why you came back to Shanghai.

40
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,719
Why?

41
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,520
To look for an old friend.

42
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,360
What are you doing?

43
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,000
How did the surgery go?

44
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,400
The cesarean section went well.

45
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:28,080
She had a daughter. She's been sent to the nursery.

46
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,639
I didn't expect Xiao Yan's heart to be so soft.

47
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,759
She's sleeping so soundly.

48
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,799
Right.

49
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,039
You're very weak. Why don't you go back to bed?

50
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,840
I'm fine.

51
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,680
What did you give her?

52
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,639
Protein, carbohydrates, and fat.

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,479
That's what she needs to grow.

54
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,719
- Thank you. - Thank you.

55
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,240
Dr. Bai.

56
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,198
A new life,

57
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,319
a new beginning.

58
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:42,680
Dr. Xiao.

59
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,079
You should have a new beginning too.

60
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,079
Thank you.

61
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,399
Hello.

62
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,680
Are you doing this on purpose?

63
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:28,240
It wasn't easy for me to take half a day off.

64
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:29,839
Wake up.

65
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,639
Two emergency patients are coming in.

66
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:33,199
We're up to our necks.

67
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,000
The director wants you to come back and help.

68
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,319
Wait for me.

69
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,679
Dad, where are you going?

70
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,680
I'm in a hurry.

71
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,679
Have your breakfast first.

72
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,439
I don't have time. I'll eat when I'm back.

73
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:48,160
Dad, what about me?

74
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,920
Just call Xu Yi Ran if there's anything.

75
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,839
- Bye. - Dad.

76
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,240
He's always in a hurry.

77
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,799
The speed limit is 50.

78
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,040
You have exceeded the speed limit.

79
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:18,040
The surgery was a success.

80
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,318
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

81
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,920
- Thank you, doctor. - It's what I should do.

82
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:33,679
Tell the two interns from the clinic to come to me.

83
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,799
- Okay. - Okay.

84
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,159
- Come on, make way. - Please make way.

85
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,439
- Make way. - Be careful. Hurry up.

86
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,599
- Hurry up. - Make way, everyone.

87
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,838
- What happened? - She was hit by a motorbike.

88
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,480
Respiratory failure. Blood pressure, 60 over 40.

89
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,360
- Car accident. Call Dr. Bai. - Okay.

90
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,120
Excuse us.

91
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,920
Excuse me.

92
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,159
What's the situation?

93
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,680
- Family, please wait outside. - She was hit by a motorbike.

94
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,639
Her blood pressure is so low.

95
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:38,479
Dopamine combined with norepinephrine.

96
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,480
Okay.

97
00:07:39,481 --> 00:07:41,160
Prepare for an ultrasound. Let's check her heart.

98
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,079
There's blood in the pericardium.

99
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,160
This is a typical cardiac tamponade...

100
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,680
following a chest impact.

101
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:53,759
Check the abdomen.

102
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,720
There is also a lot of bleeding inside the abdominal cavity.

103
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:04,480
Prepare for surgery.

104
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:06,319
Let's take care of the cardiac tamponade first.

105
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,319
Dr. Bai, there's no anesthesiologists around.

106
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,360
There's no time. Paracentesis kit.

107
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,330
Blood pressure's coming back up.

108
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:38,600
- Turn it off when it reaches 200. - Okay.

109
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,720
For now, we can only relieve the pressure temporarily.

110
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,330
We'll take a closer look later...

111
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,840
to find out the specific heart damage.

112
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,450
Call the OR.

113
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,279
Tell them to prepare for chest and abdomen surgery.

114
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:48,450
Call the cardiology again.

115
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:49,840
Tell them to get ready the bypass machine.

116
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,960
Okay.

117
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,558
You're a family member?

118
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:55,600
No, I'm not.

119
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:58,360
I hit her.

120
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,639
Then you were able to contact the patient's family?

121
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:02,759
Yes.

122
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,479
Dr. Bai, I've contacted the operating room.

123
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,519
Okay.

124
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:07,879
Tell her family to come right away.

125
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,159
Why is she bleeding so much?

126
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,600
Suction.

127
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:24,960
There's too much blood.

128
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:26,799
Blood pressure and heart rate are dropping.

129
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,279
Prepare for chest compressions.

130
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,720
Bovie.

131
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:45,120
Miss, how's my mom?

132
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,359
May I know your name?

133
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,919
I'm Huang Shu Fen's son.

134
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,039
The patient is undergoing surgery.

135
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,210
Please be patient.

136
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,360
Hello.

137
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,919
Are you Huang Shu Fen's family?

138
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,360
Yes. Who are you?

139
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,960
I was the one who called you.

140
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,450
You're the one who hit my mom, right?

141
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,799
If anything happens to my mom, I'll deal with you!

142
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:05,089
Why did you hit me?

143
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,449
- I just hit you... - This is a hospital.

144
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,759
Please keep it down.

145
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:12,240
You'll pay for all of my mom's treatment.

146
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:13,919
I've already paid for it.

147
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:15,919
What about going forward?

148
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,450
I'll pay for it.

149
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,960
Don't worry.

150
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,519
I was the one who hit her.

151
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:24,600
I'll take full responsibility.

152
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,240
Let me tell you.

153
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,000
If anything goes wrong with my mom's health,

154
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,720
I'll hold you responsible.

155
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:32,090
I will be responsible.

156
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:37,090
Blood pressure is back.

157
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:52,559
Doctor, how's my mom?

158
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,480
- Are you her family? - Yes, I'm her son.

159
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,039
Her condition is stable now.

160
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,559
She'll be treated in the EICU.

161
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:59,639
EICU? How much will that cost?

162
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,320
Is money more important than her life?

163
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,679
In her current condition, she has to be admitted in the EICU.

164
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,959
What are you looking at?

165
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,159
Go and pay the money.

166
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,080
The money I have on me is used to pay for the surgery.

167
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:10,159
I'll go withdraw some money now.

168
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,279
No.

169
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,399
You want to run away?

170
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,759
Let me tell you. I'll call the police.

171
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:14,960
I won't run away.

172
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,159
I'll find a way to get the money.

173
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,360
I really don't have any money on me right now.

174
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:20,960
Then give me your ID card.

175
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,480
Please wait a moment.

176
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,200
Listen, kid.

177
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,439
You can't run away.

178
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,840
This is a hit-and-run.

179
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:36,360
If you run away, the police will arrest you.

180
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,158
You can be jailed for eight to ten years.

181
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:39,440
Go and get the money. Hurry.

182
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,439
Go and handle the procedures.

183
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,759
The patient will be out soon.

184
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,200
Okay. Thank you, doctor.

185
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,878
I need to go.

186
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:08,240
Please tell the director for me.

187
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,480
Why should I?

188
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,519
You started this.

189
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:13,159
Of course you have to be responsible for me.

190
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:16,240
What happened because of me?

191
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:25,240
Doctor, why isn't my mom awake yet?

192
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:27,519
She'll wake up when the anesthesia wears off.

193
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:32,480
Come back and see us if there's anything.

194
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,720
Okay.

195
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:34,840
Thank you, doctor.

196
00:12:58,799 --> 00:12:59,799
Hello?

197
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:01,840
Have you gotten the money?

198
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:04,360
Did you run away?

199
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,879
We've done a heart repair and a splenectomy.

200
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,279
The surgery was successful.

201
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,720
You're recovering well.

202
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,240
You can move to the general ward in your condition.

203
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,360
Doctor.

204
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,279
You're such a joker.

205
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:25,480
This kind of injury...

206
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,679
takes 100 days to heal.

207
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,960
My heart has undergone a major surgery.

208
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,480
I almost died on the operating table.

209
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,120
I've only been in the EICU for a few days...

210
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:37,879
and you want me to move to a general ward?

211
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,559
Moving to the general ward or not...

212
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,000
depends on your recovery.

213
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,720
You're recovering very well.

214
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:45,480
There's no problem at all moving to the general ward.

215
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:47,000
I won't go to the general ward.

216
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,320
I think the place here is not bad.

217
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,480
Ma'am, the EICU is a good place.

218
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:53,639
But it costs a lot.

219
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,639
The care fee will also cost a lot.

220
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,758
Money is not an issue.

221
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:00,279
You don't have to worry about it.

222
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,639
Someone will pay for it.

223
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,559
The payment won't be late.

224
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:06,279
Give me the good medicine.

225
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,799
Expensive medicine.

226
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,679
The imported ones.

227
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:12,799
What's more important?

228
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:14,200
Money or my health?

229
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,600
I'm already an old woman.

230
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,240
I really don't want another mistake to happen.

231
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,039
This isn't about money.

232
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:25,679
The resources of the EICU are limited.

233
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,039
There are many patients who need this bed.

234
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,960
Since you've recovered,

235
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,399
you should give up the bed...

236
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,519
to patients in greater need.

237
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,399
Doctor, don't worry.

238
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:36,879
I won't stay here.

239
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:40,159
I'm just concerned about my health.

240
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,840
After all, my chest and abdomen were open.

241
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,240
It's not a joke.

242
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,199
I'm begging you.

243
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,879
Let me stay for a few more days.

244
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,120
If I'm really fine,

245
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,360
I'll be discharged.

246
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,679
I'll give this bed...

247
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,679
to patients in need.

248
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,919
I won't give you a hard time.

249
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:11,479
Let me see the medical records for bed five.

250
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,080
She could move to the general ward.

251
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,960
Why would she stay in the expensive EICU?

252
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,879
She's not using her money.

253
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:19,360
It's understandable, old people worry about their health.

254
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,039
That's no reason to use someone else's money like that.

255
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,120
And she wants the best of everything.

256
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,279
I say,

257
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,480
the young man who caused the accident...

258
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:28,840
is just a delivery guy.

259
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,120
Staying in the EICU is so expensive.

260
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,159
How many deliveries does he have to make to make up for it?

261
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,360
It's his fault for causing that accident.

262
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,600
Come to think of it, it's a lesson for those delivery guys.

263
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,320
They ride the motorbike recklessly...

264
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,039
and don't follow traffic rules.

265
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,519
If they don't cause trouble, who does?

266
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,559
How do you know it must be that young man...

267
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,000
who didn't follow the traffic rules?

268
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,879
Besides, even if he didn't follow the traffic rules,

269
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,240
it's understandable.

270
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:55,039
Do you know how hard it is to make deliveries?

271
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,119
From now on,

272
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,359
if my delivery guy is late again,

273
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,120
I won't complain.

274
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,279
Yes, right.

275
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,080
All right, get back to work.

276
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:10,559
Let's do an MRI scan on this patient later.

277
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,639
Doctor.

278
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:13,639
Doctor.

279
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,399
Can Ms. Huang be discharged?

280
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,799
She's recovering well.

281
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,919
Although she can't be discharged,

282
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,279
she can be transferred to the general ward.

283
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,480
She can?

284
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,240
Then why didn't you transfer her?

285
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,480
It's not that we won't let her.

286
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:25,799
She doesn't want to.

287
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,960
The patient has requested to be observed longer.

288
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,480
What's there to observe?

289
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:32,080
Staying in the EICU costs thousands of yuan a day.

290
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,799
That's my one-month salary.

291
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:38,440
No, she has to transfer.

292
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:43,480
- Get up! You're wasting my money! - What are you doing?

293
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,999
- Move to the general ward! - Help me!

294
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,480
Let go. This is a hospital.

295
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,679
I want her transferred.

296
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,320
You can talk it out.

297
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,679
Don't get physical again.

298
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:54,240
It hurts.

299
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,639
Where does it hurt?

300
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:57,080
My chest.

301
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,519
It's all because of him.

302
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:00,599
All right.

303
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,879
If your chest hurts,

304
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,200
I'll arrange another operation for you.

305
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:08,599
Ms. Huang.

306
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:09,920
I already asked the doctor.

307
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:12,410
You don't need to be in the EICU anymore.

308
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,680
Please do me a favor.

309
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,240
Move to the general ward.

310
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,039
What favor?

311
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,079
You didn't do me a favor when you ran into me.

312
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,680
When I was sent here, I lost my blood pressure.

313
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,920
I almost died.

314
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:27,720
Why didn't you do me a favor?

315
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,839
Ms. Huang.

316
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,359
I'm just a delivery man.

317
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:31,890
It's not easy for me to earn money.

318
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,650
It's not easy for anyone.

319
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:35,170
Let me tell you.

320
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:37,319
As long as I'm staying here,

321
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,920
you have to pay for it.

322
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:42,440
Both the medical expenses and the bed.

323
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,240
When I'm discharged,

324
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,799
I'll have you pay...

325
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:48,240
for the lost work time and psychological damage.

326
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,680
- You... - What?

327
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,039
My demands are reasonable.

328
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:53,079
You...

329
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,799
should stop messing around here.

330
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,680
Go deliver food.

331
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,440
Don't run out of money to compensate me.

332
00:17:58,599 --> 00:17:59,680
You're just a bully!

333
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:01,960
Chen Zhi, take him outside.

334
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,079
Come with me.

335
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:06,650
Let's go.

336
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:14,650
Ma'am, I'm telling you.

337
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,960
You're wasting the nation's medical resources.

338
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:18,440
To be serious,

339
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,479
you're violating the interests of other patients.

340
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,319
Okay. Stop lecturing me.

341
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:24,200
I'm not educated.

342
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:25,719
I don't understand what you're saying.

343
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,519
I only know I was hit by someone and sent here.

344
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:30,480
First, I didn't delay my payment.

345
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,359
Second, I didn't cause trouble.

346
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:34,680
No one can kick me out of here.

347
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,720
I'll personally go through the discharge procedures for you.

348
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,599
Thank you.

349
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:40,410
When I'm done here,

350
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:43,119
I'll ask you for help with the procedure.

351
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,000
Why don't we call the police?

352
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,480
Calling the police won't help.

353
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,319
She didn't delay her payment...

354
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:53,679
or cause trouble.

355
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,319
Even if the police come, there's nothing they can do.

356
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,410
Are we going to let her keep hogging the bed?

357
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:00,559
We can't do anything now.

358
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,410
She can stay as long as she wants.

359
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,720
I'm broke anyway.

360
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,650
She'll have to pay for her own stay...

361
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,480
or she can move to the general ward.

362
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:13,000
That's a good idea.

363
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,720
If she doesn't pay up,

364
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:16,719
we can kick her out by right.

365
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,559
You paid 40,000 yuan last time.

366
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,558
She can stay until the weekend with that.

367
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,079
There are still five days left.

368
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,559
Give me a refund then.

369
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,960
My parents begged my grandparents for that 40,000 yuan.

370
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,599
Before the patient is discharged,

371
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,119
we can't give you a refund.

372
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:32,650
What kind of hospital is this?

373
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,679
It's my money.

374
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,170
Why can't I get a refund?

375
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:37,479
Don't panic.

376
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,519
It's the hospital's financial system.

377
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,039
There's nothing we can do.

378
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:43,319
I know it.

379
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,440
You're in cahoots with that woman.

380
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,599
You're trying to take my money!

381
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,650
Young man, that's not true.

382
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,079
I deliver food to people.

383
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,890
I don't even dare to eat better food myself.

384
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,410
All I ate every day were steamed buns.

385
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,720
I thought after these few years of suffering,

386
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,559
I could have some money saved up to get married.

387
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:05,599
But now,

388
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,519
it's all gone.

389
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,240
That's thousands of yuan a day.

390
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:12,799
Isn't the money too hot for you?

391
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,720
Young man, don't cry.

392
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,000
We'll think of something else.

393
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:25,359
What can you think of?

394
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:26,890
You're just trying to take my money.

395
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
That's not true.

396
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:29,119
Calm down.

397
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,200
How about this?

398
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,440
I'll go talk to the patient now.

399
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,890
Human hearts are made of the same flesh.

400
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,920
I'm sure she'll understand your situation.

401
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:38,839
Just wait a little. I'll go now.

402
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:39,960
I'll be right back.

403
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:44,960
Is the result...

404
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,200
for the traffic liability determination out?

405
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,079
Age-wise,

406
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,720
I should call you Ma'am.

407
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:58,000
Well, let's just say sometimes,

408
00:20:58,119 --> 00:20:59,890
we can't just think about ourselves.

409
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:01,758
We have to put ourselves...

410
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:03,039
in someone else's shoes.

411
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:04,358
All right.

412
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:05,440
Drop the act.

413
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,799
I'm tired of hearing it.

414
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:08,920
I'm not moving.

415
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:10,838
I can't even take care of myself now.

416
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,649
I don't have time to think about anyone else.

417
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,319
You should still think about the law.

418
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,440
The police were here just now.

419
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,440
They made it clear to your family.

420
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,410
After their investigation,

421
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:22,799
they were able to reconstruct the entire accident.

422
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,319
In the accident,

423
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,650
you're both responsible.

424
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,039
You ran a red light.

425
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,960
He was speeding.

426
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:30,440
The responsibility is 50-50.

427
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:31,559
In this case,

428
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,169
the hospital bill should be split 50-50...

429
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:34,599
including what has been paid for.

430
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:37,240
I was forced to.

431
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:39,170
I have no choice.

432
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,759
If I had money,

433
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:43,559
I wouldn't have let him pay.

434
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,000
It's been so many days.

435
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,650
You've seen that my son didn't come to visit even once.

436
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:52,239
You want my son to pay for it?

437
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,000
That's impossible.

438
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,880
Stop making a fuss.

439
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,119
At first,

440
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,559
it didn't matter whose fault it was.

441
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,079
I'm the one who hit you,

442
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,319
so I'd pay for your medical bills.

443
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,680
As long as you're fine,

444
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:06,680
I'll accept it.

445
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:08,799
But look at what you're doing.

446
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:10,960
You've recovered.

447
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,519
Why must you stay here to waste my money?

448
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,680
That's right.

449
00:22:14,681 --> 00:22:16,440
Don't you feel bad spending other people's money?

450
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:17,920
You even want the best of everything.

451
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,599
It's not that I had to stay here.

452
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,200
I've thought about it.

453
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,599
If I move to the general ward,

454
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,759
I won't be able to rely on my son.

455
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:31,599
He definitely won't come to see me for sure.

456
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:34,758
Beside the nurses in the general ward...

457
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:36,359
are not as good as the ones in here.

458
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:37,599
So...

459
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:39,519
I didn't want to move.

460
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,839
Are you still going to stay in the EICU now?

461
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,880
No, I'll move.

462
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:46,200
Young man.

463
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,319
I'm sorry.

464
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:50,559
Let's do as the traffic police said.

465
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,200
But I really don't have money.

466
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:56,839
Let's forget what happened between us.

467
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,400
As for the medical bills going forward,

468
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:01,359
I'll pay half.

469
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,799
That will ease your burden.

470
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,200
What do you mean?

471
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:07,680
Are you saying I'll pay for all the expenses from before?

472
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,798
I'm already an old woman.

473
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:11,319
My husband died early.

474
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,359
My son isn't filial.

475
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:16,920
I'm all alone with no one to help me.

476
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,400
I only have a little pension left.

477
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,359
Now, I'm sick.

478
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,559
There's no one by my side to take care of me.

479
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:29,200
Take pity on this old woman.

480
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,480
All right.

481
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:32,079
You should stop the moral blackmail.

482
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,199
Doctor.

483
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,680
How is this moral blackmail?

484
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:36,119
In order to rush back to the hospital...

485
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,480
to operate on a patient a while ago,

486
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:39,559
I got a ticket for speeding.

487
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,240
I was frustrated too.

488
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,359
I was trying to save someone, but I was punished for it.

489
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:45,000
But then I thought it through.

490
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:47,680
That kind of thinking is moral blackmail.

491
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:49,439
Even if I was saving lives,

492
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,279
I can't cover up the fact that I violated regulations.

493
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,400
So I accepted my punishment willingly.

494
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,079
Every one of us...

495
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:59,079
should take responsibility for what we do.

496
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,759
Isn't that natural?

497
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,599
I'm sorry, Ms. Huang.

498
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:06,400
My family isn't well-off.

499
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,319
The few thousand yuan spent took me a lot of effort...

500
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:11,039
to save up by delivering food one by one.

501
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,599
Let's just do...

502
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:15,519
as the traffic police said.

503
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,519
Young man, why are you so unkind?

504
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:19,358
Are you trying to kill this old woman?

505
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:20,439
Ma'am.

506
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,720
You just recovered. Don't get too worked up.

507
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:23,838
Chen Zhi.

508
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:25,199
Help the patient with the procedures.

509
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,240
Okay.

510
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,598
What?

511
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,799
Are you ganging up on an old woman?

512
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,039
Please calm down.

513
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,279
How about this?

514
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,319
I'll ask the traffic officer to come here.

515
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:37,599
You can talk to him.

516
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,279
You were here and there in the day.

517
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:44,359
So you went to the police station to pay the fine.

518
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:46,680
It's all because you rushed me.

519
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,039
You have to reimburse me.

520
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,200
You drove the car.

521
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,400
I won't reimburse you.

522
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:52,400
Isn't this moral blackmail?

523
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:54,599
What is he blackmailing you for?

524
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:57,559
During the day, to save someone,

525
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,519
he broke the traffic rules and was fined.

526
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,039
That's what we should do.

527
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,400
Dr. Bai, you're very wise.

528
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,839
I'm just doing my job.

529
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,319
We should all learn from Dr. Bai.

530
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,000
You're too kind, Dr. Xiao.

531
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,000
Indeed.

532
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,240
Do you still want me to reimburse you?

533
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,839
What happened, Mr. Jiang?

534
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,359
Are you hurt again?

535
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,640
Here.

536
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,319
Come on.

537
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,880
Here.

538
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,119
Here.

539
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,400
Wait, let me.

540
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:05,599
Here, sit down.

541
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:06,599
This...

542
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,880
What happened?

543
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:11,400
I wanted to lie down in bed,

544
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:13,039
but I tripped and fell.

545
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,400
Mr. Jiang, you should have called for me.

546
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,640
I'm fine.

547
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,880
Get busy. I'm fine.

548
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,480
All right.

549
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,759
Are you okay?

550
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:24,798
- I'm fine. - I'm going to do the laundry then.

551
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:25,839
Okay.

552
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:28,880
Mr. Pan.

553
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:30,799
I want to have green beans for lunch.

554
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,599
Are we out of them?

555
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,480
Didn't the head nurse say...

556
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:38,200
to make you cabbage and cucumber for lunch?

557
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:40,559
I've washed and cut them. I'm about to cook.

558
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:44,279
I don't know why I just feel like having them.

559
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:45,880
All right.

560
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,960
I'll buy them for you.

561
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,960
Mr. Pan.

562
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,640
Open the window for me.

563
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,440
Okay.

564
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,480
Leave the screen open.

565
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,680
I want to get some fresh air.

566
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:03,400
Okay.

567
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,559
Cover up.

568
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:11,440
Here.

569
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:12,680
Okay.

570
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:14,400
All right.

571
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,680
I'll go.

572
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,640
Thank you.

573
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,880
Don't mention it.

574
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:22,920
It's not like I'm not getting paid for this.

575
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,399
Mr. Jiang!

576
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,680
(I'm sorry. I hope you live a better life.)

577
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:34,160
(I love you. Xian Yun)

578
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,919
- What's the patient's condition? - He fell from the fourth floor.

579
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,240
Blood pressure, 70 over 50. Heart rate, 135.

580
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,440
He's in hemorrhagic shock.

581
00:28:43,441 --> 00:28:44,920
Dual intravenous access has been established.

582
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,000
Lin Zhi.

583
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:51,039
- What's going on? - It's Ms. Jiang's husband.

584
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,358
Keep the dopamine pumping at 200 milligrams.

585
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:02,359
Prepare four units of red suspension.

586
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,440
Okay.

587
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,839
Prepare for an ultrasound.

588
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,159
Make a conventional four-tube.

589
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,000
- Call the OR. - Okay.

590
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,759
There's a lot of fluid in the abdominal cavity.

591
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:02,599
How's the OR?

592
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,758
Xian Yun!

593
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:04,799
Ms. Jiang.

594
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,160
Xian Yun.

595
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,240
- How is it? - Xian Yun.

596
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:09,838
- What happened? - Calm down.

597
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:11,159
- I... - Wait a minute.

598
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,720
He was fine when I left the house.

599
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:14,799
- Calm down. - Let's take a CT scan first.

600
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,799
Ms. Jiang.

601
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:18,839
- Don't panic. Calm down. - Xian...

602
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,319
- Calm down. - Xian Yun.

603
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,400
- Doctor! - Xian Yun.

604
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,039
Mr. Jiang doesn't want to be saved.

605
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,279
He said that to me himself in the ambulance.

606
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:27,720
He said...

607
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,039
he has pancreatic cancer.

608
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:30,319
It's terminal.

609
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,199
He won't make it,

610
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,759
so you don't have to save him.

611
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:41,640
Okay.

612
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,680
I got it. Thank you.

613
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:44,880
All right.

614
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,599
Don't worry. The surgery should be quick.

615
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,319
I've asked around.

616
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,839
I'll go and talk to her.

617
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:57,160
Okay.

618
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,039
I'm almost done asking around.

619
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,400
A month ago,

620
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,359
Xian Yun did make Pan...

621
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:15,839
send him to Fifth Hospital.

622
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:17,559
At that time, Xian Yun said...

623
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,920
he went to catch up with an old friend.

624
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,519
When he came out, he wasn't in a good mood.

625
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,240
Pan thought he simply felt sick, so he didn't care much.

626
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,519
After he returned,

627
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,240
Xian Yun reminded Pan again and again not to tell you...

628
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:32,920
that he went to the hospital.

629
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:34,639
He didn't want you to worry...

630
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,480
or be unhappy that he was outside for so long.

631
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:39,400
Just now,

632
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:41,960
I asked the staff at Fifth Hospital.

633
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,519
It's true that Xian Yun went to the hospital for a checkup.

634
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,319
He has been diagnosed...

635
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,480
He has advanced pancreatic cancer.

636
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:06,679
Look.

637
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,839
Well...

638
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:11,078
I think after some time,

639
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:13,239
he should get another checkup at our hospital's oncology department.

640
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,318
Because tumors...

641
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:16,640
aren't the strength of Fifth Hospital.

642
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,839
There's a possibility of a misdiagnosis.

643
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,720
You can go home for now.

644
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,200
You don't have...

645
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:40,640
to go to Ms. Jiang's anymore.

646
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,880
Later,

647
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:43,720
I'll find you a new job.

648
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,599
Dr. Lu.

649
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,000
My matter is not urgent.

650
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:48,640
It's just...

651
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,839
they're both good people.

652
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,359
They don't deserve this.

653
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,000
Isn't Ms. Jiang's husband paralyzed from the waist down?

654
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,079
Yes.

655
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,319
And now he has...

656
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:22,839
terminal pancreatic cancer.

657
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:25,240
Once it's terminal...

658
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:28,440
Maybe that's why he didn't want to live anymore.

659
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,000
Ms. Jiang never mentioned it before.

660
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,720
I heard from Lin Zhi...

661
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:35,640
that she only found out about it.

662
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:40,359
Pain from lower body paralysis...

663
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,479
coupled with advanced pancreatic cancer.

664
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,880
He has severe pain all over his body.

665
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,279
It's hard for ordinary people to even endure it.

666
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,519
Is he still in surgery?

667
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,319
Dr. Liu of general surgery is in charge.

668
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,359
Hepatobiliary surgery and oncology are having a joint consultation.

669
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,720
Why don't we go and keep Ms. Jiang company?

670
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,839
She must be very upset now.

671
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,480
Let's give her some time alone.

672
00:34:23,289 --> 00:34:24,328
Dr. Liu.

673
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:25,480
How is he?

674
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,598
He's stable...

675
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:28,960
and won't be in danger for now.

676
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:30,198
What about his pancreas?

677
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,809
It's advanced pancreatic cancer indeed.

678
00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:33,840
Is it confirmed?

679
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,809
Director Yu of oncology did the biopsy himself.

680
00:34:44,769 --> 00:34:45,879
Can it be removed?

681
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,239
The cancer has already spread to the entire pancreas.

682
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,679
How much longer does he have?

683
00:34:50,769 --> 00:34:51,809
Well...

684
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,119
It's hard to say.

685
00:34:53,329 --> 00:34:54,840
It depends on his mental state...

686
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,519
and the speed of the tumor's spread.

687
00:34:59,329 --> 00:35:00,839
I'll let you two talk.

688
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,039
Okay. Thank you, Dr. Liu.

689
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:12,719
Dr. Lu, I...

690
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:14,960
I need to take a leave.

691
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,119
I know.

692
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,480
Go and take care of Xian Yun.

693
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:20,329
I'll take care of the rest.

694
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:22,360
Don't worry.

695
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:41,559
Dr. Xiao.

696
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:44,039
This is the medication record for bed two.

697
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:49,289
Dr. Xiao.

698
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,639
What do you think will happen to Ms. Jiang?

699
00:35:55,809 --> 00:35:58,719
You have to pay attention to her mood in the future.

700
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:00,679
Got it.

701
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:26,840
Xian Yun.

702
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,440
You're awake.

703
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:30,769
Where do you feel unwell?

704
00:36:30,809 --> 00:36:32,118
Why did you save me?

705
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:33,480
Why did you save me?

706
00:36:34,329 --> 00:36:35,999
Does your stomach hurt again?

707
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,440
Let me give you a massage.

708
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:45,960
Just let me die.

709
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,039
Why did you save me?

710
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:49,719
Just let me die!

711
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:52,159
It hurts so much.

712
00:36:52,289 --> 00:36:54,239
Why did you save me?

713
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:56,639
Xian Yun.

714
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:59,239
You have pancreatic cancer.

715
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,239
You've been in pain for so long.

716
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,960
All this while,

717
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,400
I didn't even know.

718
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:07,769
And I'm still a nurse.

719
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:11,039
I shouldn't have.

720
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,558
Since you're a nurse,

721
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:14,329
you should know about terminal pancreatic cancer.

722
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,288
I don't have much time left.

723
00:37:16,289 --> 00:37:17,880
Why did you save me?

724
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,039
Why didn't you just let me die?

725
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:21,519
Let's hang in there.

726
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:24,559
Medicine is so advanced nowadays.

727
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:25,769
Who knows?

728
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:28,400
There might be a cure the next day.

729
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:43,000
Here. Hold my hand.

730
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:44,920
I'm not afraid of pain. Pinch me.

731
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,960
Xiao Shan.

732
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,480
- Let me give you a massage. - Jiang Shan, just let me die.

733
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:55,289
Why did you save me?

734
00:37:55,769 --> 00:37:57,480
If I die, everything will be over.

735
00:37:57,519 --> 00:37:59,360
It's the best for both of us.

736
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,639
You don't know how painful this is.

737
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:07,839
I know pancreatic cancer...

738
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,880
hurts so, so much.

739
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,809
- I know. - I can't bear it.

740
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,840
I don't want this. It's so shameful!

741
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:16,519
It's beneath me.

742
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,360
It's meaningless to live like this.

743
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:20,399
Do it for me.

744
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,769
Hang in there for me, Xian Yun.

745
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:25,769
I'm begging you.

746
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:28,159
Please call over the doctor who saved me.

747
00:38:28,329 --> 00:38:30,118
- Go. - Okay.

748
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:31,288
- I'll go get Dr. Bai. - Hurry up.

749
00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:33,559
I'll go get Dr. Bai.

750
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:46,199
(Tongshan Hospital)

751
00:38:49,289 --> 00:38:50,329
Dr. Bai.

752
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,809
Xiao Shan told me about you before.

753
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:57,480
She said you're an excellent doctor.

754
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,400
Thank you for saving me today.

755
00:38:59,809 --> 00:39:00,879
Don't mention it.

756
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,960
It's what I should do.

757
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:03,119
But...

758
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:05,480
did Mr. Pan not tell you...

759
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:08,329
that I...

760
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:09,679
didn't need resuscitation?

761
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,039
He did tell me that.

762
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:14,639
But I'm a doctor. I won't do that.

763
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,679
Do you know how much pain I'm in?

764
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:20,769
I don't think you'll ever understand this kind of pain.

765
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,288
If you're in a lot of pain,

766
00:39:22,289 --> 00:39:24,199
I can give you a dose of morphine to help you with the pain.

767
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,519
Can you give me that for 24 hours a day?

768
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,880
It'll hurt even more when the medicine wears off.

769
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,039
Mr. Jiang.

770
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:31,360
People...

771
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:33,480
- shouldn't let their illness get... - Shut up!

772
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,159
I'm sorry.

773
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,000
I'm sorry, Dr. Bai. I swore.

774
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,239
It's okay.

775
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,639
Please trust us.

776
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:43,920
You'll get the best treatment here.

777
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:45,809
We can extend your life.

778
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,159
I don't want to extend my life.

779
00:39:47,329 --> 00:39:48,479
I don't want to live like this.

780
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,159
I just want to die.

781
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,119
Dr. Bai.

782
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:54,840
Do you know how I feel right now?

783
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:57,199
Have you ever seen...

784
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,769
a half-dead cat that has been run over?

785
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:02,159
I was already paralyzed to begin with.

786
00:40:05,289 --> 00:40:06,960
Now I have pancreatic cancer.

787
00:40:08,809 --> 00:40:10,039
I can't do anything.

788
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,039
I can only lie in bed and wait to die.

789
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,719
But have you ever thought about Ms. Jiang?

790
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,360
Do you know that she wants to quit?

791
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,199
She wants to care for me...

792
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,239
and watch me suffer every day.

793
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:25,359
Living like this, I'm just a burden to her.

794
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,678
I drag her down.

795
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:28,400
What's the point of living then?

796
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,360
Dr. Bai, I'm begging you.

797
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,329
If something happens to me next time,

798
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:36,329
if my condition worsens, please don't save me anymore.

799
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,360
I can sign any written promise.

800
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,679
I won't get you or Tongshan Hospital into trouble.

801
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:43,599
I'm touched by what you said.

802
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:46,000
But it's also very selfish of you.

803
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,360
I'm sorry.

804
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,639
I'm a doctor.

805
00:40:48,809 --> 00:40:50,480
It's my job to save lives.

806
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:51,768
I won't let patients...

807
00:40:51,769 --> 00:40:53,769
Don't say those noble words, okay?

808
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:56,360
I know how you doctors think very well.

809
00:40:56,559 --> 00:40:58,400
An angel in white saving lives.

810
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:00,639
But have you ever thought about how I feel?

811
00:41:01,289 --> 00:41:02,519
My life has no worth now.

812
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:03,718
It's meaningless!

813
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:04,719
But as long as you're alive,

814
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,559
it's worthy and meaningful to Ms. Jiang.

815
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:08,159
I'm warning you, Bai Zhu!

816
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,840
If you insist on saving me one more time,

817
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:12,719
with the life you saved...

818
00:41:12,809 --> 00:41:14,000
and the time I have left,

819
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:16,360
I'll sue you and Tongshan Hospital!

820
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,719
This is good too.

821
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,159
For someone to have wishes when alive.

822
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:32,679
Take this as your wish.

823
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,999
Get some rest.

824
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,199
- Dr. Bai. - Don't think too much.

825
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,768
I beg you.

826
00:41:40,769 --> 00:41:42,559
Dr. Bai.

827
00:41:42,809 --> 00:41:43,809
Come back.

828
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,239
Come back!

829
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:52,809
I'm sorry, Xiao Bai.

830
00:41:53,809 --> 00:41:56,039
This illness has made him suffer too much.

831
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,719
Thank you for saving him.

832
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:00,599
It's okay.

833
00:42:01,289 --> 00:42:02,400
During this time,

834
00:42:02,809 --> 00:42:04,519
stay by his side and watch him.

835
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,880
I'm afraid he'll do something stupid.

836
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:10,360
I know.

837
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,159
Ms. Jiang's husband keeps saying he wants to die.

838
00:42:21,769 --> 00:42:23,039
It's hard to watch.

839
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:25,960
Think about his initial condition.

840
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,199
On top of that, he's suffering from advanced pancreatic cancer.

841
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:32,360
And now, he's seriously injured.

842
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,809
All these pain add up.

843
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:37,239
It's not something ordinary people can bear.

844
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:40,039
Is there no other way?

845
00:42:44,289 --> 00:42:46,159
What will Ms. Jiang do?

846
00:42:47,289 --> 00:42:48,480
I really think...

847
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:53,119
we should the patient's wishes sometimes.
