You don't want to have the surgery.

17
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,970
Is it because you think, in case you won't get off the operating table alive,

18
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,230
I wouldn't be able to live well by myself? Is that rigiht?

Yeah, that's right.

But do you know,

21
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,270
we have a chance to cure it.

If we're voluntarily giving it up,

We've always listend to you.

This time, listen to me.

Okay.

You've agreed.

This is wonderful.

Dr. Bai.

38

- Your grandfather has agreed to the surgery?
- If anything bad happens in the surgery...

39
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,860
Don't worry. I'm highly confident in the surgery's success.

40
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,060
Who allowed you to talk like this in front of the patient and his family?

41
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,530
- I was just telling the truth.
- Telling the truth?

42
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,550
What if any problem occurs?

43
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,880
It will bring a huge trouble to you and the hospital.

44
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,460
Teacher, there won't be any what ifs.

45
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,990
You know me.

46
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,150
I never speak without consideration.

47
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,110
Lately, I've looked up all the similar cases.

48
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:41,000
I've also repeatedly researched Old Mr. Chen's condition and all the imaging test results.

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,410
So, this is the surgical plan that I've drawn up.

50
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,560
Please take a look.

51
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,400
Please take a look.

52
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,360
Right now, Old Mr. Chen and his family have all agreed to it.

53
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,250
I just need you now.

54
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,030
Sir...

55
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,550
Bai Zhu, let me tell you something.

56
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:54,010
For this surgery, you must devote 200% of your efforts.

57
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:57,280
If anything bad happens, I absolutely won't forgive you.

58
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,050
Teacher, you can rest assured.

59
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,790
Go on.

60
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:33,590
Prepare to start. Be ready with vacuum and gauze.

Scissors.

65
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:57,700
The tissue adhesions are far worse than we expected.

66
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,660
It looks like the surgery's risks are a lot higher than we previously estimated.

67
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,180
Yeah. It's hard to do.

68
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,680
It's not too late to give up the surgery now.

69
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,750
Prepare for extracorporeal circulation.

70
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,830
It's possible to have heavy bleeding during the surgery.

71
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,880

The tumor has been completely removed.

00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:25,260
Also, the heart's size and function are completely back to normal

84
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:29,760
If nothing happens unexpectedly, Old Mr. Chen can leave the hospital after half a month.

85
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,350
- It's fine now?
- Yes, it's fine now.

Dr. Bai, thank you.

87

I've said it before, I've never made a mistake in a surgery.

89

Bai Zhu, you are too awesome.

91
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,400
Don't praise him anymore. If he's praised more, he won't even know his surname anymore.

92
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,880
It's the same saying. There are risks in every surgery.

93
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,790
But my name, Bai Zhu, stands for risk avoidance.

94
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,970
Look at how prideful he looks everytime. Isn't he annoying?

95
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:10,440
Our Bai Zhu is good enough to be proud.

96
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,430
Then... let me be quiet for a while.

97
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,810
I still need to draw up a surgery plan.

98
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,030
Is that right?

99
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,200
Sure, we'll leave then.

Fine, you go ahead.

- My usual.

Okay.

168
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,600
Your very luck, Dr. Bai.

169
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,860
This is the final cup with this batch of beans, I even marked it urgent.

Is it? Thanks.

Let's put it this way. If high risk investment can save many people's lives,

then it will be worth it.

Okay.

- They're on their way.

- Me too.

For someone who sell medical equipment cannot consider as doctor. Get out of the way.

Wait. She is pregnant and also heart failure, this condition is complicated.

Let's wait until the ambulance are here.

What if there is any accident while we move her?

Are you blind? Look at the traffic condition.

If we wait for the ambulance here, both the mother and baby could die.

Wait! We need to calm down in this kind of situation.

I know you're a doctor and you can save her.

If we move her and one tiny vessel exploded,

Aortic sinus aneurysm.

Fine. Got it.

No, please don't come here. Please go to the ER at Tongshan Hospital.

Okay.

You heard it. Aortic sinus aneurysm.

No matter if we move her or not, this aortic sinus aneurysm can explode at anytime.

Instead of waiting here to die, we need to send her to the hospital immediately.

Hi Xu Yi Ran. I'm sending a pregnant aortic sinus aneurysm patient your way, please get ready.

Not yet.

How are you, Director Lu.

00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,800
You are...?

255
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,760
I am Xiao Yan. Sorry that I'm late. I ran into this patient on the way.

256
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,290
Xiao Yan, who came back from the Lausanne University Hospital?

257
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:16,330
Welcome, Dr. Xiao.

258
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,960
This is so cool.

259
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,940
If I hadn't insisted, the patient would still be lying on the side of road now.

260
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:28,130
Okay. Everyone, go back to your work.

261
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:42,110
She doesn't look like a doctor.

262
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:45,240
She came back from abroad, different from us.

263
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:54,790
Take a look. The aortic sinus aneurysm has ruptured into the right ventricle.

264
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,980
Sudden death is possible anytime due to heart failure.

265
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,830
Do you see it?

266
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,120
If she hadn't been sent to the hospital in time, it would be one corpse and two dead lives now.

267
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:05,630
Sure, I admit it. You made the right choice this time.

268
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:06,440
It's good that you admit it.

269
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,020
But, to rashly moving the patient without knowing the patient's medical history is,

270
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:13,320
in a way, taking risk with someone's life.

271
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,220
It's extremely irresponsible.

272
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:18,200
Therefore, next time, If I still encounter a similar situation,

273
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,610
I would still insist on my choice. It's also a choice that a doctor should make.

274
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:22,900
You really talk tough.

275
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,980
The correctness of the result doesn't give justice to the process.

276
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,180
A doctor's justice is to cure the illness and save the life.

277
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:30,860
The patient is fine now, the two of you. Hurry and go change your clothes.

278
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:35,260
All this talk makes me want to see the new female doctor.

279
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:38,460
What's so good to see? It's just two eyes and one nose.

280
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:42,320
- When you say that, I want to see her even more.
- Someone feels that he is out of favor.

281
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,340
Out of what favor?

282
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,610
In the past, no matter if you like him or dislike him,

283
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:50,550
everyone talks about him. But look at it now,

284
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,640
everyone is talking about Xiao Yan.

285
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,260
He is no longer everyone's focal point. He's out of favor.

286
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:01,460
That's not a problem. Our Bai Zhu is always the focal point in my eyes, right in the center.

Speak of the devil...

Aren't you being undisguisedly bold?

292
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:18,520
I think you're the only one who treats her as your center and focal point.

293
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,880
Xu Yi Ran, do you have some ideas?

294
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,860
She is pretty, and she came back from abroad. She looks like a good doctor.

295
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,090
What good doctor?

296
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:30,150
A doctor who sells medical equipment on the side? You'd dare to believe her?

297
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:33,510
If she is the one saving the patient, she would make the patient

298
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:37,350
pay 2,000 on a problem that can be solved with 200 bucks. How is she a good doctor?

299
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,470
How are you?

300
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,280
Keep talkng.

301
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,190
- He wasn't talking about you.
- I was indeed talking about her.

302
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:47,330
Don't talk anymore.

303
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:52,220
Please don't continue to make remarks that insult my reputation.

304
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,040
I'm just telling the truth.

305
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:59,310
That's right. I did have a few product introduction pamphlets on me today.

306
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:03,410
Even though I was previously working in the Lausanne University Hospital,

307
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:06,760
but later I went to West Asia to work for Rescue Without Borders.

308
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,980
They had no access to advanced equipment there.

00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:11,950
But Emergency ICU have the state-of-art equipment right now.

00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:14,870
I wanted to understand more about my future work enviornment. Is this a problem?

311
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:17,740
No problem. Absolutely no problem.

312
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:21,650
Furthermore, I met this Dr. Bai for the first time this morning.

313
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:25,260
I didn't know the car that park illegally at the entrance belonged to you.

314
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,260
I'll also apologize to you for accidently bumped and spilled your coffee this morning.

315
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:31,460
But if Dr. Bai is such a petty and vengeful docor,

316
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,630
you can come to me anytime in the future.

317
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:36,630
But please stop saying untruthful remarks.

318
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:43,640
Is that how it was? Dr. Xu was just saying you're a good doctor. I refuted him

319
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,230
because, in my mind, there is only one standard for a good doctor.

320
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:49,010
Can he cure illness and save lives?

321
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:52,790
It's too bad. During the process to rescue Wang Qing,

322
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:57,060
you can not be considered a qualified doctor. Any questions?

323
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,970
Whether or not I'm a good doctor is not for you to say.

324
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:14,240
She looks really fierce, as expected of someone who returned from abroad.

325
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,290
What's the matter?

326
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:20,240
You won't be able to control her.

327
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,250
I'm not going to control her.

328
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:25,210
I, Xu Yi Ran, am a romantic with principles.

329
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:28,370
I have always adhered to the principle that rabbits do not eat grass by the nest.

330
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:32,600
I'll never flirt with my colleagues. Also, let me tell you this, starting today,

331
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,090
I will draw a clear line between Xiao Yan and me as a man and a woman.

332
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:41,170
It's okay to be afraid. Don't try to find an excuse for your cowardice.

333
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:42,990
If you aren't afraid, you can go for it.

334
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,280
Are you up for it? Are you?

335
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:51,030
<i>[Emergency]</i>

336
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:56,510
The exam's results show that the aortic sinus aneurysm has ruptured into the right ventricle.

337
00:28:56,510 --> 00:29:01,400
It's already caused heart failure in the patient. Cesarean section must be performed before heart repair surgery.

338
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,230
Otherwise, the patient may die suddenly due to heart failure.

339
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:06,300
Therefore, the surgery must be performed as soon as possible.

340
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,990
If the Cesarean section is done first to remove the baby,

341
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,790
will there be any danger to Wang Qing?

342
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,160
Yes, it may exacerbate the patient's heart failure.

343
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,220
It's possible that the patient won't leave the operating table alive.

344
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:19,220
What about doing the heart repair surgery first?

345
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:23,400
What is the danger to the baby?

346
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:27,530
To perform the heart repair surgery, extracorporeal blood circulation must be established first.

347
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:31,270
But those measures like blood anticoagulation and general anesthesia

348
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:35,280
may cause placental abruption. The fetus may be stillborn.

349
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,690
We don't want this baby then. Let's do the heart repair surgery first.

350
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:43,280
Dr. Xiao, do the cesarean section first.

351
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:47,930
Even if there is 10% risk to the baby,

352
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:49,900
I still won't want it.

353
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,520
Did you not understand what the doctor just said?

354
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:56,540
Dad, I understand it.

355
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:59,860
That's why I want to do the cesarean section first.

356
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,620
I want to give birth to the baby.

357
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,740
Don't be foolish, child.

358
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,550
My husband is dead.

359
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:10,660
So I won't have the chance to bear children again.

360
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:14,820
I mus give birth to the baby first.

361
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:18,520
Dr. Xiao, you can go back to your work first.

362
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:22,040
We'll discuss about this matter and give you an answer later.

363
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:25,530
Alright. But I must remind you on something.

364
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:28,750
The patient's condition cannot be prolonged much longer.

365
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:33,060
You don't have much time to consider. Please give me an answer quickly.

366
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,200
Yes, we'll try to hurry.

367
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:52,280
How long will Wang Qing's family consider it?

368
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,900
I'm really worried for her.

369
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,920
Can't the parents respect their child's wish?

370
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:01,530
Dr. Tang, you aren't a mother yet, are you?

371
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:04,520
Not yet. If it were me,

372
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,960
I wouldn't be like this.

373
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,750
If you haven't experienced it yourself,

374
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:11,050
what makes you qualified to judge Wang Qing's choice?

375
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:13,360
Don't use your moral values to judge others.

376
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,650
But her parents' way of thinking will make her lose the baby.

377
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:21,500
As a doctor, we can only tell them from the therapeutic perspective regarding the best choice

378
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,670
instead of using our values to criticize them

379
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:28,270
or even influence the choice of treatment options.

380
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:32,130
When you do this, how will you be different from the dislikable Dr. Bai?

381
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:38,720
No matter if you agree or not,

382
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,260
I must do the cesarean section first.

383
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,390
I want to

384
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:47,580
- give birth to this baby.
- What are you trying to do?

385
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,570
Don't you want to stay alive?

386
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:52,130
Qin Shan is already dead.

387
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:54,510
You must take care of yourself first.

388
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,450
You must stay alive and well first.

389
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:59,560
It's because Qin Shan is dead,

390
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,760
that's why I must give birth to this baby.

391
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,800
I want to give him a descendant.

392
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,700
I understand. Listen to Mom.

393
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:18,040
Even if you give birth and you, mother and child, are safe and sound,

394
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:23,100
how will you handle things by yourself in the future? How will you take care of the child and make a living?

395
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,050
I won't get married again.

396
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:30,950
I have a job, and I earn wages.

397
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:33,520
By myself,

398
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,270
I can raise the child.

399
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:38,860
Life won't be as simple as you imagine.

400
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,950
If anything bad happens,

401
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:46,760
what do you want your mom and me to do? You are our only child.

402
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:52,120
Dad, Mom.

403
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:56,150
I know you are thinking for my sake.

404
00:32:56,150 --> 00:33:00,620
You can't bear to see me in danger.

405
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:06,230
But think aout it, even if it weren't for Qin Shan,

406
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,960
this baby in my belly

407
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,570
is also mine.

408
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:14,480
I am also a mother.

409
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:19,380
Why are you so stubborn?

410
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:22,500
Therefore, if you're really thinking for my sake,

411
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,990
agree to do the cesarean section first.

412
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:28,970
This matter isn't up to you.

413
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,680
No way.

414
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:41,620
<i>[Emergency Room]</i>

415
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:48,050
Doctor, how is my baby?

416
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:49,640
The baby is fine,

417
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,670
but the problem now is not the baby, it's the surgical plan.

418
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:55,580
I already made myself very clear.

419
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:59,670
I want to first do a C-section, then get cardiac surgery.

420
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:01,180
But your parentsâ€”

421
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:05,020
I will decide on my own surgery.

422
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:07,730
Please arrange me for surgery as soon as possible.

423
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,380
The patient's current situation

424
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,620
doesn't allow for restlessness. So we won't relocate her to a different department.

425
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,630
Let's keep her in the emergency room for now.

426
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,650
Regarding the surgical procedure, we'll have the obstetrics and gynecology department's Director Wang be the head surgeon.

427
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:21,500
Both surgeries will be performed simultaneously.

428
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:25,440
The plan has already been confirmed, I have no objections. But there's one thing,

429
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,840
I want to apply to be the head surgeon for the cardiac repair surgery.

430
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:30,550
Doctor Xiao, you will do the cardiac repair surgery.

431
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:32,850
- She will do it?
- Yes. I will do it.

432
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:34,610
Don't bite more than you can chew. This is not an ordinary surgery.

433
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:36,720
I've completed similar surgeries in the past.

434
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,380
And they were under situations with poor medical conditions.

435
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:42,150
So I believe that this time, I can complete the surgery too.

436
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:44,250
Doctor Xiao, as long as you have confidence.

437
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,960
What is confidence good for?

438
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:50,090
Teacher, it's not like you don't know her skills. Previously, she almost caused harm to Wang Qing.

439
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,400
We shouldn't joke with the patient's life at risk, right?

440
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:56,570
I am well aware of Doctor Xiao's abilities. And I also know what happened previously.

441
00:34:56,570 --> 00:35:00,450
You just happened to get in contact with the patient's parent to learn about the patient's illness.

442
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:02,790
If you had not known about the patient's illness,

443
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:05,430
the fact that Doctor Xiao was adamant to not transport the patient was correct.

444
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:08,280
On the contrary, you are reckless.

445
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,580
I'm telling you, there will be a day where you will cause a big problem.

446
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:15,430
- No, Teacherâ€”
- Alright, it's decided.

447
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:18,360
Doctor Xiao will be the head surgeon for the cardiac repair surgery.

448
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,560
Bai Shu, you will be Doctor Xiao's assistant.

449
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,740
I be an assistant for her?

450
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,390
Dismissed.

451
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:37,110
I told you earlier, don't be too proud. Look at you now,

452
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:39,400
even your cardiac surgery has been stolen.

453
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:43,120
What kind of a friend are you? Who's side are you taking?

454
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:46,190
What's the big deal about not doing the surgery? It's not like you need this one.

455
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:49,700
It's not that he needs this surgery. It's that he can't let it go.

456
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,220
Will you suffocate if you don't say a word?

457
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,350
Yes.

458
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,300
Move it.

459
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:58,880
Didn't you always believe that miracles are created by man?

460
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,670
Perhaps Doctor Xiao can also make it happen.

461
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:04,840
It's exactly because it's her, that I don't believe it.

462
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,590
Don't worry. Aren't you her assistant? You can keep an eye on her.

463
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:26,170
- Doctor Bai.
- I'll give you one last chance.

464
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:29,660
- What chance?
- Go find the Dean. Tell him you want out of Wang Qing's surgery.

465
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:32,390
If something goes wrong, you can't bear the responsibility.

466
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,820
Let's make a bet.

467
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,930
What bet?

468
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:42,410
You can have a seat on my ride. I'll take you for a ride.

469
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:46,970
If you don't puke, then I lose. I will back out of Wang Qing's surgery.

470
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:51,220
If I win, you will stop bothering me from now on. How's that?

471
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,900
So childish.

472
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:56,760
So Doctor Bai is a coward?

473
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:03,200
I'm telling you, prodding me to do what you want won't work on me.

474
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,690
But I am willing to see you lose.

475
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:08,840
Hold onto your helmet.

476
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:15,280
Just wait to be my assistant, Doctor Bai.

477
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,070
Who the winner and loser is has not been decided.

478
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,410
Just this?

479
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,720
Come down, Doctor Bai.

480
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,820
I wonâ€”

481
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,580
It's very impressive that you've held out till now.

482
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:00,160
Thank you for not throwing all this up on me.

483
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,470
I already created a surgical plan for Wang Qing based on her newest examination results.

484
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:07,260
I'll send it to you later. I hope you can familiarize yourself with it as soon as possible.

485
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,530
I have high standards for my assistants.

486
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:12,750
I hope you won't have any slip-ups during the surgery.

487
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,670
Wait.

488
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:24,850
I admit, I lost the bet.

489
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:26,690
But this has nothing to do with the surgery.

490
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:29,050
You want to go back on your word?

491
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:32,900
Did you know that regarding ECG monitors, defibrillators, tomography machines,

492
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:36,230
and operating astral lamps, these most basic equipments you all,

493
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:39,590
having any of them at a combat hospital is a luxury?

494
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:42,170
I could do a surgery like this in West Asia.

495
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:45,430
Why can't I do it in a hospital here with all the equipment?

496
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:47,250
I won't play a joke with the patient's life.

497
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:50,920
Let me just ask you one question. Wang Qing's condition is so critical.

498
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,800
As her doctor, why didn't you arrange for surgery with the first chance you had?

499
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,470
The patient and her family weren't on the same page.

500
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:59,100
Again with your theory.

501
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,560
Can't people like you be more professional, more rational?

502
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,560
Can't you put your focus on the illness itself?

503
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,550
So in your eyes,

504
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:09,560
there is only illness, no patient.

505
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,480
Don't quibble with me. What I mean is,

506
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,590
taking responsibility for a patient is putting the illness first.

507
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:20,990
Medicine is a field a science. Not poetry. And definitely doesn't need your flood of emotions.

508
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:22,860
That's right. Medicine is science.

509
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:27,260
But it's not a rearview mirror you can adjust. It's not that organized and clear.

510
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,900
Alright, Doctor Xiao. Let me ask you.

511
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:36,790
What do you think it is?

512
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:41,380
The way I see it, medicine is also the study of people.

513
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:45,410
I think we have very different understandings of what a doctor's benevolence is.

514
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:48,240
You must not have been keeping up with the social news lately.

515
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,980
A fire broke out at a factory.

516
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:53,040
In the rescue process, a firefighter sacrificed his life.

517
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:58,070
This firefighter's name is Qin Shan. He's Wang Qing's husband.

518
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,840
When I first met him,

519
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:23,140
he looked super handsome in that uniform.

520
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:29,000
At the time, I liked to listen to him tell stories.

521
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,760
They were thrilling.

522
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:36,510
But after we got married, I started hearing less stories from him.

523
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:38,820
I was afraid to listen.

524
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,060
Now...

525
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:49,300
Your husband is a hero.

526
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:54,240
Qin Shan is a hero.

527
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,410
So I can't fall behind either.

528
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:02,480
Doctor Xiao,

529
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:07,400
I need to leave a descendant for the hero.
