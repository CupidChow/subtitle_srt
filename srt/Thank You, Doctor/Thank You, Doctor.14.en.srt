00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,399
(Thank You, Doctor)

(Adapted from the novel "ICU 48 Hours" by Sheng Li)

3
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,040
(Episode 14)

4
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,400
Don't get distracted. Keep going.

5
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,799
Charge to 200 joules again.

6
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:43,920
- Charged. - Clear.

7
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,439
He's back.

8
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,519
Continue the surgery.

9
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,759
- Dong Cheng. - Be quiet!

10
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,318
- Dong Cheng. - Dad.

11
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,518
- Dong Cheng. - Calm down.

12
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,640
What's going on? What's with the ruckus?

13
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:08,878
The patient went into ventricular fibrillation.

14
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:09,879
He's being resuscitated.

15
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,639
How could you treat a patient like this?

16
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,840
I'm going to file a complaint.

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,319
Ma'am, please calm down.

18
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,680
We're trying to save him.

19
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,159
We're doing our best to save him.

20
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,199
Are you really saving him?

21
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,810
- Hey. - Why are you making a fuss?

22
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:23,479
Do you want your husband to live?

23
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:24,680
Listen up, all of you.

24
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,039
If anything happens to my husband,

25
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,560
I'll never let you guys off the hook.

26
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,158
Didn't I tell you just now?

27
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:30,280
We're trying to save him.

28
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:31,810
Stop talking nonsense.

29
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:34,840
I heard him screaming in there.

30
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:35,919
Save him?

31
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,319
Is this how you save lives?

32
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,559
Didn't you say it was painless?

33
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,810
Why was he screaming so loud then?

34
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,479
Let me explain it to you again.

35
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,639
The patient went into ventricular fibrillation during surgery.

36
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,960
We have to save him first.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
He screamed...

38
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:49,000
because that's how the body react to the defibrillation.

39
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,039
It wasn't easy to stabilize him.

40
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,639
The doctors have resumed the surgery.

41
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,039
They will be done soon.

42
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,199
Please cooperate with the hospital, okay?

43
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:57,439
I don't believe you.

44
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:58,919
We don't know anything.

45
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,559
I'll believe you if you let us go in and check.

46
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,239
Letting you go in will only interfere with the surgery.

47
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,599
We have the right to know.

48
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,680
Wait a minute.

49
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:07,719
We're not keeping anything from you.

50
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,719
It's because the surgery is too complicated.

51
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:12,159
Anything could affect the patient's life.

52
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,159
If you guys go into the operating room,

53
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,960
your family will be the one at risk.

54
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,800
We understand how you feel.

55
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:24,000
Please trust us and cooperate with us.

56
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:26,759
We'll do our best to save the patient, okay?

57
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,520
Then when can I see my dad?

58
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,960
After the surgery is done,

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,560
the patient will be transferred to the EICU.

60
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:33,800
Why don't you wait over there?

61
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,599
Let's go. Come with me.

62
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:36,879
Come on.

63
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,800
They're the ones calling the shots.

64
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,840
What do we know?

65
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:40,918
Forget it.

66
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:42,120
Let's wait for Dad in the EICU.

67
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,960
I really don't get it.

68
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,840
Why do people treat doctors as enemies?

69
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,680
What's wrong?

70
00:03:58,681 --> 00:03:59,718
Where do you feel unwell?

71
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,759
My chest feels tight.

72
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,319
I can't breathe.

73
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,599
Doctor.

74
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:04,759
Doctor!

75
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,800
- Dr. Xiao. - What have we got?

76
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,879
The patient has chest pain and can't breathe.

77
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:11,239
What's your name, sir?

78
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,280
Sir?

79
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,879
Prepare the emergency room.

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,078
Acute left heart failure.

81
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,610
- 20mg of furosemide. - Okay.

82
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,399
Intubate him. Let's get him to EICU.

83
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,560
Is there a problem?

84
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:34,729
The patient keeps showing symptoms...

85
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,639
like fever, shortness of breath, and cold sweats.

86
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:39,759
But his test results show...

87
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,879
that his inflammatory markers, echocardiogram,

88
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:45,240
and virology-related tests are normal.

89
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,730
Could it be a lung infection caused by the use of a ventilator?

90
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,680
A lung infection?

91
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,519
The inflammatory markers will give you a hint.

92
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:55,959
But he has a high fever.

93
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:57,879
That means there's inflammation.

94
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,360
What's going on?

95
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:01,439
Doctor.

96
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,240
What's wrong with me?

97
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,959
It's acute left heart failure caused by myocarditis.

98
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,519
We put you on a ventilator to help you breathe.

99
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,360
Your vitals are back to normal now.

100
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,480
We already removed the tube.

101
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:12,800
As for other symptoms,

102
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,800
we'll try to identify the cause.

103
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,560
Let's run a complete test on him.

104
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:33,879
My head hurts.

105
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,439
It's really strange.

106
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:38,040
His myocarditis is under control.

107
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,000
It has been a week, but he's still getting fevers,

108
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,959
shortness of breath, and cold sweat.

109
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:46,639
You're right.

110
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:48,199
We've used all related medication.

111
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,479
We've done the necessary tests.

112
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,240
We've tried everything we can.

113
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,279
Why isn't he getting better?

114
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm just worried that if this continues,

115
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:57,879
his myocarditis will get worse.

116
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:02,160
All right. Let's not think about it for now.

117
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,680
Let's get some fresh air and clear our minds.

118
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,959
I just found a case that should be helpful.

119
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,079
You go ahead.

120
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,120
All right then.

121
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:12,040
I'm going out. Don't take too long.

122
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:49,079
This is the last of it.

123
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,439
It's a waste to throw it away.

124
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,758
- You are... - I'm Dr. Xiao's colleague, Bai Zhu.

125
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:05,800
Here's the thing.

126
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,759
Your condition hasn't improved.

127
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:10,199
So Dr. Xiao wants me to check on you.

128
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,680
What for?

129
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,199
She has asked me about my symptoms many times.

130
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,319
You've misunderstood.

131
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,559
We wish to know more about your family,

132
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,800
your work, hobbies, and things like that.

133
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,800
Does it have anything to do with my illness?

134
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,199
It has everything to do with it.

135
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,519
It's very possible that an illness is caused by your surroundings.

136
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,879
So we suspect...

137
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,040
the reason you haven't recovered from your illness...

138
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:33,360
is due to your surroundings.

139
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,519
Ask away then.

140
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:39,160
I work in a small battery factory.

141
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:42,600
My main job is to operate the stamping machine.

142
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,800
How are you feeling today?

143
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,519
I still feel the same.

144
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:56,879
By the way, Dr. Xiao,

145
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,319
a doctor came to see me just now.

146
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,720
He asked me a lot of questions.

147
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,199
Asked you questions?

148
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:21,439
(Thank you, Dr, Bai!)

149
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:30,160
Battery.

150
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,279
Stamping.

151
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,919
Stamping?

152
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,279
Stamp what?

153
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,759
Stop messing around. I'm busy.

154
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,360
As you wish.

155
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,210
How are they related?

156
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,480
Where's Dr. Xiao going?

157
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,329
I think she has gone to that patient's workplace...

158
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,399
to look for the cause of his illness.

159
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:06,519
You seem to be paying a lot of attention to her lately.

160
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:09,840
Where are you going?

161
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,919
Yes?

162
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:49,240
Hello. I'm Luo You Zhi's doctor.

163
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,120
Doctor?

164
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:53,480
What's wrong with Luo You Zhi?

165
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:55,279
He has been admitted to our hospital for myocarditis.

166
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:56,679
His condition hasn't improved.

167
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,519
I was wondering if it is related to his work environment.

168
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,240
It has nothing to do with us.

169
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,679
- Leave right now. - Please wait for a moment.

170
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,330
His condition has worsened.

171
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,519
It's serious.

172
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,878
I just want to take a look inside.

173
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:07,879
It won't take long.

174
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,559
- What is it? - Boss. A woman broke in.

175
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,200
A woman?

176
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,480
She said she was a doctor.

177
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:45,879
She looks like a reporter to me.

178
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,240
- Get someone to bring her back. - Okay.

179
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,639
Stop right there!

180
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,639
It's her. Catch her!

181
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:18,639
Hurry!

182
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,600
You're so clumsy!

183
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,960
Hurry! Catch her!

184
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,720
There's no need to thank me.

185
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:36,840
You've been saying thank you too much lately.

186
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,600
How did it go?

187
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,480
Did you find anything useful?

188
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,879
I noticed that during the production process,

189
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:45,240
the staff didn't use any protection.

190
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:47,239
I suspect that Luo You Zhi...

191
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,080
was poisoned with some kind of harmful substance...

192
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,840
during the process.

193
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,840
That's the cause of his myocarditis.

194
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,600
The harmful substance has not been metabolized.

195
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,840
That's why his symptoms have not improved.

196
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,039
What kind of substance?

197
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,879
I'm not sure. But I took a sample.

198
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:02,679
I'll know when I get back to the lab.

199
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,159
How did you know I was here?

200
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,960
I always know what I want to know.

201
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:11,558
My bike is still there.

202
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:12,879
You sprained your ankle. You can't ride the bike.

203
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,839
I already called a tow truck on the way here.

204
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,878
Don't worry.

205
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,720
They'll send the bike back to the hospital.

206
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,439
But they're a bit expensive.

207
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,720
Get your wallet ready.

208
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:25,679
It's too late to call and cancel it.

209
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:27,799
Hello, is this the Security Bureau?

210
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,519
I want to make a report.

211
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,159
There's an unethical factory.

212
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:49,840
You don't need to help me, Dr. Bai.

213
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:50,879
I can walk by myself.

214
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,080
I was just going to close the door.

215
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,960
What happened to you?

216
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,960
- I'm fine. - Slow down.

217
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,119
Here.

218
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,158
What's this?

219
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:08,840
Get a composition analysis done.

220
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:10,159
Okay.

221
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,639
Sit down.

222
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:12,919
It's okay.

223
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,720
- Go ahead. - Okay.

224
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:26,639
You've changed.

225
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:27,999
You stopped drinking your fancy coffee.

226
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,240
Now, you're drinking cheap coffee instead.

227
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:30,720
I ran out of beans.

228
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:31,759
No wonder.

229
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,159
Have you found the cause of Xiao Yan's case?

230
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,840
Acute cadmium poisoning.

231
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:39,480
Cadmium poisoning.

232
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:41,000
According to Xiao Yan,

233
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,000
the patient works at a factory producing nickel-cadmium batteries.

234
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,679
During the production process, cadmium steam is produced.

235
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,319
But he did not wear any protective gear.

236
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,320
So he breathed the cadmium steam directly into his lungs.

237
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,878
When humans inhale too much cadmium,

238
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:56,519
they often display symptoms similar to myocarditis.

239
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:59,279
The patient's symptoms haven't improved at all.

240
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,158
That means the cadmium level in his blood...

241
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:02,200
must be far over the limit.

242
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,840
You're so smart.

243
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,240
What?

244
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Come here.

245
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:14,798
When Xiao Yan went to the factory to look for answers,

246
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:15,839
you went too, didn't you?

247
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,519
Why? Were you afraid something would happen to her?

248
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:20,919
Whatever happens to her has nothing to do with me.

249
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,558
I went there to find the cause of the patient's illness.

250
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:24,559
I just happened to run into her.

251
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:25,559
Is that so?

252
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,639
But isn't his attending physician Xiao Yan?

253
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,399
It has nothing to do with you.

254
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,480
Why are you so concerned about the patient?

255
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,480
Don't you enjoy watching us compete?

256
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,518
I took care of the problem she couldn't fix.

257
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,720
Shouldn't you be happy for me?

258
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,079
Come on.

259
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,439
You used to be all about pathology.

260
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,840
You only cared about the disease itself.

261
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,399
You never bothered about the patients' stories.

262
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,359
But ever since Xiao Yan came...

263
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,398
Stop.

264
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:48,919
This is not exclusive to only her.

265
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,878
It's my duty as a doctor.

266
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:53,200
And it's my responsibility to my patients.

267
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,999
Don't flatter yourself.

268
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,080
You've changed lately.

269
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,239
Changed how?

270
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,799
Like the Sailor Moon transformation?

271
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,600
If you're Sailor Moon, then I'm Buddha.

272
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,000
You can hide it from others, but not from me.

273
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:06,918
On the surface, you're still the same.

274
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:09,200
You're mean to Xiao Yan.

275
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:11,679
But in reality, you've been helping her solve problems.

276
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,200
Tell me the truth.

277
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:16,000
Do you have feelings for her?

278
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,519
Use your brain.

279
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,840
Why do I need a woman when I already have a son?

280
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,200
Do you think I'm a fool like you?

281
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:31,480
Messing around with women every day...

282
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:32,720
and getting yourself into trouble.

283
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:33,960
Sure, deny it.

284
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,678
Zheng Ya Jie is away studying.

285
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:37,039
Let's see what you'll do when she comes back.

286
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,158
Pay the bill first.

287
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:45,359
Then get a blood test.

288
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,320
Come back and see me when the results are out.

289
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,759
Okay. Thank you, doctor.

290
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,518
How did you get hurt?

291
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:57,558
Hold on, doctor.

292
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:58,639
Let me take some photos first.

293
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,440
Excuse me.

294
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,519
Hey, you can't take photos in the hospital.

295
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:06,799
Okay, I'm done.

296
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,959
How did you get hurt?

297
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,200
Someone hit me.

298
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,279
Hold on.

299
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,480
Exam Room Two.

300
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:19,920
Send a trauma panel.

301
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,279
There's no wound on your head.

302
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:37,920
You caught me.

303
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:40,920
There's no wound, but he did hit me.

304
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:42,759
Then how did you get the blood?

305
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:44,480
I bought it online.

306
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,039
It's fake blood.

307
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:06,359
"No visible injuries to the face."

308
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:07,960
Don't write that.

309
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:09,239
Didn't I tell you?

310
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,598
I did get hit.

311
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:12,720
But there is no wound on your face.

312
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:15,959
How about this?

313
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,359
Write something more serious.

314
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:19,410
For example, a swollen face.

315
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,759
Excessive bleeding and the like.

316
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,410
Just make it as serious as you can.

317
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:25,319
I'm sorry. I can only write based on the actual situation.

318
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:26,599
Miss.

319
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:28,890
I can call you that, right?

320
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:31,920
I went out for a walk with my dog.

321
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,720
Then a man suddenly came right at me.

322
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,519
He was acting up because he was drunk.

323
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,359
Who knows what his problem with me is?

324
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,319
He hit me right in the face.

325
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,169
That place doesn't have security cameras.

326
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,170
If the diagnosis is something minor,

327
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,119
the police won't take any action.

328
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:48,890
Miss.

329
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,240
You can't let the bad guy get away with it.

330
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,119
I sympathize with you.

331
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,719
But I'm just a doctor.

332
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,240
I can only diagnose you based on facts.

333
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:02,650
What's your deal?

334
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,359
How about this?

335
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,650
I'll send you a red packet on my phone.

336
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,959
If you don't have other special needs,

337
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,319
you can leave now.

338
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:23,519
We have other patients.

339
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:24,999
I have a headache.

340
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,890
You have to write it down.

341
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,519
The patient claims she has a headache.

342
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:32,758
Can't you take out the word "claim"?

343
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:33,759
No.

344
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,960
Then I'll get a CT scan.

345
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:38,319
I'm sure there's some injury after getting hit.

346
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:41,278
It would at least cause a concussion, right?

347
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:42,410
Let me remind you.

348
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:46,000
A CT scan usually can't detect concussions.

349
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,240
How do you detect it then?

350
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:49,649
Based on my diagnosis,

351
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:50,920
you don't have a concussion.

352
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,410
I want to get a CT scan.

353
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:01,759
You can pay the bill first.

354
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:02,920
Then you can do the scan.

355
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,839
I'll be back afterward.

356
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,319
Based on the CT scan,

357
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,039
your brain looks fine.

358
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:22,559
There's nothing wrong with it.

359
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:27,079
Miss, I paid for the CT scan.

360
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,000
Just write that I have a concussion. Okay?

361
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:31,480
I already reminded you before the CT scan.

362
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,480
You can't detect a concussion with a CT scan.

363
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,839
What a weirdo I ran into today.

364
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:00,920
Here comes supper.

365
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,920
There are so many flavors.

366
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:06,439
I'm always hungry at this hour.

367
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,480
Let me see.

368
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:09,319
This is your clay pot rice.

369
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,719
This is Xiao Yan's favorite spicy hot pot.

370
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,999
This is Tang Hua's mala beef.

371
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Stay sharp.

372
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,279
Thank you.

373
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:20,519
Do it.

374
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:22,200
Put it here.

375
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,278
Your sou...

376
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:26,279
Soufflé.

377
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:28,079
How pretentious.

378
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,079
Eating this late at night will give you diabetes.

379
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,720
How illiterate.

380
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,079
Shame on you guys.

381
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:46,410
You're having supper without me.

382
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,440
I didn't know you were on duty today.

383
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,440
Eat this.

384
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:50,759
Even though I'm on a diet, I'll keep it.

385
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:51,880
I'll eat it when I'm hungry.

386
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,519
My goodness.

387
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,960
What kind of person is this?

388
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,559
Take a look, guys.

389
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,279
Search for Hao Jia Jia's Weibo.

390
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,679
She's just a girl.

391
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,559
She was walking her dog in the neighborhood.

392
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,439
But because the dog barked too much,

393
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,440
she was beaten up by this drunkard.

394
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:08,358
Look at how badly he hit her.

395
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:09,400
Her face was covered in blood.

396
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,679
I think she even got a mild concussion.

397
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,920
What a terrible guy.

398
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:16,680
Isn't this Dr. Xiao's office?

399
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:18,359
Look, Dr. Xiao.

400
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,079
Her?

401
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:24,558
She's lying.

402
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,559
What do you mean?

403
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,400
That girl came to the hospital this afternoon.

404
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:30,559
She was my patient.

405
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,359
She didn't have any wounds on her face.

406
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,400
That stuff...

407
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:35,558
She bought the blood.

408
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:36,640
It's fake.

409
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:39,599
Why would she do that?

410
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,720
Yes.

411
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,119
It's for the traffic.

412
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,839
It's either for publicity...

413
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,839
or to take revenge on the man.

414
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:48,598
Look at the comment section.

415
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:51,240
There are over 10,000 comments and over 30,000 retweets.

416
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,358
This is the first comment.

417
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:54,879
"Men are inferior animals."

418
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,599
"They only know how to solve problems with violence."

419
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,920
"All the men in the world should die."

420
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,359
They really hit hard.

421
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,279
The second comment is a doozy.

422
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,879
"Girls, this is a jerk of a human being."

423
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,239
"We'll make him stink for the rest of his life."

424
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,839
"He'll never be able to recover."

425
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:12,440
They also included his identity information.

426
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,480
That's so scary.

427
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,160
Tang Hua, isn't this your style?

428
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,960
Don't compare her to me.

429
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,679
Look at her Weibo profile.

430
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,879
"Hao Jia Jia."

431
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,959
"Hero of justice."

432
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,039
That's right. That's your style.

433
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,160
Yes.

434
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:28,078
I'm a cynic.

435
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:29,759
I hate it when men hit women too.

436
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,200
But I hate people like her even more.

437
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,439
Misleading the public through deception...

438
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,839
to get what they want.

439
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,959
Because of people like her,

440
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,200
true warriors of justice are getting a bad rep.

441
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:43,078
If you say so,

442
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:44,640
then I'm impressed.

443
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,799
I've always been impressed with you.

444
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,199
No.

445
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,680
I have to leave a comment.

446
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,278
I'll tell the truth.

447
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:53,519
People are falling for her lies.

448
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:54,959
It's no use.

449
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,119
Most of them are just venting.

450
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,559
Not many people want to know the truth.

451
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,480
I find that hard to believe.

452
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,719
That drunk also posted it on Weibo.

453
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,359
I'm talking about the guy who was exposed by Hao Jia Jia.

454
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,839
His story is totally different from Hao Jia Jia's.

455
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,200
He said he didn't drink that day.

456
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,839
After eating, he took his daughter out for a walk.

457
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,479
Hao Jia Jia's dog wasn't on a leash.

458
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,240
It attacked his daughter.

459
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,839
In his desperation, he managed to scare the dog away.

460
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,479
But Hao Jia Jia caused a bigger scene.

461
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,400
She even insulted his daughter, saying her dog was more precious.

462
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,200
How could she swear at him like that?

463
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:33,519
He couldn't help it and swore back.

464
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,920
After that, they pushed each other.

465
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,358
During the process, he accidentally bumped into Hao Jia Jia's head.

466
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:41,480
But it wasn't a beating like she claimed.

467
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:43,920
And it definitely didn't bleed all over with a concussion.

468
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,278
He also said...

469
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,279
after Hao Jia Jia posted on Weibo,

470
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:49,639
netizens dug up dirt on him.

471
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,839
That day, paint was splashed in front of his house.

472
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,160
He has also been getting threatening phone calls,

473
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:57,920
saying they would make his wife and daughter pay.

474
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,440
Gosh. Why hasn't anyone called the police?

475
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:02,440
He called the police at that time.

476
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,999
But there were no CCTVs.

477
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,078
So there's no evidence.

478
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:07,519
The police haven't released the result of their investigation.

479
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,839
Hao Jia Jia insisted that he was the one who hit her.

480
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,039
Many netizens believe that he's just denying his crime.

481
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:15,278
No one believes him.

482
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,400
All the opinions are against him.

483
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,039
Cyberbullying is so scary.

484
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:19,719
It's not cyberbullying that's scary.

485
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,959
It's those who blindly follow others...

486
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,480
and can't think for themselves that are scary.

487
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:23,599
Dr. Xiao.

488
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,440
The result of cadmium level in Luo You Zhi is out.

489
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:29,920
We can't let her do as she wants.

490
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:31,400
She's just getting away with it.

491
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,480
It's almost gone.

492
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,838
The cold sweats, fever,

493
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:36,319
and shortness of breath have stopped too.

494
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,759
He can be discharged after a few days of observation.

495
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,880
Okay.

496
00:25:39,881 --> 00:25:40,919
Dr. Xiao.

497
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,160
Someone is looking for you outside.

498
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:45,159
There are more patients at the back.

499
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,440
Don't block the way.

500
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,119
Who cares about that? I'm looking for your boss.

501
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,160
Hurry up.

502
00:25:49,161 --> 00:25:50,400
You can go.

503
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,799
What's the matter?

504
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,319
So you really are a doctor.

505
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,799
The Security Bureau shut down our factory.

506
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:56,880
Do you know that?

507
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,920
Did you report it?

508
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:00,119
Your factory manufactured goods with toxic chemicals.

509
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,799
An employee's health was seriously compromised.

510
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:05,079
Don't give me that crap.

511
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,319
You shut down our factory.

512
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,039
What about my loss?

513
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:10,720
Our salaries have been suspended.

514
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:11,799
How do you expect us to live?

515
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,999
So what do you want?

516
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,039
Pay up.

517
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:16,160
500,000. Not a penny less.

518
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:17,599
Your factory's production is illegal.

519
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:18,920
I have the right to report it.

520
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,079
What are you doing?

521
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,480
What is going on?

522
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:22,759
Dr. Xiao, are you all right?

523
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,519
Tang Hua, call the police.

524
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:27,079
There's no point looking for anyone.

525
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:29,200
If you don't pay today,

526
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:30,599
we won't leave.

527
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,679
- We won't leave. - We won't leave.

528
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,920
Don't be silly.

529
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,880
Your colleague is still in critical condition in the EICU.

530
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,079
His life is in danger because of cadmium poisoning.

531
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:39,799
Do you know how he was poisoned?

532
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,359
Because of your evil boss.

533
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:45,160
You're not provided with protective gear while working.

534
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,160
You guys were exposed to dangers in the workplace.

535
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:48,358
Nonsense.

536
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:49,680
Don't listen to her nonsense.

537
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:51,039
Let me tell you.

538
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:52,920
You can always find another job.

539
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,558
But if you lose your life, you'll have nothing.

540
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,240
And now, you're being used as pawns.

541
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:57,359
You're the victims.

542
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,240
- Move aside. - Move aside.

543
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:00,399
You're accusing us now?

544
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,598
- Security. It's them. - Move aside.

545
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:02,599
- What? - Get out.

546
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,318
- What are you doing? - I've called the police.

547
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:06,318
When the police come, none of you can escape.

548
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:07,759
You called the police on us?

549
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,759
I brought my men here today to seek justice.

550
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,279
This is a corrupt hospital.

551
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:15,479
You're just trying to swindle our workers.

552
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,680
Don't distort the truth.

553
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:18,640
I distort the truth?

554
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:20,440
You won't compensate me?

555
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:21,880
Fine.

556
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,519
We're not here to cause trouble.

557
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,440
But I'll expose the hospital's dirty background!

558
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,559
Boss.

559
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,400
What's wrong?

560
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:36,559
Somebody, send him to the emergency room.

561
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,000
Doctor.

562
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:45,759
What's wrong with me?

563
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:46,920
You're awake.

564
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:49,400
You're just like Luo You Zhi.

565
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,079
You inhaled a large amount of cadmium steam,

566
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,559
resulting in acute cadmium poisoning.

567
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,960
That's what he gets for harming others.

568
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:55,480
- He deserved it. - Tang Hua.

569
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,480
When can I be discharged?

570
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,680
You think you can be discharged?

571
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,199
You're under arrest for disorderly conduct.

572
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,240
The police are waiting outside.

573
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,399
Don't even think about running away.

574
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,919
Once you recover, you'll be investigated.

575
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,039
Get some rest.

576
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,480
If you knew this would happen, why did you do it?

577
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,519
You're accusing us now?

578
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,679
- Security. It's them. - Move aside.

579
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,758
- What? - Get out.

580
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:25,558
- What are you doing? - I've called the police.

581
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:26,559
- Get out. - When the police come,

582
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,679
none of you can escape.

583
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,759
Everyone, please leave.

584
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,279
Who are you trying to scare?

585
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,039
So what if you called the police?

586
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:33,079
Who recorded this?

587
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:35,359
I think it was taken by a bystander.

588
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,720
I don't know who posted it online.

589
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,359
It caused quite a stir.

590
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,039
Many netizens are questioning...

591
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:44,160
the performance and fees of our EICU.

592
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,519
Even the head of the National Health Commission called to ask about it.

593
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,480
He wants us to be cautious.

594
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,680
Dr. Jiang.

595
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,680
That man...

596
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:54,720
I've spoken to security to find out what happened.

597
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:57,400
You're not responsible for this.

598
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:00,279
This video doesn't tell the whole story.

599
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,559
It's biased.

600
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,920
I asked you here today to tell you this.

601
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:06,839
Regarding this matter,

602
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:10,839
the hospital will find the right time to handle it.

603
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,759
I don't want Emergency Medicine to act rashly.

604
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,400
Don't make things worse.

605
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:17,920
All right, I understand.

606
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:19,640
Take extra care these few days.

607
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,960
Don't worry.

608
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,919
Who's so insidious?

609
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,400
They're just trying to set us up.

610
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,319
I guess it's for publicity.

611
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,399
Hospital charges these days is a hot topic.

612
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,480
There are all sorts of saying.

613
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,759
Look at this WeChat post.

614
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:38,200
It's an analysis of the hospital's EICU billing.

615
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:39,319
It has been seen over 100,000 times.

616
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:41,160
Traffic is a double-edged sword.

617
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,039
Dr. Lu, look.

618
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,599
I've seen it.

619
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,920
I guess you guys already know, right?

620
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:52,319
Then I won't say anything more.

621
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,720
This is really an undeserved disaster.

622
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,319
The hospital is taking it very seriously.

623
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:59,319
I just came from the director's office.

624
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,480
He asked me to tell everyone...

625
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,439
to continue working in peace.

626
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,920
Don't be affected by this.

627
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,799
The hospital will handle it.

628
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:09,599
How will they handle it?

629
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:11,960
They have their plans.

630
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,240
Just focus on your work.

631
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,359
I finally understand the power of the Internet.

632
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:31,239
In the past,

633
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,119
the Internet gave me great convenience.

634
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,039
Now, I realize how the Internet gave me great trouble.

635
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:38,920
It's like that with everything.

636
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,200
There are good and bad sides.

637
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:47,400
Dr. Xiao.

638
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,720
Aren't you that woman on Weibo?

639
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:55,799
Hao Jia Jia.

640
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,680
Looks like you've seen my Weibo.

641
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:00,400
Did you come for treatment today?

642
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,000
Since you've seen my Weibo,

643
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:04,000
I'm sure you know what kind of situation we're in.

644
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,720
I still hope you'll be with the netizens.

645
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,599
So you're here today...

646
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,279
to ask me to write up a medical certificate per your request.

647
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:13,880
- Thank you for the trouble. - Not at all.

648
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,960
But I won't write it.

649
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,400
But I did get beaten up.

650
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,440
The netizens believe it. Why can't you?

651
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,200
You're distorting what's right and wrong.

652
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,240
You're deceiving the public.

653
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:22,960
Do you want me to expose you?

654
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,480
We can do it the hard way.

655
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,720
Your EICU isn't exactly well-liked online.

656
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,559
This is a corrupt hospital.

657
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,519
You're just trying to swindle our workers.

658
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,119
Who do you think the netizens will believe?

659
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,960
You or me?

660
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,799
Did you post the video too?

661
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:41,960
Of course not.

662
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:44,200
I don't have time for the hospital's nonsense.

663
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,039
Then why are you here?

664
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,039
The online community is furious.

665
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:50,200
They're calling you unscrupulous.

666
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:52,359
What if I fan the flame?

667
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,279
I'll say you took some money...

668
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,920
and you're in cahoots with the drunk jerk.

669
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,079
You insist that my bleeding was fake and I wasn't injured.

670
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:02,119
What do you think the netizens will think?

671
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:04,160
What should I do?

672
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:07,199
Whether or not you're injured can be easily verified.

673
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,959
Who are you trying to fool?

674
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,319
That's because my wounds have healed by the time I came to see you.

675
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,639
I have photos of my face covered in blood anyway.

676
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,480
Who do you think the netizens will believe?

677
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:19,400
When that happens, the EICU will become public enemy number one.

678
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,160
Since you keep talking about the Internet,

679
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,200
I'll share with you a famous online quote.

680
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,759
"Justice may be late."

681
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,680
"But it's never absent."

682
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,039
The doctor is busy.

683
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,479
If there's nothing else,

684
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,759
please leave Tongshan Hospital.

685
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,920
One more thing.

686
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,038
The things you've done weren't self-reliance.

687
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,559
It's selfishness.

688
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:45,160
Fine.

689
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,240
Just you wait.

690
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,999
Will you hurry up?

691
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,640
My husband is in pain.

692
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,838
We've already contacted the doctor. He'll be here soon.

693
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:57,558
Just tell me. How long are you going to take?

694
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:58,838
You can't keep giving him IV fluids.

695
00:32:58,839 --> 00:32:59,960
The patient has a urinary stone.

696
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,119
He has been hurting since he woke up in the morning.

697
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,240
All right, you may go.

698
00:33:02,241 --> 00:33:04,038
You're a doctor, right? Take a look.

699
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:05,599
This is the examination we did two days ago.

700
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:07,480
A surgery has already been scheduled in the upcoming weeks.

701
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,119
We didn't expect his condition to deteriorate.

702
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,160
Can you do the surgery for my husband now?

703
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,519
Stone in the right ureter.

704
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:13,639
Yes.

705
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,640
Hello, sir.

706
00:33:14,641 --> 00:33:17,239
Can you tell me your condition and symptoms?

707
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,239
My right lower back hurts.

708
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,279
What kind of pain?

709
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:22,839
Does it feel like a knot or a tear?

710
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,880
A tear...

711
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,920
A tear?

712
00:33:24,921 --> 00:33:26,599
Tell me the location.

713
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:28,160
Here.

714
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,480
Here?

715
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:30,920
Please lean forward.

716
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,960
Here?

717
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,839
Does it hurt here? Yes?

718
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,960
It hurts.

719
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,240
Can you arrange the operation now?

720
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:37,319
Please hold on.

721
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,559
Like this?

722
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,000
- Does it hurt like this? - Yes.

723
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:41,759
Do you feel like you're holding your breath?

724
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,199
Can you give him an injection to relieve the pain?

725
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,479
Please wait. Does it hurt here?

726
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,640
- Does it hurt here? - Yes.

727
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,720
It hurts here too.

728
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,519
Please wait a moment. Here.

729
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:49,839
It hurts.

730
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,559
Do you feel like pooping?

731
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,838
What about nausea?

732
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:55,480
Nausea, discomfort, or feel like vomiting?

733
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,278
I think we need to do a cardiovascular exam first...

734
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,558
to check his condition.

735
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:01,559
Hold on.

736
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:02,839
A cardiovascular exam?

737
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,759
You must be joking, doctor.

738
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,879
Look at the pain my husband is in.

739
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,960
And you want to conduct random exams?

740
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,039
Aren't you going too far?

741
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,808
It's not random. Because your husband is...

742
00:34:11,809 --> 00:34:14,000
I know it's not easy being a doctor.

743
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:15,119
I don't care if you're aiming for sales...

744
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:17,000
or trying to hit your quota. I'm fine with that.

745
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,119
Later, you can prescribe imported medicine to us.

746
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,360
I can afford them.

747
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,639
But first, you need to fix his pain.

748
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,559
Look at how much he's suffering.

749
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:25,599
You're mistaken.

750
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,000
- Because your husband is... - How am I mistaken?

751
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:28,479
This is the CT scan taken two days ago.

752
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,719
Ma'am, please calm down.

753
00:34:29,809 --> 00:34:31,198
- You can talk to me. - Okay.

754
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,159
Dr. Bai. Here's the situation.

755
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,038
The patient has a stone in his right ureter.

756
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,198
But I took a look at it.

757
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,919
I don't think it's just the ureter.

758
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,808
I'd like to do a cardiovascular exam to check.

759
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:42,000
But the patient's family is not cooperating.

760
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:43,679
Okay, I got it.

761
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,960
Dr. Xiao, here.

762
00:34:45,289 --> 00:34:47,000
Doctor. Take a look at this.

763
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:48,198
- Nothing to see here. Excuse us. - Look at this.

764
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,199
- Here's the report. - Thank you.

765
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,360
It's clearly written here urinary tract stone.

766
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,400
Dr. Xiao.

767
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,400
Why don't we just follow the CT scan results?

768
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,769
Dr. Lu just briefed us.

769
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,639
If anything happens again,

770
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:01,199
I worry that...

771
00:35:01,289 --> 00:35:02,480
She just randomly asked to do another exam.

772
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:04,238
My husband is in pain right now.

773
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:06,000
Okay. I understand your situation.

774
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:07,119
How about this?

775
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,808
We'll get your husband treated first.

776
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:10,400
Please come with me to do the admission procedure.

777
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:11,809
- Okay. - Okay, this way.

778
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:13,960
All right, please disperse.

779
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,999
- Please disperse. - Honey, wait for me here.

780
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,329
- This way. - I'll be right back.

781
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:23,159
Sir.

782
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,400
We might still arrange for a cardiovascular exam.

783
00:35:25,769 --> 00:35:26,919
If you're fine with it,

784
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,078
we'll arrange for surgery right away.

785
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,289
Hang in there.

786
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,360
Relax. Don't be nervous.

787
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,679
Being nervous will affect the ECG results.

788
00:35:47,289 --> 00:35:49,000
Let's get this right the first time.

789
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,159
Where's my husband?

790
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,328
Where did you take my husband?

791
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:04,920
Calm down. This is a hospital.

792
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:07,769
My colleague probably brought him for a checkup.

793
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,289
Take me to see my husband right now.

794
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,400
Calm down.

795
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:11,999
From what you said just now,

796
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,119
it seems like you suspect us...

797
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:16,289
of wanting to charge you more for unnecessary exams.

798
00:36:16,329 --> 00:36:17,359
Is that right?

799
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,719
It's not about the money.

800
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:20,719
You don't care about the patient's feelings at all.

801
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:23,198
Why do you need a heart test for bladder stones?

802
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:24,360
Let me put it this way.

803
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:26,328
Let's say your husband got a heart checkup.

804
00:36:26,329 --> 00:36:28,039
We could find nothing wrong.

805
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,400
But it's possible that his pain is caused by a heart problem.

806
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,919
The doctor from earlier made the inference...

807
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,480
based on her experience.

808
00:36:35,809 --> 00:36:37,519
She's the best ER doctor here.

809
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:38,559
She practiced abroad.

810
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,639
I trust her.

811
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,159
So I hope you can trust us.

812
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,039
You trust her?

813
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,400
You're a doctor. She's a doctor.

814
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:48,440
A doctor did the CT scan for us.

815
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:50,480
Let's talk about the test results.

816
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:52,920
The test result came from your hospital, right?

817
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:56,000
It's clearly stated there that it's urinary stones.

818
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,559
Urinary stones.

819
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,118
Why do you need a heart test?

820
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,519
- Calm down. - Dr. Bai.

821
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,559
The ECG appears to be normal.

822
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:06,039
What does that mean?

823
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:07,679
It could be a dissection.

824
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,519
This is the ECG report.

825
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:12,519
We think your husband has a serious cardiovascular emergency.

826
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:14,360
He needs an enhanced CT scan right away.

827
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,360
Have some water.

828
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:21,599
Thank you.

829
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:26,480
Last year, there was a case at our hospital.

830
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,719
It was also a couple.

831
00:37:28,809 --> 00:37:31,289
The patient had a history of pneumothorax.

832
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,638
During his appointment,

833
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:34,809
we found that he suffers from chest pains.

834
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:37,599
We advised him to get a clear bill on his heart.

835
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:40,289
But the patient adamantly rejected our suggestion.

836
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,159
He only asked to treat the pneumothorax.

837
00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:44,960
Our doctor kept recommending to get his heart checked.

838
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,199
But he wouldn't listen.

839
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,360
In the end, he went home for observation.

840
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:51,599
That night, the ambulance brought him back.

841
00:37:51,809 --> 00:37:52,840
Doctor.

842
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,519
My husband is fine, right?

843
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:55,880
Don't scare me.

844
00:37:56,289 --> 00:37:57,480
I'm not trying to scare you.

845
00:37:57,719 --> 00:37:59,880
I'm just telling you what actually happened.

846
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,329
When a doctor makes a judgment,

847
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,039
it's based on unspoken considerations.

848
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,480
Doctors and patients are not enemies.

849
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,039
If you can spend some time and money...

850
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:11,599
for peace of mind,

851
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,000
I think that's a good deal.

852
00:38:14,289 --> 00:38:15,329
What do you think?

853
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,360
Hello?

854
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,960
Okay.

855
00:38:32,809 --> 00:38:35,559
The test results show type B aortic dissection.

856
00:38:36,329 --> 00:38:37,329
There's a risk of rupture.

857
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:39,920
We need to get your husband to surgery right away.

858
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:42,440
D-2 polymer is 200 times higher than normal.

859
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:46,960
The doctor's judgment just now was right.

860
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:49,639
Come with me.

861
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:52,719
Dr. Xiao.

862
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:55,359
What's the result?

863
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,480
Type B aortic dissection.

864
00:38:56,519 --> 00:38:57,519
You were right.

865
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,439
I'm sorry, Dr. Xiao.

866
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,719
I was rude just now.

867
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:04,400
I'm really sorry.

868
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:05,559
It's okay.

869
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:07,518
We were able to find out the cause and treat the problem.

870
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:08,599
That's the best.

871
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,840
Thank you.

872
00:39:09,841 --> 00:39:11,960
We have to move the patient to Vascular Surgery.

873
00:39:13,289 --> 00:39:15,079
Take the patient to register for admission.

874
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:16,559
Okay. This way, please.

875
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:19,119
Thank you, doctor. I'm sorry for the trouble.

876
00:39:22,809 --> 00:39:24,078
How did you convince her?

877
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,479
There was an elderly couple last year.

878
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,559
They also refused to get tested.

879
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,880
That night, they were brought back here.

880
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:31,440
Xu Yi Ran took the case then.

881
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,440
It was a huge blow to him.

882
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:34,880
It's not his fault.

883
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:37,119
The patient is just stubborn sometimes.

884
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,480
There's no persuading them.

885
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:40,480
Yes, we can only try our best.

886
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:41,880
We'll persuade as many as we can.

887
00:39:45,289 --> 00:39:46,359
Dr. Xiao.

888
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,400
I want to commend you for what happened today.

889
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,119
Recently, the hospital is under scrutiny.

890
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:54,159
You didn't buckle from the pressure and doubt from others.

891
00:39:54,289 --> 00:39:55,719
Instead, you stuck to your judgment.

892
00:39:56,329 --> 00:39:57,329
You're a reliable comrade.

893
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,158
Before this,

894
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:03,960
I didn't know the meaning of "old-fashioned".

895
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:09,199
But I get it now that I've seen you.

896
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:13,329
Old...

897
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,039
It has been an hour.

898
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,199
Stop playing and go to bed.

899
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:19,239
Dad.

900
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,559
Is there someone called Xiao Yan in your department?

901
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,480
Were you looking at my phone?

902
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:26,678
No, Dad.

903
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:28,239
I didn't do anything.

904
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:30,558
Why would I peek at your phone?

905
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:31,559
Look.

906
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:36,639
Where did you get this video?

907
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,360
It's from the Internet.

908
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:41,519
She posted photos of Ms. Xiao Yan and Ms. Tang Hua.

909
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:44,480
She said they're immoral and insulted patients.

910
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:46,239
Someone doxxed them...

911
00:40:46,289 --> 00:40:48,329
and also uploaded this video.

912
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:52,519
They even called Ms. Xiao Yan the crazy doctor.

913
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Go to bed.

914
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,400
Go.

915
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:00,840
- Good night. - Good night.

916
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:18,840
Hello, Dr. Bai.

917
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:20,639
Hello, Dr. Xiao. This is Bai Zhu.

918
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:22,599
Did something come up at the department?

919
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,000
No.

920
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:25,518
You should go online...

921
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:28,079
and look at Hao Jia Jia's Weibo.

922
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:30,519
She talked about you and Tang Hua.

923
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:33,400
Someone else posted a video of you riding your bike.

924
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:35,960
Okay, thank you. I see.

925
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,559
No need to thank me.

926
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,199
I just can't stand those who distort the truth.

927
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:00,559
Dr. Xiao. You look so cool riding your bike.

928
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:03,038
It seems the whole Emergency Medicine Department knows about it.

929
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:04,079
It's not just the Emergency Medicine Department.

930
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:06,920
The whole Tongshan Hospital is full of admiration for you.

931
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,000
But there seems to be one person who doesn't like it.

932
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:12,360
There he comes.

933
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:14,639
Hello, sir.

934
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,000
You're here.

935
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,199
Let's have a meeting.

936
00:42:23,329 --> 00:42:24,329
Dr. Xiao.

937
00:42:26,289 --> 00:42:27,289
Tang Hua.

938
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:29,288
You've been exposed on the Internet.

939
00:42:29,289 --> 00:42:30,599
Aren't you worried about yourself?

940
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,159
What's wrong? I'm not afraid of being famous.

941
00:42:33,289 --> 00:42:34,840
That's a good attitude.

942
00:42:35,329 --> 00:42:37,079
I'm sure everyone has seen the video and Weibo.

943
00:42:37,329 --> 00:42:39,000
I would like...

944
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,159
to discuss a small issue.

945
00:42:41,329 --> 00:42:43,440
It's regarding our jobs...

946
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:45,159
and personal lives as doctors.

947
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:47,559
I don't think there's a problem.

948
00:42:48,769 --> 00:42:49,920
Life is life.

949
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,119
Work is work.

950
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:53,359
As long as our personal life doesn't affect anyone,

951
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,559
I don't think anyone has the right to criticize me.
