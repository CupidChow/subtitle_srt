00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,039
Dr. Bai.

5
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:56,199
Dr. Bai.

6
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,280
What happened?

7
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,399
It's nothing.

8
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,479
Dr. Bai.

9
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,240
How did you know the letter wouldn't work?

10
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,720
The couple made up.

11
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,080
To be a good doctor,

12
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,440
your eyes...

13
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,679
must not just see diseases.

14
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,360
It's the people too.

15
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,399
All this while.

16
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,039
didn't you see...

17
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,440
how that girl looked at that young man?

18
00:02:14,679 --> 00:02:16,800
Will she stop loving him...

19
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,039
just because of Klebsiella pneumoniae?

20
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:23,919
Isn't that what Dr. Xiao said?

21
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,399
No wonder Sun Zhi was talked out of it...

22
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,560
with Dr. Xiao's words.

23
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,840
Not bad, Bai Zhu.

24
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,160
You're getting more in tune with Xiao Yan.

25
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,160
Jealous?

26
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,039
Hello.

27
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:07,560
I bought a pair of shoes from your site this afternoon.

28
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,639
Why haven't you shipped them yet?

29
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,560
It's written clearly in here.

30
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,000
It would be delivered...

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,199
in two hours after I place the order.

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,039
It's been almost 10 hours now.

33
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,359
If you don't ship them now, I'll file a complaint...

34
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,479
to the State Administration for Industry and Commerce.

35
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,880
Okay.

36
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:26,079
I'll be waiting.

37
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,720
No integrity.

38
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,799
- Hang in there. - Save our child.

39
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,319
- Hang in there. - Be careful.

40
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,519
- It's all right. - Hang in there.

41
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,680
We're almost there.

42
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,479
Be careful.

43
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:50,440
- Be careful. - We're turning.

44
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,600
The patient is 28 years old.

45
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,680
She's 32 weeks pregnant.

46
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,079
She felt a stomachache after a meal.

47
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,120
Look at her.

48
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,239
What's wrong with her?

49
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,000
Don't let anything happen to her and her baby.

50
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,600
Where does it hurt?

51
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,519
- It hurts here. - Here. Are you sure?

52
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:05,199
I suspect acute appendicitis.

53
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,519
I need to do a routine blood test and B-scan to confirm.

54
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,519
You can't do that.

55
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,199
We need to do a B-scan to diagnose her.

56
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,560
There's radiation in the B-scan.

57
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,519
It'll affect the mother and son.

58
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,680
Yes, you can't do it.

59
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,359
There's no radiation in the ultrasound.

60
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:17,639
Who are you trying to fool?

61
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,120
Having an ultrasound...

62
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,519
is gliding and shining light to the stomach.

63
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,199
How can there be no radiation?

64
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,199
Mom.

65
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,600
There's really no radiation in the ultrasound.

66
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:26,280
Don't you know that too?

67
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,720
Tell her.

68
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,519
That's right, Dad.

69
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,880
Mom, the doctor is right.

70
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,199
There's no radiation in the ultrasound.

71
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:33,440
- Really? - Yes.

72
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,479
Really.

73
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,560
They're all foreign names.

74
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,770
We're just ordinary people.

75
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:39,359
How would we know?

76
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:40,960
All right. Don't worry now.

77
00:04:40,999 --> 00:04:42,840
Please wait outside.

78
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,479
- Step outside. Come. - Okay.

79
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,799
Family members, please wait outside.

80
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:48,919
Prepare for an ultrasound.

81
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,479
Where are you taking her?

82
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,330
The patient has acute appendicitis.

83
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:56,439
She needs surgery.

84
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,799
No. No surgery.

85
00:04:57,799 --> 00:04:59,400
Ma'am, listen to me first.

86
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,840
Her appendix is very obviously swollen.

87
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,160
It's highly congested.

88
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:04,679
Peripheral oozing is also evident.

89
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:06,330
Perforation can occur...

90
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,400
if surgery is not done as soon as possible.

91
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:08,600
Once it perforates,

92
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,600
a large amount of bacteria will be absorbed...

93
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:11,960
by the peritoneum and the mesentery.

94
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,919
It will enter the blood circulation and cause sepsis.

95
00:05:13,999 --> 00:05:16,400
There could be intestinal necrosis and intestinal obstruction.

96
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,879
It's life-threatening.

97
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:18,960
That's why surgery is necessary.

98
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,239
Who are you trying to scare?

99
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,520
When I was young, I also had acute appendicitis.

100
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:25,039
I only took medicine. Aren't I still alive and well?

101
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,999
Surgery has its risks.

102
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,280
What if something goes wrong?

103
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,080
What will happen to the mother and child?

104
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,919
- What if she miscarries? I... - Hold on.

105
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,479
I won't live anymore!

106
00:05:33,679 --> 00:05:35,080
- Calm down. - I won't live anymore!

107
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:36,879
- Mom. - It's different for everyone.

108
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:38,559
Stop it, all of you.

109
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,119
Her condition is very dangerous.

110
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:42,600
Have you thought about the consequences...

111
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,799
if something happens...

112
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,039
with this delay?

113
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:46,720
Hey, little doctor. How can you say that?

114
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,119
You old lady. Why are you so unreasonable?

115
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,840
Do you know that a person's life is at stake?

116
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,919
- I'll hit you! - No!

117
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,080
Mom!

118
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,280
What's going on?

119
00:05:54,359 --> 00:05:56,160
- Don't. - Calm down.

120
00:05:56,559 --> 00:05:57,559
What's going on?

121
00:05:57,679 --> 00:05:59,280
Who are you?

122
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,799
I'm Lu Ping An, the head of the EICU.

123
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:02,600
Please tell me what's going on.

124
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,400
- Don't fight. Fighting is illegal. - Dr. Lu.

125
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,600
She won't let the patient get surgery.

126
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
Okay, I got it.

127
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,840
There's still a lot to do in the EICU.

128
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:09,720
Get busy. I'll handle things here.

129
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:10,879
- Dr. Lu... - Go on.

130
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:12,119
- Go on. Dr. Lu is here. - Serves you right.

131
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,320
Ma'am.

132
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:15,479
Don't say anything.

133
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,640
Change the treatment plan as soon as possible.

134
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:19,439
- Xiao Jing, what happened? - Hurry.

135
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:20,840
- Take my girl inside. - Yi Ran.

136
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,439
- Don't get physical. - This is a hospital.

137
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:23,600
What happened?

138
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:26,439
Dr. Xiao, what's wrong with her?

139
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,359
She's pregnant...

140
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:29,840
and has acute suppurative appendicitis.

141
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:31,640
Is it confirmed?

142
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,840
What are you waiting for? Let's do the surgery.

143
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:34,879
Who are you?

144
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:35,879
Mom.

145
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,520
He used to be my neighbor.

146
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
Neighbor?

147
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,400
You're just a neighbor. What are you doing here?

148
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,679
Ma'am, how about this?

149
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:43,999
Let Xiao Jing undergo surgery first.

150
00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:45,799
Let's talk after the surgery, okay?

151
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,119
The problem is her family won't allow her to undergo surgery.

152
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:49,200
They're worried about the risk.

153
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,239
Don't worry.

154
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:51,799
Medical care these days is not the same as before.

155
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,720
We've operated on many pregnant women before.

156
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,039
I'm sure the mother and child will be safe.

157
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,999
Regardless of how good the medical care is,

158
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,760
opening her up is not a trivial matter.

159
00:06:59,799 --> 00:07:01,200
It's not like that. Please calm down.

160
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,239
Don't say anything.

161
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:04,559
Anyway, I won't agree to this surgery.

162
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,400
Think of another solution.

163
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,280
If anything happens to them,

164
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,720
I'll come for this hospital!

165
00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:11,879
You're right.

166
00:07:13,119 --> 00:07:14,439
There is another way.

167
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:17,520
If that's the case, let's cancel the surgery.

168
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:19,879
Dr. Xu.

169
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:21,280
Ms. Jiang, take Xiao Jing back first.

170
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,200
Finally, someone who knows how to treat patients.

171
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,520
Yi Ran.

172
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,840
Dr. Lu.

173
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:39,280
We have to consider what the family thinks.

174
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:43,520
Sir, ma'am.

175
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:45,679
Acute appendicitis...

176
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,080
is quite serious.

177
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,520
How about this?

178
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,840
Step outside...

179
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,999
to discuss with Dr. Xiao and Dr. Lu.

180
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,479
See what we can do.

181
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,520
Discuss outside.

182
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,400
There's no ventilation with so many of us here.

183
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:57,799
It's not good for Xiao Jing and the baby.

184
00:07:58,239 --> 00:08:00,280
Discuss at somewhere more spacious.

185
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:01,760
Her husband and I are here.

186
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,799
There will be no problem.

187
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:06,039
Yes, let's go out...

188
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:07,640
and find a place to talk.

189
00:08:08,999 --> 00:08:09,999
Watch her.

190
00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:11,039
Don't worry, Mom.

191
00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:12,679
Let's see what they have to say.

192
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:13,760
This way.

193
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,439
Your mom's old.

194
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,320
Her mindset may be a little old-fashioned.

195
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,999
My parents only said that for their sake.

196
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,039
Do you love Xiao Jing?

197
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,080
Of course.

198
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,479
Acute suppurative appendicitis is very dangerous.

199
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,919
Can you really bear to see her in danger?

200
00:08:42,359 --> 00:08:44,520
Please think about it.

201
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:45,879
Doctor.

202
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:48,200
Don't waste your breath on me.

203
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,640
You keep saying the same thing.

204
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,879
Anyway, I'm telling you...

205
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:53,999
I won't agree to the surgery.

206
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,239
Where is she?

207
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,930
Where's my daughter-in-law?

208
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,759
Where did she go?

209
00:09:17,479 --> 00:09:18,519
Dr. Lu.

210
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,930
Is the patient's family making a scene outside?

211
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:23,440
That old lady is a real piece of work.

212
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,840
I know.

213
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,050
I shouldn't have made the decision on my own...

214
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,479
and kept it from you.

215
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:31,050
I caused trouble for the department.

216
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,200
Let me complete this surgery.

217
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,519
I have no objection...

218
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:35,840
on how you will punish me.

219
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,080
What are you talking about?

220
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,560
I'll hold the old lady off.

221
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,080
Your priority...

222
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,759
is to complete the surgery.

223
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:46,050
If anything goes wrong,

224
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:47,239
I won't forgive you.

225
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,440
Don't worry.

226
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,200
I'll do a good job.

227
00:09:59,479 --> 00:10:00,810
Are they okay?

228
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,399
Doctor, is my wife okay?

229
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,519
The surgery went well.

230
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,239
Fortunately, we removed her appendix in time.

231
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,759
At the time of surgery, the appendix was visibly septic.

232
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,840
It could perforate at any time, worsen the infection,

233
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,930
and affect the baby.

234
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:13,359
Affect the baby? Then how is my grandson?

235
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,519
- Mom. - We just...

236
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,200
did intraoperative monitoring on the fetus.

237
00:10:19,359 --> 00:10:20,639
Everything is stable.

238
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,720
Don't worry.

239
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,560
What's wrong with this hospital?

240
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,560
Why are all the doctors so rude?

241
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:27,359
- My goodness. - The doctor has other things to do.

242
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:29,960
I'll go with you to wait for the patient in the EICU.

243
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,600
- Okay. - Thank you, Dr. Lu.

244
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,560
(Tongshan Hospital)

245
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,639
Why isn't she waking up?

246
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,080
Will it affect her body?

247
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:46,690
This won't do. I need to see the doctor.

248
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:47,930
Mom.

249
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,879
Didn't the doctor just say it?

250
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,879
Xiao Jing will wake up soon.

251
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,720
Mom, don't worry.

252
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:56,359
Let's wait a little longer.

253
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,239
How did Xiao Jing get involved with such a family?

254
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,320
You haven't seen each other for a long time, have you?

255
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:09,690
Five years and three months.

256
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,999
In the past, Xiao Jing and my family were neighbors.

257
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,359
She was the quietest and kindest girl there.

258
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,519
I always thought...

259
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,440
she would marry someone really great and outstanding.

260
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,999
But in the end,

261
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,479
she ended up with such a family.

262
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,600
Do you think it's fate's way of toying with us?

263
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:30,759
I'm sure she had her reasons.

264
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,320
Yes.

265
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:34,680
Everyone has their choice.

266
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,200
Everyone has their reasons.

267
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,359
Dr. Bai, delivery for you.

268
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,920
Thank you.

269
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,560
What did you buy?

270
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,920
Public display of affection.

271
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,519
Otherwise, how you could smell it from so far away?

272
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,440
There's no way you would display affection toward Xiao Yan.

273
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:00,359
How can you still be in the mood to make fun of me?

274
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,279
If I remember correctly,

275
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,200
that pregnant woman with acute appendicitis...

276
00:12:05,999 --> 00:12:07,080
was your first love.

277
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:08,999
She's already eight months pregnant.

278
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:12,840
Did you just go somewhere to cry?

279
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,479
Your eyes aren't swollen.

280
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,639
Go away.

281
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,879
Was I right?

282
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:19,840
Yes, it's really unforgettable.

283
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,560
I don't understand why she married into that family.

284
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:28,560
Her husband and her in-laws...

285
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,720
are a piece of work.

286
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:32,600
So you regret not proposing to her then?

287
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,920
Yes.

288
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,840
But what's the use of regretting it?

289
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:37,759
We can't go back in time.

290
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,359
So seize the moment.

291
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,239
You can do it.

292
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:18,519
Busy morning?

293
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,320
It's okay.

294
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:29,999
You scuffed your feet last time. Are you okay?

295
00:13:31,359 --> 00:13:33,080
I'm fine now that I've changed my shoes.

296
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,879
I accidentally...

297
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:56,399
mentioned that to Xiao Guang.

298
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:58,479
He cared so much...

299
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,359
that he bought you a pair of shoes online.

300
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:01,759
It's said to be light, airy,

301
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:02,879
and comfortable.

302
00:14:02,999 --> 00:14:04,600
He asked me to bring it to you.

303
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:08,159
Xiao Guang gave it to me?

304
00:14:10,359 --> 00:14:11,440
Maybe...

305
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,239
I gave him too much allowance.

306
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,440
He already bought it. Try it on.

307
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:19,800
- This... - It's fine. Try it on.

308
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:21,159
See if it fits.

309
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:23,800
Here.

310
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,800
Bai Zhu.

311
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,560
Did Xiao Guang send warmth to Dr. Xiao again?

312
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:36,600
Xiao Guang bought it with his pocket money.

313
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:38,279
I'll let you get back to work.

314
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,479
Xiao Guang knows how to pick a good brand.

315
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,759
This is a classic.

316
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,720
For real?

317
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,600
You don't believe me?

318
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,359
Look.

319
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,519
This is cheaper than shopping malls.

320
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,999
Xiao Guang is really reliable.

321
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,759
Are you an idiot?

322
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:07,279
How would Xiaoguang know Dr. Xiao's shoe size?

323
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,440
Did you forget about the neck pillow last time?

324
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,960
Dr. Bai gave it to her under Xiao Guang's name again?

325
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,879
He must be trying to please Dr. Xiao.

326
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,479
Stop gossiping.

327
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,159
Don't you remember getting scolded last time?

328
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:28,320
We're not gossiping this time.

329
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,359
Bai Zhu's motive is so obvious.

330
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,320
He might look haughty and cold on the outside...

331
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,720
but he's a warm-hearted man on the inside.

332
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,879
- Look at what he gave... - Dr. Xiao.

333
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:39,600
- Where are you going? - Making rounds.

334
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,239
What about the shoes?

335
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,440
Put them back.

336
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,320
Dr. Xiao didn't say she wants them.

337
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,080
You're just prejudiced against Dr. Bai.

338
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,159
He's just using the sugar-coating tactic.

339
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,879
Don't fall for it.

340
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:55,159
These shoes are really nice.

341
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,879
I heard you gave shoes to Xiao Yan.

342
00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:01,960
Tang Hua and Lin Zhi caught you red-handed.

343
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,720
What do you mean by red-handed?

344
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,999
You were being so secretive.

345
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:09,639
I thought what you were giving her.

346
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:11,159
It was just a pair of shoes.

347
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,279
Are you having brain cramps?

348
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,080
Don't you know what it means to gift shoes?

349
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,119
What's wrong with gifting shoes?

350
00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:17,320
What do you mean?

351
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,960
Giving shoes to a woman...

352
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,560
means you want her to leave you.

353
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,200
The woman will run away after putting on the shoes.

354
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,639
In that case,

355
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:28,879
you gifted your first love a pair of shoes too?

356
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:30,399
Attacking others is a sign of guilt.

357
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,440
Are you regretting it?

358
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,879
I never regret anything.

359
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,119
Dr. Bai, sit here.

360
00:16:40,119 --> 00:16:41,200
Dr. Xiao is here.

361
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:44,279
Sorry, Dr. Xiao.

362
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,279
It just slipped out.

363
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:47,320
You talk too much.

364
00:16:49,359 --> 00:16:50,840
Bai Zhu is Bai Zhu.

365
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,879
Being in love can cause a sensation in the whole hospital...

366
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,200
and even be the center of attention while eating in the cafeteria.

367
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,239
Shut up.

368
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:56,600
Don't be shy. Just go.

369
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,840
Are you going to eat or not?

370
00:16:57,879 --> 00:16:58,999
Go ahead and eat.

371
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,600
Lest the world be chaotic.

372
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,680
What do you know?

373
00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:06,840
I'm doing this for Dr. Bai and Dr. Xiao.

374
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,920
Eat.

375
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:09,840
Food can't even stop you from talking.

376
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,999
We were just joking. Let's eat.

377
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:24,279
Eat up.

378
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,840
Dr. Xiao.

379
00:17:31,879 --> 00:17:33,679
Please take a look at this and sign here.

380
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,359
Is something troubling you?

381
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,560
Is it because...

382
00:18:03,719 --> 00:18:05,639
everyone made fun of you and Bai Zhu?

383
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,080
We don't mean any harm.

384
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,520
I understand.

385
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:13,959
Look at you.

386
00:18:14,879 --> 00:18:15,959
You're pretty...

387
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:18,040
and capable.

388
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,359
As for Bai Zhu, you'll find out after a while...

389
00:18:21,719 --> 00:18:23,679
that he's actually...

390
00:18:23,879 --> 00:18:26,770
also capable and kind.

391
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,250
Perhaps everyone thinks...

392
00:18:30,879 --> 00:18:32,399
it would be perfect...

393
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,600
if these two people were together.

394
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,080
If you missed out on it,

395
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,080
it'll be a shame.

396
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,040
Have you ever missed out on someone?

397
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:46,010
Kind of.

398
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,600
But it's too late now.

399
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,010
(Tongshan Hospital)

400
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,639
Temperature is 38.9 degrees Celsius.

401
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:03,119
He's been saying he has a slight fever.

402
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,770
I was too busy to bring him here,

403
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,399
so I gave him some medicine.

404
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,800
He's been telling me he was fine for the past two days.

405
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,080
I really thought he was fine.

406
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:12,919
I didn't expect his fever to be so high today.

407
00:19:17,439 --> 00:19:19,159
- Are you his guardian? - Yes.

408
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,560
I'm his brother.

409
00:19:20,719 --> 00:19:22,159
If I knew his fever was this high,

410
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,199
I would have brought him here two days ago.

411
00:19:24,879 --> 00:19:27,439
Give the patient a routine blood test and biochemistry.

412
00:19:27,439 --> 00:19:28,520
Okay.

413
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:29,959
I'm really okay.

414
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,119
You're not.

415
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,679
You should've told me earlier you have a high fever.

416
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:33,840
You would've been fine.

417
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,399
I would've brought you here earlier. Right?

418
00:19:35,399 --> 00:19:36,770
Do you have to do yourself like this?

419
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:41,490
Hello.

420
00:19:41,719 --> 00:19:44,040
Jun Jun is sick. I brought him to the hospital.

421
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,919
You eat first.

422
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:48,439
I'm hanging up. The doctor is examining Jun Jun.

423
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:49,520
Bye.

424
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:50,719
Brother.

425
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:52,010
Was that your wife?

426
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,560
You should go home.

427
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,919
What are you saying?

428
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:56,399
You're so sick.

429
00:19:56,399 --> 00:19:57,770
Can I leave you here alone and go back on my own?

430
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,359
Your wife will get mad.

431
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,520
Enough.

432
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,770
The doctor is examining you.

433
00:20:01,879 --> 00:20:02,919
Don't get angry.

434
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:07,439
Dr. Bai.

435
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:08,840
I have to talk to you.

436
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:10,119
Are you free now?

437
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,600
Yes.

438
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,879
Doctor!

439
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,770
Doctor, come and have a look.

440
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,770
- Wait for me. - Hurry, this way.

441
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,199
- Doctor. - What's going on?

442
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:22,250
He can't breathe.

443
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:24,280
Heart rate's rising fast. Blood oxygen, 88 percent.

444
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,080
Decreased breath sounds on the left.

445
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,399
- Ultrasound, please. - Okay.

446
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,959
- Push it in. - Come.

447
00:20:42,719 --> 00:20:44,359
- Come. - Jun Jun, come.

448
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,560
It's okay. I'm here.

449
00:21:00,399 --> 00:21:02,080
There's a lot of fluid in the left chest cavity.

450
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:03,359
Chest tube for draining.

451
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,399
I'll get it ready.

452
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,840
Chen Zhi, you'll do it.

453
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,919
Okay.

454
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,679
As you can see, there's a lot of fluid...

455
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:12,800
in the patient's left chest cavity.

456
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:13,919
That's most likely...

457
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,560
causing him to not breathe well.

458
00:21:15,719 --> 00:21:17,119
But as for what caused the fluid,

459
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:18,159
we don't know yet.

460
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,770
We need to do a thoracentesis...

461
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,199
to drain the fluid...

462
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,250
and then take it to be tested.

463
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,919
This way, we can treat him.

464
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,119
Come with me to sign the procedure.

465
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,320
Okay.

466
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,250
Don't be afraid, Jun Jun.

467
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,560
I'll be right back.

468
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,560
Take the pleural fluid for routine biochemistry and culture.

469
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,040
One more thing. Once the patient is stable,

470
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:45,439
close the drainage tube when the drainage reaches 800ml.

471
00:22:45,439 --> 00:22:46,439
Okay.

472
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,679
Dr. Xiao.

473
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,679
How's the patient who just arrived?

474
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:53,240
He's stable.

475
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,080
What did you want to tell me just now?

476
00:22:56,439 --> 00:22:57,520
Bai Zhu.

477
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:01,240
Why are you back?

478
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,520
Didn't you need to study for half a year?

479
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,639
I had good grades...

480
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,040
and finished my training early.

481
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,240
Besides, if I don't come back soon,

482
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,439
someone would have snatched you away.

483
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,320
What are you talking about?

484
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,719
Carry on with your work. I'll make my rounds.

485
00:23:13,719 --> 00:23:14,840
Dr. Xiao.

486
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,639
Dr. Xiao is busy. Don't disturb her.

487
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,320
I'm busy too.

488
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,399
Bai Zhu.

489
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,480
Did you really finish your training early?

490
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,719
Don't you have to go again?

491
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,199
Of course not.

492
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,840
I have to take good care of my Bai Zhu...

493
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,480
at Tongshan Hospital,

494
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,199
I don't want anyone to take advantage of him.

495
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:32,639
You're well-informed.

496
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Did you hear anything?

497
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,480
My Bai Zhu is so outstanding.

498
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,679
I have to keep my eyes and ears open.

499
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,280
Is something going on with Xiao Yan and Bai Zhu?

500
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,359
You want to know the truth?

501
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:47,919
Not afraid of being shocked?

502
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,359
Even if they're really together,

503
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,199
I won't give up...

504
00:23:52,399 --> 00:23:53,679
as long as they're not married.

505
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,399
I won't be shocked.

506
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,919
As long as you're prepared,

507
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,080
I'm relieved.

508
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,959
Tell me.

509
00:24:00,959 --> 00:24:02,320
What's between them?

510
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,719
I'll be honest with you.

511
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,359
Bai Zhu does like Xiao Yan.

512
00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:09,359
And not just a little bit.

513
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,879
I haven't seen him like this...

514
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,080
ever since he adopted Xiao Guang.

515
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:22,119
Can't take it anymore?

516
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,000
You're just getting started.

517
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:27,760
Well...

518
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,359
Well, Xiao Yan...

519
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:31,439
What does she feel about Bai Zhu?

520
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,760
Why did I hear that she doesn't feel anything for him?

521
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:35,600
This information isn't very accurate.

522
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,159
Based on my observation,

523
00:24:38,639 --> 00:24:39,679
Xiao Yan...

524
00:24:39,719 --> 00:24:41,639
has some feelings for Bai Zhu.

525
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,760
But she's been rejecting Bai Zhu.

526
00:24:46,439 --> 00:24:48,159
I don't understand why either.

527
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,439
Bai Zhu is so outstanding.

528
00:24:49,439 --> 00:24:51,040
She really thinks she's a goddess?

529
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,240
Lower your voice.

530
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:54,320
Is this your home?

531
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,280
Let me tell you. Your attitude...

532
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,480
isn't the attitude of a girlfriend.

533
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,639
It's the attitude of a mother.

534
00:24:58,639 --> 00:25:00,280
Don't worry about my attitude.

535
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:02,480
As long as Xiao Yan is indifferent toward Bai Zhu,

536
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,560
I'm relieved.

537
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,959
I'm 100 percent sure now you don't want to be his girlfriend.

538
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:07,240
You want to be his mom.

539
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:09,600
It doesn't matter if I'm his mom or girlfriend.

540
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,840
Anyway, Bai Zhu is mine alone.

541
00:25:15,439 --> 00:25:17,520
Your vitals are back to normal.

542
00:25:17,639 --> 00:25:19,800
Stay warm once you're discharged. Don't catch a cold.

543
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,679
If you have any problems, come back for a follow-up.

544
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:22,959
Okay. Thank you, Doctor.

545
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,520
Dr. Bai.

546
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,679
Jun Jun's lab results are out.

547
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,159
White blood cells, 13,000.

548
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:42,800
C-reactive protein, 85.

549
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:44,560
Significantly elevated protein...

550
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,399
and cell counts in routine pleural fluid.

551
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:49,159
It looks like an infection.

552
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:52,040
Doctor!

553
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,280
Save him! Doctor!

554
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,320
Doctor!

555
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,000
Hurry up. Here!

556
00:25:56,879 --> 00:25:58,080
Doctor!

557
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,000
He was fine just now but had a convulsion all of a sudden.

558
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,119
Jun Jun!

559
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,359
Jun Jun!

560
00:26:02,439 --> 00:26:04,040
The patient is unconscious with convulsions.

561
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,760
- A valium injection. - Okay.

562
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,639
Why did he suddenly convulse?

563
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,240
- Get a brain CT scan. - Okay.

564
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,199
Doctor, what's wrong with my brother?

565
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:16,600
We'll find out after the test.

566
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,639
Pay close attention...

567
00:26:17,639 --> 00:26:19,000
to the patient's blood before surgery.

568
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,600
I will.

569
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,840
Xiao Yan.

570
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,119
Zheng Ya Jie?

571
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,080
I need to talk to Xiao Yan.

572
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,199
Give us some privacy.

573
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:28,199
I'll check on the patient in bed three.

574
00:26:30,199 --> 00:26:31,760
If you have something to say, just say it.

575
00:26:31,879 --> 00:26:33,320
I know Bai Zhu likes you.

576
00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:35,119
What about you? Do you like him too?

577
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,480
Whether you like him or not,

578
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,840
I can be honest with you that I like him.

579
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:41,760
I'll have a fair competition with you.

580
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,879
Based on the CT scan,

581
00:26:50,879 --> 00:26:52,800
there's a mixed density shadow in Jun Jun's brain.

582
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,359
It looks like an abscess.

583
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,560
An abscess?

584
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,000
- A tumor? - No.

585
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:58,520
An abscess is not a tumor.

586
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,320
In other words, a brain abscess...

587
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,159
is an infection of the brain tissue.

588
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,080
It's not a tumor and definitely not cancer.

589
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:06,719
Doctor.

590
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,280
I don't understand all these jargons.

591
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,520
Is it serious or not?

592
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,840
Brain abscesses are usually caused by bacteria...

593
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,280
or fungal infections.

594
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,199
This abscess is not fully developed yet.

595
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,560
We recommend conservative treatment.

596
00:27:18,719 --> 00:27:20,600
We'll observe the patient and follow up.

597
00:27:20,879 --> 00:27:22,480
But if this abscess keeps changing...

598
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,639
or gets bigger...

599
00:27:23,639 --> 00:27:25,800
or becomes more mature,

600
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,399
it will compress the brain tissue...

601
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,840
and affect brain function.

602
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,639
Then we suggest to remove it by surgery.

603
00:27:30,639 --> 00:27:31,679
Of course,

604
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,679
this surgery is relatively simple.

605
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,679
So does Jun Jun need surgery?

606
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:36,760
Not yet.

607
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:38,280
But we need to find out...

608
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,840
what's really causing his illness.

609
00:27:39,879 --> 00:27:41,959
Else, he could be easily reinfected.

610
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,439
Has he been anywhere special lately...

611
00:27:44,439 --> 00:27:46,679
where he might come in contact with germs, fungi,

612
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:48,080
or parasites?

613
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,119
A special place?

614
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:52,040
Did he go swimming in a crowded place recently...

615
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:54,040
or eat undercooked meat?

616
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,560
Well...

617
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,199
I've been too busy these days.

618
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,840
I really don't know.

619
00:27:59,879 --> 00:28:01,840
You can ask your parents.

620
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,719
Give them a call.

621
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,359
My parents passed away.

622
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,879
Jun Jun lives with me and my wife now.

623
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,199
I'm sorry.

624
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,199
It's okay. I think...

625
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:13,119
we should ask Jun Jun.

626
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,639
I'm sure...

627
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,040
he knows himself.

628
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,560
I didn't go swimming.

629
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,760
Did you eat uncooked meat?

630
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,800
No.

631
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,399
I only eat my sister-in-law's cooking.

632
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:23,399
It's not uncooked.

633
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:27,119
Hello.

634
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,679
Didn't I say I'm not going home for dinner?

635
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,439
The doctor is still examining Jun Jun.

636
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,080
What are you saying?

637
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:34,600
How can I leave Jun Jun alone...

638
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,879
- and go back on my own? - Keep it down.

639
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,280
I'm sorry. Listen.

640
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,119
I'm with the doctor right now. I'll talk to you later.

641
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,679
Don't be mad at your wife.

642
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:43,719
Go home.

643
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,080
- Don't mind her. - Brother.

644
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,840
What's wrong? You...

645
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:48,359
Does your teeth hurt?

646
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,000
Here, open your mouth. Let me see.

647
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:51,480
Open wide.

648
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,560
Severe cavities in the left back of the mouth.

649
00:28:56,879 --> 00:28:58,919
Slight abrasion on the surface of the gums.

650
00:28:59,719 --> 00:29:00,760
In that case,

651
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,359
the bacteria could have entered the blood vessels...

652
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,199
and then the brain through the cavities...

653
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:05,480
and caused the brain abscess.

654
00:29:05,719 --> 00:29:07,000
That would explain it.

655
00:29:07,439 --> 00:29:09,159
We found Staphylococcus aureus...

656
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,840
in Jun Jun's pleural fluid culture.

657
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,959
It is very likely that Staphylococcus aureus...

658
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,520
entered the blood from the cavities.

659
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,560
Bacteria spread through the bloodstream...

660
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:18,159
to the lungs and brain...

661
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,280
and triggered the abscess.

662
00:29:19,439 --> 00:29:21,679
Doctor, will I recover?

663
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,280
Don't worry, you'll recover.

664
00:29:23,719 --> 00:29:26,199
- Don't worry. - We'll put you on antibiotics.

665
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,760
But it's likely that you'll need surgery...

666
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,359
to drain the abscess.

667
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:30,399
Okay.

668
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:31,600
Let's do it.

669
00:29:31,639 --> 00:29:33,119
Brother, I'm scared.

670
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:34,919
It's okay. Don't be scared.

671
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:36,040
I'll be with you.

672
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,080
Don't be scared.

673
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,240
- Why don't you answer it outside? - Okay.

674
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,520
What are you doing?

675
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,119
You keep calling me. I'm busy.

676
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,840
I'll talk to you later.

677
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,719
Your cavities are serious.

678
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:50,719
Have you been hurting for a long time?

679
00:29:50,719 --> 00:29:51,919
Actually, it doesn't hurt that much.

680
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:52,919
I can bear it.

681
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:54,119
It doesn't hurt?

682
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:56,320
Even adults would be in pain.

683
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,679
If I said it hurt,

684
00:29:57,719 --> 00:30:00,000
my brother will definitely bring me for a checkup.

685
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,560
My brother and sister-in-law always fight because of me.

686
00:30:02,879 --> 00:30:04,800
I don't want to trouble my brother anymore.

687
00:30:04,879 --> 00:30:06,520
Is your sister-in-law not good to you?

688
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,119
She is nice to me.

689
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,119
She does my laundry and cooks for me.

690
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:11,240
She even gives me pocket money.

691
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,600
She just has a bad temper.

692
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,800
My brother has a bad temper too.

693
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,520
My teacher said this is called...

694
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,919
needle against needle.

695
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,399
Can I tell you something?

696
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,520
But keep it a secret.

697
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,119
Okay, tell me.

698
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:28,919
Actually, I lied about something just now.

699
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,080
Last weekend,

700
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,800
I went swimming with my classmates at the pool near my school.

701
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,280
My brother was here just now.

702
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,359
I didn't dare to say it.

703
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:37,159
I'm afraid he'll blame his wife for not taking good care of me.

704
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:39,159
You're such a good kid.

705
00:30:39,199 --> 00:30:40,320
Listen.

706
00:30:40,639 --> 00:30:41,879
You most likely...

707
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:44,280
got infected at the swimming pool.

708
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:46,080
With your body,

709
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:47,560
it's easy to get infected.

710
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,439
Don't go to crowded places from now on.

711
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,280
I won't go there anymore.

712
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,199
Where won't you go next time?

713
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,560
He said he won't eat sweets anymore.

714
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,359
Yes. His teeth are ruined.

715
00:30:57,359 --> 00:30:59,000
You can't have sweets anymore. Got it?

716
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:02,159
Jun Jun, your sister-in-law said...

717
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,159
she made chicken soup for you.

718
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:04,399
She'll bring it over tonight.

719
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,119
Brother, thank her for me.

720
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,879
Thank her yourself when she comes.

721
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,719
- Dr. Chen. - Dr. Bai has instructed...

722
00:31:13,719 --> 00:31:15,879
to be sure to disinfect Jun Jun's clothes...

723
00:31:15,879 --> 00:31:17,159
after he is discharged.

724
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:18,159
Don't worry, Dr. Chen.

725
00:31:18,199 --> 00:31:19,520
Ms. Jiang said the same.

726
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,399
I hurried to buy laundry detergent...

727
00:31:21,439 --> 00:31:22,560
to use at home.

728
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,679
Remember. Before you wash the clothes,

729
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:25,919
soak them for 15 minutes.

730
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:27,359
Don't worry, I won't forget.

731
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,439
Dr. Xiao, Dr. Tang.

732
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,199
You're here.

733
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,480
Doctor, I'm here.

734
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:40,840
You seem to be recovering well.

735
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,119
When will you be discharged?

736
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:43,159
Yes.

737
00:31:43,199 --> 00:31:44,760
I've almost fully recovered.

738
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,520
I'll be discharged tomorrow afternoon.

739
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,879
I'm here to visit you before that.

740
00:31:48,879 --> 00:31:49,919
That's very kind of you.

741
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,560
What are you...

742
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:53,800
I think...

743
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,719
young doctors like you...

744
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,879
are always busy treating patients...

745
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:59,600
that you neglect...

746
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:00,840
your own health.

747
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,560
I told you about the prescriptions.

748
00:32:03,879 --> 00:32:05,959
You probably forgot.

749
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,159
I asked my wife...

750
00:32:10,199 --> 00:32:11,760
to bring those herbs I told you about.

751
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:12,919
Later,

752
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:14,600
I'll write down how to use them.

753
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,879
Dr. Tang,

754
00:32:15,879 --> 00:32:17,639
you've probably forgotten...

755
00:32:17,879 --> 00:32:20,159
the names of the herbs I mentioned.

756
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:24,399
Dr. Xiao, don't laugh.

757
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,119
Your body may look better than Dr. Tang's.

758
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,359
But you doctors...

759
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,199
are always on night shifts and stay up late.

760
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,560
This is an early overdraft of health.

761
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,959
It's bad for your liver.

762
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,399
You need some herbs to help cool it down.

763
00:32:38,439 --> 00:32:40,719
I brought the three herbs,

764
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,600
rhubarb, Coptis chinensis, and Scutellaria baicalensis.

765
00:32:42,719 --> 00:32:44,719
We appreciate your kindness.

766
00:32:44,719 --> 00:32:46,520
But we really can't accept them.

767
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,359
They don't cost much.

768
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:49,520
Just take them.

769
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,199
Even so, we can't.

770
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,919
It's our hospital policy.

771
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:54,919
You're asking us to break the rules.

772
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,760
Break the rules?

773
00:32:59,879 --> 00:33:01,080
How about this?

774
00:33:02,199 --> 00:33:04,119
We'll remember what you said today.

775
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,600
When Dr. Tang and I are free,

776
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,760
we'll go to your place for a checkup...

777
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,840
of our bodies.

778
00:33:10,199 --> 00:33:11,439
But at that time,

779
00:33:11,439 --> 00:33:13,560
you have to treat us like any other patient...

780
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,679
and charge us.

781
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:15,719
All right.

782
00:33:15,719 --> 00:33:17,199
If you're busy with work...

783
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:18,639
and don't have time to brew the herbs,

784
00:33:18,879 --> 00:33:20,919
I'll brew them for you beforehand.

785
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:22,639
You're so thoughtful.

786
00:33:22,879 --> 00:33:24,040
Don't just talk about us.

787
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,639
You just had a small surgery.

788
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:26,840
How's your recovery?

789
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,879
You need a good rest.

790
00:33:27,879 --> 00:33:29,600
Don't worry.

791
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,359
Dangshen, Chinese liquorice, and huangqi.

792
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:34,359
My wife already prepared them for me.

793
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:35,639
Good job.

794
00:33:37,439 --> 00:33:38,679
I'll let you get back to work.

795
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:40,240
I'm going back to my room.

796
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:42,480
Remember to look for me when you're free.

797
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,600
We will.

798
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,959
You can go back by yourself, right?

799
00:33:45,959 --> 00:33:47,240
Yes.

800
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,480
Get back to work.

801
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,600
He's in good health.

802
00:33:54,639 --> 00:33:55,919
Dr. Xiao.

803
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,600
You're not really going, are you?

804
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,919
Why not?

805
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,000
You studied Western medicine...

806
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,919
and just came back from working abroad.

807
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:06,359
You still believe in Chinese medicine?

808
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,399
You need to change your way of thinking.

809
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:10,040
Chinese medicine...

810
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,959
is a treasure that has been practiced...

811
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,199
by Chinese people for thousands of years.

812
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,600
It binds great wisdom of the Chinese people.

813
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,840
Besides, there's no conflict between Western and Chinese medicine.

814
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,520
Look at the old man.

815
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,000
He studied Chinese medicine...

816
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,879
yet he came to us for an operation.

817
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:26,439
When he gets back, he'll use his own way to take care of himself.

818
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:29,199
I get it now.

819
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:31,239
Just like Dr. Xiao and Dr. Bai.

820
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:33,839
One of you insists on people while the other, medical science.

821
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,279
But you don't have any conflict.

822
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,719
Dr. Xiao.

823
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,369
Have you had a conflict with Dr. Bai recently?

824
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:53,080
Do you have a lot of free time lately?

825
00:34:54,279 --> 00:34:55,319
Exactly.

826
00:34:55,319 --> 00:34:56,679
Don't talk nonsense.

827
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,960
But you've been avoiding him on purpose lately.

828
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,080
Let me make it straight.

829
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:03,480
I'm not avoiding Dr. Bai on purpose.

830
00:35:03,929 --> 00:35:05,199
Besides, the two of us...

831
00:35:05,319 --> 00:35:07,080
are just colleagues.

832
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:08,560
If anyone talks about us again,

833
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,889
tell them the same thing.

834
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,199
And you,

835
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:12,369
get back to work.

836
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,560
Is that clear?

837
00:35:16,799 --> 00:35:18,889
It's just a normal relationship between colleagues.

838
00:35:18,889 --> 00:35:19,929
I don't believe it.

839
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,600
Glad to be of service.

840
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,759
Where are we going?

841
00:36:12,929 --> 00:36:14,000
I'm going to Lin'ao Road.

842
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,279
Ma'am, can you drive faster?

843
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,960
Ma'am!

844
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:14,759
You can't be too reserved...

845
00:37:14,759 --> 00:37:16,440
with someone like Bai Zhu.

846
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,560
You have to make a fuss when you should.

847
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:19,799
People like you have too much time on your hands.

848
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,480
I should have Dr. Lu put you on more night shifts.

849
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:25,000
No, look at this pimple on my face.

850
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,929
It's getting worse.

851
00:37:27,799 --> 00:37:28,839
This pimple of yours...

852
00:37:29,319 --> 00:37:30,679
is a medal from God...

853
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:32,679
for being a career woman.

854
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:33,889
You should cherish it.

855
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:36,440
By the way, it's pretty quiet tonight.

856
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,560
We don't...

857
00:37:38,279 --> 00:37:40,520
Have you forgotten the taboo of night duty?

858
00:37:46,839 --> 00:37:47,960
The motorbike crashed.

859
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,960
Blood pressure, 90 over 50. Heart rate, 140.

860
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,000
Car accident. Patient was in the passenger seat.

861
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,929
Head trauma. Wound compression dressing.

862
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,319
- What do we have? - He crashed on the motorbike.

863
00:37:57,409 --> 00:37:59,119
Blood pressure, 90 over 50. Heart rate, 140.

864
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:06,600
- What's the patient's condition? - Car accident.

865
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,929
Patient was in the passenger seat. Head trauma.

866
00:38:07,929 --> 00:38:08,929
Wound compression dressing.

867
00:38:08,929 --> 00:38:10,199
Other vitals are stable.

868
00:38:11,279 --> 00:38:12,319
What happened?

869
00:38:12,889 --> 00:38:13,889
Call the police.

870
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,600
He's a pervert.

871
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,719
Resuscitate him first.

872
00:38:19,759 --> 00:38:20,759
What's the patient's condition?

873
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:22,759
Right forearm fracture. Blood pressure, 104 over 82.

874
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,199
Be careful.

875
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,319
Listen to me. One, two, three.

876
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:30,759
Breathing is normal on both sides.

877
00:38:31,279 --> 00:38:32,369
Did you call the police?

878
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,480
Don't let him get away.

879
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,759
The police have been notified.

880
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:38,639
We need your family's contact information.

881
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,600
I'm an orphan.

882
00:38:41,759 --> 00:38:42,799
What about friends?

883
00:38:42,799 --> 00:38:43,960
I don't have any friends.

884
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,560
I'll pay for the hospital bill myself.

885
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,239
Hang in there.

886
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,319
- Saline solution. - Hurry.

887
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,080
Gauze.

888
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,159
There's still pieces of glass on her head.

889
00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:04,000
Send her to the treatment room.

890
00:39:04,889 --> 00:39:06,000
Blood pressure is still dropping.

891
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:07,719
- Ultrasound. - Okay.

892
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,040
Hurry.

893
00:39:35,279 --> 00:39:36,520
There's fluid in the spleen.

894
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,440
There's a lot of fluid in the abdominal cavity.

895
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:46,719
Blood pressure is still low.

896
00:39:46,929 --> 00:39:48,040
Should we take a CT scan?

897
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,719
No. He's not stable enough.

898
00:39:49,799 --> 00:39:50,929
He needs surgery right away.

899
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,040
Contact Dr. Cao of Gastrointestinal Surgery.

900
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:54,960
Prepare the OR and send the patient right away.

901
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,080
Contact the blood bank for preparation.

902
00:39:56,199 --> 00:39:57,199
Okay.

903
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,560
You're saying...

904
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:02,040
he's been following you?

905
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,520
Are you sure?

906
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,080
I saw him clearly.

907
00:40:05,409 --> 00:40:07,799
He's been following me while I was in the taxi.

908
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,520
He must be the pervert...

909
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,369
who follows women and attacks them.

910
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:13,679
How did it go?

911
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:15,159
I went to check the CCTV footage of the nearby streets...

912
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:16,600
right before the accident.

913
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,080
There was a young man who tailed her.

914
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,199
After that, he rode a motorbike and followed the taxi.

915
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:22,440
Officer.

916
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,119
You must bring him to justice.

917
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:25,119
All right.

918
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:26,159
Don't worry.

919
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:28,679
We won't let any criminal get away.

920
00:40:31,279 --> 00:40:33,239
Please show us to the male patient.

921
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,759
Come with me.

922
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,040
- Get some rest. - Thank you.

923
00:40:39,889 --> 00:40:41,159
This is the patient...

924
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:43,560
who was riding the motorbike.

925
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,600
What is it?

926
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:46,319
We're from Tuanjie Road Police Station.

927
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:48,440
This patient is a suspect...

928
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,239
in several recent attacks on women.

929
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,440
When will he wake up?

930
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,080
We don't know that yet.

931
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,639
The patient's spleen has ruptured.

932
00:40:55,759 --> 00:40:56,839
The surgery was successful...

933
00:40:56,889 --> 00:40:57,889
but there was a lot of bleeding.

934
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,440
He went into hypovolemic shock.

935
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:03,929
Is that his phone?

936
00:41:05,319 --> 00:41:06,639
We found it in his clothes.

937
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:07,839
Let me see.

938
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,679
Isn't this the girl from earlier?

939
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:27,839
We'll do this.

940
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,159
Get someone to watch him.

941
00:41:29,369 --> 00:41:30,889
Let me know as soon as he wakes up.

942
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,000
Okay.

943
00:41:32,409 --> 00:41:33,480
We'll take his phone.

944
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,960
Miss.

945
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:48,319
I have to apologize to you.

946
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:51,520
If I didn't get us into an accident,

947
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,480
you wouldn't be suffering here.

948
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,040
But don't worry.

949
00:41:55,369 --> 00:41:56,889
Our company has insurance.

950
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,119
We'll compensate you for all your expenses here.

951
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,960
You didn't mean it.

952
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,639
Besides, you got hurt too.

953
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:06,759
That's right.

954
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,159
I don't know what happened.

955
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,759
I couldn't control my limbs all of a sudden.

956
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:13,369
Has this...

957
00:42:13,369 --> 00:42:14,719
ever happened to you?

958
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,719
No.

959
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,080
Giving shoes to a woman...

960
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,600
means you want her to leave you.

961
00:42:52,929 --> 00:42:55,440
The woman will run away after putting on the shoes.
