00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,159
Chen Zhi.

5
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,480
I'll give you a chance.

6
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,480
Be my fake boyfriend.

7
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,400
I'll do it.

8
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,200
Hello, Mom.

9
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,280
Actually, I already have a boyfriend.

10
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,640
- Father and Mother... - Remember what I said.

11
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,640
Yes.

12
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:08,719
Hold on.

13
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,680
Hold this for me.

14
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,370
Look.

15
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:17,810
I told you to keep them in mind,

16
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,599
not write them on this stupid note.

17
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,039
Do you think this is like cheating on an exam?

18
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,530
I'm afraid I'll forget.

19
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,879
If you dare to forget,

20
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:26,840
you'll end up just like this note.

21
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,240
Hurry up.

22
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,000
Mr. and Mr. Tang.

23
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,199
Father and Mother...

24
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,280
Stop talking.

25
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:37,919
My mom likes calm and reserved people.

26
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,240
You'd better keep calm later.

27
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,759
- Do you hear me? - Yes.

28
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,280
Calm and mature.

29
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,719
Calm and mature.

30
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,319
You're here?

31
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,120
Mom.

32
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,960
This is...

33
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,759
Come in. Why are you standing there?

34
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,800
Come in.

35
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:02,800
This is my boyfriend, Chen Zhi.

36
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,800
Hello, Mrs. Tang.

37
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,800
Go inside. What are you waiting for?

38
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,800
Come on.

39
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,840
What's going on?

40
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:14,919
Why is it him?

41
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,120
Mrs. Tang.

42
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,280
Before I came here,

43
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,759
Mrs. Tang, I heard you really like...

44
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,240
dried fruit snacks.

45
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:41,080
I especially bought these for you this time.

46
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:43,039
You even know the kind of snacks...

47
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,159
that I like to eat.

48
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,639
Chen Zhi.

49
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,000
Thank you.

50
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,680
Mrs. Tang.

51
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,479
When I went to Sweden last month,

52
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,280
I bought these health supplements.

53
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,599
It's good for the cardiovascular health...

54
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,759
of elderly people.

55
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,400
They're from Sweden?

56
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:01,840
Yes, Mom.

57
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,400
These health supplements...

58
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,680
are the best in Sweden.

59
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,240
And they're very expensive.

60
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:09,479
It doesn't matter if they're expensive or not.

61
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,080
I heard that Sweden's environment is nice.

62
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,840
It's green and pollution-free.

63
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,050
These have no side effects at all.

64
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,879
Thank you, Chen Zhi.

65
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,680
Thank you.

66
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,639
Mrs. Tang.

67
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:32,959
You should try them first.

68
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,560
If you like them,

69
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:35,920
I'll buy you more.

70
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,279
If you're tired of them,

71
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,480
I'll buy from somewhere else.

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Chen Zhi.

73
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:43,240
Do you go abroad a lot?

74
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,879
I go to Europe when I have some time off.

75
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,610
My family...

76
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,000
has some businesses there.

77
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,730
Business?

78
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,000
Do they own a restaurant?

79
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,120
I heard...

80
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,800
that restaurants owned by Chinese people abroad...

81
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,639
make a lot of money.

82
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:00,079
That's good.

83
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,120
Mom.

84
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:03,519
What kind of business is a restaurant?

85
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,240
Chen Zhi's family...

86
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,759
is in the international antique business.

87
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,079
An antique...

88
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,800
is worth a lot of restaurants.

89
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:12,439
It's...

90
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,800
It's just a small business.

91
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:14,959
Antiques?

92
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:16,959
It's even international?

93
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,730
That's not a small business.

94
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,519
It's a big business.

95
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,730
This kid is quite modest.

96
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,480
It's such a big business.

97
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That's not right.

98
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,639
Do you still remember?

99
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,079
Last time at the hospital,

100
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,600
didn't you tell me yourself...

101
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,800
that your parents are ordinary employees?

102
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,360
What's going on?

103
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:41,879
How do you explain that?

104
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,639
What are you doing?

105
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:50,879
Mrs. Tang.

106
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,079
I'm sorry.

107
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,079
Actually, my dad...

108
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,519
Mom.

109
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,319
Chen Zhi's family is well-to-do.

110
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,199
But he keeps a very low profile.

111
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,959
Usually, in the hospital,

112
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:05,759
he doesn't want people to treat him as a rich heir.

113
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:07,560
So he told everyone...

114
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,800
that his parents are just ordinary employees.

115
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,959
What are you doing? Look at you.

116
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:17,680
It's not a bad thing to be rich. Am I right?

117
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,040
- That's right. - You're too low-key.

118
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:22,879
Hua Er.

119
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,720
How serious is your relationship?

120
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,199
Are you considering marriage?

121
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,199
Mom.

122
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,439
We're still young.

123
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,600
We haven't told people yet.

124
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,519
What are you talking about?

125
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,399
If you hadn't pushed me so hard,

126
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,040
I would have been embarrassed to bring him home.

127
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,199
Nonsense.

128
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,680
You're both not young anymore.

129
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,279
You should think...

130
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,800
about getting married.

131
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
Chen Zhi.

132
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,319
What do you think?

133
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,240
Yes, Mrs. Tang.

134
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:55,079
Regarding our marriage,

135
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,519
we have a plan.

136
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:59,279
But right now,

137
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:01,720
we want to focus on work.

138
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,240
- We want to work and grow together. - That's right.

139
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,959
Father and Mother think so too.

140
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,879
Look at him.

141
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,600
He was brought up so well.

142
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,439
How nice.

143
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,319
He doesn't even call them Dad and Mom.

144
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,360
He calls them Father and Mother.

145
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,839
- Let me ask you then... - Mom.

146
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,319
- Now... - Mom.

147
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:24,079
Look at the time.

148
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,759
Shouldn't we already have dinner?

149
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,519
Right. I forgot the most important thing.

150
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:30,720
Aren't you here for dinner?

151
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,399
Chen Zhi, sit here first.

152
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,839
The dishes are ready.

153
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,879
I just need to heat them up.

154
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,519
Thank you, Mrs. Tang.

155
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,160
Have a seat.

156
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,519
We're family.

157
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,120
Don't be shy.

158
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,120
Come on.

159
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,399
Come and help me.

160
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,480
- I... - Help me.

161
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,360
Come in.

162
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,079
Have a seat.

163
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:57,199
Come on, help me.

164
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:00,480
Look at you.

165
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,639
This is such a big deal.

166
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:03,040
How dare you hide it from me?

167
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,079
I was afraid that after you found out,

168
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,480
you'd force us to get married.

169
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,519
Force you to get married?

170
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,199
Isn't that for your own good?

171
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,959
For my own good?

172
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,759
Look at the people you wanted me to meet.

173
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,199
If I were to marry someone like that, wouldn't you worry?

174
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,519
If I don't do something drastic,

175
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:21,560
would you bring Chen Zhi home?

176
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:25,639
Listen. Regarding marriage, you have to hurry.

177
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,800
Understand?

178
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,800
Did you hear me?

179
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,480
He's a man. He can wait.

180
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,160
You're a woman. You can't wait.

181
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:33,039
Why can't I wait?

182
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,799
You're discriminating against women.

183
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:35,919
Save it.

184
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,519
Don't put labels on me.

185
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,000
I am a woman.

186
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:41,759
As for marriage,

187
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:43,399
pay attention to it.

188
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,799
Okay?

189
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:46,799
Mom.

190
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,360
Regarding our relationship,

191
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:49,799
we have a plan.

192
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,000
You don't have to worry about us.

193
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:54,090
If I don't worry, who will?

194
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:55,759
Let me tell you.

195
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:56,840
Chen Zhi...

196
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,240
is quite nice.

197
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,399
You should keep an eye on him.

198
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:00,559
If you don't...

199
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:02,679
and some other girl steals him away,

200
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:04,039
you'll regret it so much.

201
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,120
Do you understand?

202
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,840
Mom, you're right.

203
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,279
I'll keep a good eye on him.

204
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,120
Chen Zhi.

205
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,039
Do you want to stay for a while?

206
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:16,639
It's really late now.

207
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,240
Mrs. Tang, I'll come back next time.

208
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,639
We haven't talked enough.

209
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:21,759
Mom.

210
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,559
We have to go to work tomorrow.

211
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:25,330
Yes, work is more important.

212
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:26,919
Don't delay your work.

213
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,210
Mrs. Tang.

214
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:30,279
If you don't mind,

215
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,639
I'll come visit you often...

216
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:32,840
and chat with you.

217
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,399
Sure. You have to come.

218
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I don't mind.

219
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,240
I like it.

220
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,159
I'll cook for you again next time.

221
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,159
Mrs. Tang.

222
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,210
To be honest,

223
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,279
my dad and mom...

224
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,759
Father and Mother are always not by my side.

225
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,480
It has been a long time...

226
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,879
since I've had such delicious food.

227
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,879
It tastes like home.

228
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:53,039
Your parents aren't with you.

229
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:54,450
I feel bad for you.

230
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,450
It's okay.

231
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,360
The next time you want home-cooked food, come to our house.

232
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,480
I'll cook for you.

233
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,399
- Okay, Mrs. Tang. - Chen Zhi.

234
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:02,240
If you don't leave now,

235
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,639
you'll miss the subway.

236
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,039
Let him leave.

237
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,480
Mrs. Tang, I'll get going then.

238
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:08,480
Okay, take care.

239
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:09,799
See him out.

240
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,159
- There's no need. - She must.

241
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,159
I must see you out.

242
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,159
Come on.

243
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,210
Did I do well today?

244
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:19,090
I think your mom is quite satisfied with me.

245
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,720
Do you know which way is north?

246
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,039
North?

247
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,450
I'm sorry.

248
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:31,159
I'm a bit lost indeed.

249
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,639
I'm glad you know that.

250
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,519
My mom is interested...

251
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:38,120
in the fake heir,

252
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,759
not the real you.

253
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:40,799
Do you understand?

254
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,600
Yes.

255
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,330
One more thing.

256
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,240
If my mom asks you to come over for dinner,

257
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:49,330
you can't say yes.

258
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:50,799
You can only say no.

259
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:52,039
Understand?

260
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:54,330
Yes.

261
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:58,399
All right.

262
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,559
Thank you for today.

263
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,559
Go home.

264
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:03,279
Aren't you going to walk with me a bit more?

265
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:04,799
What are you thinking about?

266
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,000
Go.

267
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:08,759
Tang Hua.

268
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:11,879
If I'm really an heir,

269
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,399
will you accept me?

270
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,840
You think too much.

271
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,519
No matter who you are,

272
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,080
I won't accept you.

273
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:20,000
What if I don't rely on anyone,

274
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,279
just on myself?

275
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:52,200
The patient was hit by a car.

276
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,200
She's unconscious.

277
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,519
Her blood pressure is 170 over 90.

278
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:55,639
Heart rate is 118.

279
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:57,480
- First aid room Bed Number 3. - Got it.

280
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,600
- Car accident. Get Dr. Xiao. - Okay.

281
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,399
Are you her family? Please wait here.

282
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,159
Wake up.

283
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:13,159
Wake up, ma'am.

284
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,279
What's your name?

285
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,320
Wake up.

286
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,279
Clear breathing sounds from both lungs. No pneumothorax.

287
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:31,559
Prepare for deep permanent needle of deep venipuncture.

288
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,399
Ringer's solution, 1,000cc dilation.

289
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,240
Based on the ultrasound,

290
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,480
there's no bleeding in her abdomen.

291
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:54,399
She continues to be unconscious.

292
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:55,919
There could be brain damage.

293
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:58,200
Arrange for chest and head CT.

294
00:12:58,279 --> 00:12:59,279
Okay.

295
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,080
Doctor.

296
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:06,399
How is she?

297
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:07,679
How much will her treatment cost?

298
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:08,679
We don't know yet.

299
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:10,360
We'll have to see the results of the tests.

300
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:11,879
Doctor.

301
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:13,120
I heard that conducting too many tests...

302
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,120
is not good for health.

303
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,840
- Can we conduct fewer tests? - Don't worry.

304
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,320
The tests we're giving her are all necessary.

305
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,320
She's still so young.

306
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,320
You don't want anything to happen to her...

307
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,120
because we didn't conduct enough tests, right?

308
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,279
Okay then.

309
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,799
Conduct the necessary tests.

310
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:27,000
- Okay. - Thank you.

311
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:32,279
How's the patient in Bed Number 2 today?

312
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,200
All his vitals are normal.

313
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,639
But his blood pressure is still a bit high.

314
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,960
I heard that Dr. Xiao...

315
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,360
just accepted a patient at noon.

316
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:44,399
I heard it was from a car accident.

317
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,600
She has been transferred to the EICU.

318
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,080
Is it that serious?

319
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,200
Dr. Xiao has so many patients lately.

320
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,360
Can she handle all of them?

321
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,039
It shouldn't be a problem.

322
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,559
How about this?

323
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,559
Go and take a look.

324
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:57,600
See if there's anything we can do to help.

325
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,360
Don't tell her that I sent you.

326
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,559
Don't tell her I sent you.

327
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:08,559
All right. Go.

328
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:22,919
The patient...

329
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:24,279
has several external injuries.

330
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,000
The more serious one...

331
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,519
is the head injury that caused an epidural hematoma.

332
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:29,960
She needs surgery as soon as possible.

333
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:31,039
Is that surgery...

334
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,840
easy or not?

335
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,360
Will there be any aftereffects or something?

336
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:36,399
If she undergoes surgery soon,

337
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,159
there wouldn't be any serious aftereffects.

338
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,200
That's good.

339
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:40,399
Dr. Chen.

340
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:41,879
What's the matter?

341
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,159
Dr. Xiao, I'm fine.

342
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,440
Let's operate on her quickly then.

343
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:49,360
We'll do it as soon as we can.

344
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,360
Thank you.

345
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,399
Tell me what you need.

346
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:56,159
Dr. Xiao.

347
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:57,440
I heard you have a patient...

348
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,639
with epidural hematoma.

349
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,720
I want to learn how to treat that from you.

350
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:02,480
I'm talking to the patient's family.

351
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,840
Dr. Tang is over there.

352
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:06,480
You can ask him if you have any questions.

353
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,000
I'll go to her first then.

354
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,960
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

355
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,080
Why are you here?

356
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,559
I want to learn more from Dr. Xiao.

357
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,120
I came in to see the situation first.

358
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,320
We're working right now.

359
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,240
If you're trying to approach me this way,

360
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,480
I can only tell you to please leave right now.

361
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:37,679
You've misunderstood.

362
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:39,639
I'm really here to learn and improve my medical skills.

363
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:43,240
Tell me about that patient's situation first.

364
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,200
You're learning from Dr. Xiao,

365
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,559
not me.

366
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,120
I'm not obligated to do that for you.

367
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,200
I...

368
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:51,240
We'll arrange for a neurosurgeon to perform the surgery...

369
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,320
as soon as possible.

370
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:53,559
Before that,

371
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,200
we need to run more tests.

372
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:57,759
So she needs to stay here for a few more days.

373
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,639
She still needs...

374
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,960
to stay here for a few more days?

375
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,679
Doctor.

376
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:05,960
I heard your ICU...

377
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,840
is very expensive.

378
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:09,320
Can you transfer her...

379
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:10,639
to a regular ward?

380
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,039
To be safe,

381
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,159
I think she should stay here.

382
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,039
Then...

383
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,600
Then how much will that cost?

384
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:20,840
The nurse will give you a bill later.

385
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,399
Dr. Xiao.

386
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:25,919
The patient is awake.

387
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,720
Come and take a look at her.

388
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,720
Where's my dad?

389
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:40,799
Where is he?

390
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,639
Let me take a look.

391
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,240
There's no one outside.

392
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,600
What kind of dad is he?

393
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,120
His daughter is awake,

394
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:52,440
but he's gone.

395
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,600
He must be attending to something important.

396
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,519
He must have gone to pay the bill.

397
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:00,879
Let me take this time to tell you about your condition.

398
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,170
You just made one cup?

399
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:14,759
You're a little selfish.

400
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,440
Are you handicapped? Can't you make it yourself?

401
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,039
Xiao Yan is not handicapped either.

402
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,440
Why did someone make coffee for her?

403
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,039
Let me put it this way.

404
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:24,279
The world is just not fair sometimes.

405
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:25,650
You can't accept it?

406
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,319
You prioritize women before friends.

407
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:31,960
Dr. Bai, I looked into it.

408
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,410
The patient has an epidural hematoma due to a car accident.

409
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:36,920
They also found out that she also has glioblastoma.

410
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,200
Dr. Xiao has already made arrangements.

411
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:39,920
They'll drill a hole in the skull to clear out the hematoma first,

412
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,119
then perform a craniotomy.

413
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,890
All right, get to work if there's nothing else.

414
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,799
I really like to see your facial expression...

415
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,890
where you want to exert yourself, but you can't.

416
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:54,839
You can't help Xiao Yan solve her problems...

417
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:56,240
and show your manliness.

418
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,519
You must be very disappointed.

419
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,890
I noticed that you...

420
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,119
have the potential of becoming a gossiper more and more.

421
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,839
Don't argue.

422
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:03,839
Keep it up.

423
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:04,839
That's good.

424
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:06,759
At this rate,

425
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:07,839
in a few years,

426
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:09,519
you'll be able to open a new department.

427
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,960
By then,

428
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,039
you'll be the elder, the authority.

429
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,650
- What department? - Gender Reassignment Department.

430
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:19,759
You're so disgusting.

431
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,039
You won't undergo surgery?

432
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:27,279
- You may look fine now, but... - Doctor.

433
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:29,680
You've already told me...

434
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:32,000
all the possible consequences just now.

435
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,599
What you're saying now is all hypothetical.

436
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,680
It might not happen.

437
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,200
I really can't undergo surgery.

438
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,170
Why?

439
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:44,200
If I undergo a craniotomy,

440
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:46,279
how long will it take for me to be discharged?

441
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,119
How long can I recover?

442
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:51,079
Do you have something important to do?

443
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:53,720
I'm a ballerina.

444
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
In a month,

445
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,079
I have a very important performance I can't miss.

446
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,319
I won't miss it no matter what.

447
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,240
What's more important, the performance or your life?

448
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:04,960
The performance is more important.

449
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,440
Look at you...

450
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,170
How about this?

451
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,119
Our hospital...

452
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,680
always respects the wishes of patients.

453
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:16,319
Since you don't want to do it,

454
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,650
we won't force you.

455
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:19,960
- Dr. Xiao. - But your treatment plan...

456
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,200
requires a family member's signature.

457
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,279
Please contact them.

458
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:24,519
Tell them to come as soon as possible.

459
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:30,799
Forget about ballet.

460
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,480
She may suffer from brain herniation...

461
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,960
by just lying in bed and not moving.

462
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,079
She needs surgery right away.

463
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:37,519
Indeed.

464
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:39,720
Then why didn't you let me talk earlier?

465
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,240
The patient is very determined.

466
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:43,599
She wouldn't listen to us.

467
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:46,319
Then should we just leave her alone and let her be?

468
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,170
That's why...

469
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,559
when her family gets here,

470
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:50,599
let's come up with another way.

471
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,359
As doctors,

472
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,720
we can only provide medical advice.

473
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:57,079
After all, her family knows her better.

474
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,480
Family?

475
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,480
Her dad?

476
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,680
She can't count on him.

477
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,240
When surgery was mentioned,

478
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,759
money was the first thing he thought of.

479
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,519
The patient refuses to operate,

480
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:07,000
so that saves him money.

481
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,359
Maybe he'll be happy.

482
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,359
Dr. Tang.

483
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:14,839
When did you imagine...

484
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,119
so many stories?

485
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:17,519
I...

486
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:20,440
But her dad seems to be in a tight spot indeed.

487
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,440
It's normal to care about money.

488
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,839
Now that you've mentioned it, I remember something.

489
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,519
The patient dressed well.

490
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,200
Her phone is the latest model too.

491
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:31,480
I don't think it's a matter of prioritizing a son over a daughter.

492
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,039
Then the daughter must be sucking...

493
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,079
her hardworking dad dry.

494
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:40,920
Dr. Tang, have a seat.

495
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,440
Share the story you just made up with everyone.

496
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:45,759
I'm just worried about the patient, okay?

497
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,920
Doctor.

498
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:56,039
Where have you been?

499
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,000
Your daughter is already awake.

500
00:20:58,279 --> 00:20:59,650
I didn't bring any money with me.

501
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,279
I went out to raise money.

502
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,410
This is...

503
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:04,410
Is 10,000 yuan enough?

504
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:06,359
Actually, if she doesn't undergo surgery,

505
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:07,839
you don't need that much money.

506
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:09,039
No surgery?

507
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,480
Wait.

508
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:12,720
Why won't we perform surgery now?

509
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,650
Didn't you say that her condition is very dangerous?

510
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,240
Glioblastoma is indeed very dangerous.

511
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,759
But the patient is worried about her performance a month from now.

512
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,920
So she's determined not to undergo surgery.

513
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:23,839
Then...

514
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:25,359
Why don't we...

515
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:26,839
Let's not operate first.

516
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:28,170
How can we not operate?

517
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:33,319
As her family, I hope you can persuade the patient.

518
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,410
That's right.

519
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:36,960
I know you want to save money.

520
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:39,599
But what's more important, money or your daughter's life?

521
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:41,119
- No, I... - Don't say that.

522
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,480
How about this?

523
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,359
Come with us to talk to her.

524
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:45,680
Come on.

525
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:46,960
Doctor.

526
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,039
Why don't you go talk to her?

527
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,119
I won't go anymore.

528
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:52,440
We're just doctors.

529
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,160
She won't listen to us.

530
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,880
You're her dad.

531
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:59,279
- If anything happens to her... - Nurse. Where's the EICU?

532
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:00,799
- I really can't go. I... - Who are you?

533
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,640
- She's still so young. - We're her family.

534
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,759
My daughter's name is Fang Jing Xuan.

535
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,160
She called us and said she was hit by a car.

536
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,240
Are you Fang Jing Xuan's family?

537
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,720
- Yes. I'm her dad. - That's right.

538
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Where is she?

539
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,039
Don't go.

540
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,039
He said that he's Fang Jing Xuan's dad.

541
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,039
Do you know each other?

542
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:15,240
I don't know him. Who is he?

543
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,640
You...

544
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,279
Are you all right?

545
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,480
He's stable for now.

546
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:27,200
Who exactly is this person?

547
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,920
Do you know him?

548
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,720
No.

549
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,039
But he was the one who brought you here.

550
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:38,640
He even brought 10,000 yuan...

551
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,759
and paid for your treatment.

552
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:43,000
I really don't know him.

553
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,400
Then who is he?

554
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,880
I remember now.

555
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:49,480
He seems...

556
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:51,279
to be the driver who hit me.

557
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,680
No wonder.

558
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,640
He wasn't looking where he was going.

559
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,160
He hit Xuan Xuan this way.

560
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,680
Mr. Zheng.

561
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,440
Come to Tongshan Hospital now.

562
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,279
Yes, right now.

563
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,880
That driver is actually a good person.

564
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,440
He hit someone and didn't run away.

565
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,880
He even sent her to the hospital.

566
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,319
If the driver is irresponsible,

567
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:17,440
he'd be long gone.

568
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,519
This family seems powerful.

569
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,480
If they have a good lawyer,

570
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,839
this driver would be out of luck.

571
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,359
No matter how good the lawyer is,

572
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:26,839
he has to follow the law.

573
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:30,200
The driver hit someone, so he should be held accountable.

574
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:32,880
I believe the law won't wrongly accuse him.

575
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,039
This driver...

576
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,880
already had a hard time getting 10,000 yuan.

577
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,279
If the situation worsens,

578
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,359
I don't think he can even afford the lawyer's fee.

579
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,640
I remember that there's legal aid available in the country.

580
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,839
Don't worry about it.

581
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,119
Call the driver's family.

582
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,519
Okay.

583
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:55,920
Based on the X-ray,

584
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,200
I don't see any obvious fractures.

585
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,160
So I suggest you go home and rest.

586
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:00,640
If you still feel unwell later on,

587
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,680
come and see me again.

588
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,319
Thank you, Dr. Bai.

589
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,319
- Thank you, Dr. Bai. - Thank you.

590
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Come in.

591
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:22,599
What's the matter?

592
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:25,160
Dr. Bai, I have something to tell you.

593
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,160
Go ahead.

594
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,279
I heard from Lin Zhi...

595
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,319
that Dr. Xiao seems to be in trouble.

596
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,680
What kind of trouble?

597
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,599
Her glioblastoma patient...

598
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:35,759
doesn't want to undergo surgery.

599
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:36,799
Why not?

600
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,960
I think it's because of ballet.

601
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,599
Why are you telling me this?

602
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:47,640
- Didn't you tell me to... - Just do your job.

603
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:01,119
Dr. Xiao.

604
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,559
We've already talked to her.

605
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:05,759
She wouldn't agree.

606
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,440
The longer you delay it,

607
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:09,279
the greater risk of bleeding and expansion...

608
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,920
of the epidural hematoma.

609
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,279
And the patient even has glioblastoma now.

610
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,839
If she dances now, that's not dancing.

611
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:17,039
That's suicide.

612
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,720
An Ping.

613
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,359
Why don't we talk to Xuan Xuan again?

614
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,759
You know how Xuan Xuan is.

615
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,480
Dr. Xiao.

616
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,640
Xuan Xuan has always been opinionated since she was little.

617
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,279
Even her dad and I...

618
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:32,359
can't change her decisions.

619
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,880
Especially when it comes to dancing,

620
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,039
there's no way she'll listen to us.

621
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,160
Is there a special reason for the patient to be so adamant?

622
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:41,680
Can you tell me?

623
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:44,799
Actually,

624
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:47,880
Xuan Xuan has a wish.

625
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,119
She wants to perform at the Mariinsky Theater...

626
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:52,480
and dance "Swan Lake".

627
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:54,839
When Xuan Xuan was young,

628
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:56,599
her mom and I were busy with work.

629
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:58,359
She was raised by her grandma.

630
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:00,720
When my mom was young,

631
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:02,400
she studied in Russia.

632
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:05,839
She used to be a great ballerina.

633
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:07,599
She had a chance...

634
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,000
to perform at the big Mariinsky Theater...

635
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,240
to dance her beloved "Swan Lake".

636
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,960
But because of an accident later on,

637
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,000
she hurt her leg.

638
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,680
She couldn't dance anymore since then.

639
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:18,880
So she entrusted this wish...

640
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,799
to Xuan Xuan.

641
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,160
Maybe Xuan Xuan inherited her grandma's dancing genes.

642
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:25,720
Ever since she was little,

643
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,279
she has always been the best...

644
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,440
among her peers.

645
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:30,680
Unfortunately,

646
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,160
when Xuan Xuan was 10 years old,

647
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,240
her grandma passed away.

648
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:34,680
Ever since then,

649
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,400
she made a promise to herself.

650
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,640
She must perform at the Mariinsky Theater...

651
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:42,119
and fulfill her grandma's last wish.

652
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:44,960
Over a year ago,

653
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:48,039
the Mariinsky Theater sent an invitation to their troupe.

654
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:49,759
She was very happy.

655
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,200
In the past year,

656
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,160
she poured her heart and soul...

657
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,519
into practicing.

658
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:57,640
Think about it.

659
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,160
Because of this surgery,

660
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,359
she won't be able to perform this time.

661
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,920
You can imagine how huge...

662
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,519
this blow will be to her.

663
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:08,680
I get it now.

664
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:10,079
Dr. Xiao.

665
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,839
If she undergoes this craniotomy,

666
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:15,599
will she be able to dance again?

667
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,599
The patient's glioblastoma is in the functional area.

668
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:20,599
Even if it's small,

669
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,000
craniotomy will damage the brain tissues...

670
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,240
to a certain extent.

671
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:28,559
There's a very high possibility of postoperative dysfunction.

672
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,559
- So... - So...

673
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,920
there's a chance...

674
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,160
that she can never dance again?

675
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,160
I won't rule that possibility out.

676
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:42,279
Dr. Xiao.

677
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:44,759
Is there another way?

678
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,039
What I'm trying to say...

679
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,519
is that if Xuan Xuan can't dance anymore,

680
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,079
it'll be the end of her life.

681
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:54,200
There is a compromise now indeed.

682
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,400
We can drill a hole in the patient's skull...

683
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,480
to remove the hematoma...

684
00:27:57,799 --> 00:27:59,839
so that it doesn't press on the tumor.

685
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:02,279
And drilling a hole in the skull is considered minimally invasive.

686
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:03,720
Normally,

687
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,480
she can be discharged a week after the surgery.

688
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:06,799
Okay, let's do it.

689
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,960
But getting discharged doesn't mean...

690
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,160
that she's cured.

691
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,559
She needs to rest for at least three months.

692
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,119
And she needs to come back for checkups.

693
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:16,480
During that period,

694
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,039
it's not that she can't dance.

695
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,160
But as her attending physician,

696
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,440
I don't recommend it.

697
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:23,720
It's better to remove the tumor as soon as possible.

698
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
You mean...

699
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,440
we'll do that minimally invasive drilling surgery first.

700
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:28,720
After she comes back from the show,

701
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:30,200
we can do the craniotomy.

702
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:32,519
This surgery has some risks involved.

703
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,160
We'll need further consultations.

704
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,559
According to this new surgery plan,

705
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,720
will Xuan Xuan's tumor...

706
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,559
pose some dangers...

707
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:42,079
during her performance period?

708
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,720
That's a possibility.

709
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,519
And during that time,

710
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:49,799
the patient has to keep taking...

711
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:52,160
anti-seizure medicines and painkillers.

712
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:54,279
It'll be hard on her.

713
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,839
So as her family,

714
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,440
you should still advise her...

715
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,920
to get the surgery done as soon as possible.

716
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,240
Dr. Xiao, I think...

717
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,920
we should keep this from her for now.

718
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:10,319
Why?

719
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:11,680
You don't know her temper.

720
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:14,480
If she finds out that she can never dance again in the future,

721
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,160
she'll never agree to it.

722
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,000
But the patient is an adult.

723
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:19,960
And the surgery result...

724
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,240
will have a huge impact on her life.

725
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:24,160
You shouldn't keep it from her.

726
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:25,880
Don't worry. As long as the surgery is successful,

727
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:27,680
we're not going to give you any trouble.

728
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,599
It's not that.

729
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,400
We're not afraid of taking responsibility.

730
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,400
I just think that the patient has a right to know.

731
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,519
We shouldn't decide...

732
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,519
this matter for her.

733
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:43,079
All right, Dr. Xiao.

734
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,640
We'll listen to you.

735
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,640
An Ping.

736
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,440
But I think we're the ones who should inform her about this matter.

737
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:51,759
This way,

738
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,480
it might be easier for her to accept.

739
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,440
That's good too.

740
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,200
The hospital...

741
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,519
will provide a consent form as soon as possible.

742
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:03,160
You should talk to her soon and get her to sign it,

743
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,519
so we can schedule the surgery.

744
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,960
Xuan Xuan.

745
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,440
Your mom and I...

746
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:12,559
already discussed it with the doctor.

747
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,039
Your surgery...

748
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,200
isn't a major one.

749
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:17,480
And the recovery will be quick.

750
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:19,240
It won't delay your dancing.

751
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,960
Yes, it won't.

752
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:22,200
There won't be any aftereffects.

753
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,279
Dad, Mom.

754
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:25,680
You don't need to persuade me anymore.

755
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,960
This performance is very important to me.

756
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:32,160
As long as I can complete this performance,

757
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,000
I don't care if I die.

758
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:35,759
You're still young.

759
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:37,359
You'll have plenty of chances in the future.

760
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:38,359
Mom.

761
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,480
Say no more.

762
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,200
I won't change my mind.

763
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,279
Xuan Xuan.

764
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:50,839
We know...

765
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,599
that what you're doing...

766
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,319
is all for your grandma.

767
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,920
But has it ever occurred to you...

768
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,599
that if your grandma is here,

769
00:30:58,039 --> 00:30:59,240
what would she do?

770
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,240
She'll definitely let me undergo the surgery.

771
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,759
That's why.

772
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,079
We can't disappoint your grandma.

773
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:06,079
Right?

774
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:07,319
But Grandma is gone.

775
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:08,720
Even if your grandma isn't here anymore,

776
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,400
aren't your mom and I with you?

777
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,400
Even if you don't think of yourself,

778
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,160
at least think about me and your dad.

779
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,519
Your dad and I...

780
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:19,440
only have you.

781
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,039
If something happens to you,

782
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,880
how are we supposed to live?

783
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,920
Mom.

784
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,839
I'm just going to dance. Nothing will happen.

785
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:30,799
But you can't risk your life like this, Xuan Xuan.

786
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:34,240
Listen to me and your dad just this once.

787
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:35,799
That's enough.

788
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:37,119
Stop it.

789
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:38,599
Xuan Xuan.

790
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,279
I'm going to say one last thing.

791
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Look.

792
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:45,559
Your mom and I are already old.

793
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:49,240
You're our family's only hope.

794
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,359
Think about it carefully.

795
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,519
Let her get some rest.

796
00:31:56,839 --> 00:31:57,839
Come on.

797
00:31:58,759 --> 00:31:59,759
Xuan Xuan.

798
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:01,640
- That's enough. - Your dad and I...

799
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,240
Don't force her anymore. Let's go.

800
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:15,519
Mom.

801
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:16,799
Dad.

802
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:43,079
Doctor, you are...

803
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,400
I'm the attending physician of Emergency Medicine, Bai Zhu.

804
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:46,559
Dr. Bai.

805
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,160
Dr. Bai, what brings you here?

806
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,640
After the craniotomy,

807
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,039
you might not be able to dance again.

808
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,839
- There are risks involved. - Dr. Bai.

809
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,480
Can we talk about this outside?

810
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,079
Dad, let him finish.

811
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,799
Don't listen to him.

812
00:32:57,799 --> 00:32:58,920
He doesn't understand the situation.

813
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,039
He's not your attending physician.

814
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:01,200
- Dad. - The...

815
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,759
Drilling a hole in the skull to remove the hematoma...

816
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,400
and a craniotomy to remove the tumor.

817
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:13,960
It'll take a long time to recover from the surgery.

818
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:15,559
Going dancing after a month...

819
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:16,599
will be impossible.

820
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,640
Dr. Bai.

821
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,799
As a patient, you have the right to know.

822
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:22,440
That's why I'm telling you the truth.

823
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,880
But there's actually a win-win solution.

824
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,240
What is it?

825
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,720
We'll remove the hematoma first...

826
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,880
to reduce it from hemorrhaging...

827
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,440
and pressing on the glioblastoma.

828
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:34,160
Come back after your performance...

829
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:35,519
for the craniotomy to remove the tumor.

830
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:39,279
I will never undergo this surgery.

831
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,279
Dr. Bai.

832
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,480
Look.

833
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,960
If Xuan Xuan's treatment gets delayed,

834
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,839
can you take responsibility for that?

835
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:50,359
Why are you doing this to my daughter?

836
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,680
She's your daughter.

837
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,759
You know her better than I do.

838
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,640
If she finds out after the surgery...

839
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,880
that she had been lied to...

840
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:57,640
and she can't even dance again,

841
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,839
what will she do then?

842
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:00,079
This is a family matter.

843
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,400
It's none of your business.

844
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,720
Every patient has the right...

845
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,079
to know the consequences they must handle.

846
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Okay.

847
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,199
I can't get through to you.

848
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,679
I'm going to talk to your boss.

849
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:15,679
Is your hospital that reluctant to operate on my daughter?

850
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,880
Is this the medical ethics of your hospital?

851
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:20,329
Mr. Fang, please calm down.

852
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,639
Well, this is our fault.

853
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,920
We'll surely reflect on ourselves deeply...

854
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,920
and improve on educating staff...

855
00:34:26,289 --> 00:34:27,809
to better our medical ethics.

856
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,880
I'm warning you.

857
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,159
If anything happens to my daughter,

858
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,719
I won't let you get away with it.

859
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,159
Don't worry.

860
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:37,679
We'll make sure the patient gets the best medical treatment.

861
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,679
As for the issue regarding the surgery,

862
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,119
we'll do our best...

863
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,559
to come up with a win-win solution.

864
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,769
Give us some time.

865
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,480
- Dr. Xiao. - Do we have a patient?

866
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,440
Fang Jing Xuan's family is arguing with Mom Lu.

867
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,960
Dr. Lu.

868
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,880
You bowed unctuously just now.

869
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,960
You looked like a director.

870
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,329
Don't talk nonsense to me, Bai Zhu.

871
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,519
Can't you use your brain when doing things?

872
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,360
The patient refuses to undergo surgery now.

873
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:11,329
If the delay causes some problems,

874
00:35:11,329 --> 00:35:12,440
who will be responsible for this?

875
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,519
If the patient doesn't agree, we can think of another way.

876
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,079
As doctors,

877
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,289
we have to respect the patient's right to know her situation.

878
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:19,329
The right to know?

879
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:21,119
You also know that now?

880
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,840
When treating Yu Ming Ming before,

881
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,329
who strongly opposed the treatment?

882
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,920
How can that be the same?

883
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,960
Dr. Lu.

884
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,559
Regarding this matter,

885
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:32,289
I agree with Dr. Bai.

886
00:35:37,329 --> 00:35:39,329
Even if the patient has the right to know,

887
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:42,199
can't we use a smarter method?

888
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,719
Why do we have to get into a conflict with the family?

889
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:46,289
I told you.

890
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,769
The EICU treats emergency cases.

891
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,599
In emergency situations,

892
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,199
patients and their families are easily agitated.

893
00:35:53,329 --> 00:35:55,000
They can easily clash with us.

894
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:56,289
One look,

895
00:35:56,599 --> 00:35:57,920
one action, or one wrong word from you...

896
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,289
can be the start of a fight.

897
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:01,199
So in communicating with them,

898
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:03,039
you must pay attention to the method.

899
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:05,360
There are so many patients every day.

900
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,440
I'm so busy.

901
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:08,960
How can I have the time to pay attention to the method?

902
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,719
I don't want to be in a leadership position anyway.

903
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,400
I'm not afraid of getting complaints.

904
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,289
- You... - Mr. Lu.

905
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:16,679
Don't be mad first.

906
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:18,920
Regarding the patient's surgery, let's come up with a way.

907
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:20,480
We surely won't cause trouble for the department.

908
00:36:20,809 --> 00:36:21,809
I'll get back to work first.

909
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:35,039
Thank you.

910
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:37,639
I didn't expect this.

911
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,440
Dr. Bai, who always prioritizes the patient's treatment first,

912
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:41,960
has started to care about the patient's right to know.

913
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:45,360
Stop mocking me.

914
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:48,199
But in meeting Fang Jing Xuan this time,

915
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:50,480
I realized that I've really changed a lot.

916
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:51,809
How so?

917
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:55,159
I want to cure her right away.

918
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:57,289
I neglected the patient's own will.

919
00:36:57,639 --> 00:36:59,880
I naively thought that in telling her the truth,

920
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,119
she would trust us.

921
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,159
Now, after her parents made a fuss,

922
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,679
will she think...

923
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:07,440
that we're colluding with her parents?

924
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,239
- It's so hard to be a doctor. - It's so hard.

925
00:37:14,329 --> 00:37:15,559
It's really hard.

926
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:23,119
Bed Number 3 was extubated today.

927
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:24,599
We still need to encourage rolling.

928
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:25,840
It's best if you do that.

929
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,480
Let the interns watch you from the side.

930
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:28,719
Okay, Ms. Jiang.

931
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:29,719
Hello.

932
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:31,719
Are you a patient's family?

933
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,289
I got a call from your hospital.

934
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,599
You said my dad had a heart attack and is hospitalized.

935
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,119
Is your dad's name Zhang Cheng?

936
00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:38,079
Yes. How is my dad now?

937
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,599
He was unconscious when he was brought here.

938
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:40,840
But it's under control now.

939
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:43,159
- I'll bring you to him. - Okay.

940
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:45,119
Tell Dr. Xiao that Bed Number 9's family is here and ask her to come.

941
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:46,199
Okay.

942
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:53,239
Why isn't my dad awake yet?

943
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,289
Is there something wrong with him?

944
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:56,809
Your dad became agitated...

945
00:37:56,809 --> 00:37:58,159
and had an acute myocardial infarction.

946
00:37:58,519 --> 00:37:59,880
We were able to save him in time.

947
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
And his condition is quite stable now.

948
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:05,559
As for his specific condition,

949
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:07,599
the doctor will explain it to you in detail when she arrives.

950
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,719
After confirming the treatment plan later,

951
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,159
we also need your signature.

952
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,440
Okay.

953
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:14,559
Right.

954
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,159
Did my dad...

955
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:18,079
hit someone with his car?

956
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,440
It's a female patient.

957
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,960
Then...

958
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:24,840
Then is her condition serious?

959
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,360
Hello.

960
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:34,559
I'm Zhang Cheng's family.

961
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,159
Zhang Cheng?

962
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,400
The driver...

963
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:41,480
who bumped into your daughter.

964
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:44,079
What are you doing here?

965
00:38:44,809 --> 00:38:45,809
I...

966
00:38:45,809 --> 00:38:47,480
My dad isn't awake yet.

967
00:38:47,769 --> 00:38:49,880
I'm here to apologize on his behalf.

968
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,079
I'm sorry.

969
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:55,119
What's the use of apologizing?

970
00:38:55,809 --> 00:38:57,000
Your dad harmed my daughter.

971
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,809
She won't be able to perform as scheduled because of him.

972
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:01,809
She won't even undergo surgery now.

973
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:03,599
Ma'am.

974
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:06,360
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

975
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,920
My family will pay for all the medical expenses.

976
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,639
And compensation.

977
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:13,000
- And... - How can you compensate for it?

978
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,880
How are you going to compensate for my daughter's dream?

979
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,199
- I... - All right. That's enough.

980
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:21,719
Go home.

981
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,840
My lawyer will talk to you.

982
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:27,199
Go.

983
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,000
Compensation?

984
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:38,639
How can they compensate?

985
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:40,599
- Can money... - Dad.

986
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,119
That's enough.

987
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:44,119
I'm not having the surgery.

988
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,480
Look at you.

989
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,000
Why are you so stubborn?

990
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,920
Look.

991
00:39:58,679 --> 00:39:59,809
Are you the patient's family?

992
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:02,719
I'm your dad's attending physician. My name is Xiao Yan.

993
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:03,719
This is Dr. Tang.

994
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:05,960
Is my dad all right?

995
00:40:08,289 --> 00:40:09,329
Your dad...

996
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,719
suffered from acute myocardial infarction.

997
00:40:11,289 --> 00:40:12,769
His condition is stable for now.

998
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:15,599
But the test results show...

999
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:16,960
that the stenosis of the blood vessel...

1000
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:19,159
that caused the infarction is over 70 percent blocked.

1001
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,809
We need to perform intervention treatment as soon as possible.

1002
00:40:21,289 --> 00:40:23,199
Intervention treatment?

1003
00:40:23,769 --> 00:40:24,880
Your dad's blood vessel...

1004
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,159
is already starting to get blocked.

1005
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,440
After a while,

1006
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:29,599
it might cause cardiac arrest and death.

1007
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
In the intervention treatment,

1008
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:34,289
a balloon catheter...

1009
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:36,159
will be inserted into the narrow blood vessel wall...

1010
00:40:36,329 --> 00:40:38,119
through vascular penetration.

1011
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:40,119
By applying pressure to the balloon catheter...

1012
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:41,159
and making it expand,

1013
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:42,960
it will open up the narrow blood vessel wall.

1014
00:40:43,329 --> 00:40:44,329
The diseased blood vessels...

1015
00:40:44,329 --> 00:40:45,400
will then be unblocked.

1016
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:47,400
Okay, we'll do it.

1017
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:49,159
Please schedule the surgery as soon as possible.

1018
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,239
Here's the consent form.

1019
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,599
You need to sign it.

1020
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:54,239
Read it carefully.

1021
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:56,679
If you have any questions, you can come to us.

1022
00:40:57,159 --> 00:40:58,159
After signing it,

1023
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:00,599
we can arrange for a cardiologist to perform the surgery.

1024
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:02,039
Okay.

1025
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,480
I won't do the surgery.

1026
00:41:03,769 --> 00:41:05,360
Dad, you're awake.

1027
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,440
Yun Yun.

1028
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,960
I won't do the surgery.

1029
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:12,119
I'm your attending physician. My name is Xiao Yan.

1030
00:41:12,289 --> 00:41:13,840
You're in critical condition.

1031
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:15,719
You must cooperate with our treatment.

1032
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:18,000
Only an intervention treatment can save your life.

1033
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,480
Dr. Xiao.

1034
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,840
I have no money.

1035
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,599
I won't do the surgery.

1036
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:24,199
I won't have the stent installed.

1037
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,480
Dad.

1038
00:41:30,289 --> 00:41:31,769
My mom passed away when I was little.

1039
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:33,809
My dad didn't want me to suffer.

1040
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:35,840
That's why he didn't find me a stepmom.

1041
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:38,769
He relied...

1042
00:41:38,769 --> 00:41:40,119
on driving a taxi...

1043
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,960
to raise me all by himself.

1044
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:45,199
In order to make money,

1045
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:47,679
he drove the taxi day and night.

1046
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:50,199
That's why he had a heart attack.

1047
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,880
My college entrance exam results came out.

1048
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:55,599
I got into the University of Political Science and Law.

1049
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,360
He was so happy.

1050
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,809
He wanted to drive the taxi 24 hours a day if he could.

1051
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:05,289
Actually...

1052
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:07,880
Actually, I know.

1053
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,920
He just wanted to make more money.

1054
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,809
He wanted to pay my tuition.

1055
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:19,329
He didn't want me to use student loans.

1056
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:20,960
He didn't want me...

1057
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:23,159
to pay debts once I go to school.

1058
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,360
Yesterday,

1059
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:31,400
he drove the taxi all night again.

1060
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,559
He had chest pains during lunch.

1061
00:42:34,289 --> 00:42:35,840
That was why he bumped into that girl.

1062
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,519
I got it.

1063
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,960
He doesn't want to waste money.

1064
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,719
That's why he doesn't want the surgery.

1065
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:43,599
Right.

1066
00:42:44,289 --> 00:42:45,880
We have to compensate that girl.

1067
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:47,960
We have to pay for my tuition too.

1068
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,079
He has no choice.

1069
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:51,769
However,

1070
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,880
at a time like this,

1071
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,289
he can't give up his life.
