(Xiao Yan)

5
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,800
Okay, got it.

6
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,879
We'll keep it for now.

7
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:48,919
Okay. Bye.

8
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:49,960
Send him over.

9
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:52,360
- Ms. Jiang. - A patient is coming in.

10
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,400
Ms. Jiang.

11
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,000
What's the matter?

12
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,120
This medical record was on my desk.

13
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,439
Can you check whose it is?

14
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,960
A new patient.

15
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,240
Dr. Bai took him on.

16
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,800
- Dr. Bai? - Yes.

17
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:14,960
Dr. Bai.

18
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,120
This is your patient's medical record, right?

19
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:26,360
I wondered why I couldn't find it.

20
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,480
It's with you.

21
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,079
It was on my desk.

22
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:32,839
Dr. Xiao, this patient has a progressive decline...

23
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,050
in cognitive function.

24
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,759
His situation is complicated.

25
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,199
Right now,

26
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,519
I have a few difficult patients.

27
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,610
I can't handle them all.

28
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,319
You're more experienced in this field.

29
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,920
Why don't you take over?

30
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:45,319
Just think of it as doing me a favor.

31
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,610
I can assist you with the diagnosis.

32
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:48,800
But if I take over, I don't...

33
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,279
I'm really too busy.

34
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:53,079
I don't want to leave it to someone else.

35
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:54,730
We can't...

36
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:55,879
leave the patient be.

37
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:05,000
I'll get back to work then.

38
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,000
How does the poem go again?

39
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,839
"I am willing to look haggard because of you."

40
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:22,199
"My belt loosens, but I don't regret it."

41
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,959
It's the other way around.

42
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,199
It's the same.

43
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,879
I didn't think you were so childish before.

44
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,560
You think you can...

45
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,759
dump some cases on Xiao Yan every few days?

46
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,639
Do you think...

47
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,319
your trick to keep her here...

48
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:38,720
will work?

49
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,879
She said...

50
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,000
she wants to challenge herself...

51
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,040
to become stronger.

52
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,879
Nothing can train a doctor more than intractable diseases.

53
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,759
She has a strong sense of responsibility.

54
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,160
She won't just leave.

55
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,240
But your plan won't last long.

56
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,879
How are you going to get so many complicated diseases?

57
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,240
Dr. Bai.

58
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,199
This patient has Wernicke's encephalopathy.

59
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,000
I've printed out the detailed diagnosis basis.

60
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
They're all in there.

61
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,639
And my treatment plan.

62
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:12,879
That's fast.

63
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,639
Take a look first.

64
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,600
If you have any questions, we can discuss.

65
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,199
I...

66
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,439
I'm flying to Switzerland tomorrow.

67
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,319
I've already handed over the rest of my work.

68
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:34,839
Just this one.

69
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,879
If there are any updates...

70
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:39,720
on this patient's condition,

71
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,959
you can talk to me anytime.

72
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,240
I'm leaving.

73
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,519
Xiao Yan.

74
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,199
Since you're leaving,

75
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:52,720
why don't we find time to get together...

76
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,759
for a karaoke or something?

77
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,279
I don't want to trouble you.

78
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,720
We're all quite busy.

79
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,160
You should rest when you have time.

80
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,439
During this time,

81
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,959
I'm so lucky...

82
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,879
to have met you all.

83
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,240
Bye.

84
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,639
Xiao Yan.

85
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,560
You can't keep her.

86
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,439
I didn't expect...

87
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,920
that in just a few days,

88
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,800
Xiao Yan got in touch with Dr. Murphy in Germany...

89
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,360
and got so many cases.

90
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,480
You and Xiao Yan.

91
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,480
Bai Zhu and Xiao Yan.

92
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,160
A match made in heaven.

93
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,720
A combination of East and West.

94
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:56,560
Hello.

95
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,839
Dr. Jiang.

96
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:04,879
Dr. Jiang.

97
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,279
What happened?

98
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,439
Calm down.

99
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,759
He collapsed in his office.

100
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,079
When he was brought to the emergency room,

101
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:13,199
his heart stopped beating.

102
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,160
I performed CPR on him...

103
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,439
and a series of resuscitations.

104
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:19,279
His heartbeat and breathing are back.

105
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,600
But he's been in a coma the whole time.

106
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,959
The EKG shows ST-segment elevation...

107
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,279
in the inferior and anterior leads.

108
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,079
Our preliminary diagnosis...

109
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:33,000
is acute coronary syndrome.

110
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,360
Don't worry.

111
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,120
We've proceeded with coronary catheterization.

112
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,090
The director will be fine for now.

113
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,090
He's known about his illness for a long time.

114
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,519
Dr. Jiang is like a father to him.

115
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,600
He may look tough...

116
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,840
but he's actually very fragile.

117
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,090
New onset of left bundle branch block...

118
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,639
within 12 hours of symptom onset.

119
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:40,159
Immediate coronary intervention is needed.

120
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:42,840
Dr. Jiang is in cardiogenic shock.

121
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,279
The imaging shows three lesions.

122
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,919
Coronary intervention is not suitable.

123
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,279
I recommend heart surgery.

124
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:51,240
I just contacted his family.

125
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:53,450
They said Dr. Jiang has been taking medicine...

126
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,159
for angina pectoris.

127
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,000
For now,

128
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,840
I think the best treatment is coronary artery bypass graft.

129
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:03,279
His family is on their way.

130
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:04,759
When they arrive,

131
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:06,200
I'll have them sign the papers.

132
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:07,600
Call the OR.

133
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,799
How is he?

134
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:35,879
The surgery was a success.

135
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,720
Ms. Lan.

136
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:08,840
Have something to eat.

137
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,720
I'll keep an eye on Dr. Jiang.

138
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,039
I'm not hungry.

139
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,399
You haven't eaten all night. How can you not be hungry?

140
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:16,279
I'm really not hungry.

141
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,960
I haven't eaten all day either.

142
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,720
I bought some wontons.

143
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,159
Why don't we eat together?

144
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:26,840
If you fall sick,

145
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:28,440
how will you take care of Dr. Jiang?

146
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:33,320
Go on.

147
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,159
Don't worry.

148
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,440
Xiao Xu and I are here.

149
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
Go on.

150
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,559
Let's go.

151
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,039
If there's anything, call me.

152
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,320
Don't worry.

153
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,759
I've been in this hospital...

154
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,080
since my housemanship.

155
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,320
I've followed Dr. Jiang...

156
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,360
for over a decade now.

157
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,039
Time really flies.

158
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,120
The wonton place in front of the hospital is pretty good.

159
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,559
Eat it while it's hot.

160
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:27,080
So you like wontons.

161
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:29,679
One time, I was on the night shift.

162
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,440
It was so cold.

163
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:33,240
There were not many people outside.

164
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:37,039
But this stall was still lit.

165
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,799
The owner was sitting inside...

166
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,679
and greeted me with a big grin.

167
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,039
I was looking at the bowl...

168
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,919
of steaming hot wontons he worked hard to make.

169
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,399
It warmed my heart.

170
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,639
I felt happy when I ate it.

171
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:53,559
Thank you.

172
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,559
We all have moments of weakness...

173
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:58,000
when we need warmth.

174
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,519
At times like this, you have to tell yourself...

175
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:01,919
it's going to be okay.

176
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:06,879
Everything will be fine.

177
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,519
Eat it while it's hot.

178
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:24,080
Where's Ms. Lan?

179
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:27,360
She looked very upset.

180
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,480
I was afraid she would break down,

181
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:29,960
so I had her sent home.

182
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,480
You should go home and rest too.

183
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:32,679
I'll be here.

184
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:33,840
I'll be here too.

185
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,519
I'll fill in for you tomorrow morning.

186
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,440
Can I ask you a question?

187
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:05,080
I didn't get to ask before.

188
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,519
I thought I would hear it from you without me having to.

189
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:12,799
But until now, you haven't said anything.

190
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,720
I don't want to have any more regrets.

191
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,759
What do you want to ask me?

192
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,240
The man...

193
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,399
in the photo in your phone.

194
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,919
Is he your boyfriend?

195
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:35,519
He's my fiancé.

196
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,360
He...

197
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,519
Is he gone?

198
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:53,759
His name is Zhi Yuan.

199
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,840
We were university classmates in Switzerland.

200
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,759
He...

201
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,320
admired doctors...

202
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
who were as perfect as machines.

203
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:06,799
As for me,

204
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,360
I pay more attention...

205
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,799
to respecting patients' own wishes.

206
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,080
We have very different philosophies.

207
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:16,120
But we still got together.

208
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,320
And then,

209
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:20,120
we joined...

210
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:21,639
Doctors Without Borders together.

211
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,480
During a mission,

212
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,639
Zhi Yuan was badly injured.

213
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,559
But at that time,

214
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,000
I was in the middle of an operation.

215
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:36,480
Zhi Yuan wanted me...

216
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,360
to finish the surgery well,

217
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,200
so he didn't tell me about his injury.

218
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:44,440
My surgery went well...

219
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:47,120
and Zhi Yuan also missed the golden hour.

220
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:51,759
Just like that,

221
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,120
he died in front of me.

222
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:04,650
Shanghai was Zhi Yuan's hometown.

223
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,440
I came back...

224
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:11,200
to find the traces...

225
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:13,319
he once left behind.

226
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,240
I want to be part of the moments in his life...

227
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,799
when I wasn't there.

228
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,039
So...

229
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,890
I found Smoky Alley...

230
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,039
and lived there.

231
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,000
By doing this,

232
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,920
it's as if Zhi Yuan is still by my side.

233
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,890
But I never thought...

234
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,519
that you'd appear in my world.

235
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:48,319
You...

236
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,799
When I first met you, I thought you were very arrogant.

237
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:54,559
And you like to show off.

238
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,559
But after cases and cases,

239
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,279
I realized...

240
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,079
that you have your own persistence.

241
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:05,650
You don't want to give up any glimmer of hope.

242
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:07,759
You're a good doctor.

243
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:10,759
It's just...

244
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,170
that mouth of yours...

245
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:14,799
is quite mean sometimes.

246
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,799
In the past six months,

247
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:27,039
I've slowly walked out from the guilt...

248
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:28,799
of losing Zhi Yuan.

249
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:33,170
As well as some ideas that I once insisted on.

250
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,519
Right now,

251
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,240
my biggest philosophy...

252
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:40,119
is to immediately devote myself...

253
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,039
to healing and saving lives.

254
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,200
What about me?

255
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:08,799
Your appearance...

256
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:13,960
is an accident to me.

257
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:20,650
I admit...

258
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:23,559
that I have feelings for you.

259
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:35,559
But now, I'm not ready...

260
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:38,119
to start a new relationship.

261
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,039
I want to give myself more time...

262
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,480
to become stronger...

263
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:46,680
and more determined...

264
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:50,410
to reconsider...

265
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:51,839
my relationships.

266
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:57,480
I hope you can understand.

267
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:52,480
(Tongshan Hospital)

268
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:34,079
Bai Zhu.

269
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:35,680
The director's condition has stabilized.

270
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,680
He's out of danger now.

271
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,680
I have a flight to catch.

272
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,039
Take care of the director...

273
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:42,720
and take good care of yourself.

274
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,319
Say goodbye to everyone for me.

275
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,599
It's only been one night.

276
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:14,759
You look like as if you've been drugged.

277
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:18,359
Go home and take a shower.

278
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,839
Rest well.

279
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:21,880
I'll take care...

280
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:23,279
of Dr. Jiang.

281
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,200
Don't worry.

282
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,319
I'll stay until he wakes up.

283
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:33,599
Dr. Jiang.

284
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,920
You're awake.

285
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,000
Thank you.

286
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,559
You had a coronary artery bypass graft.

287
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,240
You're still weak.

288
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:43,599
You need more rest.

289
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:48,000
Actually, I knew I had this illness.

290
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,480
But I didn't tell you.

291
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,240
I kept it from you.

292
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,680
You don't blame me, do you?

293
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:09,160
I didn't know it would get this bad.

294
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,680
I was thinking of stepping down gradually...

295
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
and it would get better...

296
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:21,799
when life slows down.

297
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:24,200
Seriously, Dr. Jiang.

298
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,559
You've been a doctor all your life.

299
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,319
How can you be so unobjective when it comes to yourself?

300
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:32,519
You scared your wife.

301
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,359
We were worried she would fall ill,

302
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:38,079
so we sent her home.

303
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:40,440
I bet she'll scold you today.

304
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:42,599
She's easy to coax.

305
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:45,839
She'll be fine after.

306
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,640
I originally planned to go to the northwest with her...

307
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:55,319
after retirement.

308
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,920
That's where I spent...

309
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:05,400
my internship.

310
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,319
I've been thinking about that place a lot lately.

311
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:18,559
You made such a fuss...

312
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:19,759
about going back to cardiology.

313
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,039
Now you want to stay in the EICU.

314
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:29,559
It's because of Xiao Yan, isn't it?

315
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,440
She was a factor.

316
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,279
I know a little...

317
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:43,400
about Dr. Xiao's past.

318
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,799
It hard...

319
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,559
for people to take...

320
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:57,440
the first step.

321
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,400
You have to understand her too.

322
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:06,680
But both of you are great doctors.

323
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,039
I'm sure that after some time,

324
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:15,640
she can do it.

325
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,519
Even if she takes that step,

326
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,039
it's useless.

327
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,240
She's going back to Switzerland today.

328
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:25,279
Silly boy.

329
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,119
Technology and communication are so advanced nowadays.

330
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,319
You can reach her so easily.

331
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:38,000
If you can't bear to see her leave,

332
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:43,519
you can video call her every day.

333
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,279
I'm sure you can get her back.

334
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:51,839
When you save patients,

335
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:54,880
you won't give up even the slightest hope.

336
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,039
How can you not do the same...

337
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,480
when it comes to your own happiness?
