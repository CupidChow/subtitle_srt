4
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,119
Here, let me examine you.

5
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,319
Let me know if it hurts.

6
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,319
Doctor.

7
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,520
Is my condition not so good?

8
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:21,039
You just had surgery.

9
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,559
It will take some time for it to recover.

10
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,639
I wonder when Ding Xiao Ying can see things.

11
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,199
Don't worry.

12
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:34,039
My colleague will help her look for a cornea donor.

13
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:36,199
The police have also cleared you of suspicion.

14
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,319
I hope both of you can be discharged together.

15
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,840
Thank you.

16
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,079
Hui Zhen.

17
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,639
My dad woke up early this morning...

18
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,199
and made so much food.

19
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,319
It's all your favorite dishes.

20
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,799
But now that I'm discharged from the hospital,

21
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:58,319
your dad will rush us to have a baby again.

22
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:00,919
Hui Zhen.

23
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,000
You can't blame my dad.

24
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,319
Look.

25
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,440
We're almost 40 years old.

26
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,799
We don't even have a child.

27
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,120
It's normal for an old man like him to be worried.

28
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,440
- I'm not blaming him. I just... - Le Le!

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,079
Le Le!

30
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,359
Le Le, slow down!

31
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,319
- Are you okay? - I'm fine.

32
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,359
Okay.

33
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:24,680
Are you all right, Le Le?

34
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,319
- Are you all right? - I'm fine.

35
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,160
Let's go.

36
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,960
Hui Zhen.

37
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,160
Hui Zhen.

38
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,600
What...

39
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,880
Hui Zhen.

40
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:38,960
The taxi driver is back.

41
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:40,519
As soon as she walked out of the hospital,

42
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:42,519
she was hit by a child and fainted.

43
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:45,160
By a child?

44
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:47,400
Ne Zha.

45
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,239
We did an electrocardiogram...

46
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,600
and there's no arrhythmia,

47
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,639
so our previous diagnosis was wrong.

48
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,039
It wasn't because of smart drugs.

49
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,199
Now that I think about it,

50
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,079
it should be...

51
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,600
a cerebral embolism caused by a blood clot...

52
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,799
in the patient's blood.

53
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:10,680
We did an arteriovenous ultrasound on her,

54
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,840
but there was nothing abnormal.

55
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,799
So we don't know why there's a clot in her blood.

56
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,680
Could it be a lack of protein C?

57
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,880
It doesn't match symptoms of abnormal seizures.

58
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,799
I remember now.

59
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,639
I heard about it from the patient's family.

60
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:26,680
A few months ago,

61
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,880
the patient has taken clomiphene continuously.

62
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:30,400
To induce ovulation to get pregnant.

63
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,440
That's right.

64
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,079
Later, she felt uncomfortable and stopped.

65
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,319
Overdose of clomiphene...

66
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,720
does increase the risk of endometrial cancer.

67
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,720
Endometrial cancer can cause blood clots...

68
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,799
and that leads to a stroke.

69
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,840
I'll arrange a transvaginal ultrasound for her.

70
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,840
No thickening of the uterine lining.

71
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:53,280
I don't see any lumps either.

72
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:54,770
Does that mean she's fine?

73
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,650
Judging from the ultrasound, I don't see any signs of cancer.

74
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,080
I told you.

75
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,840
We can't be that unlucky.

76
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,239
Doctor.

77
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,879
What happened to me?

78
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:09,919
How about this?

79
00:05:09,999 --> 00:05:11,439
Let's consult the gynecologist later...

80
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,720
and let them do an endometrial biopsy.

81
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:15,439
No abnormalities were found in the ultrasound.

82
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,600
Was it really necessary?

83
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Is this your first day as a doctor?

84
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:18,999
Don't you know the sensitivity of ultrasound...

85
00:05:18,999 --> 00:05:19,999
to tiny cancerous tissues?

86
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:21,479
- What I mean is... - Doctor.

87
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,840
We'll do it.

88
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:25,479
It's for peace of mind.

89
00:05:25,799 --> 00:05:27,770
Scraping the lining of the uterus is very harmful to the body.

90
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,160
You must be mentally prepared.

91
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,720
Will it hurt a lot?

92
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,770
It won't hurt.

93
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:33,840
We'll use anesthesia.

94
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:34,999
You'll be fine.

95
00:05:35,239 --> 00:05:36,650
I'm here.

96
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,239
Doctor.

97
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,999
We'll do it.

98
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:47,919
Dr. Xiao.

99
00:05:48,359 --> 00:05:51,039
If my wife really has cancer,

100
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,799
how much longer can she live?

101
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,559
Don't worry.

102
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,039
There's a high chance of recovery...

103
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,400
in the early stage of endometrial cancer.

104
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:00,039
What's more, it's only suspicion.

105
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:01,640
We have to wait for the scraping results...

106
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,840
for more details.

107
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,160
Maybe that's not the case.

108
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,720
You're Ma Hui Zhen's guardian, right?

109
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,280
Yes, I'm her husband.

110
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,720
When I first diagnosed the patient, I didn't see anything abnormal.

111
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:18,559
But the ultrasound revealed that there was hypoechoic in the liver.

112
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,119
There's fluid leaking from the abdominal cavity.

113
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:21,879
What do you mean?

114
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,400
Right now, there's a shadow in the liver.

115
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,160
There's fluid leaking from the abdominal cavity.

116
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,760
We have to quickly figure out what this shadow is.

117
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:32,840
We will arrange an MRI of the abdomen for the patient.

118
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,080
I want to see her just once.

119
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:40,160
Just once.

120
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,039
You can't get out of bed yet.

121
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,039
Can't she see things at all?

122
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,359
She'll be able to see things when she finds the right cornea.

123
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,239
Is there anything you want to tell her?

124
00:06:58,359 --> 00:06:59,479
We can convey it to her.

125
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:04,479
Forget it.

126
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,679
I won't bother her.

127
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,840
All right. You should get some rest.

128
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,320
Let's leave him alone.

129
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,600
I don't know if I should be touched or sad.

130
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:30,119
He must be happy to sacrifice willingly...

131
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,080
for the person he likes.

132
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:37,919
Look.

133
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:40,679
So the previous plan was wrong.

134
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:42,999
The problem is not in the uterus.

135
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,080
All the root causes are in the liver.

136
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,479
But I can't tell right now if it's benign or malignant.

137
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,799
Schedule for a biopsy.

138
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,679
But a liver tumor won't cause abnormal seizures.

139
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,439
There must be another reason.

140
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:59,080
A normal liver tumor doesn't cause abnormal seizures,

141
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,439
but she was on smart drugs and clomiphene.

142
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,280
Maybe when these two drugs are mixed together,

143
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,919
it'll have some side effects that we don't know about.

144
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:06,559
Maybe.

145
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,879
Doctors can't use that to diagnose.

146
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:11,520
Should we just let it be then?

147
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,679
How can that be?

148
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,119
All necessary treatments and examinations have to be done.

149
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,559
What if the tumor gets worse?

150
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,520
That's right.

151
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,359
Both of you can just proceed with the standard procedure.

152
00:08:21,799 --> 00:08:23,799
Leave the difficult puzzle-solving work to me.

153
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:30,879
All right.

154
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:33,039
Let's see if you can solve it.

155
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,760
Just wait and see.

156
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,799
There's a tumor in her liver?

157
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,160
Is it benign or malignant?

158
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,239
We'll need to do more tests to find out.

159
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:45,160
A normal liver tumor doesn't cause abnormal seizures,

160
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:48,320
so Dr. Bai thinks that the patient may have other illnesses.

161
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:50,400
He did it to show off.

162
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:52,720
Dr. Bai is so capable.

163
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,320
He can only fool ignorant nurses like you.

164
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,080
I think the patient's current situation...

165
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:00,440
may have something to do with her pregnancy.

166
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,200
What does it have to do with pregnancy?

167
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:04,930
Didn't she take clomiphene for pregnancy?

168
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:06,960
Who knows if she has taken any other medications?

169
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,600
Nowadays, those fertility pills...

170
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,239
and birth control pills are all hormones.

171
00:09:10,239 --> 00:09:11,399
If you overdose, you'll have a problem.

172
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,519
One shouldn't take estrogen as she likes.

173
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:22,759
What's wrong?

174
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:23,810
What are you thinking about?

175
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,399
Nothing.

176
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,560
Let's eat.

177
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,279
Dr. Xiao.

178
00:09:33,479 --> 00:09:34,999
I have something to tell you.

179
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,239
Never mind. I'm not sure if I should tell you.

180
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,119
Tell me when you're ready.

181
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:41,200
I'll just tell you.

182
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,479
Regarding the patient who had abnormal seizures,

183
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,359
she has been taking birth control pills.

184
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,560
Birth control pills?

185
00:09:48,359 --> 00:09:50,119
Shouldn't she be taking fertility pills?

186
00:09:50,119 --> 00:09:51,119
Fertility pills?

187
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:53,519
Her husband and father-in-law forced her to take it.

188
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:54,999
She didn't want to have a baby,

189
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:57,399
so she secretly took birth control pills.

190
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:01,479
I wonder if her abnormal seizures have something to do with this.

191
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,479
What kind of birth control pills was she on?

192
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:04,960
This patient didn't say.

193
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,600
She just said they were birth control pills.

194
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,560
Some of them do cause seizures.

195
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,080
Let's ask her about it.

196
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,479
Come on.

197
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:17,600
If it's because of your past...

198
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:19,519
that you don't want to get pregnant and don't want your family to know,

199
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,519
we understand that.

200
00:10:21,999 --> 00:10:23,600
But for the sake of your health,

201
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:25,050
I need you to tell me...

202
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:27,159
which birth control pills you have taken.

203
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,440
I'm sorry.

204
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,879
Dr. Tang is just worried about your condition.

205
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,999
I've never taken birth control pills.

206
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:40,359
Your husband just went to pay the bill.

207
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:41,930
You can tell us.

208
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,239
He won't be back so soon.

209
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,440
If you don't want your family to know,

210
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,759
we can keep it a secret.

211
00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:51,119
That's your right.

212
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:54,159
But right now, we need the information...

213
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,600
to diagnose your condition.

214
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,479
Yes, think about it.

215
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,759
You have a lump in your liver.

216
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:01,519
It could be a malignant tumor.

217
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,720
Don't try to scare me.

218
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,159
Taking birth control pills won't cause me to grow a tumor.

219
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:09,479
We're not trying to scare you.

220
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:11,119
Previous cases have shown...

221
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:12,560
that long-term use of certain types of contraceptives...

222
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,840
is likely to cause hepatocellular adenoma.

223
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,279
It also affects the dopamine system in the human body...

224
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,519
and cause abnormal seizures.

225
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,800
What you said is possible,

226
00:11:21,239 --> 00:11:22,320
but you're not certain...

227
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,639
if it was caused by birth control pills.

228
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,960
It doesn't matter...

229
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,720
if the tumor is related to birth control pills or not...

230
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,879
or whether it's benign or malignant,

231
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,560
but we may need to remove part of your liver tissue.

232
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,359
You don't want to remove...

233
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:37,879
part of your liver tissue for nothing, right?

234
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:42,080
If my husband and my father-in-law...

235
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,279
know about me taking birth control pills,

236
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,279
I'll never be able to have a peaceful life.

237
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,840
Trust me this time.

238
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:51,200
Your secret is safe with us.

239
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,440
I've only taken...

240
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,639
two different kinds of birth control pills.

241
00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:11,159
Doctor.

242
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,639
Can you recommend me a safer birth control pill?

243
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,680
You still want to take birth control pills?

244
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,840
Regardless of the results of this examination,

245
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,119
whether the tumor and seizures...

246
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:21,320
are related to birth control pills or not,

247
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,680
you can't take them anymore.

248
00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:26,200
All those birth control pills out there have hormones.

249
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,119
You've been taking birth control pills?

250
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:40,119
Honey.

251
00:12:40,479 --> 00:12:41,680
How long were you here?

252
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,759
Tell me!

253
00:12:43,479 --> 00:12:44,600
Keep your voice down.

254
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,680
This is the EICU.

255
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,920
Honey.

256
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:53,920
- I'll tell you later. - Doctor.

257
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,119
Do you mean...

258
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:58,359
her illness is related to her taking birth control pills?

259
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,239
We need to do more tests to confirm this.

260
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,879
Okay.

261
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:12,479
I understand.

262
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:15,399
I...

263
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:18,960
I want to talk to my wife...

264
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,960
privately.

265
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,519
This is the ward.

266
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,720
The patient is still sick.

267
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,040
Watch what you say.

268
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,440
She can't get too worked up.

269
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:31,920
Okay.

270
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,320
I'll let you two talk.

271
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,279
Honey.

272
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,440
I'm sorry.

273
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,519
I shouldn't have kept it from you.

274
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,960
Do you not want to have a baby with me?

275
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,200
That's not true.

276
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,239
What are you doing?

277
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:50,680
- That's not it. - Do you despise me?

278
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:52,519
Do you despise me or this family?

279
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:53,879
What are you doing?

280
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:56,320
No, I'm scared.

281
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:03,440
You're scared?

282
00:14:07,119 --> 00:14:08,279
Honey, come here.

283
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,720
I'll tell you everything.

284
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,040
Do you remember when we first met,

285
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,999
I told you...

286
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,840
that my dad passed away in an accident?

287
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,920
Do you?

288
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:34,680
Actually, I didn't tell you the truth.

289
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,560
My dad was sick.

290
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:41,119
He had hemophilia.

291
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:48,119
It's a hereditary disease.

292
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,920
It only occurs in boys.

293
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,879
Although I didn't get sick, I have this gene.

294
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,960
In the future,

295
00:14:58,279 --> 00:14:59,879
if we have a son,

296
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:02,519
I can only watch him suffer.

297
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,840
I'll blame myself.

298
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,680
I really don't dare to have children.

299
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,720
I don't dare to.

300
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,600
Honey.

301
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,960
You have no idea.

302
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,359
When I think about my child being sick,

303
00:15:23,119 --> 00:15:25,239
that scene...

304
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,200
It's like a nightmare. I don't want it.

305
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:30,999
I don't want it.

306
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:32,279
I know.

307
00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:34,080
- All right, I know. - I don't want it.

308
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,879
- I don't want to be pregnant. - I know.

309
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:38,879
- I'm scared. - Okay, I know.

310
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,359
I got it.

311
00:15:40,359 --> 00:15:41,680
- I got you. - I'm scared.

312
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,720
I got it.

313
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:43,759
I got it.

314
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:45,279
I got it.

315
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,720
I got it.

316
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:54,560
Could it be an organic brain lesion?

317
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,359
We have done a CT scan and MRI.

318
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,840
No organic lesions.

319
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,840
He always wants to show off.

320
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,279
But at a critical moment,

321
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:05,600
one still has to rely on his skills.

322
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,759
What are you talking about?

323
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,359
Dr. Xiao has basically found out the cause of that seizure patient.

324
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,600
She's much better than some braggart.

325
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:17,600
What's the cause?

326
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,600
She secretly took birth control pills.

327
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,800
Tang Hua.

328
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,200
We promised the patient.

329
00:16:22,999 --> 00:16:24,800
But her family already knows about it.

330
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,320
There's no need to hide it.

331
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,639
Birth control pills?

332
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:28,999
Aren't they fertility pills?

333
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:30,759
She has a knot in her heart.

334
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:31,999
She doesn't want to have children,

335
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,840
so she took them without telling her family.

336
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,960
Long-term use of certain types of birth control pills...

337
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,639
can indeed induce tumors and seizures.

338
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,960
However, for the confirmed diagnosis,

339
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,759
we have to wait for more test results.

340
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,239
Do you have any other suggestions?

341
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:49,600
Let's wait for the result.

342
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,960
It sounds like he's angry.

343
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,920
Dr. Xu.

344
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,440
This is your patient. I'll leave it to you.

345
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,519
Okay.

346
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,560
Hui Zhen.

347
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,960
About your dad,

348
00:17:15,479 --> 00:17:16,999
why didn't you tell us earlier?

349
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,119
It's my fault.

350
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,600
I know you and your dad want to have kids so badly.

351
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:25,159
If I tell you I don't want kids,

352
00:17:25,639 --> 00:17:27,010
I know you won't agree.

353
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:30,080
I really want a child.

354
00:17:31,879 --> 00:17:33,040
My dad wants it even more.

355
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,010
However, you should tell us about it...

356
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,879
so that we can solve this matter together.

357
00:17:38,879 --> 00:17:40,119
How to solve it?

358
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,399
You can't solve it.

359
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,320
Just let it be then.

360
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:06,159
Both of us...

361
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:08,399
have been childless for so many years.

362
00:18:09,639 --> 00:18:11,080
Aren't we doing fine?

363
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:14,919
Your dad won't agree to it.

364
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:17,520
It's fine.

365
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,719
I'll talk to him.

366
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:22,199
Maybe after some time,

367
00:18:23,639 --> 00:18:25,800
he'll give up on the thought.

368
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:27,959
Are you really okay...

369
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:29,600
with not having kids?

370
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,250
It's hard.

371
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,080
However,

372
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:45,520
I'm willing to try it for you.

373
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,010
It's okay.

374
00:18:53,639 --> 00:18:54,800
Get well first.

375
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,010
It's all right.

376
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,399
Come on. Don't cry.

377
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:03,159
It's all right.

378
00:19:19,879 --> 00:19:20,879
Son.

379
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,040
Why are you sitting here?

380
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:25,840
I need some fresh air.

381
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:28,320
Fresh air for what?

382
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,359
Let's go in.

383
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,439
Leave me alone here.

384
00:19:32,719 --> 00:19:34,250
I want to sit here for a while.

385
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,359
All right then.

386
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,119
I'll sit here with you for a while.

387
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:44,560
Son.

388
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,119
Her tumor is definitely not malignant.

389
00:19:48,719 --> 00:19:49,879
Don't think too much.

390
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:52,199
Do you remember Mrs. Li,

391
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:54,639
the one who stayed next door?

392
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,490
There's a tumor on her liver.

393
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,119
It was removed later on.

394
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:01,959
It has been so many years now...

395
00:20:02,879 --> 00:20:04,639
and nothing happened.

396
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,840
I hope...

397
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:09,600
when Hui Zhen gets better,

398
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,879
she can give birth to a baby.

399
00:20:15,639 --> 00:20:16,679
Dad.

400
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,439
If Hui Zhen's tumor is malignant...

401
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:21,359
and she won't be able to have children anymore,

402
00:20:21,879 --> 00:20:23,879
are you not going to accept her as your daughter-in-law?

403
00:20:23,879 --> 00:20:25,600
Don't say such inauspicious things.

404
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,959
How can it be malignant?

405
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,080
I mean...

406
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,250
I'm just saying if.

407
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:31,800
It's just a tumor.

408
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,840
We can just remove it.

409
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:35,199
Where are there so many ifs?

410
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,959
At the very least,

411
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,280
if it's really a malignant one,

412
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:58,119
she won't be able to have kids.

413
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,770
We'll do what we have to do.

414
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:04,010
Huizhen has done her best...

415
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:06,879
for both you and me all these years.

416
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,679
I'm getting old.

417
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:13,639
I do want to have a grandchild.

418
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:17,959
However, I'm not a heartless person.

419
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:21,119
What could be more important than her life?

420
00:21:23,439 --> 00:21:24,959
I've thought it through.

421
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,040
I should let my children have their own happiness.

422
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,399
As for having children or not,

423
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,600
I'll let you decide for yourselves.

424
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:37,439
From now on,

425
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:41,959
I won't urge you to have children anymore.

426
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,320
Dad.

427
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:48,250
Let's go see Hui Zhen.

428
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:50,959
- Let's go. - Let's go, Dad.

429
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,359
Here, let me hold it for you.

430
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,560
Be careful, Dad.

431
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,159
Dr. Xu.

432
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,119
Are my wife's test results out?

433
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,800
The results of the liver MRI...

434
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,639
showed that the cyst ruptured and hemorrhaged.

435
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,679
- How bad is it? - The cyst is benign.

436
00:22:05,879 --> 00:22:07,199
It can be treated with surgery.

437
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,250
Dad.

438
00:22:10,639 --> 00:22:12,119
Help me take care of Hui Zhen.

439
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,560
I have some questions about the surgery.

440
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,560
Okay.

441
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,080
Dr. Xu.

442
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:27,280
Is the cyst caused by taking birth control pills?

443
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,800
It's possible.

444
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,919
I didn't tell my dad...

445
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,119
about Huizhen taking birth control pills,

446
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,600
- so... - Don't worry.

447
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,119
We won't tell anyone.

448
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,520
Thank you.

449
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,800
Please sign the consent form as soon as possible...

450
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,399
so that we can schedule the surgery.

451
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,840
Okay.

452
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,840
Xu Yi Ran.

453
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,800
Has the patient with abnormal seizures...

454
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,879
been diagnosed?

455
00:22:56,879 --> 00:22:58,439
It was caused by birth control pills, right?

456
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,159
Didn't I just tell you?

457
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,280
What's wrong with your memory?

458
00:23:05,639 --> 00:23:06,919
The divine doctor is already having a hard time.

459
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:08,399
You don't have to be so mean.

460
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,679
What do you mean?

461
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:11,199
It's just a line.

462
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:12,760
What an old man.

463
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:23,760
Why does the coffee taste so bad?

464
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,080
Did you buy the beans?

465
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,679
Someone is in a bad mood.

466
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:32,199
Even the coffee tastes bad.

467
00:23:32,639 --> 00:23:35,080
Who is to blame for not being capable?

468
00:23:45,399 --> 00:23:46,919
See? You pissed him off again.

469
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:47,959
It serves him right.

470
00:23:49,959 --> 00:23:54,199
(Tongshan Hospital)

471
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,159
Dr. Xiao.

472
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:02,480
This is the medication record for Bed Number 2.

473
00:24:11,719 --> 00:24:12,800
What's going on?

474
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,639
I just changed his dressing and he suddenly had a stomachache.

475
00:24:14,639 --> 00:24:15,639
Where does it hurt?

476
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,800
I haven't pooped in days.

477
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:18,280
My stomach hurts a lot.

478
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:19,679
Move your hand.

479
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,399
Do a follow-up CT scan of his abdomen.

480
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:29,719
- Yi Ran. - Dr. Lu.

481
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,280
Where are Xiao Yan and Bai Zhu?

482
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,159
They went to check on a patient.

483
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,760
Both of them?

484
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,240
The patient's condition is quite urgent.

485
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,520
If there's nothing else, I'll get going.

486
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,520
Go ahead.

487
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,600
Mesenteric hematoma.

488
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,840
The intestinal tract is dilated.

489
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:52,240
There's fluid in the abdominal cavity.

490
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,560
Doctor.

491
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,480
What's happening to me?

492
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,280
Could there be progressive bleeding in the abdominal cavity?

493
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,240
It's possible.

494
00:25:02,439 --> 00:25:04,199
But the patient has a history of atrial fibrillation.

495
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:06,600
We need to rule out mesenteric artery embolism.

496
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:08,119
Do a follow-up CT scan.

497
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:09,119
Okay.

498
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,520
Dr. Bai, you're right.

499
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,080
It's a mesenteric artery embolism.

500
00:25:25,719 --> 00:25:27,439
In this case, simple pain relief and rehydration...

501
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,000
won't solve the problem.

502
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,080
Lin Zhi.

503
00:25:31,639 --> 00:25:33,439
Contact the Gastroenterology Department for another surgery.

504
00:25:33,439 --> 00:25:34,439
Okay.

505
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,840
Hello, I'll take your temperature.

506
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,439
The patient's mesenteric bleeding and hematoma were too extensive...

507
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:48,679
during the surgery.

508
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,199
We couldn't resolve it completely during the surgery.

509
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,639
The most obvious part of the intestinal segment was removed,

510
00:25:54,959 --> 00:25:56,600
but there was necrosis.

511
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,800
The removed intestines are all black.

512
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,879
I'll leave her to you.

513
00:26:01,439 --> 00:26:02,480
Thank you.

514
00:26:08,879 --> 00:26:10,000
Xiao Yan.

515
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,240
Xiao Yan.

516
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,679
How's her condition?

517
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,520
She's still unconscious.

518
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,600
Her blood sugar level is below 2.8.

519
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:33,119
She's exhausted after working several night shifts in a row.

520
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:34,119
That's why she has low blood sugar.

521
00:26:34,199 --> 00:26:35,240
I just injected her with glucose.

522
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,560
Let me do it.

523
00:26:40,719 --> 00:26:42,800
Okay, take good care of her.

524
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,959
Call everyone if you need anything.

525
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:46,399
Get back to work.

526
00:26:50,879 --> 00:26:51,959
Tang Hua.

527
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,840
Let's go.

528
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:20,320
Dr. Xiao, you're awake.

529
00:29:21,199 --> 00:29:22,520
You are so tired that you have low blood sugar.

530
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,159
We just injected you with glucose.

531
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:25,480
Are you feeling better now?

532
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,119
I'm fine.

533
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:29,119
Get back to work.

534
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,800
Have a good rest then.

535
00:30:32,879 --> 00:30:36,080
(Whose pen, ink, paper, and inkstone?)

536
00:30:53,959 --> 00:30:55,040
I knew you'd be here.

537
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,320
Well, you read my mind.

538
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:02,280
Have you ever seen such a handsome mind reader?

539
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,280
A hospital in the dead of night.

540
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,159
A sad and lonely man.

541
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,679
It's a perfect match.

542
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,040
You won't throw yourself at your first love.

543
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:16,159
What are you doing here?

544
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,240
Stop mentioning my first love.

545
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,199
She's already married with a child.

546
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,320
I can tell.

547
00:31:23,959 --> 00:31:26,560
Your words are full of bitterness.

548
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,600
Stop teasing me.

549
00:31:29,719 --> 00:31:30,760
Come on, have a meal with me.

550
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,760
I'm not hungry.

551
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,840
I'm not hungry either.

552
00:31:35,719 --> 00:31:37,760
I want to stimulate myself through food.

553
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,959
To release some dopamine and to cheer up my wounded heart.

554
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,879
Why don't you go alone?

555
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,520
No. I'm taking you with me.

556
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:47,040
Xu Yi Ran, I don't want to go.

557
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,119
- You're alone anyway. - Let go of me.

558
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,199
I just checked his blood pressure.

559
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,280
He's all right,

560
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:53,000
but his temperature is still a bit high.

561
00:31:53,199 --> 00:31:54,199
Okay.

562
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,520
- Son. - Dad, you're here.

563
00:31:58,359 --> 00:31:59,439
Yes.

564
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,800
She's awake.

565
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,520
Hui Zhen is awake.

566
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,280
Good job, Hui Zhen.

567
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:14,480
You heard the doctor.

568
00:32:14,719 --> 00:32:17,080
This cyst is caused by birth control pills.

569
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,520
Don't take them again.

570
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:22,840
What are you whispering about?

571
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:24,199
Dad.

572
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:25,520
I told Hui Zhen...

573
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,919
that you're so happy when you see that she's fine.

574
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,359
Stop making up stories about me.

575
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,879
I'm praising you, aren't I?

576
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:37,000
My dad won't force you to have children.

577
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,240
I made porridge for you.

578
00:32:42,719 --> 00:32:43,800
Longan and lotus seed.

579
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,320
It means having a baby soon.

580
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:49,480
Me and my big mouth.

581
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,560
I take it back.

582
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,199
Longan and lotus seed nourish yin and vitality.

583
00:32:53,879 --> 00:32:54,879
This is for you.

584
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,320
Have some.

585
00:32:56,439 --> 00:32:58,280
Dad, the doctor said she just had surgery.

586
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,320
She can't eat yet.

587
00:33:01,439 --> 00:33:02,439
Father.

588
00:33:03,199 --> 00:33:05,000
Give that lady a bowl.

589
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:08,719
That lady?

590
00:33:09,399 --> 00:33:10,439
Don't worry.

591
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:13,040
You'll surely find a suitable cornea.

592
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,560
Doctor.

593
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,840
Is there no cure for my illness?

594
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:33,159
Don't think too much.

595
00:33:37,399 --> 00:33:38,480
I understand.

596
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,040
How much time do I have left?

597
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
It can also be treated by rehydration, hemodialysis,

598
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:50,199
and other methods.

599
00:33:50,879 --> 00:33:51,959
Don't worry.

600
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,199
We'll do our best to cure you.

601
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,040
Thank you, doctor.

602
00:34:03,879 --> 00:34:05,240
How's Ding Xiao Ying?

603
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,040
We haven't found a suitable cornea yet.

604
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,639
How was your day?

605
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:16,679
It was okay.

606
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,840
You ate half a bowl more than yesterday.

607
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,480
It's good that you ate more.

608
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,280
You haven't found a suitable cornea yet, right?

609
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,409
We're still looking.

610
00:34:31,799 --> 00:34:33,000
But we'll find one.

611
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,199
Look at the patient in the bed next to yours.

612
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,960
She has got such a strange disease, yet she's all better now.

613
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,159
I even saw her husband...

614
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,560
take her sunbathing in the yard just now.

615
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,080
You can do it.

616
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,080
I'm just not used to not seeing the sunlight.

617
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:48,929
In the past,

618
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:51,159
I loved sitting in front of the window to see the sunlight.

619
00:34:53,319 --> 00:34:54,319
Right.

620
00:34:54,319 --> 00:34:55,960
Did the police arrest that pervert?

621
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,600
There's no more victim, right?

622
00:34:57,719 --> 00:34:59,279
The police already caught the criminal.

623
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:00,929
However,

624
00:35:01,279 --> 00:35:03,319
he's not the one who admitted at the same time as you.

625
00:35:03,889 --> 00:35:05,279
That patient is a good person.

626
00:35:05,279 --> 00:35:06,639
He did it to catch the criminal.

627
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:08,719
To catch the criminal?

628
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,239
He did what was right.

629
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,319
The police even praised him later.

630
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:13,889
Then...

631
00:35:13,889 --> 00:35:14,929
Is he all right?

632
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:17,159
That day, I saw that he was badly injured.

633
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:19,679
He's fine.

634
00:35:20,279 --> 00:35:21,520
It's just some bruises and scratches.

635
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,520
He'll be fine soon.

636
00:35:23,319 --> 00:35:24,369
That's good.

637
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:27,889
I misunderstood him.

638
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,319
I even got the police to arrest him.

639
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,600
I really want to apologize to him.

640
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:33,929
He has been discharged,

641
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,319
but we'll tell him on your behalf.

642
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,119
Thank you.

643
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,520
I hope I didn't cause him any trouble.

644
00:35:45,889 --> 00:35:46,960
Doctor.

645
00:35:48,929 --> 00:35:51,040
I'm donating my cornea to her,

646
00:35:53,799 --> 00:35:54,929
so she can...

647
00:35:56,799 --> 00:35:58,520
see the world with me.

648
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,119
Please.

649
00:36:02,799 --> 00:36:03,799
I'm sorry to tell you this.

650
00:36:04,889 --> 00:36:06,319
According to the rules of corneal donation,

651
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:08,239
there can't be a designated direction...

652
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:09,719
for corneal donation.

653
00:36:10,759 --> 00:36:12,929
Both the donor and the recipient...

654
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,369
must go through a series of complete procedures.

655
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:17,199
However,

656
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:19,679
if you really want to donate your cornea...

657
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,799
to anyone you don't know...

658
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:23,239
so that he can see things again,

659
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,119
I can contact the relevant department for you.

660
00:36:34,929 --> 00:36:36,000
I do.

661
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,929
I believe Ding Xiao Ying...

662
00:36:41,889 --> 00:36:43,369
will find a kindhearted person...

663
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,719
like me.

664
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:57,719
Have some water.

665
00:37:07,799 --> 00:37:10,279
I think I can see the light.

666
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:13,199
Take your time.

667
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:14,600
You'll feel better soon.

668
00:37:25,929 --> 00:37:26,929
She's lucky.

669
00:37:27,409 --> 00:37:28,799
She got a suitable cornea so quickly.

670
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,199
The surgery was a success.

671
00:37:30,889 --> 00:37:31,960
Yes.

672
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,520
But Luo Guang Liang wasn't so lucky.

673
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:37,799
During the surgery,

674
00:37:38,319 --> 00:37:40,080
we found that the mesenteric membrane has multiple bleeding.

675
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:42,279
It caused peritonitis and intestinal necrosis.

676
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:44,600
After that, sepsis occurred...

677
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:46,679
and it caused multiple organ failures.

678
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:48,639
In this case,

679
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,159
the mortality rate is very high.

680
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,480
It's a pity that he dies so young.

681
00:37:54,759 --> 00:37:55,889
Tell me.

682
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,239
Did Luo Guang Liang's cornea...

683
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:00,199
happen to be transplanted to Ding Xiao Ying?

684
00:38:01,319 --> 00:38:03,000
While she's watching the world,

685
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,409
it's going to be a bit different.

686
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,199
The cornea application and donation are complicated procedures.

687
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:12,600
They can't be a match that quickly.

688
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:16,159
You're a doctor,

689
00:38:16,319 --> 00:38:17,889
yet you said such unprofessional things.

690
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,199
Do you think you're in an idol drama?

691
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:21,679
Are there so many coincidences?

692
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:24,159
You're the rational one.

693
00:38:25,279 --> 00:38:27,199
You like Xiao Yan, but you don't dare to confess.

694
00:38:29,279 --> 00:38:30,409
Look at Luo Guang Liang.

695
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:33,480
He likes Ding Xiao Ying and he didn't say it until the end.

696
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,719
He'll regret it for the rest of his life.

697
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:39,639
You said it yourself. Life isn't an idol drama.

698
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:41,440
Can you stop making things so melodramatic?

699
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,639
Can't you just say it?

700
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:47,600
If you like her, just tell her.

701
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:51,239
Why are you looking at me?

702
00:38:51,759 --> 00:38:52,759
Tell her.

703
00:39:03,279 --> 00:39:04,369
Dr. Bai.

704
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:08,369
How are you feeling?

705
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:13,000
What time is your shift today?

706
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:17,199
I want to find a quiet place to talk to you about something.

707
00:39:18,409 --> 00:39:19,480
Sure.

708
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,719
I happen to know a place.

709
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:21,799
I'll take you there.

710
00:39:57,279 --> 00:39:58,279
What do you think?

711
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,520
The scenery is nice, isn't it?

712
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,279
You asked me out alone.

713
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:04,799
You must have something very important to tell me.

714
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:10,560
Do you like me?

715
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,520
I do like you.

716
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:23,759
Dr. Bai.

717
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,080
I think you're already affecting my normal life.

718
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:30,960
Maybe you enjoy being talked about by others,

719
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,960
but I don't.

720
00:40:33,799 --> 00:40:35,369
I can't stand being the center of attention.

721
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,639
If I did something that made you misunderstand,

722
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:40,679
I apologize.

723
00:40:40,799 --> 00:40:41,839
But you and I...

724
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:43,889
We're just colleagues.

725
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,159
I want to know why you rejected me.

726
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:58,679
There's something I can't let go of in my heart.

727
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:01,799
I...

728
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,199
I can't accept anyone else.

729
00:41:03,799 --> 00:41:04,889
Anyone.

730
00:41:05,279 --> 00:41:06,719
I won't ask you what's in your heart.

731
00:41:07,369 --> 00:41:08,480
That's your secret.

732
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,560
However,

733
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,319
I'm sure you'll tell me one day.

734
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,960
I'm a cardiac surgeon at Tangshan Hospital after all.

735
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:30,929
I don't believe I can't open your heart.

736
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:32,929
I...

737
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:35,480
I just recovered.

738
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,319
I'm going home to rest.

739
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,600
I'll get going.

740
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:53,409
Catherine.

741
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,239
If I go back to Switzerland,

742
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:57,600
can I still work at the hospital?

743
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,759
Shirley, is that true?

744
00:41:59,929 --> 00:42:00,960
Yes.

745
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,719
That's really great news.

746
00:42:03,369 --> 00:42:05,080
We were all so sad when you quit.

747
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,889
I'll talk to the hospital tomorrow.

748
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:10,440
Wait for my message.

749
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:11,719
Thank you, Catherine.

750
00:42:24,279 --> 00:42:25,759
Okay, your temperature is 36.8.

751
00:42:25,759 --> 00:42:26,759
It's normal.

752
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,279
Your blood pressure is good too.

753
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,199
Thank you, Dr. Jiang.

754
00:42:31,759 --> 00:42:33,159
I'm Ms. Jiang, a nurse.

755
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,279
It's the same thing.

756
00:42:35,279 --> 00:42:36,520
Both doctors and nurses save lives.

757
00:42:37,279 --> 00:42:38,369
What's wrong with her?

758
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:39,960
Dr. Bai,

759
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:41,889
Mrs. Zhang has chronic heart failure.

760
00:42:41,889 --> 00:42:43,639
She's here for a furosemide injection.

761
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,080
Dr. Jiang is very attentive.

762
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:49,440
Ma'am. Do you have a weak heart?

763
00:42:49,929 --> 00:42:52,279
It's chronic heart failure.

764
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:53,839
Let me listen to your heart sounds.

765
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:55,600
Let Dr. Bai examine you.

766
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,119
- Come on. - Okay.

767
00:42:57,239 --> 00:42:58,319
Slowly.

768
00:43:04,929 --> 00:43:06,409
Dr. Xiao. You're back.

769
00:43:06,889 --> 00:43:07,889
How are you doing?

770
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:09,319
I'm fine now.
