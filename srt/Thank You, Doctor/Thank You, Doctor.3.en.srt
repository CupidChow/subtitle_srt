15
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,570
You've seen the surgery information?

16
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,720
Is there anything that you still don't understand?

17
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,540
- No.
- No.

18
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,910
Relax. Don't be nervous.

19
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,860
Mothers are the bravest.

20
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,780
Later the staff from the operating room will come and receive her.

21
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,740
If you need to use the toilet, don't get out of the bed.

22
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,230
Okay.

23
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,850
Do you want to pee?

24
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,760
No.

25
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,070
Mom.

26
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:25,130
Do you still remember what happened when you gave birth to me?

27
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,770
I heard grandma said

28
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,850
when you were pregnant with me,

29
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,980
you had very serious

30
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,200
pregnancy induced hypertension.

31
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,410
You could die any time.

32
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,060
All the doctors

33
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:50,270
persuaded you to abort me.

34
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:54,120
Even grandma, who was very traditional, said

35
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:00,130
"you can give birth to my grandchild again."

36
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,780
"I only have you as my only daughter-in-law."

37
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,930
But you didn't care about everyone's advise.

38
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:15,320
You persisted till full term and gave birth to me.

39
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,720
I followed you.

40
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,680
We two are the same.

41
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:31,320
You didn't care about the danger of losing your life to give birth to me.

42
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:38,010
And for this child, I'm also doing the same.

43
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:44,020
You are a good mother.

44
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:50,070
I also want to learn to be a good mother like you.

45
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:56,350
Actually, I and your dad are worried about you.

46
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:02,850
Mom, you must believe in me.

47
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,030
I'm okay.

48
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,080
Dad.

49
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,250
I made you fearful again.

50
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,850
I... I will definitely...

51
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:23,810
- definitely be okay.
- Yes.

52
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:28,180
Qing Qing, be strong.

53
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:32,060
Your dad and I will wait for you

54
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,110
outside the operating room.

55
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,480
Wang Qing's surgery plan.

56
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,850
Didn't you say this surgery will have you and not her?

57
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,530
Why? You're willing to be the prisoner?

58
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,130
What prisoner?

59
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,570
I'm going into this in spirit being responsible for the patient.

60
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,370
I'm examining and providing guidance for her plan.

61
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:15,000
Oh please. You're picky.

62
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,740
Doctor Bai, I have to remind you that yesterday's betâ€”

63
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,690
Bet is bet. Work is work.

64
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,270
I'm not letting you have this surgery.

65
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,020
Don't tell me you two are betting on who is doing this surgery?

66
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:30,850
There's no need to. The hospital has rules. We will listen to the hospital director.

67
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:33,820
The hospital director arranged for you to be her assistant.

68
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,620
You heard it.

69
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,230
You really want to be her assistant?

70
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,930
If you don't talk, you will suffocate?

71
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,190
Okay, I'm not talking, I'm not talking.

72
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,880
Doctor Xiao.

73
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,340
Doctor Bai.

74
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,940
If you want to still want to talk to be about Wang Qing's surgery,

75
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,050
I've already explained what I should explain.

76
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,800
You still stick to your perspective. Then please withdraw from this surgery.

77
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,710
- Very stubborn.
- Likewise.

78
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,920
I'm stubborn because of my professional competence.

79
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,010
My surgery plan will not have any problems.

80
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,720
It's pity that your plan has loopholes.

81
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,460
I've already sent it to your email. I've noted my opinions on the changes.

82
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,350
And from your surgery plan,

83
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:29,250
you really need someone who's more outstanding than you to help you.

84
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:59,810
Level of blood coagulation?

85
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,020
More than 480.

86
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:09,490
Prepare to clip the ascending aorta. Start the extracorporeal circulation.

87
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,300
Aorta clamp.

88
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,970
Surgical blade.

89
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,910
Doctor Xiao is doing the surgery really well.

90
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,960
Hemostat.

91
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,690
Blood is stopped.

92
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,460
The surgery was not bad.

93
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,640
Being the assistant, you're competent.

94
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,130
If it's me, that blood vessel will not break.

95
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,670
It's normal that accidents happen.

96
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:15,660
But how to calmly handle the accident, that's the test for the doctor.

97
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,040
My aim is no accidents.

98
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,860
Don't aim for these meaningless things.

99
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,350
That's because you're not capable enough.

100
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,880
Xiao Yan did the surgery really well.

101
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:35,560
Our hospital should have more of these kind of doctors. Pretty and ride well.

102
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,550
I advise you to go to the ophthalmology department for a checkup.

103
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,530
- Why?
- There's a problem with your eyes.

104
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,200
What problem?

105
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,530
You only lust for beauty. You didn't see a blood vessel break?

106
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:50,040
You can't listen to us praising good things about others.

107
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,400
Why are you not driving?

108
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,360
I'm tired.

109
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:00,360
Doctor Bai, do you need me to send you?

110
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,000
No need.

111
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,270
Why is she asking you that?

112
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,420
Being friendly.

113
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,400
Being friendly?

114
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,840
<i>[Emergency]</i>

115
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,090
You awake.

116
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:40,850
Quick. Qing Qing, you're awake.

117
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,700
You're awake.

118
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,010
Where's my child?

119
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:52,450
Your child is good. It's a boy.

120
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:55,320
1.75kg.

121
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:01,830
I... I want to see.

122
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,110
The child is not full term and born prematurely.

123
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:08,000
Doctor sent him to the incubator.

124
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,090
We took a few pictures of him for you to see.

125
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:13,200
Don't panic.

126
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,150
Look.

127
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:19,590
How handsome this young boy is.

128
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,120
He's really...

129
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,050
my son?

130
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,070
Beautiful right? He's good.

131
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:40,850
Mom, Dad.

132
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,000
I made you worry.

133
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,310
Mother and child is safe is better than anything else. We are very happy.

134
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:55,020
Your dad has came up with a name for the baby. You hear if it's okay.

135
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,590
What do you want to call him?

136
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:01,520
I want to call him Qin Xiao Shan.

137
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,800
- Xiao Shan.
- Qin Xiao Shan.

138
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,590
Qin Xiao Shan.

139
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:09,720
Thank you, Dad.

140
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:13,220
Qin Xiao Shan.

141
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,640
Mom, I'm okay.

142
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,530
You're okay, you're okay.

143
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:21,230
Both of you are good and safe.

144
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,570
Qin Xiao Shan.

145
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,730
There's no problem.

146
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:45,940
Sir, you recovered very well.

147
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,190
Really?

148
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:53,260
-That's amazing!
-Thank you so much!

149
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,850
If it weren't for you

150
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:00,230
I would never be able my specialized publication.

151
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:04,050
Then when you finish that publication, how about you send me a copy?

152
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,940
I will give you the first copy.

153
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,070
-It's a plan.
-It's a plan.

154
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:13,040
Doctor Bai, don't worry. He has me.

155
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,500
If he doesn't send you the first copy

156
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,170
-I won't make him any food and starve him.
-By the way

157
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:20,520
Thanks for reminding me

158
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,540
for a while, don't let Mr. Chen eat too much.

159
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,580
I know. I remember.

160
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:29,090
Good. Now Mr. Chen, take a rest. I'll come back to check on you.

161
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,550
-Go do your thing.
-I will.

162
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,910
-Yes, go do your thing.
-Okay.

163
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:39,200
-He's great.
-Doctor Bai really is amazing.

164
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:43,120
You ran out of water again. I will go get you some more.

165
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,470
Don't go. Let Xiao Yan do it. You're arms and legs are getting old. What are you doing?

166
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:50,420
Look at that, you despise me again.

167
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:55,090
Today I want you to see the true meaning of "taking great strides".

168
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,290
Slow down!

169
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,090
Wait for me!

170
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:39,080
Doctor Bai, it's bed number twenty-six.

171
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,230
Mr. Chen!

172
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,200
Doctor! Save him!

173
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,550
-Family members leave the room.
-Save him!

174
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:53,380
-Sir!
-Old Chen! What's wrong! Old Chen!

175
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,080
Prepare the defibrillator!

176
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,180
There's no heartbeat.

177
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:06,860
Put in the IV. One ml of epinephrine! Once every three minutes.

178
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,180
Xiao Wu, open the airway.

179
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,000
Call the anesthesia department! Prepare for intubation!

180
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,530
Okay.

181
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:26,030
One ml of epinephrine hydrochloride complete.

182
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:56,320
Doctor Bai, we have already been trying to save him for forty minutes.

183
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:25,190
Time of death, 13:50.

184
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:14,530
Mr. Chen one of our countries most outstanding linguistics experts.

185
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:19,190
This will greatly affect our country's development in the linguistic field.

186
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:25,820
Our hospital deeply regrets Mr. Chen's death.

187
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:32,440
Immediately after Mr. Chen's death, we started an investigation on this medical case.

188
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,790
We initiated a third-party investigation.

189
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:38,990
The postoperative treatment after

190
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:43,230
in regard to the excision of the cardiac tumor and the emergency handling of Mr. Chen

191
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:48,450
Doctor Bai's diagnosis was correct, the medication was correct, and it was handled correctly.

192
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:52,040
Doctor Bai strictly enforced every single rule and regulation

193
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,680
operating instruction and job duty.

194
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,570
According the the investigation

195
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:03,360
Mr. Chen's death has no direct relation to Doctor Bai.

196
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,470
If the family has any demands

197
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:09,400
under the circumstance of rule violations

198
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,630
Our hospital will satisfy them as best we can.

199
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:16,870
Dean, does my grandfather's death

200
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,500
really have nothing to do with Doctor Bai?

201
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:30,680
Mr. Chen, this is the third-party agency's investigation results.

202
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,510
If you have any objections, you can apply for a review.

203
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:37,790
But according to my many years of medical experience...

204
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,640
The surgery succeeded, his rescue was timely

205
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,540
I have no objections to this, Dean.

206
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:46,510
But if Doctor Bai had never given my grandfather the surgery

207
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:49,910
the accident that happened afterwards may have never happened.

208
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:52,440
Then my grandfather would still be here.

209
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,150
I can understand your emotions towards your grandfather's accidental death

210
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:59,780
but this accident could not be foreseen.

211
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:03,670
Don't worry, I'm not looking for money from the hospital.

212
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,800
My family doesn't lack in that.

213
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:10,720
-Then you...
-I only have one request.

214
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:17,140
The day my grandfather is buried, Doctor Bai will bow to my grandfather three times

215
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,590
and apologize.

216
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:24,930
Otherwise, I will get a lawyer, and go through the legal whole process with the hospital.

217
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:28,470
I agree to bow, but I won't apologize.

218
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:33,230
Dean, I am also very sad about Mr. Chen's death

219
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:37,270
but as a doctor, no matter from the early diagnosis and medical care

220
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:41,670
or the later surgery and emergency rescue, I never did anything wrong.

221
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:44,080
Bowing to someone is not hard

222
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,340
I'm not afraid to bow one hundred times if necessary.

223
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:50,320
But I am a doctor, I use my expertise to heal people and save them.

224
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,020
I need to respect my expertise. I need to protect my identity as a doctor.

225
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,290
Even more, I need to respect myself.

226
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:59,790
Let him sue, I don't believe he will win.

227
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:04,610
In fact, we can use this opportunity to tell all of society

228
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,840
us doctors also have dignity.

229
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,480
The doctor profession also needs to be respected.

230
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,480
Chen Yan, as a doctor, I tell you apologetically

231
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:20,880
I will not apologize when I have not made any mistakes. That would be insulting to myself.

232
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,280
Fine.

233
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,610
Then I will see you in court.

234
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:28,290
Please enter.

235
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,790
Grandmother?

236
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:39,200
Dean, I want to talk to you.

237
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,040
No, you say you have a Ph.D.

238
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,440
but you can't even write medical records.

239
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,680
"The patient said they needed to poop in the middle of the night."

240
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:57,200
"They got up to go at 12:00am, they got up to go again at 2:00am. They tried several times, but no poop came out." This is how you write

241
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,660
when you write a story book.

242
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,920
However the patient says it, you just write it down.

243
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:07,460
Then why did you not write "the patient pulled the doctor's hand and said â€˜Doctor, my poop won't come out, what should I do?'"

244
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:11,920
The patient self-reported dysuria. When it's called 'dysuria' do you understand?

245
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,710
Doctor Xu, Xiao Chen Nian has a Ph.D. in scientific research.

246
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:19,390
A lack of clinical experience shouldn't be a problem.

247
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:22,570
Xiao Chen, there's not problem. Doctors come here like this

248
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:24,690
but you need to remember

249
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:29,040
doctor's orders and medical records are both a hospital's most legally binding records

250
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,980
so you need to be concise and accurate.

251
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,270
Thank you, Doctor Xiao.

252
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:36,010
Why are you thanking her? Go run the ECG for all of the emergency patients.

253
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,520
I have already run the ECG's.

254
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,090
Then go test their blood sugar.

255
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:48,420
Chen Zhi, what's going on? Xu Yi Ran, you are bullying people again.

256
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,850
I bullied him? He bullied me.

257
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,600
Sooner or later he will cause me to have a heart attack.

258
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,100
Doctor Xiao, have you heard? Something happened with Doctor Bai.

259
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,390
-What happened?
-He had a patient

260
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,050
who suffered an accident post-operation and died.

261
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:06,790
Originally, the patient's family members felt that the surgery was too risky, so they wanted to continue with conservative treatment. He persuaded the patient to go through with the surgery

262
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:10,680
and after the surgery, the patient fell off of the bed and suffered an accident.

263
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,320
Tang Hua, you call it an accident.

264
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,120
Then Doctor Bai's surgery was successful?

265
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,550
I can't stand him. He doesn't respect patients and he acts so full of himself.

266
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,940
You are his friend, of course you will speak up for him.

267
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,400
I am only speaking up for the truth.

268
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:37,670
Dean, our family's boss suddenly died.

269
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:42,130
Chen Yan is having trouble accepting it

270
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:46,620
Because his parents were busy, we have essentially raised him since childhood.

271
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:52,600
When he was young, he loved to read books with his grandpa in the yard.

272
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,580
When they got tired of reading, they'd fall asleep on the recliner.

273
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:01,880
It was always the scent of my cooking that would wake them up.

274
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,290
And Old Chen? Before he died he said

275
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:08,290
Birth and death are a part of life.

276
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,530
His time came.

277
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:15,370
It's not your fault.

278
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:30,020
Dean, what are you going to do about this?

279
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:33,570
Not only is Doctor Bai one of our doctors here at Tong Shan hospital

280
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:37,530
he is also my student, not to mention

281
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,720
Doctor Bai performed Mr. Chen's surgery, it passed through my approval.

282
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,170
Not only am I the dean of the hospital

283
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:50,220
I am also Doctor Bai's teacher.

284
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:53,900
So, I apologize on behalf of him.

285
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:58,280
Chen was always a senior I truly respected.

286
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:01,350
His death

287
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:05,040
is something I deeply regret.

288
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,920
Doctor Bai is a good doctor.

289
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:17,020
He is considerate towards patients, and he's not afraid to take responsibility.

290
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:23,240
I came today just to tell you this.

291
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,040
In the future, keep doing

292
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,900
what you think is right.

293
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:34,460
Don't feel burdened by what happened to our family's Old Chen.

294
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,320
Thank you.

295
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:42,100
Alright.

296
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:45,830
We'll head back now.

297
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,650
Thank you.

298
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,590
Bai Shu, I feel you were a bit over the top this time.

299
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:12,140
Look, the Zheng Yajie who has always worshipped you blindly can't even stand you.

300
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:17,650
I know, you all think I am headstrong and won't listen to reason.

301
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:22,060
You think the Dean bears the responsibility and blame, and was considerate of the majority's interest.

302
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:26,170
If I went to apologize, that would be indulging the family's unreasonable demand.

303
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:30,940
It would be disrespecting my expertise and identity as a doctor. It would defile the doctor profession.

304
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:39,280
What's good is that Mr. Chen's wife understands reason.

305
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,570
-And you always follow reason?
-Yeah.

306
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:44,580
True reason is often held in my own hand.

307
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,880
Okay, everything you hold is true reason.

308
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:16,710
<i>[Chen Chuan Shu]</i>

309
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:22,280
<i>Thank you so much!</i>

310
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,760
<i>If it weren't for you</i>

311
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:29,110
<i>I wouldn't be able to finish my specialized publication.</i>

312
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:33,090
<i>Then when you finish it, how about you send me a copy?</i>

313
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,800
<i>I will send you the first copy.</i>

314
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,480
<i>-It's a plan
-It's a plan.</i>

315
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,830
Grandma, let's go.

316
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:42,960
<i> [Tongshan Hospital] </i>

317
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:46,590
- You're sending me to the emergency department?
- Why are you yelling?

318
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:49,260
This is the hospital's decision.

319
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,140
I'm just informing you.

320
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:56,620
Dean, Teacher Jiang, I know you have had to endure humiliation and make compromises for me.

321
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:59,080
You need to punish me in order to quell everyone's anger.

322
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,860
I understand. I can accept it. But do you really have to send me to the emergency department?

323
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,810
What's wrong with the emergency department?

324
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:09,490
The emergency department is also a part of Tongshan Hospital, an important part at that.

325
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:17,290
The Emergency Department are establishing an emergency intensive care unit. They happen to be short on staff.

326
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:20,880
Director Lu has asked me for staff many times already, but there has never been anyone suitable.

327
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,050
Don't you call yourself the knife of Cardiology? You are most suitable to go there.

328
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:28,230
- Then you may as well send me to Obstetrics and Gynecology!
- Disgraceful words!

329
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,050
All day long, you pick and choose,

330
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:32,940
and haggle, do you really treat the hospital as your own home?

331
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,810
Either way, I cannot accept going to Emergency.

332
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:40,090
There's no point in glaring at me. You said just now,

333
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:44,910
I am the knife of our Cardiology Department. How many patients have come back from the dead under my hands?

334
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:47,390
If I go to the emergency department, every day just

335
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:51,110
- treating cough, fever, diarrhea, what a waste-
- Enough!

336
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,330
Look at how condescending you currently are!

337
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:59,460
How could you be one of my students?

338
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:03,890
Teacher, don't get angry. You have high blood pressure.

339
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,650
Enough.

340
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,360
Do you want to drink some water?

341
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,950
You think that sending you to the emergency department

342
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:30,850
is because I am not happy with Mr Chen Chuan Shu's surgery

343
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,670
so I'm punishing you?

344
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,640
I'm telling you it has nothing to do with that at all.

345
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,910
Then why?

346
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:42,290
So that you can properly, diligently learn how to be a good doctor.

347
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:46,630
You want me to go to the emergency department to work on my skills?

348
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:49,680
But Emergency just has that set of actions: compressions, intubation,

349
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,870
defibrillation, bagging, dosing epinephrine - which one can't I do?

350
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:55,770
You think that having good technical skills makes you a good doctor?

351
00:28:55,770 --> 00:29:01,080
A true doctor doesn't just focus on the illness or the technical skill.

352
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:06,100
They need to pay attention to the person, to the patient, and connect with the patient's heart.

353
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:09,630
I believe that as a good doctor, diagnosing and treating the disease

354
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:12,430
is the best thing they can do for the patient.

355
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:15,540
Once you make a name for yourself in Emergency,

356
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,760
then you can come back and contest this.

357
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,940
Let me tell you, Bai Zhu. Either you properly work in the emergency department,

358
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:24,280
or leave Tongshan Hospital

359
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:27,020
and never call me Teacher again.

360
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:38,200
Did you just say that I need to make a name for myself before coming back to find you?

361
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:44,630
Teacher, don't worry.

362
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:48,190
I will quickly come back to find you.

363
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,860
Also, don't be angry anymore.

364
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,050
Your health is most important.

365
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:56,480
If there's nothing else, I'll get going.

366
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:18,850
I think that Dean Jiang has done this to refine your abilities.

367
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:23,170
So what if you're going to Emergency, you can pretend you're going there to practice.

368
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:24,800
In a few days, once his anger subsides,

369
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:29,240
then he will realize Cardiology can not run without you. When that time comes, he will beg for you to come back.

370
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,480
Then you can continue with your brilliant career.

371
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:37,480
What's wrong with joining our emergency department?

372
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,820
The Earth revolves around no one. Can Cardiology not treat patients without you?

373
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:45,200
You'll be together all day soon. Don't lead my Bai Zhu astray.

374
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,730
Me leading him astray?

375
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,590
More like him leading me astray.

376
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:52,650
Look at him. Everyday, he puts on these airs of superiority,

377
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:55,990
coffee cup in hand, acting as though life is good, with no care in the world.

378
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:59,790
I would just like to ask you, will you die if you stop pretending?

379
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,030
I will die.

380
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:06,640
As our Bai Zhu said, he will die.

381
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,730
You two really are a pair, aren't you?

382
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,380
Dean.

383
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:16,620
Dean, the emergency intensive care unit just got established. It can't withstand any blows.

384
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,090
What's that supposed to mean?

385
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:21,140
Don't you all run to me all day long, whining for staff?

386
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:25,060
I want talented people, not sh*t-stirrers!

387
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:30,820
This geek is not good for our team synergy.

388
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:34,570
Dean, if you continue acting like this, I-

389
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:36,660
my path ahead...

390
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:41,000
Sit, Lu.

391
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:46,960
Let me tell you. You don't know Bai Zhu. He's a good seedling.

392
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,210
Then isn't a good seedling like him going to be wasted over at our emergency department?

393
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:53,020
Send him to cardiology. They need people.

394
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:56,260
Then I guess you don't want Dr Xiao who has just come back from Switzerland either?

395
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:59,340
He is also a geek, b-but we need him.

396
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:02,320
Why? It's either take none of them

397
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,130
or take them both. Your choice.

398
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:07,190
Dean.

399
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,640
Let me be honest with you and I'm not afraid of you making a joke of me,

400
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,040
but I know everyone in Emergency all gossip about me.

401
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,000
They say I ramble and fuss over things like a woman.

402
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,590
I always emphasize that safety comes first. It's given them a great deal of pressure.

403
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:26,300
But I really cannot let myself or Emergency have any more problems.

404
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:30,850
This Bai Zhu...everyone in the hospital knows he's a big problem.

405
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:32,960
Let me finish.

406
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,300
I know he's your student and you're doing what is best for him.

407
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,690
Sit.

408
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:42,610
But, either publicly or privately, I can't afford to deal with this kind of problem.

409
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:46,430
Speaking for myself, while I may currently be the Head of Emergency,

410
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:50,450
but don't I have 'Acting' in front of that role?

411
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:53,410
In order for the hospital to remove the word 'Acting',

412
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:56,660
I need to walk on thin ice and tread carefully.

413
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:59,560
From a public perspective, it was not easy for the hospital to establish an emergency intensive care unit.

414
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,480
This has been everyone's dream for many years.

415
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,210
I have worked in Emergency for so many years. I have seen with my own eyes too many critically ill patients

416
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:10,570
that missed out on the critical period for treatment due to shortages in equipment and staff.

417
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:14,040
Now that the emergency intensive care unit has been established, we gave made up for these shortcomings,

418
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,220
and brought them the hope for survival, haven't we?

419
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,110
It was through these kinds of considerations that the hospital

420
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:20,570
decided to set up an emergency intensive care unit in your Emergency Department.

421
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:25,400
Yes, but even with that, many people in the hospital were against it.

422
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,430
They felt as though the emergency ICU was a repeated investment to the ICU,

423
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:31,470
which spent a massive amount of money and squeezed their budgets.

424
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,850
That is why, at the hospital general meeting,

425
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:36,760
I took a soldier's vow to you and all the hospital staff,

426
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:42,020
that, if there were any issues coming out of the emergency ICU or if it wasn't operating effectively, we would shut ourselves down.

427
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:47,060
This past year, I have exerted all my efforts. I cannot allow any trouble to happen.

428
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,820
Today, if you force Bai Zhu to transfer to our Emergency Department,

429
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:54,290
I fear that I won't be able to control him and he'll bring disaster to our Emergency Department.

430
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:58,360
I can understand everything that you've said. But you need to trust me.

431
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:02,380
I had to think long and hard before deciding on transferring Bai Zhu to the Emergency Department.

432
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:06,360
Someone with as much potential as Bai Zhu needs their abilities refined.

433
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,270
Since the ICU needs to develop further, they need a talented person like him.

434
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:13,470
- B-but-
- No buts.

435
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:17,760
Just listen to me. I can make a bet with you.

436
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,100
Perhaps after a few months, I want to transfer Bai Zhu away from your Emergency Department.

437
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,790
You won't be happy. Really.

438
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:27,530
Dean. Dean, I-

439
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:30,520
Please.

440
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,620

<i>[Tongshan Hospital]<i></i></i>

442

00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,260
<i>(chatter)</i>

444
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:52,090
Dr Bai,  coming to work?

445
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:00,270
The Top Blade of Cardiac Surgery has come to our emergency department.

446
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:02,450
Welcome.

447
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:04,410
Didn't they get you ready for it?

448
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:07,090
I'm ready, I didn't go.

449
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:08,460
Why don't you rest a bit.  I'll help you grind it.

450
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,600
If you grind it will I be able to drink it?

451
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,840
You sound annoyed.

452
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,570
Okay, you just wait and watch me become a laughingstock.

453
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:18,010
Besides I won't be able to stay here for more than a few days.

454
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:20,630
You just got here and you're only staying a few days?

455
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:24,190
It wasn't easy for us to get an office.  Are you unhappy?

456
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,590
I'll introduce you to our emergency department people.

457
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:28,220
No need.  I don't want to know them.

458
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:31,510
No need to introduce Madam Lu. You know Xiao Yan already.

459
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:34,370
You've also met Chen Zhi, the intern that I'm leading.

460
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:38,980
Tang Hua is also a resident doctor. She's the one that said you were impolite that day.

461
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:43,610
She really looks down on you because of your feelings of superiority and the way you grind your own coffee.

462
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:46,220
You gave me this label, didn't you?

463
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:51,280
Also, there's Head Nurse Jiang Shan. She's our chief administrator in the emergency department.

464
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,260
She's particular serious in anything she does.

465
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,890
Yiran.

466
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:57,270
Director,

467
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:59,570
Go take a look at the paitent in No.8 bed.

468
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:01,510
Okay, I'm coming.

469
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:04,070
Have a good chat.

470
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:11,690
Bai Zhu, I know you don't want to come to the Emergency Department.

471
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:15,880
But I want to tell you that since you're already here, you should work hard.

472
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,560
Director, you should know

473
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,030
that I came to the emergency department under the Dean's expedient measure.

474
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:24,220
It won't take long before i'm transferred back to Cardiac Surgery.

475
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:28,620
So it's best that we coexist peacefully now without provoking each other.

476
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:32,670
Don't be angry. Your Emergency ICU will be officially launched this afternoon.

477
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,900
Anger affects your work.

478
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:39,740
It may even inpede your great future in getting promoted and rich. Isn't that right?

479
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,320
What do you mean by this?

480
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,820
Getting promoted and rich is a legitimate pursuit.

481
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,830
There's nothing too embarrassing to say.

482
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,280
Everyday you say 'Safety First'

483
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,800
isn't it just because you're worried something will happen and affect your ability to obtain tenure?

484
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,060
You can't be reasoned with.

485
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,040
The patient has abdominal pain. When he came, he had frequent diarrheas, low blood pressure, and the body temperature was 39.1 centigrade.

486
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:11,330
Routine blood and stool tests were done. White blood cells are a little too high.

487
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:15,420
It shouldn't be a common diarrhea. Could it be food poisoning?

488
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:18,490
- Doesn't look it.
- Doctor, how is the child's condition?

489
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:28,060
Let me check.

490
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,300
This situation doesn't look optimistic.

491
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,600
Doctor, what kind of disease is this?

492
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,180
There's a lot of ecchymosis. Could it be viral dysentery?

493
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:41,440
The routine stool test is normal. It doesn't appear to be severe bacillary dysentery.

494
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,630
It's meningococcal meningitis.

495
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,120
Is this disease treatable?

496
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,270
Don't worry. It's not difficult to treat.

497
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:51,470
Little Friend, does your head hurt?

498
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:54,740
My head doesn't hurt, my stomach hurts.

499
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:57,140
The patient doesn't have obvious vomiting and headache.

500
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,550
There is no stiffness in the neck. It shouldn't be meningococcal meningitis.

501
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,870
That's right. Meningococcal meningitis doesn't cause diarrhea.

502
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:04,190
To determine if it is or isn't, let's draw blood from the ecchymosis

503
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:07,020
and do a bacterial smear. We should find out then.

504
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,080
The test result is out.

505
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,670
- How is it?
- It's meningococcal meningitis.

506
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:31,610
Doctor, please hurry and treat it.

507
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:34,250
Patient's family, meningococcal meningitis must be transferred to the infectious disease department.

508
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:36,590
You all can wait here and I will go contact them for you.

509
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:38,570
Okay.

510
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:44,010
It's meningococcal meningitis, so why did it cause diarrhea?

511
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:46,670
He has meningitis complications in Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome.

512
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,920
The latter can cause intestinal mucosal bleeding,

513
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:52,020
and irritation of the intestines, leading to abdominal pain and diarrhea.

514
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:55,810
If I weren't there just now, what would you guys have done?

515
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,690
I just remembered.

516
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:02,850
It could be because Dr. Xiao just returned to the country,

517
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:06,730
you haven't acclimatized to the local living?

518
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:16,940
No matter how good a doctor is, I don't think he can guarantee a 100% rate of correct diagnosis.

519
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:20,350
However, when doctors in the department work together,

520
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:23,120
the misdiagnosis rate can be minimized.

521
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:28,100
Well said, Dr. Xiao. It is the collective strength of teamwork.

522
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,520
It turns out that my performance just now is working together to getâ€”

523
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,230
Okay, everyone finish their work.

524
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:38,170
In a while, anyone who is not on shift duty will go to the front entrance for the launching ceremony. Okay?

525
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,320
I've heard it.

526
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:53,050
You showed off superb medical skills in front of a returnee from abroad. Happy now?

527
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:54,870
Are you satisfied?

528
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,770
Don't hold back.

529
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:13,450
Dr. Xiao, it would have been better if you were the one to diagnose meningococcal meningitis.

530
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:17,580
Isn't it most important for the patient to receive the most timely and effective treatment?

531
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:22,510
That's true, but I just can't stand Bai Zhu's arrogance.

532
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:27,460
Do you know why he voluntarily went to treat that patient?

533
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,770
It's his job.

534
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:34,610
This matter is related to you.

535
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,950
With such a giant baby personality,

536
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:40,570
His biggest wish is to attract everyone's attention

537
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:43,090
to satisfy his lack of security.

538
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:45,800
But when you come, everyone's attention is on you.

539
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,560
No one is paying attention to him. You stole all of his limelight.

540
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,600
Of course he is unhappy.

541
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,780
Him doing this is just to make everyone see

542
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,680
that his medical skills are far more superior than yours.

543
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:01,150
Dr. Tang.

544
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,700
Are you especially not busy?

Okay, everyone look my way, look my way.

549

3, 2, 1.

00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,050
Okay, that's good.

551
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:33,740
Okay, good, good.

552
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,650
Everyone get back to work.

553
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,690
How is the preparation?

554
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:41,430
All the patients have been transferred over. Everything is going smoothly.

555
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:43,210
It's business as usual. You can rest assured.

556
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:45,650
It's not good to be business as usual.

557
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:49,520
New things have their own uniqueness and operational process.

558
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,140
I will definitely explore gradually.

559
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:54,010
You can perfect it, but no need to explore.

560
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:56,160
- Dr. Xiao?
- Yes.
- Come here.

561
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,780
Thank you.

562
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,560
I asked Dr. Xiao to submit a guideline for the operation of emergency and emergency ICU.

563
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,950
I've viewed it. It's quite good. The medical administrative office will print and distribute to all of you today.

564
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:11,250
Live and learn. New things must be handled in new ways.

565
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:14,940
Okay. When I receive the document, I will definitely study it diligently.

566
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:20,790
We invited Dr. Xiao here, it's not only to add an excellent doctor in the emergency department.

567
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:25,820
The Lausanne Universitiy Hospital has an outstanding achievement in emergency medicine.

568
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:29,230
Dr. Xiao also has experience in Rescue Without Borders.

569
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:32,290
You must make good use of her.

570
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:36,210
You'll have to work hard to advise our department in the future.

571
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:39,130
I'd like to bother you two to come with me this way.

572
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:45,910
Director, I think

573
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:49,880
the traffic flow is poorly designed here.

574
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,810
Think about it. If there is an emergency patient in the car,

575
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:56,710
will they have the time or patience to circle around?

576
00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:00,130
To a patients with sudden cardiac arrest or major bleeding,

577
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:04,060
circling once around can mean the difference between life and death.
