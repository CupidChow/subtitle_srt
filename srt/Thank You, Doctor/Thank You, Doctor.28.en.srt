4
00:01:54,679 --> 00:01:55,679
Giving shoes to a woman...

5
00:01:55,679 --> 00:01:57,199
means you want her to leave you.

6
00:01:57,559 --> 00:01:59,559
The woman will run away after putting on the shoes.

7
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:09,799
It's been a long night.

8
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:10,840
Have some coffee.

9
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,120
Thank you.

10
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:34,919
Ma Hui Zhen.

11
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,000
Ma Hui Zhen!

12
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,160
Ma Hui Zhen!

13
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,720
What's going on?

14
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,120
She convulsed out of nowhere.

15
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,880
This won't do. Give her a shot of stabilizer.

16
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,000
Okay.

17
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:00,919
Keep an eye on her.

18
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,759
- Call us if you need anything. - Okay.

19
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,639
That's what happened to her in the car.

20
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,359
That's how we got into the accident.

21
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,639
In addition to Ding Xiao Ying's obvious head trauma,

22
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,960
according to the CT scan,

23
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,519
there's a small hemorrhage in the brain.

24
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,639
There's not much bleeding.

25
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,799
Operation is not needed.

26
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:22,479
We'll have to wait and observe.

27
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,000
Then could Ma Hui Zhen's convulsions...

28
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,799
be a result of the car accident?

29
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,120
Her convulsions caused the accident.

30
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,799
The accident didn't cause the convulsions.

31
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,880
Facial twitches...

32
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,519
And loss of speech...

33
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:35,239
Why do you ask so many questions?

34
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:37,879
Why don't you let Dr. Xu show you?

35
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,119
Sudden spasms...

36
00:04:41,799 --> 00:04:43,600
- It could be a stroke. - Dr. Xiao.

37
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:45,520
The test results are out.

38
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,999
Urinalysis and blood routine are normal.

39
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:54,080
What about the urine pregnancy test?

40
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,479
Negative.

41
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:56,479
No pregnancy.

42
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,679
It's only 99 percent accurate.

43
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,770
It's not absolute.

44
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,879
Do a blood pregnancy test for.

45
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:03,330
And another MRI...

46
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,679
to rule out brain problems.

47
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,400
And rule out stroke.

48
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,520
Okay.

49
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:17,039
All right.

50
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,679
It's good that it wasn't serious.

51
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,600
I was so scared when I got a call from the hospital.

52
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:21,999
Yes.

53
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,359
Why did you suddenly get into an accident?

54
00:05:25,239 --> 00:05:26,600
Dr. Xu, Dr. Tang.

55
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,770
The patient's family is here.

56
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:29,799
Doctor, I'm the patient's husband.

57
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,160
This is my dad.

58
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,280
Doctor.

59
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,679
Will her injury...

60
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:35,359
will affect her from getting pregnant...

61
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,840
in her future?

62
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:38,559
The patient only fractured her right forearm.

63
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:39,999
It has nothing to do with pregnancy.

64
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:41,919
- But... - But what?

65
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:43,770
But we just found out...

66
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,400
that the patient is having abnormal seizures.

67
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:46,960
Abnormal seizures?

68
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,359
What's wrong?

69
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,080
I don't know what happened.

70
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:54,520
I couldn't control...

71
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:56,760
my arms and legs all of a sudden.

72
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:58,919
Doctor.

73
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:00,600
What's wrong with her?

74
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:02,559
We need to run some tests to be sure.

75
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:03,960
There are many possibilities.

76
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,720
It could be a stroke...

77
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,160
or a pregnancy.

78
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,280
Impossible.

79
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,520
Why not?

80
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,960
Doctor.

81
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:12,039
She's pregnant?

82
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,320
That's not what I meant.

83
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,320
I'm just saying pregnancy can cause abnormal seizures.

84
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,160
Didn't she have seizures?

85
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,600
That means she's pregnant.

86
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,039
- That's great. - Dad.

87
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,679
Let the doctor finish.

88
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,439
It's like this.

89
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,359
The urine test shows that she's not pregnant.

90
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,080
We need to run a blood test...

91
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:29,200
to be sure.

92
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,840
Draw some blood.

93
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,760
- What's going on? - Hui Zhen.

94
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,919
- It's happening again. - Put your hand on her.

95
00:06:37,239 --> 00:06:38,280
Hui Zhen.

96
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:40,479
- Hui Zhen. - Hui Zhen.

97
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,679
Hui Zhen.

98
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,640
Hui Zhen.

99
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:47,160
Doctor, she...

100
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:48,479
What's wrong with her?

101
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,239
Let's wait for the blood test results.

102
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:52,999
We also need to make an appointment for an MRI...

103
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:54,039
to check her brain.

104
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,359
A brain scan?

105
00:06:55,359 --> 00:06:56,879
Is her condition that serious?

106
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,200
Dad.

107
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,999
Don't worry too much.

108
00:06:59,999 --> 00:07:01,200
Let's listen to the doctor.

109
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,720
Schedule her an MRI scan tomorrow morning.

110
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:05,879
Tonight,

111
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,200
we'll give you another shot of stabilizer.

112
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,280
Have a good sleep.

113
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,679
Thank you.

114
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,799
Thank you, doctor.

115
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,520
- Draw her blood. - Okay.

116
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,640
Thank you, doctor.

117
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:17,160
Thank you.

118
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,760
Hui Zhen.

119
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,520
Do you know how this happened?

120
00:07:24,799 --> 00:07:26,720
It's fatigue.

121
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,320
Listen to me.

122
00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:30,479
After you're discharged, don't drive the taxi anymore.

123
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,160
Find an easier job.

124
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,039
- Okay? - Yes.

125
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:35,760
Quit this job.

126
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,879
You don't earn much anyway.

127
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,799
And you don't come home at night.

128
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,119
Why are you still doing it?

129
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:43,520
Dad.

130
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:51,760
I quite like this job.

131
00:07:52,119 --> 00:07:53,799
Okay, I know.

132
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,999
I know.

133
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,840
You're already like this.

134
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,160
You still want the job?

135
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,479
Dad.

136
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:01,080
Listen.

137
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:02,760
When Hui Zhen gets discharged and recovers,

138
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,320
I'll talk to her.

139
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:09,720
Take care of yourself first.

140
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:24,919
Do you want more?

141
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:26,479
Okay.

142
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:29,799
Doctor.

143
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,239
The MRI results are out.

144
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:35,359
There's nothing wrong with her brain.

145
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:36,439
It's not a stroke.

146
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:38,679
The blood test shows...

147
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,200
that the patient isn't pregnant either.

148
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,400
Doctor.

149
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:45,080
Can you confirm...

150
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:46,479
what illness my wife has?

151
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:49,280
We have to do some more tests.

152
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,879
Because a lot of illnesses can cause those symptoms.

153
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,560
For example, Huntington's disease.

154
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,200
Hunting...

155
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,720
Doctor, what kind of disease is it?

156
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,119
Huntington's disease...

157
00:09:01,119 --> 00:09:02,879
is a neurodegenerative disease.

158
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,479
It often occurs in middle age...

159
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,600
as dance-like movements.

160
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,560
When it gets worse,

161
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,999
you'll have convulsions,

162
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,279
just like what happened to you.

163
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:14,879
Is my wife's illness...

164
00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:16,119
very serious?

165
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,720
Here's the thing.

166
00:09:19,119 --> 00:09:20,879
If the disease is not treated now,

167
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,519
the patient will gradually lose...

168
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,960
the ability to talk, move, think, and swallow.

169
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,239
It will mostly continue to develop...

170
00:09:28,239 --> 00:09:29,359
for 10 to 20 years...

171
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,639
and eventually lead to the patient's death.

172
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,159
But don't be nervous.

173
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,159
It's a very, very rare disease.

174
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,810
We're just trying to rule out this possibility.

175
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:43,050
Dad, you...

176
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:45,200
Get Hui Zhen a glass of water.

177
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,200
Okay.

178
00:09:47,359 --> 00:09:48,359
Hui Zhen.

179
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:50,050
It's okay. I'm here.

180
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,239
I don't think we'd be that unlucky.

181
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,600
It's okay. Drink some water.

182
00:09:58,479 --> 00:10:00,639
- Honey, it's happening again. - It's okay, Hui Zhen.

183
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:01,639
Hold me! Hold me, honey.

184
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:03,600
Hui Zhen, it's okay. Calm down.

185
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,320
No need to rush.

186
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,600
If her illness can't be cured,

187
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,050
how will she live in the future?

188
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,519
Honey.

189
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,200
Send Dad home first.

190
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,200
Okay.

191
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,279
Dad.

192
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,320
Give her some stabilizer.

193
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:18,810
Okay.

194
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,399
Thank you.

195
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,720
Don't mention it.

196
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:26,930
Get some rest.

197
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:47,690
I'm sorry.

198
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:49,159
I bothered you.

199
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:52,600
This illness of mine...

200
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:54,960
You'll get better.

201
00:10:57,119 --> 00:10:58,200
I think...

202
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,720
your husband treats you well.

203
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:04,119
My husband does treat me well.

204
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,840
He's usually...

205
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:07,239
quite good to me.

206
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,050
It's just that...

207
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,159
Let's not talk about them.

208
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:13,960
Miss, let's talk about you.

209
00:11:14,119 --> 00:11:15,560
Do you have a boyfriend?

210
00:11:18,359 --> 00:11:19,359
No.

211
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,519
I'm alone.

212
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,519
Why don't you find a boyfriend?

213
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,440
Too busy with work?

214
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,119
I'm still young.

215
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,680
I want to hustle for a few more years.

216
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,560
It's good to work hard.

217
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,999
You should hold on tight when you meet the right one.

218
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,080
Miss, what's wrong?

219
00:11:53,239 --> 00:11:54,879
My eyes suddenly hurt.

220
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,040
I'll call the doctor for you.

221
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,119
I'm fine.

222
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:00,600
Maybe I didn't sleep well.

223
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:03,440
It's all my fault.

224
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:04,960
I'm really fine.

225
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,080
It's not that serious.

226
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,840
The doctor will observe me for the night.

227
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,159
I'll be fine after some rest.

228
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,279
All right.

229
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,920
Get some rest then.

230
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:15,800
I'm fine.

231
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,359
Sudden irritability.

232
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,759
It really looks like Huntington's disease.

233
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:26,279
Why don't we give her some medicine?

234
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,759
The patient hasn't been diagnosed yet.

235
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,920
Giving her valproic acid...

236
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,399
will ruin her liver.

237
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,440
But her condition is progressing rapidly.

238
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,279
The frequency of abnormal seizures is also getting higher.

239
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,800
If it really is Huntington's disease,

240
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,080
I don't think it would progress that fast.

241
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:43,359
Then what could it be?

242
00:12:43,999 --> 00:12:44,999
Don't come near me!

243
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:46,040
- Watch out. - Call my husband!

244
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,279
Hui Zhen, I'm here.

245
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:49,200
Put the syringe down first.

246
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,560
I don't know you. Liar!

247
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,200
- What's wrong? - The patient seems confused.

248
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,399
Who's confused?

249
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:54,720
I want to see my husband!

250
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:55,879
I want to see my husband!

251
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,680
Hui Zhen, listen to me. Listen to my voice.

252
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:59,239
Hui Zhen, I'm your husband.

253
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:01,239
Listen to my voice.

254
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,999
You're not my husband!

255
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:04,879
- Calm down. - Calm down.

256
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:06,560
- Liar! - Calm down.

257
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,960
I want my husband!

258
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:11,159
- Give her a shot of diazepam! - Okay.

259
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,279
- Let go. - Doctor.

260
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:13,600
What's wrong with my wife?

261
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,639
I need to see my husband!

262
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,960
Huntington's disease results...

263
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,119
came back negative.

264
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,399
But everything she's doing...

265
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,560
is consistent with Huntington's disease.

266
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,879
Abnormal convulsions and nervous disorder.

267
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,999
Not bad.

268
00:13:25,999 --> 00:13:27,119
You're good at memorizing.

269
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,119
But if illnesses can be diagnosed by just memorization,

270
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:31,279
you'd already be a miracle doctor.

271
00:13:32,119 --> 00:13:33,159
So for now,

272
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:34,960
it's good news for the patient.

273
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,359
That's right.

274
00:13:36,359 --> 00:13:37,440
But the bad news is...

275
00:13:37,479 --> 00:13:39,519
you'll have to scratch your heads to find the cause.

276
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,320
Dr. Bai.

277
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,119
It's time to show your abilities.

278
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,960
Given the patient's age,

279
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,759
it's impossible for her to develop a mental illness on her own.

280
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:50,680
She has no family history of this either.

281
00:13:52,239 --> 00:13:53,320
What does she do for a living?

282
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,080
She's a night taxi driver.

283
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,960
She also works part-time at a supermarket.

284
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,479
Her family said that when she's off-duty,

285
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,920
she runs a stall to sell some handicrafts.

286
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:05,239
She has so much energy...

287
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,800
for a night taxi driver.

288
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,840
What do you mean?

289
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:15,080
You must have eaten something you shouldn't have.

290
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,320
Something she shouldn't have?

291
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,639
You'll have to ask your wife.

292
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,040
What did you eat?

293
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,119
What did you eat?

294
00:14:22,239 --> 00:14:23,560
Tell the doctor now.

295
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,879
Doctor.

296
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,159
What does this have to do with her illness?

297
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:29,560
Here's the thing.

298
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,119
We suspect that she has taken some medication...

299
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:33,920
to keep herself energized.

300
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,680
The medication...

301
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,040
is probably what causes her symptoms.

302
00:14:37,479 --> 00:14:38,759
Tell them.

303
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,040
Dad.

304
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:41,440
It can't be.

305
00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:43,879
I only took a smart drug.

306
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,560
What's a smart drug?

307
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,159
The smart drug is a central nervous system stimulant drug.

308
00:14:50,119 --> 00:14:51,960
But the side effects of ingestion are very severe.

309
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,759
If a healthy person takes it over a long period,

310
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:55,119
not only does it not improve concentration.

311
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,600
It will also become rather addictive.

312
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,720
It's addictive?

313
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,759
Yes.

314
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,720
Why did you take it?

315
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,440
It must be tiring as a night taxi driver.

316
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,359
I...

317
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,759
I wasn't feeling well a while ago.

318
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,479
I had no energy all day.

319
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,840
I was worried that I might get into an accident...

320
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,200
when I was driving,

321
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,840
so I asked my colleague for a few pills.

322
00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:21,119
I tried it, and it worked.

323
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,440
Hui Zhen.

324
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:23,840
When you get better,

325
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,840
quit this job no matter what.

326
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,320
Doctor.

327
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,560
Does the drug have anything to do with this illness?

328
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,119
Overdose of smart drugs...

329
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:34,359
would explain the symptoms you're having.

330
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,440
Abnormal seizures and a nervous disorder.

331
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:38,399
But I haven't had it many times.

332
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:40,639
Everyone's tolerance to it is different.

333
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,399
You took one before the accident, didn't you?

334
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,560
Just one.

335
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,960
How about this?

336
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,560
Let her stay in the hospital for observation.

337
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:51,639
If they are indeed side effects of a smart drug,

338
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:53,800
these symptoms will go away...

339
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:55,239
as long as you don't eat it.

340
00:15:55,359 --> 00:15:56,519
Don't ever take it again.

341
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,440
Once you're addicted, it's hard to quit.

342
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:00,639
- Call us if you need anything. - All right.

343
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,560
- Thank you, doctor - Thank you.

344
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,440
Why did you take that?

345
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,560
Hui Zhen.

346
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,320
You were fine. Why did you take those pills?

347
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,440
No wonder you're like this.

348
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,119
I think...

349
00:16:12,119 --> 00:16:14,440
it's definitely because you took those things.

350
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,680
Dad.

351
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,879
Hui Zhen also did it because of work.

352
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:19,040
Well, it's a lousy job.

353
00:16:19,999 --> 00:16:21,560
It doesn't even pay much.

354
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:23,600
What's so good about it?

355
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,840
Hui Zhen.

356
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,960
Dad is right.

357
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,800
Let's quit this job.

358
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:35,999
All right. Don't be angry. Have a good rest.

359
00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:37,800
Have a good rest.

360
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,040
We'll talk later.

361
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,399
Dr. Xiao.

362
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,960
Please take a look at the patient.

363
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,320
Don't panic. The doctor will be here soon.

364
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,320
What's going on?

365
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,159
Doctor, I can't see anything.

366
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:50,560
It's okay. Don't panic.

367
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,720
Lie down.

368
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,159
Contact the ophthalmologist for an eye exam.

369
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,920
I hope nothing happens to her.

370
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:02,239
She's an orphan...

371
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,999
and has no family or friends.

372
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,879
If her eyesight worsens,

373
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:07,479
how is she going to live?

374
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,920
The examination just now didn't look good.

375
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:15,999
- Hello. - Hello, Dr. Xiao.

376
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:17,479
The test results are out.

377
00:17:17,879 --> 00:17:19,200
Ding Xiao Ying has intraocular hemorrhage.

378
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:20,359
Both her corneas have ruptured.

379
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,840
Though she has a sense of light, she's almost blind.

380
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,119
There's a need for corneal suturing.

381
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,560
Does that mean...

382
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,800
I can't see anymore?

383
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:32,879
Your current injury...

384
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:34,520
caused the corneal suturing to be ineffective.

385
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,719
But if a suitable cornea can be found in the future,

386
00:17:37,719 --> 00:17:39,840
you can still see again through transplantation.

387
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,840
I heard corneas...

388
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:42,959
are hard to find.

389
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,040
There's high demand and low supply.

390
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,639
And you have to wait for a long time.

391
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:47,520
Dad, why are you saying this?

392
00:17:47,879 --> 00:17:50,320
I'm just saying. It's the truth.

393
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,119
Sir.

394
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:54,010
Don't talk nonsense if you don't know anything.

395
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,359
Who doesn't know anything?

396
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,280
It's all over the news.

397
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,250
Doctor.

398
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,560
Is that so?

399
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,199
No, don't listen to him.

400
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:06,840
How could you say that?

401
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,719
- Who's talking nonsense? - Dad.

402
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,639
- I... - Stop it.

403
00:18:10,639 --> 00:18:11,800
No.

404
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,919
I'm just worried for the girl.

405
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,199
- Dad. I'm sorry. - You...

406
00:18:16,199 --> 00:18:17,770
Dad, you should go home and cook.

407
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,639
Why can't he read the room?

408
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,560
I'm sorry.

409
00:18:23,639 --> 00:18:24,679
Doctor.

410
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,770
Is he telling the truth?

411
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,639
For people waiting for corneal transplants,

412
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:30,919
the number of corneal donors...

413
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,280
is indeed low.

414
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:33,840
But we'll do our best...

415
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,490
to find a suitable cornea for you...

416
00:18:35,639 --> 00:18:37,040
and help you see again.

417
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,119
Thank you.

418
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,010
In your condition,

419
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,520
you need someone to take care of you.

420
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,520
I don't have anyone.

421
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:50,080
I have some money.

422
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:51,840
Please find me a caregiver.

423
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:54,359
You'll also have to stay here a little longer.

424
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,719
The cost for a caregiver in the EICU is a lot.

425
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,119
If it's going to the bathroom or getting food,

426
00:19:00,199 --> 00:19:01,770
we nurses can help you.

427
00:19:01,879 --> 00:19:03,359
Yes, I can help you.

428
00:19:03,719 --> 00:19:05,359
No, thank you.

429
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:07,800
You work so hard every day.

430
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,600
There are so many people to take care of.

431
00:19:09,639 --> 00:19:11,280
I can't trouble you.

432
00:19:11,879 --> 00:19:14,010
Besides, I have enough money saved up.

433
00:19:14,639 --> 00:19:16,250
I work so hard...

434
00:19:16,399 --> 00:19:18,080
thinking that one day,

435
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,280
if I got sick,

436
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,800
I would have enough money...

437
00:19:20,879 --> 00:19:22,159
to find someone to take care of me.

438
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,399
I did it.

439
00:19:24,639 --> 00:19:25,770
Doctor.

440
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:29,159
Miss, I'll pay for the caregiver.

441
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,250
If it weren't for me,

442
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,119
you wouldn't be suffering like this.

443
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,359
There's really no need.

444
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,560
Thank you.

445
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,560
You didn't do it on purpose.

446
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:41,359
Besides, didn't you say it?

447
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,879
Your company will pay for it.

448
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:45,119
- Miss... - There's really no need.

449
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,320
I really thank you.

450
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,560
And thank you all.

451
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,320
But...

452
00:19:53,719 --> 00:19:55,399
I really don't want to trouble you.

453
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,080
Okay.

454
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,080
In that case,

455
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,679
I'll respect your decision.

456
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,359
If you need anything, just let us know.

457
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:04,520
Then...

458
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,800
please find me a reliable caregiver.

459
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:08,359
Thank you.

460
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:09,520
Don't worry.

461
00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:11,490
I'll find you the most reliable one.

462
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:13,719
Thank you.

463
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,080
Get some rest.

464
00:20:57,639 --> 00:20:59,439
Poor girl.

465
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,119
When she said she works so hard just in case that one day...

466
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:03,719
she could find someone to take care of her,

467
00:21:03,719 --> 00:21:04,800
my heart broke into pieces.

468
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:06,250
I know.

469
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:07,490
We wanted to help her...

470
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,520
but she said she didn't want to trouble us.

471
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,159
She's such a good girl that it hurts.

472
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,840
Life isn't easy.

473
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,320
And she's all alone.

474
00:21:15,719 --> 00:21:17,490
She has no one to take care of her after the accident.

475
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:18,919
It's even more difficult for her.

476
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,600
We'll do as much as we can...

477
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,639
and help her.

478
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,399
She should find a boyfriend.

479
00:21:28,399 --> 00:21:30,250
At least there's someone to keep her company and share her burden.

480
00:21:30,439 --> 00:21:32,040
Instead of relying on others, it's better to rely on yourself.

481
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,919
Becoming stronger on your own is the right way.

482
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,359
You can't ask everyone to be like you.

483
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,040
If you don't mind,

484
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,080
I suggest you introduce Chen Zhi to her.

485
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:41,639
I'll thank you.

486
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,439
I don't want him to stick to me all the time.

487
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:45,399
I hate this kind of clingy person.

488
00:21:45,399 --> 00:21:47,040
Chen Zhi falling in love with you...

489
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,040
means seven years of bad luck for you.

490
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:51,119
Who has seven years of bad luck?

491
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,010
You're a man.

492
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:56,439
Don't pry.

493
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,159
Why don't we sit over there?

494
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:10,560
You go.

495
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,719
The more the merrier.

496
00:22:12,719 --> 00:22:13,919
Because there are women?

497
00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:17,800
Women aren't human?

498
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:20,119
Tang Hua would be mad at you if she hears.

499
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,320
Lately, you and Xiao Yan have been acting strange.

500
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,600
What is?

501
00:22:28,199 --> 00:22:29,480
I prefer places that are not crowded.

502
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,679
The air is better.

503
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,080
How is the young man who had the accident?

504
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:36,760
He's still in a coma.

505
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,439
Do you think he's a pervert who attacks women?

506
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,959
There are only patients in the hospital,

507
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,119
no perverts.

508
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:43,240
Hurry up and eat.

509
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,879
She's asleep?

510
00:22:47,879 --> 00:22:49,040
Yes, she's asleep.

511
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:50,520
I brought her food.

512
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,919
Feed her when she wakes up.

513
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,679
Also about the caregiver,

514
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,800
tell her not to worry.

515
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,879
I'm finding one for her.

516
00:22:55,879 --> 00:22:56,919
Okay.

517
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,959
Dr. Tang.

518
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,240
Yes?

519
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,000
I want to ask you for a favor.

520
00:23:10,719 --> 00:23:11,760
What is it?

521
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,919
Will this car accident...

522
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,840
affect me...

523
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,679
from getting pregnant and having a baby?

524
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,520
No, don't worry.

525
00:23:19,639 --> 00:23:21,119
You only suffered external injuries.

526
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,800
Not even if I take the smart drugs?

527
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,560
According to some studies,

528
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,919
the prolonged use of smart drugs...

529
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,520
will affect the development of the baby's nerves.

530
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,320
But everything be fine once you stop using it.

531
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,280
Besides, you didn't even take a lot of it.

532
00:23:35,399 --> 00:23:36,560
You're going to be okay.

533
00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:41,800
Here's the thing.

534
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,159
I want...

535
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:46,280
to ask you to talk to my husband and father-in-law.

536
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:48,119
Because of this accident,

537
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,080
my uterus has been damaged and I can't get pregnant...

538
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,679
or something along the lines.

539
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,919
What do you think?

540
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,719
Do you want me...

541
00:23:56,719 --> 00:23:58,280
to lie to them for you?

542
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,919
Please, Dr. Tang.

543
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,919
I really don't want to have children.

544
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,560
You don't want to have children?

545
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,679
Just tell them directly.

546
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,639
How?

547
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,919
My father-in-law wants a grandchild.

548
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,560
Although my husband doesn't say it,

549
00:24:17,399 --> 00:24:18,439
I know...

550
00:24:18,439 --> 00:24:20,240
that he wants to have our baby.

551
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,919
Dr. Tang.

552
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:26,639
My husband is really good to me.

553
00:24:26,719 --> 00:24:28,560
I don't know how to tell him.

554
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,040
You don't want to disappoint your family...

555
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,119
but you don't want to have a baby.

556
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,560
So you want to use this accident as an excuse?

557
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,639
Yes.

558
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,159
I really don't know what else to do, Dr. Tang.

559
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,000
I'll be honest with you.

560
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,080
When I think about having children,

561
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:48,240
I'm so scared.

562
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,719
I'm scared...

563
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,000
I'm so scared that I'm shaking all over.

564
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,480
Why?

565
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,000
It's okay.

566
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:00,800
You don't have to tell me.

567
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,280
Dr. Tang.

568
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,639
I'll tell you.

569
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:06,119
But you have to keep it a secret.

570
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,719
Although I don't have your background or experience,

571
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:28,359
I deeply understand...

572
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:29,800
why you're afraid to have children.

573
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,919
Thank you, Dr. Tang.

574
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:34,040
But as a doctor,

575
00:25:34,639 --> 00:25:35,800
I can't help you.

576
00:25:36,199 --> 00:25:38,560
We doctors have our own protocol.

577
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,119
Don't you understand...

578
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:42,600
what I've been through?

579
00:25:42,879 --> 00:25:43,879
Yes.

580
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,280
I do.

581
00:25:46,199 --> 00:25:49,199
But first, you have to tell them your difficulties.

582
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,840
You have to communicate with them.

583
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:52,359
I think they will understand.

584
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,320
Dr. Tang.

585
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,000
You're not married, are you?

586
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,719
Does it matter?

587
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,159
You won't understand since you're not married.

588
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,760
All right, Dr. Tang.

589
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:12,600
I won't put you on the spot.

590
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,480
Pretend I didn't say anything.

591
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,080
People these days need to learn to communicate better.

592
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:28,199
Are you going to talk about a patient's personal matter again?

593
00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:29,520
I just feel emotional.

594
00:26:29,639 --> 00:26:30,760
From them,

595
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,040
I've learned a lot about communication.

596
00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:34,840
It can be regarded as a preventive measure.

597
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,800
Stop talking about patients' family matters.

598
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,520
Don't let Mom Lu hear you or you'll get scolded.

599
00:26:38,879 --> 00:26:39,919
It's almost midnight.

600
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,359
Go home and get some rest.

601
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:43,000
I'm so angry that my blood pressure is rising.

602
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,119
I can't sleep at all.

603
00:26:44,719 --> 00:26:46,639
It's not safe lately. Do you need a ride?

604
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,840
With you?

605
00:26:48,199 --> 00:26:49,679
It's safer to go back on my own.

606
00:26:50,719 --> 00:26:52,639
Aren't you afraid of being robbed or molested?

607
00:26:52,639 --> 00:26:54,600
Isn't that person already under watch?

608
00:26:55,639 --> 00:26:56,639
You're right.

609
00:26:56,719 --> 00:26:58,719
Him getting out of the EICU to molest you...

610
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,159
is a bit too much.

611
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:01,719
Annoying.

612
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,199
(Chen Zhi)

613
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:15,520
Did something happen at the hospital?

614
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,800
No.

615
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:19,040
I just wanted to ask where you are.

616
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,439
I'm on my way home.

617
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,119
Are you taking a taxi?

618
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:25,159
Yes. What's the matter?

619
00:27:25,639 --> 00:27:27,040
Are you alone?

620
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:29,000
Who else could there be?

621
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,879
Take a look at the driver.

622
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:33,080
Does he look like a bad guy?

623
00:27:36,719 --> 00:27:37,760
Are you crazy?

624
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,959
If there's nothing else, I'm hanging up.

625
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:56,959
What now?

626
00:27:57,719 --> 00:27:59,959
I want to ask where you are.

627
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,480
I just hung up on you one minute ago.

628
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,280
I'm still on my way home.

629
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:06,600
Then take a good look.

630
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:08,520
Is the driver a bad person?

631
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,320
If there's nothing, I'm hanging up.

632
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,480
(Chen Zhi)

633
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:29,840
Aren't you on night duty?

634
00:28:30,199 --> 00:28:31,240
Dr. Xu.

635
00:28:31,719 --> 00:28:33,040
I've been calling Tang Hua...

636
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:34,240
but she isn't picking up.

637
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,359
Could something have happened to her?

638
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:36,679
What's wrong with you? Are you sick?

639
00:28:36,879 --> 00:28:38,080
Get back to your night shift.

640
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,439
Cranial CT scan suggests...

641
00:28:41,439 --> 00:28:43,119
the possibility of subarachnoid hemorrhage.

642
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:44,760
But no bloody cerebrospinal fluid...

643
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,760
was found in the lumbar puncture.

644
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:47,879
Is it intracranial venous sinus thrombosis?

645
00:28:48,199 --> 00:28:50,119
But the cerebrospinal fluid cell count,

646
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,480
biochemical proteins, chloride and sugar...

647
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,840
are all within the normal range.

648
00:28:58,679 --> 00:28:59,719
Hello.

649
00:28:59,719 --> 00:29:01,439
Dr. Bai, the patient in bed five is awake.

650
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:03,199
You had a ruptured spleen.

651
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,879
We've done surgery for you.

652
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,840
After a blood transfusion...

653
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,840
Doctor.

654
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:09,560
How long was I unconscious?

655
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:12,480
How is Ding Xiao Ying?

656
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,600
Who?

657
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,320
The girl who was brought here with him.

658
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:16,879
Her life isn't in danger.

659
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:19,040
But her cornea was ruptured in both eyes.

660
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,119
Sutures didn't work and she lost her sight.

661
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:22,280
How did that happen?

662
00:29:22,879 --> 00:29:24,399
Can she be cured?

663
00:29:24,719 --> 00:29:26,800
You should worry more about yourself.

664
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:28,159
Pervert.

665
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,320
She...

666
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,280
Can she be cured or not?

667
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,199
As long as we find a suitable cornea,

668
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:36,480
there's still hope for recovery.

669
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:37,959
Can I see her?

670
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,159
No.

671
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,040
Will you have any trouble finding the cornea?

672
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,119
Dr. Bai.

673
00:29:50,719 --> 00:29:51,800
How is he?

674
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,679
He just woke up. He's still a bit weak.

675
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,439
Are you Luo Guang Liang?

676
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,600
Yes.

677
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,840
You are...

678
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:00,560
We're from Tuanjie Road Police Station.

679
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,840
We suspect...

680
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,439
that you're connected to several recent attacks on women.

681
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:05,919
Please cooperate.

682
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,040
Attacks on women?

683
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,359
There's been a misunderstanding.

684
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:12,320
Do you know her?

685
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,080
Yes.

686
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,399
At 11:30pm on the night of the accident...

687
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,800
at Tuanjie West Road,

688
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,439
why were you following her?

689
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:23,080
I wasn't following her.

690
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,080
I was trying to protect her.

691
00:30:28,199 --> 00:30:29,520
I'm a cashier...

692
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,119
at a convenience store on Tuanjie Road.

693
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,639
Not far from my store...

694
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,840
is a café.

695
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:36,959
She's a server there.

696
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,760
Her café doesn't provide food,

697
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,399
so she often buys lunch at the convenience store.

698
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,280
She's very gentle when she talks.

699
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:47,040
But she doesn't seem to have many friends.

700
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,080
She's always alone.

701
00:30:49,719 --> 00:30:51,639
After she finishes her lunch at the store,

702
00:30:51,639 --> 00:30:52,719
she goes back.

703
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,439
Many people leave a lot of trash behind...

704
00:30:55,879 --> 00:30:57,480
after they finish their food.

705
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,119
But not her.

706
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,959
She would clean up after her.

707
00:31:02,639 --> 00:31:04,679
She'd even wipe the table with the wet wipes...

708
00:31:04,879 --> 00:31:06,159
that she brought along.

709
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:09,919
She...

710
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,359
is a kind and thoughtful girl.

711
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:14,959
Is that when you noticed her?

712
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:17,320
Do you like her?

713
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,919
I've never dated anyone before.

714
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,959
I guess I like her.

715
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,080
Because I'm always involuntarily...

716
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,480
thinking about her...

717
00:31:32,199 --> 00:31:33,399
and want to see her.

718
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:36,399
She gets one day off a week.

719
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,080
I would feel terrible on that day.

720
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,240
Later,

721
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,119
I noticed that in her eyes...

722
00:31:44,879 --> 00:31:46,679
is a faint sadness.

723
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:48,600
It's heartbreaking.

724
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,080
Ding Xiao Ying is an orphan.

725
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,359
I only found out...

726
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,959
after I overheard...

727
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,359
her colleagues talking.

728
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,399
Since then,

729
00:31:59,439 --> 00:32:00,679
when I knew she was coming,

730
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,840
I'd always hide the best lunch box...

731
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,159
and save it for her.

732
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,879
But she never noticed.

733
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:09,800
You can be more proactive.

734
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:11,879
She doesn't want to be bothered.

735
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,879
I've seen someone confess their love to her before.

736
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,639
It was her colleague.

737
00:32:17,719 --> 00:32:19,879
He seemed like a nice guy...

738
00:32:19,879 --> 00:32:21,119
but she rejected him.

739
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,840
I know...

740
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,560
that she doesn't want to interact with anyone at all.

741
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,959
She just wants to live in peace.

742
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,199
She's used to being alone.

743
00:32:31,439 --> 00:32:33,159
So whether it's friends...

744
00:32:33,399 --> 00:32:34,560
or a lover,

745
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,359
they are too complicated for her.

746
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,679
The best love...

747
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,240
for her...

748
00:32:46,199 --> 00:32:47,520
is not to bother her.

749
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:54,159
She gets off work late...

750
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:55,560
and lives far away.

751
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,320
When I heard about those attacks,

752
00:32:58,639 --> 00:32:59,919
I was worried for her.

753
00:33:00,199 --> 00:33:02,280
That's why I secretly followed her.

754
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:04,359
I only went home...

755
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,800
until I see her get home.

756
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,159
So you were trying to protect her.

757
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:10,840
I don't want her to know of my existence.

758
00:33:11,719 --> 00:33:12,879
But that day,

759
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,719
she still found out.

760
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,159
She thought you were a bad person.

761
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,800
That's why she called the police.

762
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:19,399
Officers.

763
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,600
Doctors.

764
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:26,480
About what I just said, please keep it a secret.

765
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,679
Don't tell her.

766
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,119
Okay?

767
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:31,760
Okay.

768
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,919
Thank you.

769
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:38,840
Thank you.

770
00:33:39,639 --> 00:33:41,919
We shouldn't have thought he was a pervert and a jerk...

771
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,240
before knowing what was going on.

772
00:33:44,879 --> 00:33:47,000
I'll apologize to him when I see him.

773
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,320
I didn't expect it to end up...

774
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:50,800
as a heart-warming love story.

775
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,520
Two orphans,

776
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:53,679
loving in loneliness.

777
00:33:53,879 --> 00:33:55,000
I understand...

778
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,840
what he said deeply.

779
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,359
If you really like someone,

780
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,639
you don't bother them.

781
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Do you understand that?

782
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,359
I do.

783
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,800
I think...

784
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,600
Hello.

785
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,359
Really?

786
00:34:08,919 --> 00:34:11,280
Why didn't you tell me you were coming to Shanghai?

787
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,800
I'm free tonight.

788
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,840
I'll get in touch with you after your meeting.

789
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,480
See you tonight.

790
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,560
Are you going out for dinner tonight?

791
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,600
It's none of your business.

792
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,240
I'll drive you there.

793
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,520
It's hard to get a taxi during rush hour.

794
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,719
There's no need.

795
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,409
I'll take the subway. Green exit.

796
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,719
Where are you going?

797
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,369
Can you get to the subway?

798
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,560
It's none of your business.

799
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,119
Can you get back to work?

800
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,279
Who are you having dinner with?

801
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,839
If it's a man,

802
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,679
you can have lunch with him...

803
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,889
Excuse me.

804
00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:44,520
Right now,

805
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,759
get out of my sight.

806
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:47,239
I think...

807
00:34:58,199 --> 00:34:59,560
He's trying to kill me.

808
00:34:59,799 --> 00:35:01,040
It's quite annoying.

809
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,369
He's a control freak.

810
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,159
He wants to control my life and my freedom.

811
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:08,279
I can't take it anymore.

812
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,279
Where are you going?

813
00:35:13,409 --> 00:35:14,889
Where are we going?

814
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,520
Don't you have dinner plans tonight?

815
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:17,929
I'm not going.

816
00:35:18,279 --> 00:35:19,839
You're not going? Good.

817
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,839
It's dangerous to go out at night.

818
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:25,639
So where are we going now?

819
00:35:26,279 --> 00:35:28,279
My mom is here. She's waiting for me.

820
00:35:28,279 --> 00:35:29,319
Your mom is here?

821
00:35:29,319 --> 00:35:30,480
Should I get changed then?

822
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,119
I need to show her the best side of me.

823
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:33,239
Chen Zhi.

824
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,159
From now on, you don't have to pretend to be my boyfriend.

825
00:35:37,929 --> 00:35:39,040
Tang Hua.

826
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:40,639
Did I do something wrong...

827
00:35:40,759 --> 00:35:41,889
to make you angry?

828
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,119
Everything you do makes me angry.

829
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:45,839
I get angry every time I see you now.

830
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,480
Tang Hua, calm down.

831
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,929
Think before you act.

832
00:35:49,929 --> 00:35:52,889
I've thought long and hard enough.

833
00:35:52,929 --> 00:35:54,759
Think about it. Your mom is here at this time.

834
00:35:54,759 --> 00:35:56,369
If you tell her about this,

835
00:35:56,409 --> 00:35:57,520
I'm sure she'll...

836
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,080
I'd rather be tortured by my mom...

837
00:35:59,319 --> 00:36:00,889
than to be tortured by you.

838
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,239
Do you get it?

839
00:36:04,409 --> 00:36:06,159
I have a patient. I have to go.

840
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,279
I really have a patient to see.

841
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,679
I really do.

842
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,080
As soon as you asked me to pick you up from work,

843
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,159
I knew what was going on.

844
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:24,239
Look.

845
00:36:24,369 --> 00:36:25,759
Chen Zhi is all shy now.

846
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,960
Mom.

847
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,000
It's not what you think.

848
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:31,199
I know.

849
00:36:31,279 --> 00:36:33,520
Grown-up men and women are bound to marry.

850
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:35,759
You two have been dating for so long.

851
00:36:35,759 --> 00:36:38,279
You should think about getting married.

852
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,369
Chen Zhi isn't my boyfriend.

853
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:41,369
Of course.

854
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,520
When you get married,

855
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,929
he'll be your husband.

856
00:36:45,279 --> 00:36:48,199
This day has finally come.

857
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:50,759
I'll be honest with you.

858
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,080
From the start, I never wanted to get married.

859
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,080
Nonsense.

860
00:36:54,319 --> 00:36:55,960
Both of you are not young anymore.

861
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,159
Why don't you get married?

862
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:00,639
It's time for you to think about getting married.

863
00:37:00,759 --> 00:37:01,929
He and I...

864
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:03,960
were never a couple.

865
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,369
It was a lie from the beginning.

866
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,319
A lie?

867
00:37:10,279 --> 00:37:11,409
What do you mean?

868
00:37:11,409 --> 00:37:13,889
You left me with no choice.

869
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:15,679
So I went to get Chen Zhi...

870
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:17,199
to pretend to be my boyfriend.

871
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:19,000
From the very beginning,

872
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,040
we were only colleagues.

873
00:37:22,759 --> 00:37:23,799
- You scared me. - You're so sneaky.

874
00:37:23,889 --> 00:37:25,409
- Dr. Xu. - What are you doing?

875
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,600
This will affect the image of EICU if our patients see.

876
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,719
Tang Hua...

877
00:37:29,759 --> 00:37:31,409
is coming clean to her mom...

878
00:37:31,409 --> 00:37:32,679
about Chen Zhi pretending to be her boyfriend.

879
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,000
That's interesting. Move.

880
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Xiao Chen.

881
00:37:36,759 --> 00:37:38,520
Is what Tang Hua said true?

882
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:40,199
What about your family background?

883
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,600
What about your parents who run an international antique business?

884
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,119
Are they all lies?

885
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:45,889
Did you make that up to deceive me?

886
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:00,319
Ma'am.

887
00:38:00,799 --> 00:38:02,799
My parents are ordinary workers.

888
00:38:03,929 --> 00:38:04,929
I'm sorry.

889
00:38:09,759 --> 00:38:12,319
You don't have to glare at me like that.

890
00:38:12,319 --> 00:38:14,600
You forced me. I have no choice.

891
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,239
That's why I did this.

892
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,639
Now that I've said it,

893
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:20,929
I feel quite relieved.

894
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:23,560
You're all grown up now.

895
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:25,369
To deceive your mom,

896
00:38:25,889 --> 00:38:28,719
you can even come up with such an idea.

897
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,000
Good.

898
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,639
So...

899
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,600
don't force me to date...

900
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,960
and get married anymore.

901
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:37,799
It's useless if you force me.

902
00:38:38,799 --> 00:38:40,480
It's tiring for both of us.

903
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:41,839
Why do so?

904
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,600
Mom.

905
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,239
Won't you say something?

906
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,480
I'm busy.

907
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,639
What are you playing on the phone?

908
00:39:10,839 --> 00:39:11,839
I'm not playing.

909
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:14,369
I need to make a call.

910
00:39:15,279 --> 00:39:17,159
Who are you calling?

911
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,040
Hello?

912
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,600
Sister?

913
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:23,080
It's me, Da Mei.

914
00:39:25,799 --> 00:39:27,839
Tang Hua is single again.

915
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,600
Who knows?

916
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,409
That's how young people date these days.

917
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,409
As if it's a game.

918
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,409
Didn't you tell me last time...

919
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,369
about the young man from a national enterprise?

920
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,119
You know, the one with the limp.

921
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:43,000
It's okay if he has a limp.

922
00:39:43,279 --> 00:39:45,639
He can still walk, right?

923
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:47,080
It's fine.

924
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,319
Besides, Tang Hua is a doctor.

925
00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:51,279
She has seen all kinds of people.

926
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:53,159
All right.

927
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:55,679
Send me his contact information.

928
00:39:55,759 --> 00:39:57,480
Thank you. Bye.

929
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,520
Bye.

930
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:01,369
Mom.

931
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:03,409
What are you doing?

932
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,679
Wait.

933
00:40:04,759 --> 00:40:06,799
Let me make a call to your third aunt.

934
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,600
I'm begging you.

935
00:40:08,799 --> 00:40:10,560
Please spare me.

936
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:12,369
Xiao Ling.

937
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,409
Tang Hua is single again.

938
00:40:14,409 --> 00:40:17,239
Didn't you say you have a distant relative...

939
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:19,239
who is a quite handsome young man?

940
00:40:20,839 --> 00:40:21,889
He's got hepatitis?

941
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:23,759
Hepatitis is fine.

942
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:25,799
Hepatitis can be cured.

943
00:40:27,799 --> 00:40:30,279
Besides, Tang Hua is a doctor.

944
00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:31,520
When the time comes,

945
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,839
she can treat him.

946
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,960
How about this?

947
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,040
You can arrange...

948
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,409
for them to meet.

949
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,679
Okay.

950
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,600
Mom.

951
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,119
Just now,

952
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,929
I was just joking with you.

953
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:45,409
Xiao Ling, I'm in the middle of something.

954
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,480
I'm hanging up.

955
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,119
What did you say?

956
00:40:50,369 --> 00:40:51,409
I said...

957
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,839
- I was... - Ma'am.

958
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,119
Tang Hua said...

959
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:56,119
she was just joking with you.

960
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,759
That means...

961
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,889
you two are dating.

962
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,279
You're not lying to me, right?

963
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,960
We're dating.

964
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:08,279
Don't bother us.

965
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,520
Since you two are dating,

966
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,839
why should I bother then?

967
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,679
Xiao Chen.

968
00:41:14,799 --> 00:41:17,000
Come over for dinner tomorrow.

969
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,369
I'll cook something delicious.

970
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,040
You have to come.

971
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:22,600
Yes, I'll be there tomorrow.

972
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Mom.

973
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,560
- Actually... - What is it?

974
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,889
You were lying to me again?

975
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:40,839
It's true that you two aren't dating.

976
00:41:40,929 --> 00:41:42,409
You know everything?

977
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,440
I'm not stupid.

978
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,560
You know about it and you still...

979
00:41:47,799 --> 00:41:50,239
Xiao Chen might not be my ideal son-in-law...

980
00:41:50,409 --> 00:41:52,319
but I'm doing this for your own good.

981
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,600
He's just doing his job.

982
00:41:57,889 --> 00:42:00,279
You already know we were pretending.

983
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,040
Let's not make a fuss.

984
00:42:02,369 --> 00:42:04,759
Xiao Chen seems to care a lot about you.

985
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,409
Even if you're pretending now,

986
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:07,759
in the future,

987
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:09,679
it might become real.

988
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,040
That's impossible.

989
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,929
Throughout my life, I've only realized one thing.

990
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,480
No matter what it is in this world,

991
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,040
nothing is impossible.

992
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,199
What are you doing here?

993
00:42:28,369 --> 00:42:30,600
What happened today was a rollercoaster.

994
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:32,199
Fortunately, it turned out well, right?

995
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:33,199
Don't worry.

996
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:34,759
I'll surely do a good job as your boyfriend.

997
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:37,929
No. I mean a fake boyfriend.

998
00:42:37,929 --> 00:42:38,929
A fake one.

999
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,440
I'll make sure that you...

1000
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,159
and your mom will not worry.

1001
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:43,560
Don't you have anything better to do?

1002
00:42:43,889 --> 00:42:45,239
Why are you always here?

1003
00:42:45,369 --> 00:42:46,560
Get out.

1004
00:42:56,929 --> 00:42:57,960
