00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,200
(Thank You, Doctor)

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,079
(Adapted from Sheng Li's novel "ICU 48 Hours")

3
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,040
(Episode 26)

4
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,159
I got it now.

5
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,760
He didn't want to spend money.

6
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,719
That's why he didn't want the surgery.

7
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,280
Yes.

8
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,719
We have to compensate the lady.

9
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,760
We have to pay for my tuition too.

10
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,840
He has no choice.

11
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,480
However,

12
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,000
he can't risk his life at this moment.

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,040
Don't worry.

14
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,000
I'll convince my dad.

15
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,040
We have to do this surgery.

16
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:07,439
Thank you, doctor.

17
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,759
I've always thought...

18
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,759
that money and life can't be treated equally.

19
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,199
Now only I know...

20
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:22,120
that this is the hardest choice...

21
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,879
for many families.

22
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,810
I've thought of a way to help her.

23
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,319
Let's go find Dr. Lu.

24
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,879
Dad, have another sip.

25
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,120
No.

26
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,919
Yun Yun.

27
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,280
Put the water aside.

28
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,560
I have something to tell you.

29
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,370
Leave it there.

30
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,680
Yun Yun.

31
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,840
Listen to me.

32
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,759
Let's not do this surgery.

33
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:52,919
Dad.

34
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,719
Let me finish.

35
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,840
As you know,

36
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,240
I've been having this chest pain...

37
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,840
for many years.

38
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,719
It has been like this since you were little.

39
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,360
Until now,

40
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,879
nothing happened, right?

41
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:13,280
The hospital doesn't want to take responsibility.

42
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,319
That's why they make it sound very serious.

43
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:20,439
They're afraid that if...

44
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,199
If something happens,

45
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,680
they can get away with it.

46
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,400
Trust me.

47
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:29,199
I know how healthy I am.

48
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:30,719
I'll be fine.

49
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,879
Tomorrow,

50
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,759
we'll ask to be discharged.

51
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,520
As for me,

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,560
I'll just focus on driving...

53
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:40,800
to earn money.

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,080
You just focus on your study and go to college.

55
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,280
Dad.

56
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,280
Stop lying to yourself.

57
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,319
I've looked up your illness online.

58
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,120
The doctor is right.

59
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,800
You have to put the stent in.

60
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,520
Dad.

61
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,039
I know you don't want to spend this money,

62
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,159
but this is to save your life.

63
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,080
What's wrong with you?

64
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:04,400
Do you believe everything you read online?

65
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,039
There are a lot of scams online.

66
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,919
You believe everything online but not your dad.

67
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,599
Look at our family situation.

68
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,159
You know that.

69
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,000
Dad hit someone.

70
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,439
We have to compensate her.

71
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,519
We can't go against our conscience.

72
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:22,439
No, you still have to go to college.

73
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,730
I can't stay in the hospital and waste money.

74
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:25,920
Dad.

75
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:28,170
You've raised me for 18 years.

76
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,120
It's my turn to take care of you now.

77
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,000
Silly child.

78
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:36,879
You're my good daughter.

79
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:39,439
If you don't take care of me when I'm old, who will?

80
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,639
Starting tomorrow, I'll take care of you.

81
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:45,279
You just treat your illness in the hospital...

82
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,319
and undergo surgery.

83
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:48,399
What...

84
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,839
What are you trying to do?

85
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:51,800
I...

86
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,439
I'll look for a part-time job and study part-time.

87
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,170
What nonsense are you talking about?

88
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,560
I'm not talking nonsense.

89
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,480
You said it yourself.

90
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,279
Given the situation of our family,

91
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:05,199
even if you drive for 48 hours a day,

92
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,000
you won't make enough money to pay them.

93
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,959
If I look for a part-time job, I can also share your burden.

94
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,319
I don't need you to help me with family matters.

95
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,170
Your task now is to get into college and study hard.

96
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,680
I know...

97
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,319
you want to become a lawyer since you were young.

98
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,050
All these years,

99
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:26,079
you've suffered so much.

100
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,920
It wasn't easy for you to get into law school.

101
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,160
No, you can't...

102
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:31,759
You have to go to school.

103
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,480
You can't be distracted from studying.

104
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,519
Dad.

105
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,680
It's okay.

106
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:36,879
I'm still young.

107
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,839
I have plenty of energy.

108
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,480
I can work and study at the same time.

109
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,920
Don't worry.

110
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:44,800
You just treat your illness in the hospital...

111
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
and undergo surgery.

112
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,360
From now on,

113
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:48,639
I'll take care of our family matters.

114
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,759
How are you going to do that?

115
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,319
You're driving me crazy.

116
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,399
I'm still alive.

117
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,959
I don't need you to worry about family matters.

118
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,480
Dad.

119
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,120
I don't have a mom anymore.

120
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,560
I can't lose you as well.

121
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:10,240
I'm begging you, all right?

122
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:13,399
Listen to me this time.

123
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:15,839
My dear daughter.

124
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,040
Yun Yun.

125
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,800
I'm sorry.

126
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,120
I'm too ashamed to face your mom when I get down there.

127
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,040
Dad.

128
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,560
Dad.

129
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,120
What did I do to deserve this?

130
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,360
Dad.

131
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,319
Sir.

132
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,000
You have a heart condition.

133
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,079
You shouldn't get so worked up.

134
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,879
I'm sorry.

135
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,920
Dad, stop crying.

136
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:52,839
I'm sorry about that.

137
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:55,120
We have good news.

138
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Good news?

139
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,680
Here's the thing.

140
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,120
There was a patient and his family...

141
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,000
worked together with our hospital...

142
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,160
to establish a medical fund...

143
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,480
dedicated to helping...

144
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,160
severely ill patients with financial trouble.

145
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:10,160
Just now, we also talked to Dr. Lu...

146
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,519
and the person in charge of the fund...

147
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,240
about the situation of your family.

148
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,759
The other party has agreed.

149
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,959
They'll pay 90 percent of your medical expenses...

150
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,160
in addition to health insurance.

151
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:20,199
That includes hospitalization fees, medical expenses,

152
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:22,439
surgery costs, and the cost of a stent.

153
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,839
You just need to pay 10 percent of it.

154
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,040
That's great.

155
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,319
Thank you.

156
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,040
Don't thank us.

157
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,040
You should thank the medical foundation.

158
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,680
They'll have someone in charge to talk to you later.

159
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,279
So?

160
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,439
Have you thought about the surgery?

161
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,360
I'll do it.

162
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
Thank you.

163
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,079
Thank you.

164
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,240
Hello.

165
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,199
Hello? You're still up?

166
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,160
Yes. Anything?

167
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:02,360
I just remembered that patient named Fang Jing Xuan.

168
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,000
The ballet dancer.

169
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,639
Has she agreed to the surgery?

170
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:09,040
I'm still working on it.

171
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:12,959
It's okay.

172
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,600
We'll cross the bridge when we come to it.

173
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,040
Don't be too anxious.

174
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,639
It's getting late.

175
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:18,680
You should get some rest.

176
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:21,720
Okay, thank you.

177
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,360
Good night.

178
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:24,959
Good night.

179
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:39,210
It's my turn.

180
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,720
These are the successful cases of burr hole craniotomy...

181
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,720
that I organized.

182
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,279
Actually, this surgery has a very high success rate.

183
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,879
I saw your CT scan.

184
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:53,090
The bleeding isn't that bad.

185
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:56,000
If we remove the hematoma in time and drain the blood,

186
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:58,039
it won't affect your performance in a month.

187
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:00,799
Can I really go to the Mariinsky Theatre to dance?

188
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,919
We'll help you keep the epidural hematoma under control.

189
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:09,039
Most people usually take a few months to recover.

190
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,679
But I trust you.

191
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,759
You're a professional dancer.

192
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:13,960
You're strong-willed.

193
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,000
After a month, you can return to the stage.

194
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:18,840
However, you have to promise me one thing.

195
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,519
Once the show is over,

196
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:22,519
you have to come back right away to cure the illness.

197
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,519
Were you bribed by my parents?

198
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,399
Did you come up with fake cases to deceive me?

199
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,159
Your family complained about me.

200
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,360
They even reported it to my chief.

201
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:32,120
Do you think I'll collude with them?

202
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,039
They did it for my own good. Please don't blame them.

203
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:36,720
I can assure you.

204
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,399
These are all real cases.

205
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,519
Then you'll have to write me an affidavit.

206
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,210
Promise me that after the surgery,

207
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,360
I'll be able to participate in the show.

208
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:46,039
All surgeries have risks.

209
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,210
I can't absolutely promise success.

210
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,639
Besides, our hospital...

211
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,759
doesn't allow us to make such promises to patients.

212
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:53,399
Then why should I believe you?

213
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:55,240
Once I'm under anesthesia,

214
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,639
I won't know anything.

215
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,360
You'll operate me however you want.

216
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,559
It'll be too late for me to regret it by then.

217
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:02,799
Let me put it this way.

218
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,360
If I wanted to lie to you,

219
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,519
I wouldn't have exposed your parents.

220
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,559
Back then, you're about to sign the agreement.

221
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,559
Even though I can't promise you anything,

222
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,210
I'll tell you anyway.

223
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,039
We respect life.

224
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,720
We respect patients' rights.

225
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,600
We respect everyone's dream even more.

226
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,360
Please believe in us.

227
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,000
Dr. Xiao.

228
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:40,879
Xuan Xuan has signed it.

229
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:42,399
Thank you.

230
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,679
Before this, I was too anxious.

231
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,399
I had some misunderstanding with Dr. Bai...

232
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:49,210
and I was rude to him.

233
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,679
How about this?

234
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,519
I'll apologize to him in person.

235
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,799
I'm sorry.

236
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:54,840
Yes.

237
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,039
If Dr. Bai hadn't come here early in the morning...

238
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,639
and explained to Xuan Xuan patiently,

239
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,200
Xuan Xuan wouldn't have agreed to the surgery so soon.

240
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:15,080
Aren't you off today?

241
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,759
Why did you come to the hospital?

242
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,799
You're so professional, just like him.

243
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,279
I wonder what he's up to.

244
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,519
Xiao Guang told me...

245
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,399
that he did some research all night yesterday.

246
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,600
He came here first thing in the morning.

247
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:30,399
I'm going to make my rounds.

248
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:25,159
The surgery was a success.

249
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,200
The epidural hematoma has been removed.

250
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,080
If nothing unusual comes up,

251
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,600
she can be discharged in a week.

252
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,360
Can I go...

253
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:35,159
to the Mariinsky Theatre?

254
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,080
Yes, you can. The doctor said you can.

255
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,480
One month before the show,

256
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,559
you have to pay more attention to rest and nutrition.

257
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,240
We'll prescribe her...

258
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,759
some anti-seizure medicine and painkillers.

259
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:46,799
Make sure she takes them.

260
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:49,679
Once the show goes well,

261
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,159
remember to come back for the surgery.

262
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:52,799
Thank you.

263
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:00,879
Hello, Dr. Xiao.

264
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,960
I'm here to visit Fang Jing Xuan.

265
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,799
I heard she just had surgery.

266
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,200
Don't worry. The surgery was a success.

267
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:07,360
That's great.

268
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,480
Can I go see her?

269
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,080
We need to ask the patient and her family first.

270
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,279
Dr. Xiao.

271
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Perfect timing.

272
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,720
Sir and ma'am.

273
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,480
I'm here to visit Fang Jing Xuan.

274
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:29,840
There's 5,000 yuan in here.

275
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:31,159
Please accept it.

276
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Sir.

277
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:41,519
All the money my dad earned over the years...

278
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,120
has been used for me to go to school.

279
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,960
We don't have much savings.

280
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:49,360
On top of that, he has been hospitalized recently.

281
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,159
This is all we can spare.

282
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:57,080
Please don't worry.

283
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,960
We'll definitely pay you back.

284
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,320
We will pay off the money...

285
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:04,519
slowly in the future.

286
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,960
Miss.

287
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,120
Take this money back.

288
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,480
We can't accept it.

289
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,919
If it weren't for this car accident,

290
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,519
we wouldn't know that Xuan Xuan has a glioma in her brain.

291
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:17,960
Isn't this a blessing in disguise?

292
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,519
Actually, this is Xuan Xuan's idea.

293
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:22,879
Before the surgery,

294
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:24,360
she found out about your family's situation.

295
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:25,759
She kept telling us...

296
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,919
not to look into your dad's fault anymore.

297
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,279
The money is for your tuition.

298
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:36,639
Thank you, sir.

299
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:38,080
Thank you, ma'am.

300
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,919
I'll take you in to see Xuan Xuan.

301
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,200
When she wakes up,

302
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,879
she's worried about you and your dad.

303
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:44,639
Let's go.

304
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:48,960
Dr. Xiao, I'll talk to you later.

305
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,840
I really want to see you on stage with my own eyes.

306
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:05,000
I believe that in a month,

307
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,480
you'll be able to stand on the stage of the Mariinsky Theatre...

308
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:08,759
and realize your dream.

309
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,320
I will.

310
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:13,759
Enough about me.

311
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:15,480
What is your dream?

312
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:18,840
I heard you're going to law school.

313
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,200
I just started last month.

314
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:23,440
In my spare time,

315
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,519
I'll also work as an intern at a law firm.

316
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,080
Working part-time?

317
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:29,000
Kind of.

318
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,799
I can also lessen my dad's burden.

319
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,480
That's amazing.

320
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:36,320
I can't let my parents hear this.

321
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:38,879
Until now, I'm still spending their money.

322
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,600
That's not true.

323
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,840
In the future, I'm sure you'll do better than me.

324
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:46,600
We'll both get better.

325
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,480
Hello, Dr. Xu.

326
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:11,799
The rice is quite salty today.

327
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,480
You know it's salty even before you eat it.

328
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,000
Tang Hua.

329
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,120
Your mixed nuts look delicious.

330
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:38,720
Hello.

331
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:41,159
He's acting suspiciously.

332
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:42,399
Who calls him?

333
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:43,720
He's just being mysterious.

334
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,320
Go ahead and eat.

335
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,320
I'm full.

336
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,480
Where's Dr. Tang?

337
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:02,279
Dr. Tang said you're trying to be mysterious.

338
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:03,320
She left.

339
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,200
Your face changes really fast.

340
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,170
You're lucky that he didn't give you a sour look.

341
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:21,279
- Hua'er, you're back. - Mom.

342
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,279
I'll put the clothing disinfectant here.

343
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:24,960
Good, you're back just in time.

344
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,960
Wash your hands and eat.

345
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:28,720
It smells so good.

346
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:30,599
What delicious food did you make?

347
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,759
There are so many dishes.

348
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,319
Are we expecting someone?

349
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,119
He's already here.

350
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:37,890
He has been busy all-day in the kitchen.

351
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,890
Who is it?

352
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,240
Why are you here?

353
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,200
Your mom called me.

354
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,799
She said she made something delicious for me.

355
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,319
She asked me to come and try it.

356
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,240
You have no idea.

357
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,680
Initially,

358
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:53,039
I wanted Chen Zhi to try my cooking.

359
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:54,319
But Chen Zhi came...

360
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,279
and made all this delicious food.

361
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:57,839
They're all your favorites.

362
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:02,079
Someone like Chen Zhi can even cook.

363
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:03,890
I think it's not easy.

364
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:07,650
He can even go to the bathroom himself.

365
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:08,759
How can you say that?

366
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,559
Ignore her. Come, sit down.

367
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,650
Let's eat.

368
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,480
Have some coconut water.

369
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,599
Thank you, ma'am.

370
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:15,920
Here, have some coconut water.

371
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,410
Ma'am, have a seat. Let's eat.

372
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:18,890
The rice is simmering.

373
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,200
I'll leave you two to talk.

374
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,799
Who told you to come?

375
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:28,240
Why didn't you tell me when my mom called you?

376
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,720
When your mom called me at noon,

377
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,410
we were eating in the cafeteria.

378
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:34,519
I was going to tell you.

379
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,480
However, after I answered the call,

380
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,650
you left.

381
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:38,890
Don't give me excuses.

382
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:40,279
I was in the department this afternoon.

383
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:41,359
Why didn't you tell me?

384
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:43,359
I forgot.

385
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:44,440
You forgot?

386
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,799
I think you did it on purpose.

387
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,519
- No, I didn't... - Did what on purpose?

388
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,279
Mom. Why were you eavesdropping?

389
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,240
She's just concerned about us.

390
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:56,119
What's wrong?

391
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,480
It's nothing.

392
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,519
Ma'am.

393
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:00,480
There's so much delicious food.

394
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:01,720
I'm a little excited.

395
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,279
You made all these dishes yourself.

396
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:05,359
Why are you so excited?

397
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,319
Come on. Let's eat.

398
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,200
Tang Hua.

399
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:19,799
Don't be mad, Tang Hua.

400
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:20,890
I...

401
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,920
- I shouldn't have... - I know what you're thinking.

402
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,240
Do you think I'll give you a chance if you win over my mom?

403
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:26,359
Listen. I won't.

404
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:27,519
I won't for sure.

405
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,890
The more you please her, the more I hate you.

406
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:31,200
Do you understand?

407
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:33,519
Tang Hua.

408
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,119
Spicy hot pot.

409
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,240
It's good, right?

410
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:14,559
It's good.

411
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,519
It's spicy.

412
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,279
Dr. Xu.

413
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,039
I need your help.

414
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,039
I knew it. There's no such thing as a free midnight snack.

415
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:24,920
For the sake of this delicious food,

416
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,920
tell me about it.

417
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,480
It's about me and Tang Hua.

418
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,200
It's just as I expected.

419
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,680
Dr. Xu, please help me.

420
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,680
If you take advantage of me, I'll take advantage of you.

421
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:39,890
Let me give you a piece of advice.

422
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,720
For people like you who have no talent,

423
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,319
there's only one ultimate technique.

424
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,279
Never give up and persevere.

425
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,039
I can do it.

426
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,039
Dr. Tang, are you waiting for a taxi?

427
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,170
It's hard to get a taxi at this hour.

428
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:17,559
Get in. Let's go together.

429
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:22,920
You're shameless.

430
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,170
You're so persistent.

431
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,200
Dr. Tang.

432
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:28,079
Dr. Tang, get in.

433
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,079
You can't be late.

434
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,960
Dr. Tang.

435
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,680
Dr. Tang, get in the car.

436
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,720
You're going to be late.

437
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,920
There's still a lot to do at work.

438
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,000
Dr. Tang.

439
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,410
Drive faster.

440
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,480
Don't worry. I promise we won't be late.

441
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:08,119
Who did you borrow the car from this time?

442
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,039
I didn't borrow it.

443
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:11,079
I rented it.

444
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:12,480
You're so rich.

445
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:14,799
You don't go to the hospital.

446
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,319
Why are you loitering in front of my house?

447
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:17,680
I'm not loitering.

448
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
It's on my way.

449
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,519
If I remember correctly,

450
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,160
you stay in Pudong.

451
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,559
Which route did you take?

452
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:25,519
I had some business to take care of,

453
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,920
so I'm going the same way.

454
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:31,519
How could you lie like that?

455
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,480
You're getting more shameless.

456
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:36,319
It's true.

457
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:40,920
You're not ashamed. Instead, you're proud of it.

458
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,559
Don't tell anyone that you fetched me here.

459
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:01,680
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

460
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:07,599
Good morning, Dr. Xu.

461
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,000
When I was parking just now,

462
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,039
I saw you and Tang Hua came together.

463
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,039
What's going on?

464
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,000
I rented a car...

465
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:17,680
and waited for her downstairs.

466
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,400
She woke up late...

467
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,720
and she couldn't get a taxi,

468
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:22,119
so we came together.

469
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:23,680
Not bad.

470
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:25,759
- Isn't that great advice? - Yes.

471
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:26,759
She even praised me for being shameless...

472
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:27,759
on our way here.

473
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,400
Is that a compliment?

474
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,759
Dr. Xiao.

475
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,160
The patient is a male.

476
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,200
He's 50 years old.

477
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,640
He has abdominal distension.

478
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,200
He had blood in his stool this morning,

479
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:42,720
so he suspects he has hemorrhoids.

480
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,359
I did a blood test on him.

481
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:45,839
No abnormalities were found in digital rectal examination.

482
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:49,160
The possibility of intestinal tumor is not ruled out.

483
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,799
Do you mean intestinal cancer?

484
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,160
That's impossible.

485
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,519
I pay great attention to my body maintenance.

486
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:56,559
Don't worry.

487
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:57,799
Body maintenance is one thing.

488
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,119
There are actually many reasons for intestinal tumors.

489
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,559
In addition to the high fat and low cellulose diet,

490
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,400
there are also genetic reasons,

491
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,599
including chronic inflammation of the intestine.

492
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,839
They can all lead to cancer.

493
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:14,920
I'll arrange a colonoscopy for you later.

494
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:17,599
Okay.

495
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,759
Over there.

496
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:23,599
Dr. Xiao.

497
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,079
You're finally here.

498
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,480
That patient just now...

499
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,559
is an experienced Chinese medicine practitioner.

500
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:29,359
He has been nagging me all morning.

501
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:31,480
He nags more than my mom.

502
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,799
What did he say?

503
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,000
He said he can tell that I'm not in good health.

504
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,160
I need to take care of myself.

505
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,039
I received many prescriptions in a short while...

506
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:41,839
like female ginseng, white peony root...

507
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,400
What else?

508
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,960
Anyway, there are so many that I can't remember.

509
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,880
He said I need to replenish my blood...

510
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,039
and regulate my menstruation.

511
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:51,400
Chinese medicine is broad and profound.

512
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:53,279
Why don't you listen to what he says?

513
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,440
Get a prescription.

514
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:56,319
I have been here all morning.

515
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,480
I wonder if I'm the one treating him...

516
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:00,000
or if he's here to treat me.

517
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,480
Come back to me when you have the results.

518
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,920
Okay, thank you.

519
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,960
Doctor.

520
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:17,720
The results are out.

521
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,839
According to the colonoscopy,

522
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,960
I think it's an early colon tumor.

523
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:28,200
But don't worry.

524
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,240
If it's an early colon tumor...

525
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,680
and no metastasis has occurred,

526
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:33,400
the sooner we find it, the sooner we can cure it.

527
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:35,640
There's a very high chance that we can cure it.

528
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:37,759
Doctor, what's the treatment?

529
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:38,799
Do I need surgery?

530
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:40,200
It's a minimally invasive surgery.

531
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:42,319
At that time, our proctologists...

532
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,839
will be responsible for your surgery.

533
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:46,079
Okay.

534
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,160
Thank you.

535
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:54,599
Look.

536
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,079
It's so cold now.

537
00:25:57,079 --> 00:25:59,400
I shouldn't have brought you to Shanghai to travel at this time.

538
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,000
What are you saying?

539
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,880
I catch a cold easily in winter.

540
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,960
It doesn't matter where I am.

541
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,039
I'm fine.

542
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:10,559
This is the first time we traveled together...

543
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,960
and you went straight to the emergency room.

544
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:14,200
It's all my fault.

545
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,519
I didn't think it through.

546
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,640
It's just a mild fever.

547
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,039
It's 38 degrees Celsius.

548
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:21,240
How is that a mild fever?

549
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,359
Number 17, Chen Yan Ke.

550
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:26,359
Please come to the first treatment room.

551
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,799
It's our turn. Let's go.

552
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:30,839
First treatment room.

553
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,519
Doctor.

554
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,359
She hasn't eaten all day.

555
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:37,599
Even drinking water hurts.

556
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:40,680
Inflammation of the throat, tonsils abscess,

557
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:42,799
and some yellow exudates.

558
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,319
Exudates?

559
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,160
It means pus. I think it's an infection.

560
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,640
Isn't it just a common cold? Why is there pus?

561
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:50,279
It's a common symptom of infection.

562
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:51,279
Don't worry too much.

563
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:53,319
Let me check your lymph nodes again.

564
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,039
Your lymph nodes are swollen.

565
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,720
How about this?

566
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,200
Let's go for a routine blood test and blood biochemistry test first.

567
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:04,759
Okay.

568
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,559
Okay. Go ahead.

569
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:14,559
- Okay. - Thank you, doctor.

570
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,960
Thank you, doctor.

571
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,319
Your dad...

572
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:25,079
thought I couldn't take care of you.

573
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,200
He doesn't want us to be together.

574
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:29,119
I wasn't convinced at the time.

575
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,960
Now that I think about it,

576
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,960
your dad was right.

577
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,599
You lost all your confidence because of my dad.

578
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:38,359
In my dad's eyes,

579
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:40,480
I'm too good for anyone.

580
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:42,200
Not even a celebrity.

581
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:48,359
Doctor.

582
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:49,799
The results are out.

583
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:52,160
Please take a look at the results.

584
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:59,720
Elevated C-reactive protein and white blood cells in the blood.

585
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,839
I think it's a bacterial infection.

586
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:02,400
What's going on?

587
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,200
Da Zhi, let the doctor finish.

588
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:06,799
The more common bacteria...

589
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,079
that causes purulent tonsillitis...

590
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:09,079
is Streptococcus.

591
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:12,400
I'm prescribing you cephalosporins.

592
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,559
Take it orally for three days straight.

593
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,680
It'll basically heal completely.

594
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:17,799
Does that mean I'm fine?

595
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,519
Yes, you're fine.

596
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:22,160
When you get home, get some rest and stay warm.

597
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,160
Drink more water.

598
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:26,279
Also, take your medicine on time to avoid reinfections.

599
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,680
Let's just stay in the hotel these few days.

600
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:32,799
This is my first time in Shanghai.

601
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:34,240
It's fine. Let's play again when you feel better.

602
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:38,839
All right. Go get the medicine.

603
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,240
- Okay. Thank you, doctor. - Thank you, doctor.

604
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,240
Thank you.

605
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:43,119
Let's go.

606
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,079
What's wrong?

607
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,799
I'm fine. My feet hurt from walking too much.

608
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,160
Let's go back to the doctor.

609
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,160
Forget it.

610
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,079
Let's go back to the hotel and rest.

611
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,960
I've been so tired these past two days.

612
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,279
All right.

613
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:01,799
Slowly.

614
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:03,319
Slow down.

615
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,119
Let's go and eat.

616
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:08,640
I'm not eating. You go ahead.

617
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:17,640
- Are you okay? - What's wrong?

618
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:19,119
I'm fine.

619
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:20,279
There's a scratch.

620
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:21,279
It's fine.

621
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,119
- Let's go. - Be careful.

622
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,440
Why did you sprain your ankle?

623
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:39,319
The shoes don't fit.

624
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,880
Here.

625
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,880
I'll apply some medicine for you.

626
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,559
Dr. Bai.

627
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:45,200
I can do it myself.

628
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:47,279
Thank you.

629
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,039
- You're welcome. - Thank you.

630
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:53,519
Dr. Xiao.

631
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:54,920
How big is your foot?

632
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,759
I think it's size 36 or 37.

633
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,559
I bought these shoes online. I didn't try them on.

634
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,960
That's the same as mine.

635
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,119
I have a spare pair of shoes.

636
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:05,119
I'll get them for you.

637
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:07,440
Wait.

638
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:13,039
I'll go with you.

639
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,319
No, I...

640
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,960
Let me help you.

641
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,519
Slowly.

642
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:26,480
I'm fine.

643
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,119
I'm fine.

644
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,359
Lin Zhi.

645
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,519
There was a female patient in the morning...

646
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:53,240
with a tonsils infection who came to Shanghai to travel.

647
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,319
Check the records.

648
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,400
Contact her.

649
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,400
Tell her to come back for a follow-up.

650
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:04,119
Okay.

651
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:07,319
These shoes are quite comfortable. Where did you buy them?

652
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,720
Online.

653
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,000
It's a lot cheaper than shopping malls.

654
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,079
Dr. Xiao.

655
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,119
Can't you tell Bai Zhu likes you?

656
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,920
Dr. Bai and I are colleagues.

657
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,160
I'm not blind.

658
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,279
I can tell.

659
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,960
Bai Zhu treats you differently.

660
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:24,680
You treat him differently too.

661
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:27,720
I'll get mad if you say that again.

662
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,400
Then I'll say one last thing.

663
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,519
He doesn't deserve you.

664
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,160
That's all.

665
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,240
Thank you, doctor.

666
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:58,559
What are you doing sneaking around?

667
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,119
Does it have anything to do with you?

668
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,400
Come in.

669
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,480
Dr. Bai.

670
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,039
The patient with a tonsils infection is here.

671
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:07,039
Okay.

672
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,200
Chen Zhi, let's go.

673
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:14,039
Do you need two doctors for tonsils infection?

674
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,240
You don't understand.

675
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,319
Dr. Bai is going to train Chen Zhi.

676
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:24,920
The doctor asked us to come back in such a hurry.

677
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,000
Could something have happened?

678
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:27,480
Don't jinx me. Touch wood.

679
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:28,640
Touch wood.

680
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:30,720
Did you hurt your leg?

681
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,839
The back of my heels are scraped.

682
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:34,480
Take off your shoes so I can see.

683
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,839
- Lie down on the bed. - Your feet.

684
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:46,160
I'm going to tear off the Band-Aid.

685
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,039
Is it that serious?

686
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,319
Your swelling is serious.

687
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,279
You'll need surgery to drain it.

688
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:00,079
Lin Zhi, get ready.

689
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:01,079
Okay.

690
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,519
Let me tell you.

691
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,599
Later, we have to remove some pus for bacteria culture.

692
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,759
Bacteria culture?

693
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,200
What kind of illness is this?

694
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,039
Only after the bacteria culture results come out...

695
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:11,119
can we deal with the illness.

696
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,519
Okay.

697
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,519
Why is it so swollen?

698
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:18,400
I didn't notice it.

699
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,519
It's all my fault.

700
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:21,200
Why didn't I notice it sooner?

701
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,400
Okay, here we go.

702
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,559
It's going to hurt a little. Bear with it.

703
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:39,559
It'll be over soon.

704
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:45,400
Bear with it.

705
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:46,839
It'll be over soon.

706
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,119
Is it the same kind of pus in her throat?

707
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,880
We don't know yet.

708
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,799
We have to cultivate the bacteria to know.

709
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:58,359
It won't take long.

710
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,440
Dr. Bai.

711
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,880
Is the infection in her throat and ankle...

712
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,599
really the same bacteria?

713
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,039
Are you serious?

714
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,679
I've never seen anything like this.

715
00:34:17,329 --> 00:34:18,960
I wonder how you graduated.

716
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,559
Bacteria will spread everywhere once it enters our blood.

717
00:34:24,289 --> 00:34:25,360
I know that.

718
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,599
What I mean is...

719
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:27,809
if it's bacteria,

720
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,880
can it spread this fast in such a short time?

721
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,639
You've finally asked a meaningful question.

722
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,360
Let's wait for the result.

723
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:39,079
Don't give up.

724
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:41,719
Dr. Xu said Dr. Bai is trying to train you.

725
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,039
That's how I consoled myself.

726
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:48,519
- All right. Go get your medicine. - Okay. Thank you.

727
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,289
Dr. Bai.

728
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:52,960
Chen Yan Ke's test results came out.

729
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,000
Please take a look.

730
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:06,480
Klebsiella pneumoniae.

731
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:07,679
It's a superbug.

732
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,519
This Klebsiella pneumoniae can usually be found in hospitals.

733
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,599
It's rarely exposed to ordinary people in everyday life.

734
00:35:15,289 --> 00:35:17,329
Is she infected in our hospital?

735
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:18,769
It won't happen so soon.

736
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:21,360
Dr. Bai, I remember now.

737
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,360
When I changed her dressing just now,

738
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,440
I heard them say...

739
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,920
that the patient's boyfriend was hospitalized for two weeks...

740
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,639
due to pneumonia six months ago.

741
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:30,329
Do you think he was carrying it then?

742
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,119
A healthy carrier.

743
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:37,769
They're a couple.

744
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:39,440
It's highly contagious.

745
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:41,519
Listen.

746
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,079
You give the patient a piperacillin injection first.

747
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,440
Then get a sample from the boyfriend and get it tested.

748
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,440
Okay.

749
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,119
If something like this happens next time,

750
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,289
you'll do it.

751
00:35:54,289 --> 00:35:55,329
Me?

752
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,039
Thank you, Dr. Bai.

753
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:09,360
I got the illness from Da Zhi?

754
00:36:09,809 --> 00:36:11,000
- Yes. - That's impossible.

755
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:12,599
I don't have any symptoms.

756
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,199
You don't have any symptoms now,

757
00:36:14,289 --> 00:36:16,289
but you had pneumonia once six months ago.

758
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,480
At that time, you got infected with Klebsiella pneumoniae.

759
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:21,289
That's why you've been carrying the bacteria.

760
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,000
That's how Chen Yan Ke got infected.

761
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:25,289
But in the past, both of you never got sick.

762
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,199
This time, it's because you came to travel...

763
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:28,559
and she was overworked.

764
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:30,329
Her body was too weak, so she got sick.

765
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:31,840
I carried it with me?

766
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,920
We found this bacteria in your throat and nasal cavity.

767
00:36:35,329 --> 00:36:36,559
But I come into contact with so many people...

768
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:37,599
at work every day...

769
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:39,559
and I've never seen anyone get such an illness.

770
00:36:39,769 --> 00:36:40,769
This bacteria...

771
00:36:40,769 --> 00:36:43,000
can only be transmitted through contact with body fluids.

772
00:36:46,769 --> 00:36:47,840
I'm sorry.

773
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:49,519
I...

774
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,360
I didn't know I had this bacteria with me.

775
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:54,289
It's not your fault.

776
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:55,769
You said it yourself.

777
00:36:55,769 --> 00:36:57,159
You didn't know that.

778
00:36:57,519 --> 00:37:00,809
Moreover, I feel much better now.

779
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,840
Did the medicine you injected me work?

780
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,920
- Yes. - Why don't you give Da Zhi...

781
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,329
the same medicine as me?

782
00:37:07,329 --> 00:37:08,360
That's right.

783
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,000
Get rid of all the bacteria in my body.

784
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:12,639
Even if I give you an injection, it won't be able to do much.

785
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,039
Why?

786
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:16,719
Because you've been carrying this bacteria for over six months.

787
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,519
The bacteria are all over your body.

788
00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:20,480
Antibiotics won't help you much.

789
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,880
Wait. What does that mean?

790
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,639
Do I have to carry the bacteria for the rest of my life?

791
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,400
If you don't have an attack, I don't think it'll affect you much.

792
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,599
If I carry it all the time,

793
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,159
won't it still infect Xiao Ke in the future?

794
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:33,329
It's possible.

795
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,769
Paying attention to precautions during physical contact...

796
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:37,639
can reduce the risk of infection.

797
00:37:40,769 --> 00:37:41,769
We'll make it work.

798
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:43,400
There will be a way.

799
00:37:43,809 --> 00:37:45,000
Isn't that right, doctor?

800
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:48,159
If we find a more effective antibiotic,

801
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:49,159
I'll let you know.

802
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:51,639
Take care of yourself.

803
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,199
Come to us if you have any questions.

804
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:56,159
Let's go.

805
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,079
Your dad was right.

806
00:38:02,809 --> 00:38:04,199
I should've taken better care of you.

807
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:08,519
I even spread the illness to you.

808
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:10,639
Da Zhi.

809
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,960
All right.

810
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:16,840
If there's the latest treatment method,

811
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,840
please tell me.

812
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:20,119
Okay, thank you.

813
00:38:25,769 --> 00:38:26,769
You came at the right time.

814
00:38:27,769 --> 00:38:30,599
This is some information about the prevention of Klebsiella.

815
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:31,719
You can read it at home.

816
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:33,239
No.

817
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:34,880
There's no need for prevention.

818
00:38:38,289 --> 00:38:39,360
Please...

819
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,360
give this letter...

820
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,880
to Xiao Ke.

821
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:46,239
I don't have the courage to tell her myself.

822
00:38:48,289 --> 00:38:50,400
I can't take care of Xiao Ke.

823
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,400
Please.

824
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,769
Dr. Bai, what should we do?

825
00:38:57,769 --> 00:38:58,840
Throw the letter away.

826
00:38:59,289 --> 00:39:01,079
Don't you hear me? Throw the letter away.

827
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:03,809
Go and find Chen Yan Ke right now.

828
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,519
Take her to the entrance and stop him.

829
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,400
Da Zhi.

830
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:42,329
Are you just going to run away so sneakily?

831
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:46,679
I'm sorry.

832
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,639
You abandon me because of such a trivial matter.

833
00:39:51,769 --> 00:39:53,440
I carry bacteria with me all the time.

834
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,199
I can infect you at any time.

835
00:39:55,289 --> 00:39:56,329
Sir.

836
00:39:58,559 --> 00:39:59,920
I don't think you need to carry this burden.

837
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,079
It's too heavy for you.

838
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:02,679
You didn't know about this.

839
00:40:03,289 --> 00:40:05,400
You just need to protect yourselves from now on.

840
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:07,289
There's still a chance of infection.

841
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,119
As a doctor,

842
00:40:09,289 --> 00:40:11,289
I deal with all kinds of incurable diseases every day.

843
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:13,920
I've also seen separations between loved ones.

844
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:16,239
It's rare to see someone...

845
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,519
who gives up love so easily like you.

846
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:21,920
I don't know...

847
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,599
if you have heard of Lin Ruo Yun...

848
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:26,519
and Mr. Li Shi Lei in our hospital before.

849
00:40:28,769 --> 00:40:32,239
The struggle Ms. Lin faced is much more painful than yours.

850
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,119
And it's also about...

851
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:35,480
the life and death of the person she loves.

852
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:38,440
Even though Ms. Lin chose to let go in the end,

853
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,000
it's about respecting the will of the one she loves.

854
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,719
Love is between two people.

855
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:46,119
Before you make a decision,

856
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,039
have you asked your lover?

857
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:56,289
Before this, we had an elderly couple here.

858
00:40:56,559 --> 00:40:59,119
The woman had a car accident and was in a vegetative state.

859
00:40:59,809 --> 00:41:01,679
From a medical point of view,

860
00:41:01,769 --> 00:41:03,119
even if we continue with the treatment,

861
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,289
I don't think she'll wake up.

862
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,199
But her lover didn't give up on her.

863
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,199
He read his diary to her every day...

864
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,960
to help her recall the bits and pieces...

865
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,119
that both of them have experienced

866
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:16,769
He believes that she'll wake up one day...

867
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:18,400
and another miracle will happen.

868
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:27,239
In fact,

869
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:29,480
you're already very blessed to live in this peaceful age.

870
00:41:30,329 --> 00:41:31,480
If you get sick,

871
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,119
there are such good doctors...

872
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,719
and such advanced equipment...

873
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:35,809
that can treat you.

874
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:37,719
Do you know?

875
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:39,239
There are a lot of places in the world...

876
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:40,719
where war is still raging.

877
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:44,159
If the people there are injured or sick,

878
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:45,840
they may be gone just like that.

879
00:41:46,769 --> 00:41:48,039
It's not easy for two people who love each other...

880
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:49,329
to be together.

881
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:52,159
How can you be defeated by a tiny bacteria?

882
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:53,719
Don't people who love each other...

883
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:56,159
have to overcome all kinds of difficulties together?

884
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:01,199
Thank you, doctor.

885
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:03,159
You're right.

886
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,239
I won't run away.

887
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,289
I won't run away.

888
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:16,159
I'm sorry.

889
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,960
Xiao Ke.

890
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,519
I'm sorry.

891
00:42:32,769 --> 00:42:33,809
Dr. Bai.

892
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,960
Dr. Bai.

893
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,960
What happened?

894
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,000
It's nothing.

895
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:38,079
Dr. Bai.

896
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:40,000
How did you know that the letter wouldn't work?

897
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:41,360
The couple made up.

898
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,840
If you want to be a good doctor,

899
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,199
you don't just see diseases...

900
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,000
but also people.

901
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:51,960
Didn't see the way that girl looked at that young man?

902
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:56,360
Would she stop loving him because of Klebsiella pneumoniae?
