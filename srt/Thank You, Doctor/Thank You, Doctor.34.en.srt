(Adapted from Sheng Li's novel "ICU 48 Hours")

3
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,200
(Episode 34)

4
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:38,400
Poison or infection?

5
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,760
The patient doesn't have a fever.

6
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,359
His white blood cell count didn't increase either.

7
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:45,239
So I don't think it's an infection.

8
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:47,159
It's written in the blood test...

9
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,879
that there are no toxins or drugs.

10
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:50,400
So it's not poison either.

11
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,879
Respiratory cancer?

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,799
The bronchoscopy was clean.

13
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,200
So are the lungs.

14
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,000
So it's not a respiratory problem.

15
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:03,599
Could there be an ulcer or bleeding in his digestive tract?

16
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,879
I checked his upper and lower digestive tracts.

17
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,640
All clear.

18
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,560
So where did the blood...

19
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,199
he coughed up come from?

20
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,090
If the heart rate is too high,

21
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,639
there will be a lot of blood rushing into the lungs...

22
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,039
and cause hemoptysis.

23
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,759
But his lungs are clear...

24
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,759
because the flow is through the normal pipeline.

25
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,530
Let's check his heart.

26
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:25,759
Kai Yang.

27
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,530
Doctor, what's wrong with him?

28
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,000
Who are you?

29
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:31,599
I'm his girlfriend.

30
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,680
What's wrong with him?

31
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,090
The patient's current symptom is hemoptysis.

32
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,439
We need to run more tests...

33
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,319
to find out the specific cause.

34
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,039
I shouldn't have rushed you to deliver the key.

35
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,439
The police officer who brought the patient said...

36
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,080
before the patient coughed blood,

37
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,479
he broke down in the middle of the street...

38
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:50,360
due to stress from working overtime every day.

39
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:51,599
I feel so bad for him.

40
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,759
The pace of society is too fast these days.

41
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,840
A lot of people get exhausted and break down because of work.

42
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,360
In a way,

43
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,960
they all have suboptimal health.

44
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:02,159
And there are some people...

45
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,240
who never skimp on...

46
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,639
spending on handbags or cars.

47
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,759
They are willing to spend a huge amount money.

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,120
But they don't spend a penny when it comes to health checkups.

49
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,759
Physical examinations are important.

50
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:12,400
Early detection leads to early treatment.

51
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,000
Are the results out for Gao Ming's MRI scan?

52
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:20,919
Not yet. I think it'll be soon.

53
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,039
But I reckon it's brain metastasis.

54
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,560
- Hello? - Dr. Bai.

55
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,479
Gao Ming's MRI results are out.

56
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:35,840
Okay, I got it.

57
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,639
The results are out.

58
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,439
Brain metastasis?

59
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,560
Is it confirmed?

60
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:44,960
Yes, it's confirmed.

61
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,280
It has only been over a year...

62
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:49,840
since the stomach cancer was discovered.

63
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,599
How did this happen so quickly?

64
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,520
He's only 22...

65
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,319
and just graduated from university.

66
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,240
He's still so young.

67
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,919
Why is this happening?

68
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,800
Doctor.

69
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,879
Is there no hope at all?

70
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,800
Undergoing radiotherapy...

71
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,560
can buy him some time.

72
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,360
Think of another way.

73
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,319
See what else we can do.

74
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,319
The brain has metastasized.

75
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,050
There's nothing we can do.

76
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:21,480
Brain metastasis...

77
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,000

Ming Ming...

79
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:35,199
Why is this happening?

80
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,000
Mom.

81
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,079
I can't go home, can I?

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,050
Mom.

83
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,839
Dad.

84
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,399
I've made you sad again.

85
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,839
Doctor, please save him!

86
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:34,240
His breathing has stopped!

87
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,079
Compressed lungs. Intubation.

(Kai Yang's Medical Report)

89
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,560
There's fluid in his chest.

90
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,160
Puncture shows low protein.

91
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,480
Could be cirrhosis or heart failure.

92
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,839
Liver enzymes normal.

93
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:56,199
His heart looks fine too.

94
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,319
Pleural effusion with traces of blood.

95
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,560
Elevated bilirubin,

96
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,079
mainly non-combined.

97
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,319
Creatinine rose progressively.

98
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,399
Kidney failure?

99
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,279
Could be hemolytic uremic syndrome.

100
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,399
It's possible.

101
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:12,439
Arrange for a continuous renal replacement therapy.

102
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,519
Okay.

103
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,399
I say,

104
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:20,319
when one is tired, they should learn to take a break.

105
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,639
Dwelling on the past...

106
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,560
will only do harm.

107
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,240
Moving on is the best.

108
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,759
Dr. Xiao, Dr. Bai. Traffic accident patients.

109
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:38,279
They will arrive at the hospital in three minutes.

110
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,480
Got it.

111
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,040
Dr. Xiao.

112
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,399
I heard you just resuscitated two car accident patients.

113
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,480
You've worked hard.

114
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,319
If you're free, take a rest.

115
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,199
Ms. Jiang.

116
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,399
When you're free later,

117
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:59,279
please bring me bed two's medical records.

118
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,040
Okay. Get some sleep.

119
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,000
How are you today? Does your head still hurt?

120
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,279
A little.

121
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,160
Should I give you more painkillers?

122
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,240
There's no need.

123
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,800
I can still endure the pain.

124
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,439
You're drawing us?

125
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:20,839
I'm sorry. I'm not good at drawing.

126
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,920
No, I think you did a great job.

127
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,600
Is this me?

128
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,199
That's definitely Dr. Bai.

129
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,560
Even at the edge...

130
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,759
I can see how serious he is.

131
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,090
This must be Xu Yi Ran.

132
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,240
When did my looks become like his?

133
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,519
Am I that ugly?

134
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,559
Dr. Bai.

135
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,799
I'm not that good.

136
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,159
I'll make you more handsome later.

137
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:01,600
I cleaned the house...

138
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:03,240
and organized the bookshelves.

139
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,210
I slacked off in secret and sat down.

140
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,210
Books are all over the place...

141
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,879
on all four sides of the carpet.

142
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,879
I hope you and Brian...

143
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:12,360
enjoy your time in London.

144
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,360
He said to me on the phone,

145
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,799
"If you had the money,"

146
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,279
"would you come with us?"

147
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,330
I almost cried.

148
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:34,960
Call me if you have any questions.

149
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,120
Okay, I will.

150
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,559
I've dreamed about it so much.

151
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,210
A long time ago,

152
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,210
someone told me...

153
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:50,450
those who have been to England...

154
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,039
can find what they most want there.

155
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,240
- What are you looking at? - I said,

156
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,799
- I want to go to England... - What's wrong with this patient?

157
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:00,799
Car accident. Paralyzed from the waist down.

158
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:03,159
His nerve injury is quite serious.

159
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,559
It'll be hard for him to recover.

160
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:09,120
He's still so young.

161
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,240
Tell me about it.

162
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:11,600
Bed one's medical record.

163
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,240
While they were on their date,

164
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,450
a truck slid down the slope.

165
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,879
The girl saw a child playing...

166
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:18,240
and dragged the child away.

167
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,159
But her boyfriend couldn't dodge it.

168
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:23,159
Why do kind-hearted people always get the short stick?

169
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,600
Is it that hard to live a peaceful life?

170
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,840
This is the reality.

171
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,919
You can think this way if you're not a doctor.

172
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,919
But don't forget, you're a doctor now.

173
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,960
In the hospital, especially in the EICU,

174
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,480
there is always more pain than joy.

175
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:35,639
Learn to accept it.

176
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:37,210
It's not just joy and sorrow.

177
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,919
There are more cruel things.

178
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:42,120
For example, it is better not to test human nature.

179
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,799
Sometimes, the result can be...

180
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:45,360
more desperate than you think.

181
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,330
Dr. Xu, you're making it scary.

182
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,240
There are many kinds of cruelty and despair.

183
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:52,679
But there are also warm and beautiful emotions.

184
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
That's not something you'd say.

185
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,679
Something strange must be going on.

186
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,200
Is it because of Dr. Xiao?

187
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,279
I think so.

188
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:05,200
Dr. Lu.

189
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,519
What is this?

190
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,120
This is what Mr. Jiang asked me...

191
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,399
to give to you.

192
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,559
Before I could take care of it,

193
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:12,840
he passed away.

194
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,279
I found it in my pocket...

195
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:17,480
when I was cleaning up a few days ago.

196
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,639
I'm sorry.

197
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,639
It's my fault.

198
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,000
About you giving me money without Ms. Jiang's knowledge,

199
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,080
Mr. Jiang found out.

200
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,480
So...

201
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:32,840
It's fine. Take this money.

202
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,600
Lin Jie, give me the triage record.

203
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,320
Is it there?

204
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:42,960
Mr. Jiang said...

205
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,600
I must return the money to you.

206
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,759
He didn't want to owe anyone.

207
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:48,879
Dr. Lu.

208
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:50,480
Please accept it.

209
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,639
Ms. Jiang doesn't know about this, does she?

210
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,759
No.

211
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,159
Mr. Jiang also asked me to keep it from her.

212
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:08,600
If that's all, I'll get going.

213
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,600
- Thank you. - No problem. Bye.

214
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:19,279
- I'll take it. - Okay.

215
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:26,000
Mr. Pan.

216
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,159
Ms. Jiang.

217
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,200
Do you have a minute?

218
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,080
I have something to ask you.

219
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,200
During that time,

220
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:37,080
every month,

221
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,840
Dr. Lu would give me 3,500 yuan in secret...

222
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
as to compensate for my salary.

223
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,399
He told me not to tell you.

224
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,759
That's what happened.

225
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:51,639
Well, Ms. Jiang...

226
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:54,879
If there's nothing else, I'll get going.

227
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,360
Okay.

228
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,000
Ms. Jiang.

229
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:04,679
I'd like to add one more thing.

230
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:08,559
Dr. Lu is very nice to you.

231
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:09,799
It's incomparable.

232
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,600
Bye.

233
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,679
Ms. Jiang?

234
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:42,519
I was just going to look for you.

235
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:45,440
By the way, is the family of bed 17...

236
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,840
here yet?

237
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,679
I've called to urge them.

238
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,000
Okay, I still need the patient's family's signature...

239
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,480
for the follow-up treatment.

240
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,200
Okay.

241
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,240
Is there something wrong?

242
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,679
Mr. Pan told me everything.

243
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,919
Mr. Pan told you...

244
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,679
I...

245
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:22,720
I was...

246
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,759
I was just trying to help you.

247
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,639
I...

248
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,240
Gosh, this Pan.

249
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:30,720
Well...

250
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,440
Thank you.

251
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:53,840
It's nothing.

252
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,279
What's wrong?

253
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:09,559
It's my birthday today.

254
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:10,960
I want to draw something...

255
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,279
and upload it to my Weibo.

256
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,519
Just for a while.

257
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,600
I feel much better now.

258
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,240
Look.

259
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:31,320
My hands aren't shaking anymore.

260
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:49,840
Why don't you draw it tomorrow?

261
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,559
I don't think...

262
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,360
I can draw for much longer.

263
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:58,360
I can't afford to draw...

264
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,360
even a single stroke right now.

265
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:04,879
Let me draw a little longer.

266
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,600
Enough. Don't draw today.

267
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,759
Get some rest.

268
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,240
Dr. Bai.

269
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,000
I have a favor to ask.

270
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,919
This is the watch Mom and Dad bought me...

271
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,080
for my birthday last year.

272
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,399
I have a friend who likes this watch.

273
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,279
He has transferred the money to me.

274
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:07,119
Can you help me wrap it up...

275
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,319
and deliver it?

276
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,890
But it's a gift from your parents.

277
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,200
Can you bear it?

278
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:14,920
Tomorrow...

279
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,039
is my parents' wedding anniversary.

280
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,079
I want to book a table at the best restaurant for couples...

281
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,680
with the money I got in exchange for the watch.

282
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,890
All these years,

283
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,920
they gave up their jobs...

284
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,359
to treat my illness.

285
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:36,920
They gave up their lives.

286
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,559
Everything they did was for me.

287
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,559
I wish...

288
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,410
for them to stop living just for me...

289
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,920
even if it's the time of just one meal.

290
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:01,759
I'll help you.

291
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,440
Get some rest.

292
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,119
It's our child's birthday. Be happy.

293
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,920
Dr. Bai.

294
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,000
It's Gao Ming's birthday today.

295
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,279
I made some noodles for him.

296
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:36,240
He loves my noodles.

297
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:41,000
You should...

298
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:43,200
spend more time with him these days.

299
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:53,680
Let's go in.

300
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:02,720
Are you feeling better today?

301
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,000
Much better.

302
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:06,890
Doctor,

303
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,170
I heard the patient in the next bed...

304
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,480
is a comic artist.

305
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,410
Actually,

306
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,240
I loved to draw too.

307
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,079
I used to go to the suburbs all the time...

308
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:16,759
to paint landscapes.

309
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:18,799
But I didn't paint that much anymore...

310
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,000
after I graduated.

311
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,410
Why did you stop?

312
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,799
I moved a few times.

313
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,519
I lost my brushes and stuff.

314
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:28,170
And I was so busy with work.

315
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:29,559
I didn't have the time...

316
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:31,240
or the mood.

317
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,279
Actually, I think...

318
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:37,000
it's good to have a hobby.

319
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:38,559
You should pick it up again.

320
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,039
When you feel stressed,

321
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,170
just draw.

322
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,079
You can control your emotions.

323
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:45,839
Don't push yourself too hard.

324
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,960
You'll get sick if you're too stressed.

325
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,440
You can always make more money.

326
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,440
But if you lose your health,

327
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,759
you'll lose everything.

328
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:52,839
Yes.

329
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,279
Doctor.

330
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:55,920
I had a colleague...

331
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,440
who always made this joke.

332
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,960
"Work 9 to 6, enter the ICU when you're sick."

333
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,039
I can't believe...

334
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:02,759
I'm really in the ICU this time.

335
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:06,240
Honestly, who wants to work overtime...

336
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,839
and be tired all the time?

337
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,720
That's just how life is.

338
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:12,359
I came to the city to work.

339
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,720
To have a girlfriend...

340
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:15,319
and get married,

341
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,480
I need a car and a house.

342
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,200
I can't be renting a house with my wife and kids.

343
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,519
If things are awry,

344
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,890
we'd be chased away by the landlord.

345
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,480
Actually,

346
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,319
we have a lot of young people...

347
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:28,890
who are admitted into the EICU due to anxiety.

348
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,599
People get sick younger.

349
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,039
There are many patients who are younger...

350
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:35,480
and even sicker than you.

351
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:37,680
If I have to say,

352
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,319
the car, the house, and so on...

353
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:40,839
don't really matter.

354
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,960
Living...

355
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,839
and being with the people you love...

356
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:45,319
is the greatest happiness.

357
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,279
Just right.

358
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:49,759
Let falling sick this time...

359
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:51,440
be a warning to you.

360
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:53,650
Take this time to rest...

361
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,480
and think carefully about your future.

362
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Yes.

363
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,480
Take a day off if you're tired from work.

364
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,799
If it doesn't work out,

365
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,000
find another job.

366
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:03,359
Something less stressful.

367
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,890
Being in a good mood is the most important.

368
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,759
Don't we work just to live a better life?

369
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:09,519
When you're done venting, dry your tears...

370
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:11,000
and live a good life.

371
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:12,480
As long as you're healthy,

372
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,960
you can overcome anything.

373
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,000
Yes.

374
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,240
Actually, my girlfriend and I have made a deal.

375
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,599
When I get out of the hospital,

376
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,170
we'll go back to our hometown.

377
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,410
Living...

378
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,319
and being with the ones you love...

379
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,920
is the greatest happiness

380
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,650
Gao Ming...

381
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,440
won't be able to make it?

382
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,680
In this world,

383
00:21:56,839 --> 00:21:59,119
despair is greater than hope sometimes.

384
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,119
In the past,

385
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,000
if I had known the ending would be bad,

386
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,119
I would still give it my all.

387
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,480
But not anymore.

388
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:20,279
I still believe in miracles.

389
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:23,400
But I'm willing to face reality.

390
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,640
You've matured.

391
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,839
It's all thanks to Xiao Yan.

392
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:41,759
Even though the ending...

393
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:43,519
will be bad,

394
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,440
as long as there's hope,

395
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,880
it will still be meaningful.

396
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:59,400
I'm off.

397
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,160
In terms of form,

398
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,759
the world before us...

399
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:14,480
is only this one thin layer.

400
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:17,359
But the world of Charing Cross Road...

401
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,279
revealed through books...

402
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,519
are overlapping endless layers of time.

403
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:25,400
Including the endless past...

404
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,920
that we have lost...

405
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:31,440
due to memory loss and don't even know we had.

406
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:33,240
And the endless future...

407
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:35,920
that we cannot and do not intend to look forward to.

408
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,200
Dad and Mom...

409
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:42,359
had a great time today.

410
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,440
Look.

411
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:44,839
All the food.

412
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:47,440
They're almost all gone.

413
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,480
I'm glad you liked it.

414
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,480
When I ordered it,

415
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:54,200
I was worried that you wouldn't like it.

416
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,799
Your dad loved it so much.

417
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,200
Look at these dishes.

418
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,559
We ate them all.

419
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,680
You and your dad...

420
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,720
are the same.

421
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:05,039
You don't put down your chopsticks...

422
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,640
when there's your favorite food.

423
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:07,960
The food is delicious.

424
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:10,119
This restaurant you chose...

425
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,519
is especially good.

426
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,759
Ming Ming.

427
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:15,200
I'm thinking...

428
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,759
for our wedding anniversary next year,

429
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,000
three of us...

430
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:21,400
should come to this restaurant again.

431
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,599
What do you think?

432
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:25,039
Okay.

433
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,079
If you like it,

434
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,039
I'm sure I'll like it too.

435
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,720
Thank you, Ming Ming.

436
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,880
This is the happiest...

437
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:35,839
wedding anniversary...

438
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,559
I've had with your dad.

439
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:40,559
Dad...

440
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,400
Mom...

441
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,119
I hope both of you will be this happy...

442
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:47,640
every day in the future.

443
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:52,559
Ming Ming, it's getting late.

444
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,880
Get some rest

445
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:56,480
Mom and I will head back soon.

446
00:25:57,799 --> 00:25:58,799
Dad.

447
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,519
Mom.

448
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,279
Goodbye.

449
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,359
I'll see you later.

450
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,319
Hello, I've packed up the dishes for you.

451
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:12,960
Okay, thank you.

452
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:16,440
You saw how happy Ming Ming was.

453
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:21,480
Cheer up.

454
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:24,400
Dad...

455
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:26,559
Mom...

456
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,240
Goodbye.

457
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:35,160
Gao Ming updated his Weibo.

458
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:40,799
He even drew a picture of our department.

459
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,119
Look, Dr. Xu.

460
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,519
Let me see.

461
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,480
He's good.

462
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,039
That looks just like Tang Hua.

463
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:57,759
Why does only Bai Zhu look like this?

464
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,559
A handsome man...

465
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:00,960
looks handsome no matter the drawing.

466
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:07,319
There's a caption.

467
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:09,799
Thank you for taking care of me.

468
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:11,880
It's great to have you.

469
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:17,960
He's quite a sentimental kid.

470
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,720
- Gao Ming is dying! - Gao Ming is dying!

471
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,640
What's going on?

472
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,079
Heart failure.

473
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:41,799
- Intubation and CPR. - Doctor.

474
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:43,559
- Intubation! - Don't save him.

475
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:44,599
Why?

476
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,400
His family has signed...

477
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,799
the consent to give up treatment.

478
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,079
There's still hope.

479
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:50,400
There's still hope!

480
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,000
Let him go.

481
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,000
He doesn't want to force it,

482
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,039
so he gave up on treatment.

483
00:27:58,359 --> 00:28:01,279
He wants to donate his organs.

484
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,200
To give the chance to live...

485
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,119
to those who need it more.

486
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:34,119
Ming Ming...

487
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,920
Ming Ming...

488
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,759
Gao Ming's time of death.

489
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,359
- My condolences. - Ming Ming...

490
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,359
21:50.

491
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,519
Get an EKG.

492
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,279
Ming Ming.

493
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,279
Ming Ming...

494
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:18,920
My son.

495
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:21,920
Ming Ming.

496
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,759
Ming Ming, please.

497
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:26,000
Mom can't live without you, Ming Ming.

498
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,759
- My condolences. - Ming Ming...

499
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,680
To you who I love most,

500
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,680
goodbye.

501
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:38,880
I will donate all the royalties...

502
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:41,240
from the publication.

503
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:45,519
I will give the money and hope for life...

504
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,279
to others.

505
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,920
I shall leave...

506
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:56,000
like the beauty of autumn leaves.

507
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:58,599
I hope...

508
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:02,160
you will bloom...

509
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,240
like the summer flowers.

510
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,839
I heard you were looking for me.

511
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:09,079
Dr. Xiao.

512
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,240
Give me your email address.

513
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:11,759
I have a gift for you.

514
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,440
What gift? You're being so mysterious.

515
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:02,759
Dr. Xiao.

516
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:05,480
This is my present for you.

517
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,599
You must cherish it.

518
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,160
Qian Qian.

519
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:25,480
Qian Qian, we're going out for a jog.

520
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,160
Got it.

521
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:40,240
Qian Qian, hurry up.

522
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,880
Qian Qian.

523
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:48,559
Qian Qian!

524
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,119
Qian Qian, you're finally awake.

525
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,400
You scared me.

526
00:31:58,319 --> 00:31:59,960
Where am I?

527
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,480
This is Tongshan Hospital.

528
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,599
I'm Dr. Xiao.

529
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,640
What happened to me?

530
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,359
You fainted just now.

531
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,880
Was it because you took diet pills?

532
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:17,119
What we can now confirm...

533
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:19,839
is that the patient's heart attack was caused by taking diet pills...

534
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:21,039
with unknown ingredients.

535
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:23,240
My husband and I have always been worried...

536
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,759
about those lousy diet pills.

537
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:26,119
It's not good to take too many.

538
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:29,279
But Qian Qian insisted on taking them.

539
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:32,880
Girls always want to be pretty.

540
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:35,799
I'd like to ask you something.

541
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,640
What's the patient's father's...

542
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,400
height and weight?

543
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,200
My husband...

544
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,440
is 180cm tall.

545
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,920
I think he weighs around 72kg.

546
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,400
I'm not considered fat...

547
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,799
among middle-aged men.

548
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:52,200
Are there any obese people...

549
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,640
in your family?

550
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,759
My husband and I...

551
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:56,640
are both normal.

552
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,440
But for some reason,

553
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,599
my daughter...

554
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,480
is like that.

555
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,960
At first,

556
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,640
we thought she was sick.

557
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:05,920
All these years,

558
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,000
we've been bringing her to doctors.

559
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,960
But nothing could be found.

560
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:12,279
They just told her to watch her diet...

561
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:13,640
and exercise more.

562
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,279
Did it work?

563
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:16,880
No.

564
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:20,240
She even stopped eating almost all meat and starch.

565
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:22,119
During summer vacation,

566
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:24,519
she only ate apples for a week.

567
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:26,640
But she didn't lose even a pound.

568
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,400
As long as we hear of ways that might work,

569
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,799
we'd give them a try.

570
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:33,400
But they never worked.

571
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:37,200
Dr. Xiao.

572
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,240
Qian Qian has low self-esteem and is sensitive.

573
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:43,440
I hope you can be more considerate of her emotions.

574
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,720
When you talk to her,

575
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,559
I hope you won't mention her weight.

576
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:49,359
Don't worry about that.

577
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,880
We'll be careful.

578
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:52,839
Thank you, Dr. Xiao.

579
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,960
Thank you.

580
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:57,240
The patient is not...

581
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,400
biologically obese.

582
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,880
I think it's pathological.

583
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:01,359
So what do you plan to do?

584
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,480
Let's get her on the scale and weigh her.

585
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:07,400
Exact weight...

586
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,000
is the basis of all treatments.

587
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,119
But didn't her mom say this?

588
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,239
She's sensitive about her weight.

589
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,519
She still needs to be weighed.

590
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:14,809
How else can we treat her?

591
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:22,960
We're going to weigh you.

592
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,239
No.

593
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,559
Your mom already gave me permission.

594
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:26,809
Permission for what?

595
00:34:27,769 --> 00:34:29,159
For me to get tested?

596
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,000
To see if I'm fat or not?

597
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,679
Don't waste your energy.

598
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,239
I've done so many tests all these years.

599
00:34:36,519 --> 00:34:38,000
The results are all the same.

600
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:40,480
I'm going to die of obesity.

601
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:42,239
I'm a fatty!

602
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,400
I'm sick of all of you looking down at me.

603
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:47,079
As if I'm not human...

604
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:48,809
but a walking lump of meat!

605
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,719
That's right.

606
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,159
I'm fat.

607
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:53,599
I'm short,

608
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:54,599
fat,

609
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:55,679
and ugly.

610
00:34:56,329 --> 00:34:57,840
So what?

611
00:34:58,289 --> 00:35:00,360
You normal people will never understand this feeling...

612
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,639
of hating yourself!

613
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,480
Actually,

614
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:12,329
I understand how you feel.

615
00:35:14,769 --> 00:35:16,199
Let me tell you a little secret.

616
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:19,329
You see,

617
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:21,159
when I was in junior high school,

618
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:22,639
I was given a nickname.

619
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:24,039
My classmates called me a toad.

620
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:25,769
Do you know why?

621
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,480
Because at that time,

622
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,519
I had pimples all over my face.

623
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,039
Look. I still have scars.

624
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,119
Right here. Isn't it obvious?

625
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,079
At that time,

626
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,480
I had pimples...

627
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:45,239
on my face and neck.

628
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,039
I wished they would disappear so badly,

629
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:49,679
so I would pick them...

630
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:50,920
until my face was covered in blood.

631
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:52,920
Luckily, my mom found out.

632
00:35:53,289 --> 00:35:54,960
She thought...

633
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,360
pimples on the face during puberty was normal...

634
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,440
and I'd be fine once I'm past the hormonal instability period.

635
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:02,480
But she didn't think I'd be so sensitive...

636
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:03,920
and hate myself so much.

637
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:07,079
So during that time,

638
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:09,769
she took me to several hospitals and beauty parlors.

639
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,440
It took us about...

640
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,769
a year or two...

641
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,289
to get rid of the pimples.

642
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,400
My parents also took me to many hospitals.

643
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,880
This is their love for us.

644
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,679
To be honest, I still don't know...

645
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:25,639
if the high cost of treatment played a role...

646
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:27,920
or just that my puberty was over.

647
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,840
But those two years...

648
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:31,719
were really hard for me.

649
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:34,159
Maybe it's the same as you now.

650
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:37,289
What a coincidence.

651
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:39,159
Me too.

652
00:36:40,809 --> 00:36:41,840
When I was young,

653
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,119
I was very short.

654
00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:46,639
My brother is only two years older than me.

655
00:36:46,809 --> 00:36:48,719
But he was one head taller than me.

656
00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:50,769
He was the main player of the school's basketball team...

657
00:36:50,769 --> 00:36:52,880
while I couldn't even make it into the basketball team.

658
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:55,199
My classmates always teased me.

659
00:36:55,329 --> 00:36:57,239
They asked if my brother and I were blood-related...

660
00:36:57,809 --> 00:36:59,809
and even said that I lowered...

661
00:36:59,809 --> 00:37:00,920
my family's average height.

662
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,840
So back then,

663
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,880
I really hated it when people compared me...

664
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:06,360
to my brother.

665
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,679
And then?

666
00:37:08,329 --> 00:37:10,199
And I want to tell you...

667
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:12,119
that genes are mighty.

668
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,039
When I was around 20 years old,

669
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:17,199
I started growing like crazy.

670
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,000
I suddenly grew 30cm.

671
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,559
In one go, I surpassed my brother's height.

672
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,559
That's how I ended up like this.

673
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:25,360
My brother said...

674
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,039
I transformed.

675
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:31,519
Think about your mom.

676
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,329
Your family has good genes.

677
00:37:33,329 --> 00:37:35,329
If you believe it, you can be like her too.

678
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:47,769
Then...

679
00:37:48,289 --> 00:37:50,039
let's take this first step.

680
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,159
You're really amazing, Dr. Bai.

681
00:38:19,289 --> 00:38:21,079
At 20, epiphyseal lines have already closed.

682
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,840
But you could still grow so much.

683
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,360
You're gifted.

684
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,289
You were trying so hard to make up a story.

685
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,000
I had to cooperate.

686
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:29,360
I didn't make it up.

687
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:31,400
I used to have a lot of pimples.

688
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:35,329
You can't tell now...

689
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:38,239
but I was a runt too when I was young.

690
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,119
You noticed it just now, didn't you?

691
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:44,480
That patient...

692
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:46,289
seems to have an injury on her leg.

693
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,119
When she walks, she limps a little.

694
00:38:50,809 --> 00:38:51,960
Thank you.

695
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,329
Does it hurt?

696
00:39:00,329 --> 00:39:01,329
A little.

697
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,360
- Here? - A little too.

698
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:05,559
Doctor.

699
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,719
Is liposuction dangerous?

700
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:10,000
All surgeries have risks.

701
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:12,599
I thought about getting liposuction to lose weight.

702
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,840
If you're biologically obese...

703
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,039
and not pathologically,

704
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:18,440
I think liposuction is a good choice.

705
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,079
You're not against it?

706
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:21,599
Why would I be?

707
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,679
You're an adult.

708
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:25,440
Your body is in your own hands.

709
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,329
But of course, I'm not encouraging you.

710
00:39:28,769 --> 00:39:31,119
As for whether you're biologically or pathological obese,

711
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:33,480
we'll have to wait for the test results to see.

712
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:34,920
But I have to warn you.

713
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,769
Plastic surgery comes with risks.

714
00:39:36,809 --> 00:39:38,000
You have to think carefully.

715
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:39,159
Dr. Xiao.

716
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,519
Thank you.

717
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:42,769
You're different from the doctors I've met before.

718
00:39:43,769 --> 00:39:45,840
Doctors only want what's best for their patients.

719
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:49,039
You'll take an X-ray this afternoon.

720
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:50,289
Dr. Tang will take you there.

721
00:39:56,199 --> 00:39:58,360
Ma'am, where do you feel unwell?

722
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:00,079
- I have a cold. - A cold?

723
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:01,880
Is this the medicine the doctor prescribed you?

724
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,559
Have you heard of this saying?

725
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:04,960
When you get sick,

726
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,639
take medicine for seven days and you'll be cured.

727
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:08,239
Take no medicine, and you'll be cured in one go.

728
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:09,679
Have you heard of it?

729
00:40:09,769 --> 00:40:10,880
I think so.

730
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:12,159
You've heard of it, right?

731
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:13,639
85 percent of medicine...

732
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:15,440
is ineffective.

733
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,599
The best treatment for patients...

734
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,360
is minimal medical intervention.

735
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,480
Getting a fever from a cold is a good thing.

736
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,559
It's the human body detoxifying properly.

737
00:40:25,769 --> 00:40:26,880
You can't take medicine.

738
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,559
It's actually bad for your health.

739
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,679
What can you do for good health?

740
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:32,960
The key is to replenish nutrients.

741
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:35,920
Look. This is our company's all-natural juice...

742
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,599
developed with...

743
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,719
the most advanced technology in the world.

744
00:40:39,769 --> 00:40:42,719
It is composed of four kinds of high-nutrition fruits.

745
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,440
Gac, sea-buckthorn,

746
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,840
beach rose, and goji berries.

747
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,480
It's rich in all vitamins and trace elements...

748
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:49,480
needed by the human body.

749
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,880
If you get sick, you won't have to come to the hospital.

750
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,599
Just drink this all-natural juice.

751
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,639
It can completely heal...

752
00:40:56,809 --> 00:40:58,719
All-natural juice?

753
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:01,119
Who told you not to come to the hospital when you're sick?

754
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:02,599
Statistics from international authoritative organizations show...

755
00:41:04,289 --> 00:41:05,360
that in this world,

756
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,639
30% of people die...

757
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:08,960
from adverse reactions to medications.

758
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:11,880
Misdiagnosis rate of common diseases is as high as 27%.

759
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,840
Misdiagnosis rate of major diseases is as high as 40%.

760
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,480
85% of medicine is ineffective.

761
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:19,880
For a patient, the best solution...

762
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:21,440
is to reduce as much medical intervention as possible.

763
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,329
Because 30% to 40% of surgeries...

764
00:41:23,329 --> 00:41:24,769
aren't even necessary!

765
00:41:24,809 --> 00:41:26,559
You're quite eloquent.

766
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:28,519
I've been practicing medicine for many years.

767
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:30,000
But I've never heard...

768
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,289
of the statistics you just mentioned.

769
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,119
Then you're too ignorant.

770
00:41:34,329 --> 00:41:35,400
Fine.

771
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,880
Now, it's my turn to explain to you.

772
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,079
Tongshan Hospital...

773
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:41,159
forbids all sale of any health care products.

774
00:41:41,289 --> 00:41:42,440
Please leave now.

775
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:43,639
Stop harassing our patients.

776
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,159
No, I'm not trying to sell anything.

777
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:46,480
- I'm trying to help... - If you don't leave now,

778
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:47,809
I'm going to call security.

779
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:54,920
How ignorant.

780
00:41:57,719 --> 00:41:58,840
It seems like...

781
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,239
you haven't had enough juice.

782
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,079
I'm detoxifying.

783
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,960
Ma'am.

784
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,480
This is my business card.

785
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:06,719
Call me if you need anything.

786
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,719
Call me.

787
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,079
Should I take a look at you?

788
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,289
Ma'am, ignore people like that.

789
00:42:16,289 --> 00:42:17,289
She's a liar.

790
00:42:17,289 --> 00:42:18,480
I just listened for fun.

791
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:20,599
How can the sick not come to the hospital?

792
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,289
She's harming others.

793
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,480
- Thank you, doctor. - You're welcome.

794
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,519
Dr. Xiao.

795
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:34,639
Dr. Xiao.

796
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,329
Come and sit here.

797
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,679
Dr. Xiao.

798
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:50,199
Was your face full of pimples...

799
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:51,559
when you were young?

800
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:54,289
How did you get better? It's amazing.
