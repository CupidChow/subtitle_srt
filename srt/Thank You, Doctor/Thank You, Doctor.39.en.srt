(Adapted from Sheng Li's novel "ICU 48 Hours")

3
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,959
(Episode 39)

4
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,159
Hematuria and proteinuria.

5
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,159
It's a classic case of acute nephritic syndrome.

6
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:39,640
You're something.

7
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,958
You have acute nephritis.

8
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,280
How can you take your own medicine?

9
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,840
You're a medical student.

10
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,439
Isn't it just a cold?

11
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,760
How is it nephritis?

12
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:48,319
Tell me...

13
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:50,760
the pathology and pathogenesis of acute nephritis.

14
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:53,400
Xiao Yan, I'm a patient now.

15
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,599
Okay, I'll stop joking with you.

16
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:57,159
Go ahead with the admission procedure.

17
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,840
Admission?

18
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,400
My flight is tomorrow.

19
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,560
Then I'm afraid you won't be able to fly.

20
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,760
You need to be hospitalized to fight the infection...

21
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,840
and have your urine and kidney function checked.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,530
If necessary, a kidney biopsy.

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,318
It's just nephritis.

24
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:13,120
Why do I need a kidney biopsy?

25
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,679
Doctor.

26
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,680
Doctor!

27
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:21,759
Xiao Min is...

28
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,479
V-fib. Prepare to defibrillate.

29
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:25,810
- Charge to 200 joules. - Family members, please leave.

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,319
Charged to 200 joules.

31
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,840
Clear.

32
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,960
Charge to 200 joules again.

33
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,479
Charged to 200 joules.

34
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,479
- Charged. - Clear.

35
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,879
200 joules again.

36
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,919
One milligram of epinephrine, stat.

37
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:00,039
Stat.

38
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,039
Clear.

39
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,839
Dr. Lu.

40
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,359
Under normal circumstances,

41
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,799
a week after the surgery,

42
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,399
the patient can be removed from the ECMO.

43
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,438
But...

44
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:24,840
the patient has severe heart failure.

45
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,400
Once the flow decreases,

46
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,280
there is arrhythmia...

47
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,360
and worsening heart failure.

48
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,400
So she can't be removed from the ECMO.

49
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,599
Her lung function...

50
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:33,879
hasn't improved at all.

51
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:38,039
The third round will be tough.

52
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:40,360
A lung transplant is the only way now.

53
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,639
Sun Fang Min's case is a special one.

54
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:44,360
Even if you give her a lung transplant,

55
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,519
in her case,

56
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,479
the survival rate is only 50 to 60 percent at most.

57
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,800
Without a transplant, she can only wait for death.

58
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:50,960
That's right, Dr. Lu.

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,319
As long as there's hope,

60
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,360
we have to save her.

61
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,800
If we take the risk...

62
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,919
and give her a lung transplant,

63
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,680
should anything go wrong,

64
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,639
the blame is not only on the EICU.

65
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,560
It's on the entire Tongshan Hospital.

66
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,159
We're all to blame.

67
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,360
- Dr. Lu, we're doctors. - I know what you're trying to say.

68
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,198
You want to gamble...

69
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,560
on the future of the EICU, right?

70
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:13,879
Dr. Lu.

71
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,400
We really can't watch her die without helping.

72
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,560
Dr. Lu.

73
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,839
We can't just watch her die.

74
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,170
How about this?

75
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,319
If the patient herself agrees,

76
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,480
we'll give her a transplant.

77
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,049
If you consent to a lung transplant,

78
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,079
nod your head.

79
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:48,610
Doctor, she says she'll do it.

80
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,198
Thank you for trusting us.

81
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,480
We'll do our best.

82
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,199
You can watch your son grow up.

83
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,610
You can become a good mother.

84
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,610
Thank you, doctor.

85
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:02,839
Thank you.

86
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,279
According to clinical cases,

87
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,279
those waiting for a lung source for more than 30 days...

88
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:13,800
and are on life support on the ECMO...

89
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,639
mostly won't survive.

90
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,170
So hurry and get Sun Fang Min in line.

91
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:20,519
See if we can get matching lungs.

92
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,839
What's the patient's condition?

93
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,198
The patient's oxygen level is still dropping.

94
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,839
Her lung function can hardly be maintained.

95
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:32,600
And she's still unconscious.

96
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:33,839
A lung transplant is the only way.

97
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,120
Can she make it through today?

98
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,800
The chance is slim.

99
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,559
- Got it! - Got what?

100
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,879
A lung donor!

101
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,278
Great news.

102
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:49,879
The lung donor and the patient are a match.

103
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:52,000
That's great.

104
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,399
That's great!

105
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,720
Dr. Lu.

106
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:55,958
Let's hurry with the surgery.

107
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,079
Please calm down.

108
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,439
The lung has just been removed from the donor.

109
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,318
It will take half an hour to get here at the fastest.

110
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,438
But don't worry.

111
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:04,319
Our hospital has prepared for the operation.

112
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:06,518
The chief of thoracic surgery, Dr. Li will operate.

113
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,559
Once the lungs arrive,

114
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,279
we'll proceed with the transplant right away.

115
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,959
Thank you, Dr. Lu.

116
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,319
Thank you.

117
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,398
Mr. Lu, where did the lung donor come from?

118
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,438
It's a coincidence.

119
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:20,199
A young man was in an accident yesterday.

120
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,679
He was taken to the ICU at Xinrui Hospital...

121
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,240
but he couldn't be saved.

122
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,399
When he was alive,

123
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,399
he signed the organ donation agreement.

124
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,639
His lungs are just right for Sun Fang Min.

125
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:32,560
How can I not be anxious when a person's life is at stake?

126
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:36,319
Didn't he sign the organ donation agreement?

127
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,559
Talk to the patient's family, okay?

128
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,560
What's going on?

129
00:06:41,561 --> 00:06:43,319
I think his family refused to donate.

130
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,638
Isn't that ridiculous?

131
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,639
How about this?

132
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,319
I'll give you another 30 minutes.

133
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,879
You have to deliver the lungs.

134
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,720
Dr. Lu.

135
00:06:50,721 --> 00:06:52,399
Dr. Lu, how are the lungs?

136
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:53,800
There's a small problem.

137
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,240
We got the lung donor.

138
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,359
But when the donor's grandparents arrived at the hospital,

139
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,879
they refused to have the lungs delivered.

140
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,879
It's about saving someone's life! Why are they backing out now?

141
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,120
What should we do now?

142
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:03,959
What can we do? We can only wait.

143
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,078
Sun Fang Min's lungs don't work at all now.

144
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:08,839
- Her body is deteriorating rapidly. - Dr. Lu.

145
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:10,240
Sun Fang Min's condition isn't good.

146
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,480
Xiao Min.

147
00:07:12,481 --> 00:07:14,638
- Doctor. - I'm here.

148
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,639
Family members, please leave.

149
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,239
Family members, please come out.

150
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,720
Mom, let's go.

151
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,039
Xiao Min, hang in there.

152
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,120
Please keep it down.

153
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,480
Mom.

154
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:24,560
Dr. Lu.

155
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,040
Why aren't the lungs here yet?

156
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,120
Soon.

157
00:07:28,121 --> 00:07:29,639
Don't panic. They'll be there soon.

158
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,920
Why so slow?

159
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:33,279
They're going as fast as they can.

160
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:34,480
Please wait a little longer.

161
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,319
What should we do?

162
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:37,600
Xiao Min will make it, Mom.

163
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:38,800
Don't worry.

164
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,680
Doctor, how is she?

165
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,360
Don't worry.

166
00:07:44,361 --> 00:07:45,800
The patient's condition is stable now.

167
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,120
Thank you.

168
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,680
Thank goodness.

169
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,040
We can't have any more accidents.

170
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:54,040
We can't have any more accidents.

171
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,560
Dr. Lu, we can't wait any longer.

172
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,800
If we don't wait, what else can we do?

173
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,600
I'll go to Xinrui Hospital...

174
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:02,720
to retrieve the lungs.

175
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,519
I'm sure I can convince the donor's family.

176
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:07,039
It's the evening rush hour.

177
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,799
There's a lot of traffic. You might not make it.

178
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,680
I'll take the motorbike. I won't be stuck.

179
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,758
That's fine too.

180
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,560
- Be careful. - Okay.

181
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,680
I'll go with you.

182
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,559
Don't just stand there. Hurry up.

183
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,560
Go.

184
00:08:18,561 --> 00:08:20,160
- Two is better than one. - Okay.

185
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,360
Hold on tight.

186
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,959
Let's go.

187
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,879
God help us.

188
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,679
God bless my child.

189
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:52,399
- Xiao Min. - My dear Xiao Min.

190
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,999
You must hang in there.

191
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,090
God help us.

192
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,639
The lungs will be here soon.

193
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:58,210
God help us.

194
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,090
God help us.

195
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,600
God help us.

196
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:04,639
God help us.

197
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,919
I'll never agree to it.

198
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,519
- But... - Hao Hao...

199
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:17,000
won't be able to rest in peace.

200
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:18,159
Dad.

201
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,878
This is his last wish.

202
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:20,918
Shut up!

203
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:22,360
You trash! I'll beat you up!

204
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,559
Dr. Gao.

205
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:25,599
- This is Dr. Gao. - Hello.

206
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,480
We're from the EICU of Tongshan Hospital.

207
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:28,759
- We're here to retrieve... - What?

208
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,919
You're the ones...

209
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,919
who want my eldest grandson's lungs?

210
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,450
They are Hao Hao's family.

211
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,519
We understand how you feel right now.

212
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,120
- But... - Do you?

213
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:42,519
It's good that you understand.

214
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:44,399
Don't stay here.

215
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,999
Don't even think about my eldest grandson.

216
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,330
Just leave, okay?

217
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,719
Don't get any ideas about my eldest grandson.

218
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,039
Dad, calm down.

219
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,210
Come on, let's sit down.

220
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,399
Dad.

221
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:01,799
- Hao Hao... - Sirs and madam.

222
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:04,960
We really do understand how you feel.

223
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,450
We're doctors from the EICU of Tongshan Hospital.

224
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,210
I know that talking about this now...

225
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,000
is too cruel for you.

226
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,720
But I have to tell you this.

227
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,960
We have a patient who is in very critical condition.

228
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,519
A second late...

229
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:18,839
and she could die at any time.

230
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,039
I know you need the lungs desperately.

231
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:23,039
I'm willing to respect Hao Hao's last wish.

232
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:24,600
But...

233
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,799
as you can see,

234
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,159
my dad...

235
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,600
Although I've never met Hao Hao,

236
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:31,720
I believe...

237
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,399
he was a sensible...

238
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,559
and good kid who helped others.

239
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:36,799
Yes.

240
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,480
He was so young.

241
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,210
But he made such a brave decision.

242
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,159
It must have to do with your teaching.

243
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,399
Since he signed the agreement,

244
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,919
that means he wants to help others.

245
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:51,210
His lungs could save another life right now.

246
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,279
I'm sure he'll be happy if he knew.

247
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:56,679
All right. Stop trying to lecture us.

248
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,798
This or that agreement,

249
00:10:58,799 --> 00:10:59,840
I don't understand at all.

250
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,719
No matter what happens today,

251
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,119
I won't let you take...

252
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,999
my eldest grandson's lungs!

253
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,038
Sir.

254
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:07,959
We had a patient...

255
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,639
who was in a car accident too.

256
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,999
On his deathbed,

257
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,480
he signed the agreement.

258
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:14,559
His cornea is helping someone now.

259
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:16,158
This is also a kind of continuation of life.

260
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:17,799
- Yes, that's right. - Miss.

261
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,639
We understand what you're saying.

262
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,720
But we've just lost our eldest grandson.

263
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,918
We can't get over it.

264
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,039
That's right.

265
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,240
We don't care about other people's business.

266
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,960
Anyway, let me tell you.

267
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,559
Don't you dare try...

268
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:35,399
to take my eldest grandson's lungs away from me.

269
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,599
Don't even think about it.

270
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,679
Sir.

271
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,878
- We understand... - Say no more.

272
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:42,200
I'm asking you to leave. Please leave.

273
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:44,038
- If you don't leave, I... - Dad.

274
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:45,480
- Calm down. - Get out of here.

275
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,398
Get out of here!

276
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,559
Dad!

277
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:49,720
Mom!

278
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,600
My son.

279
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,240
Hao Hao was such a poor kid.

280
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,000
When he was just a kid,

281
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,960
his mom passed away.

282
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,038
But he was still so enthusiastic...

283
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:09,759
about life.

284
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:12,120
It's all because...

285
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:14,799
of the education and love we gave him.

286
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,399
Don't be selfish.

287
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,120
Try to empathize with others.

288
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,440
Learn to care and help others.

289
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:28,080
That's how you raised me since I was little.

290
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:31,480
That's also what you've always done, Dad.

291
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So...

292
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm not surprised...

293
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,320
that Hao Hao made that choice.

294
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,480
Dad.

295
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,918
Right now, his choice...

296
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:48,120
can save another life.

297
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,440
Shouldn't we be proud of him, Dad?

298
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:54,200
Yes.

299
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,240
Hao Hao is gone now.

300
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:00,159
Both of you must be sad.

301
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,798
As his dad,

302
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:04,439
I'm even sadder.

303
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,440
Dad...

304
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:07,959
This is the last thing...

305
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,200
I can do for Hao Hao.

306
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:11,519
Dad.

307
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:16,039
Please fulfill his last wish!

308
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,159
Dad!

309
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:19,639
My son.

310
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,120
Hao Hao...

311
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:24,039
Hao Hao...

312
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,440
Hao Hao...

313
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,080
I'm sorry, Hao Hao!

314
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:48,039
We'll be there in 20 minutes.

315
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,279
The lungs will be here soon.

316
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,879
The patient will be moved to the OR.

317
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:04,158
- Okay. - Okay, let's get ready.

318
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:05,839
- Go. - Move her to the OR.

319
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,879
- Got it. - This is great.

320
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,759
- Go. - We'll go first.

321
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,080
- Don't fall. - Be careful.

322
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,600
Make way!

323
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:26,519
- Are you okay? - Yes.

324
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:28,079
Are you okay?

325
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,480
I'll return your helmet later.

326
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,200
Are you okay?

327
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,960
Make way!

328
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,080
Make way!

329
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,798
- Make way! - Make way!

330
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:46,480
- Dr. Lu. - Hurry.

331
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,559
Thank you.

332
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:53,159
Dr. Li, the lungs are here.

333
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:54,758
Okay, let's begin.

334
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:55,799
Scalpel.

335
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:07,158
I hope there won't be...

336
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:08,559
another surgery like this one.

337
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:10,239
I hope that other patients...

338
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,639
with pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis...

339
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:13,159
don't look up to her as a role model.

340
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,960
Not everyone has this kind of luck to escape from death.

341
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,240
Doctor.

342
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,360
Thank you so much.

343
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,678
I'm sorry for the trouble...

344
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:23,758
with Xiao Min illness.

345
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:24,798
Don't mention it.

346
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,080
It's what we should do.

347
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,320
Then will she be okay...

348
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,000
in the future?

349
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,840
If there are no infections or complications after the surgery,

350
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,119
after a good rest,

351
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,119
she'll be the same as a normal person.

352
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,239
And If she recovers well,

353
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,080
she can go hiking and exercise as much as she wants.

354
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:41,320
And...

355
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,200
she must remember to take the anti-rejection medicine.

356
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:46,679
Thank you.

357
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,080
Thank you.

358
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:50,480
Thank you.

359
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:52,799
We're not in a hurry.

360
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:53,919
You drive.

361
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,080
We can take the motorbike.

362
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,240
I'm used to you riding a motorbike.

363
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,559
What are you thinking about?

364
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,679
If Hao Hao's dad didn't kneel today,

365
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,080
we wouldn't have gotten the lungs.

366
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:41,399
I was thinking...

367
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,240
what it was...

368
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,639
that made him do it.

369
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:45,919
A father's love.

370
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:48,480
I want to ask you a question.

371
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,639
Go ahead.

372
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,519
What is a father's love?

373
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,679
Am I writing an essay for a college entrance exam?

374
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:56,799
I refuse to answer.

375
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,399
If you answer it well,

376
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,000
I'll let you in on a little secret.

377
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,799
Sure.

378
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,119
A father's love...

379
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:09,680
is not as natural and innate...

380
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,559
as a mother's love.

381
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:14,039
It's more like...

382
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,319
something that has been awoken at a certain point.

383
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,359
I can't understand its entirety.

384
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,519
But at least,

385
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,359
I experienced most of it.

386
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:25,039
When I first started taking care of Xiao Guang,

387
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,170
nothing went right.

388
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,359
Until one night...

389
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:31,119
when he woke up from a dream.

390
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:33,720
He called my name and was looking for me.

391
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,410
I felt...

392
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:37,890
my traces on him.

393
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:41,000
That's when...

394
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:44,000
developed a feeling that's like a father's love.

395
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:48,170
In that case,

396
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:51,240
a mother's love is more like a home.

397
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,999
A father's love is like the road to the world...

398
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,680
in front of the home.

399
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:58,079
Doesn't every father hope...

400
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,920
to pave the road for his children?

401
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:01,680
And that will never change.

402
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:05,599
That's why Hao Hao's dad...

403
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,839
did what he did today...

404
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,240
to fulfill his son's wish.

405
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:11,890
What gave him the power was a father's love.

406
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,519
To any family that has lost a child,

407
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,519
getting them to donate their organs is not easy.

408
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,519
I can understand...

409
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,839
the way his grandparents behaved.

410
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:22,519
But in the end,

411
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,440
the determined elders...

412
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:25,759
eventually let go.

413
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,720
Isn't it also because of love?

414
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:30,650
People are complicated.

415
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,039
But it's precisely because of this emotional bond...

416
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,480
that it could be passed on.

417
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:36,758
That life...

418
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:38,839
can be passed on in another way.

419
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:43,890
I'm done.

420
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,170
What's your secret?

421
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:52,920
That doesn't count.

422
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,650
Say another one.

423
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,200
Tell me one more.

424
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:01,079
Fine, you don't have to.

425
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:03,170
Then you owe me a secret.

426
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,359
Are the elders all right?

427
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:17,559
They're fine.

428
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,650
They're just heartbroken.

429
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,680
They took some medicine and fell asleep.

430
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,170
We came this time...

431
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:27,680
to thank you and the two elders.

432
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:30,559
And to let you know of the result of the surgery.

433
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,200
How is that patient now?

434
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:34,559
The surgery went well.

435
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,440
Your son saved a life.

436
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,759
Hao Hao signed the organ donation agreement...

437
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,170
when he was alive.

438
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,890
As Hao Hao's dad,

439
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,119
I'm proud of what he did.

440
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:54,890
I support it too.

441
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,960
But you should understand...

442
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:58,960
how the elders feel.

443
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:00,679
My parents...

444
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,799
are usually more reasonable...

445
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,559
and kind-hearted than anyone else.

446
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:06,799
But this time,

447
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,410
Hao Hao is gone.

448
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:13,720
Their grandson died before them.

449
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:17,359
They are terribly upset.

450
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:19,079
Yes.

451
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:20,680
We can understand.

452
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,680
We Chinese put emphasis on having an intact body for burial.

453
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:25,119
Organ donation...

454
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,890
is only developed in modern medicine.

455
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,518
It's not just the two elders.

456
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:29,519
Even youngsters...

457
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:31,170
are unable to accept it.

458
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:33,170
You've done very well.

459
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,409
Hao Hao's life will continue...

460
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,720
in another form.

461
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,480
We're proud of him too.

462
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:42,440
Since there's nothing else,

463
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,359
we'll get going.

464
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:45,799
We won't disturb you anymore.

465
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,519
- Thank you. - Thank you.

466
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:50,480
Let's go.

467
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:02,440
Tired?

468
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,960
A little.

469
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,039
Take a nap.

470
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,599
We're here.

471
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,960
Your ears hurt?

472
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,519
I feel like they're buzzing.

473
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,839
I don't know why.

474
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,440
Try pressing here.

475
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:08,880
That happens to me all the time.

476
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:10,839
Press here?

477
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:14,200
It's not working.

478
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,480
Harder.

479
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:17,200
It's still not working.

480
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,160
Don't move. Like this.

481
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:23,079
That's right.

482
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,559
- Is it better? - I think so.

483
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:49,479
Xiao Yan.

484
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,519
Xiao Yan.

485
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:19,880
(Xiao Yan, I really like you!)

486
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,599
(Get home safe, see you tomorrow.)

487
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,599
(Get home safe.)

488
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,519
What are you looking at?

489
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:37,200
Are you serious?

490
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,559
You two are being reproved but you're still happy?

491
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,038
Can't I be?

492
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,720
Do you have a fever?

493
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:53,759
There's something up with you today.

494
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,559
Did you two...

495
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,200
Why is your mind so dirty?

496
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,440
Then why are you so happy?

497
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,279
I told her...

498
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,240
I liked her.

499
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:12,480
She said yes?

500
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:14,559
She told me...

501
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:16,920
to get home safely.

502
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,039
And?

503
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,559
That's it.

504
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,838
What's wrong with you?

505
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:25,240
What's wrong with you?

506
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:26,960
She was concerned about me.

507
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,920
That means we still have a chance.

508
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:31,199
Are you mad?

509
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,640
She meant she wanted you to leave.

510
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:34,960
What hope do you have?

511
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,200
Shut up!

512
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:37,359
You don't get it.

513
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,920
I know more than you, okay?

514
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:42,279
- It's for Xiao Yan? - None of your business.

515
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,720
Give me a bite.

516
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,880
It's for Xiao Yan.

517
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:52,759
My head hurts.

518
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,359
It's okay. As long as you're happy.

519
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,480
I'll get back to work.

520
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,880
Bye.

521
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,039
Dr. Xiao.

522
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:10,720
- Good morning. - You haven't had breakfast, right?

523
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,079
I've had breakfast.

524
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,079
- Why don't you keep it... - It's fine.

525
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,680
You can still eat more.

526
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,960
We have a lot of work to do today.

527
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,240
You need energy.

528
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,480
I asked my friend to send the coffee beans...

529
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,599
Sorry, I need to take this call.

530
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:34,359
Shirley.

531
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,960
Your application came through.

532
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,440
That's great.

533
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,319
Welcome back.

534
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,559
Thank you, Catherine. Thank you.

535
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,519
Bye.

536
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:08,680
Dad! Mom!

537
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,279
Xiao Min.

538
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,960
Xiao Min.

539
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:17,160
Xiao Min.

540
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,079
You're awake.

541
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:24,200
Am I alive?

542
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,920
You're alive.

543
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,119
Of course, you're alive.

544
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,319
I told you.

545
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:36,640
I'm tough.

546
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,160
You're tough.

547
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:40,920
You're so tough.

548
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,919
Dr. Lu, come and take a look!

549
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,719
- What's wrong? - Some drunkard got hurt in a fight.

550
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,038
Ms. Jiang asked him a few questions...

551
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,799
but he went crazy and hit her!

552
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,640
Call security!

553
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:57,559
Don't you know how to treat a patient?

554
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,640
Let go!

555
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,920
What are you doing?

556
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,119
Let go!

557
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:03,480
What are you doing?

558
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,758
- Dr. Lu! - Call security!

559
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:08,119
- Excuse me. - Let go!

560
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,518
- Let go! - Call security!

561
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:12,400
- Let go! - Get up!

562
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:14,319
Let go of me.

563
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,839
- Are you okay? - Come to the station.

564
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:20,879
Are you okay?

565
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,000
I think I sprained my leg.

566
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,318
- Slowly. - I'm fine.

567
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:24,319
Here, put your arm around me.

568
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:25,799
Slowly.

569
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:29,240
It's cold. Let me help you.

570
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:30,679
- I'll do it myself. - No, it's too cold.

571
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,480
No, I can do it myself.

572
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,759
Let me get you a towel.

573
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,799
Does it hurt?

574
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:01,160
Dr. Lu.

575
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,759
Thank you.

576
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,000
You're taking care of me again.

577
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:06,839
It's nothing.

578
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,039
After what happened to Xian Yun,

579
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,359
I saw how hard it was for you.

580
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,319
I've seen it all.

581
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,920
As a colleague,

582
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,880
I can't be of much help.

583
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:30,200
I admit that I have feelings for you.

584
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,319
But I really understand your situation.

585
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:36,039
I also respect...

586
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,799
your relationship with Xian Yun.

587
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,240
I never thought to bother you two.

588
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:43,480
After Xian Yun passed away,

589
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,519
I know how sad you are.

590
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:49,480
But...

591
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:52,319
life must go on, don't you agree?

592
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,720
That's why if I can help you,

593
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,079
I'll do it.

594
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,599
Be it at work...

595
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:03,680
or in life.

596
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,960
I understand...

597
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,440
your feelings for me.

598
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:10,599
But...

599
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,160
I'm sorry.

600
00:30:12,161 --> 00:30:13,440
Don't be sad.

601
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,519
As colleagues,

602
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,960
we've fought side by side for so many years.

603
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,079
There's an understanding between us.

604
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:31,359
As for what happened today,

605
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:33,119
I would still step in...

606
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,920
even if it were someone else...

607
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,599
as I'm the chief of the EICU.

608
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,920
Thank you.

609
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,920
Let's not be so courteous.

610
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,279
Your leg...

611
00:30:56,519 --> 00:30:57,558
It's fine.

612
00:30:57,559 --> 00:30:58,559
I'm old.

613
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,639
It's easy to pull the wrong muscle.

614
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,960
I'll be fine after putting on some pain relief patches.

615
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,440
I'll get you some then.

616
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,319
- There's no need. - Sit still.

617
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,480
Don't move.

618
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,920
You've just recovered from the nephritis.

619
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,559
You have to be careful and don't overwork yourself.

620
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,278
Don't eat too much.

621
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,719
Measure your blood pressure frequently.

622
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,959
If your blood pressure rises,

623
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,959
take the blood pressure medicine following the doctor's advise.

624
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,480
- Okay? - Okay, Xiao Yan.

625
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:34,640
If you keep nagging,

626
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,279
you'll be just like our mom.

627
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:37,680
I'm just concerned about you.

628
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,039
Actually, before I came,

629
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:41,839
I was thinking of convincing you to go back.

630
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,039
But after some observation,

631
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:46,440
I realized you seem to be in good condition lately.

632
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,279
Seems like you're used to the life in Shanghai.

633
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:50,880
So if you want to stay here,

634
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:52,200
I support you.

635
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:55,359
All right, Xiao Yan.

636
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,079
There will always be a time of separation.

637
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:58,640
You can get back to work.

638
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,039
Be careful.

639
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:08,559
Come.

640
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,200
Future brother-in-law,

641
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:11,599
good luck.

642
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,079
Don't worry.

643
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:15,559
I'll get going.

644
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:16,640
- Bye. - Bye.

645
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:21,039
What did he say to you?

646
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,039
Do you want to know?

647
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,240
I won't tell you.

648
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:33,719
Okay, call me if you need anything.

649
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,720
- Okay. - Dr. Lu.

650
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,200
Take a look at this.

651
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,440
What is it?

652
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,000
Sun Fang Min posted a video online.

653
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,798
She's encouraging other patients...

654
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,240
with pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis...

655
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:47,480
to be like her,

656
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,960
get pregnant and have a baby.

657
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:51,319
...a very cute baby boy.

658
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:53,880
Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis...

659
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:56,599
is a rare respiratory system disease.

660
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,479
Once you reach the advanced stage,

661
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,799
you can't carry a child.

662
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,440
Then how did I...

663
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,559
escape from death?

664
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,400
I'd like to share with everyone...

665
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,200
I know you want to share with everyone...

666
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,480
the beautiful feeling of being pregnant.

667
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:17,279
I understand that.

668
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:18,920
However,

669
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:20,558
you can't encourage other patients...

670
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,160
who have the same illness as you...

671
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:24,200
to ignore the doctor's advice and get pregnant.

672
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:25,399
Do you know?

673
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,039
A successful case like yours is even rarer.

674
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:29,480
By encouraging them,

675
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,200
you're misleading them.

676
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,400
You'll end up harming them, do you understand?

677
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:36,440
I'm sorry.

678
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:38,480
I didn't think that far.

679
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:39,920
I just wanted...

680
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:41,519
to give patients like me...

681
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,839
a little hope.

682
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,960
You're harming them by doing that.

683
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:46,839
They're losing more than hope.

684
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,319
They may even lose their lives.

685
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,920
It's that serious?

686
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:52,240
What should we do then?

687
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,200
Why don't I record another video?

688
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:57,078
Like that, more people will know about your case...

689
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:58,960
and see you as a role model.

690
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,160
You should delete the video now...

691
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,319
and say no more.

692
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,319
Okay. I'll delete the video now.

693
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,000
I'm sorry.

694
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,809
I've caused you trouble.

695
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,960
Dr. Lu.

696
00:34:19,289 --> 00:34:21,079
Someone is waiting for you in your office.

697
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,288
Who?

698
00:34:22,289 --> 00:34:23,360
He, the reporter.

699
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:24,719
Mr. He?

700
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,079
Did he need something?

701
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:28,809
I think it's for the pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis patient.

702
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,159
Tell him I'm out for a meeting.

703
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:38,239
I'll go check.

704
00:34:40,809 --> 00:34:42,809
Thank you Dr. Lu for doing an interview with us.

705
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,079
So everyone,

706
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,329
now...

707
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:48,329
Can you turn off the camera?

708
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,519
What's wrong, Dr. Lu?

709
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,920
Because this case...

710
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,289
is not suitable to be broadcasted to the media.

711
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,400
Turn the camera off first. Let me explain why.

712
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:00,809
Okay. Turn it off first.

713
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:03,879
You're here to interview me...

714
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,518
about the patient with pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis.

715
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:08,239
I'm sure you know about this disease then, right?

716
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:11,879
For a patient with pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis...

717
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,119
in the advanced stage,

718
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:14,769
pregnancy is prohibited.

719
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:16,440
Once pregnant,

720
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:18,480
their life will be in great danger.

721
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:20,599
But Sun Fang Min made it.

722
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:22,639
Sun Fang Min is an exception.

723
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:24,719
Such an isolated case can't be replicated.

724
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,079
But you should know this, Dr. Lu.

725
00:35:26,289 --> 00:35:29,000
Many patients are willing to die if they can have children.

726
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:30,480
It's nature.

727
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:33,329
The choice between motherly love and rationality...

728
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:35,960
is hard for us onlookers to understand.

729
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:37,769
I can strictly tell you...

730
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:40,519
the patient's attitude of not considering their own situation...

731
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:42,039
is a terrible mindset...

732
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:44,039
in my opinion.

733
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:46,079
Having a baby in the name of love...

734
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:48,289
is in fact using the name of love...

735
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,480
to shackle the hospital...

736
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:50,960
and the doctors.

737
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:53,639
And in the process of shackling,

738
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:56,719
the media plays a very bad role.

739
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,960
It seems like...

740
00:36:00,289 --> 00:36:02,440
you're still prejudiced against the media.

741
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:03,769
You can't say that.

742
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,639
Due to the need to spread the news,

743
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,199
you media often hype up...

744
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,718
all kinds of patients who sacrifice themselves...

745
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:11,719
in the name of love...

746
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,960
to have children.

747
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,920
This kind of exalted praise...

748
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:17,000
that is detached from science...

749
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:19,159
can mislead a lot of patients.

750
00:36:19,329 --> 00:36:21,920
They'll think it's okay not to listen to doctors...

751
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:23,329
and take the risk for once.

752
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,920
That they'll be able to survive...

753
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,239
and give birth to a healthy baby.

754
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:28,880
Little do they know...

755
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,329
that behind all this risk...

756
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:32,679
are severe consequences.

757
00:36:32,769 --> 00:36:34,359
Is that why...

758
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,639
you don't want this case...

759
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:37,400
to be spread to the media?

760
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:40,239
It's not just patients...

761
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:42,719
with advanced pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis.

762
00:36:43,329 --> 00:36:44,769
The media often report...

763
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,769
about patients with congenital heart disease,

764
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,920
leukemia,

765
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:49,159
tumors,

766
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,440
and genetic diseases...

767
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:52,440
who are not suitable for pregnancy...

768
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:55,329
yet took the risk and successfully gave birth.

769
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,119
They don't know...

770
00:36:57,159 --> 00:36:58,519
that behind every risk of childbirth,

771
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:00,199
the patients and their families...

772
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,599
are paying a huge price.

773
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,329
For example, the medical expenses.

774
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:06,079
It's an astronomical number.

775
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:08,039
Ordinary families can't even afford it.

776
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:10,289
And the success rate is very low.

777
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:12,679
Behind a successful patient...

778
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,679
are countless tragic families...

779
00:37:14,809 --> 00:37:15,840
with desperation and loss of life,

780
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,199
both mother and child.

781
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,159
That's why by telling you this,

782
00:37:20,329 --> 00:37:21,639
I sincerely hope...

783
00:37:21,769 --> 00:37:23,079
that as a media outlet,

784
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:24,999
we must take the lives of the vast majority of patients...

785
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,559
as the premise.

786
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:28,288
Don't encourage them indirectly...

787
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:29,769
to take the risk.

788
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:35,519
Dr. Lu.

789
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:37,238
I was very inspired by what you said today.

790
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:38,639
I'll have a lot to learn from you.

791
00:37:38,769 --> 00:37:40,289
You flatter me. Let's keep in touch.

792
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,678
- Okay. - Bye.

793
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:42,880
- Bye. - Okay.

794
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,960
Come in.

795
00:37:57,559 --> 00:37:58,719
Did you ask for me?

796
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,039
Come.

797
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:03,079
Have a seat.

798
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:13,399
You've been in Tongshan Hospital's EICU...

799
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,079
for almost half a year, right?

800
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:17,599
So? Are you used to it?

801
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:19,679
I couldn't get used to it at first.

802
00:38:19,809 --> 00:38:21,400
But it's much better now.

803
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:22,769
How so?

804
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,638
When I was in Switzerland,

805
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:26,679
I was just a doctor...

806
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:27,960
who treated patients.

807
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:30,079
After coming to the EICU,

808
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:32,000
I'm not just treating patients.

809
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:33,198
Part of my job...

810
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:35,199
is dealing with the patient's family.

811
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,920
Because of this,

812
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:38,999
I have a better understanding...

813
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,719
of who we are as doctors.

814
00:38:41,289 --> 00:38:42,289
Indeed.

815
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,039
Different national conditions have different requirements for doctors.

816
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:47,159
But I have faith in your skills...

817
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:50,119
to solve any sort of complicated problems.

818
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:52,000
Thank you, Dr. Jiang.

819
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,920
I asked you to come...

820
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,639
because I'd like to ask for your opinion on something.

821
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:01,559
Dr. Lu is managing the EICU well.

822
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,719
The hospital is thinking of promoting him.

823
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:07,360
Previously, you said you could stay with the hospital for a year.

824
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,329
I can see that you get along well with your colleagues.

825
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:14,599
Will you stay?

826
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,679
Dr. Xiao.

827
00:39:17,329 --> 00:39:19,239
You're an excellent doctor.

828
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:21,119
I hope...

829
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:24,239
you can take Tongshan Hospital's EICU...

830
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,039
to another level.

831
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,960
Come in.

832
00:39:43,289 --> 00:39:44,880
Dr. Jiang, you were looking for me?

833
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:49,840
You've been in the EICU for half a year.

834
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,960
You've matured a lot.

835
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,440
It's time to transfer you back to cardiology...

836
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:57,769
or it'll be too late.

837
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,119
Transfer me back?

838
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:00,239
What?

839
00:40:00,329 --> 00:40:01,400
You don't want to?

840
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,039
No, it's not that.

841
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:04,199
Why so suddenly?

842
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:05,289
What do you mean it's too late?

843
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,599
Suddenly?

844
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,039
I'm afraid you're used to being in the EICU...

845
00:40:09,289 --> 00:40:10,920
and don't want to return.

846
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,199
I sent you to the EICU...

847
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,880
because I wanted you to know...

848
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:18,639
that doctors look at not only the disease...

849
00:40:18,809 --> 00:40:19,920
but also the patients.

850
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:21,840
Skills are important.

851
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,289
But you need to learn...

852
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,239
to communicate with the patients and their families.

853
00:40:28,289 --> 00:40:29,639
It's a kind of medical ethics...

854
00:40:29,809 --> 00:40:31,400
and humanistic care.

855
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:32,769
It's very important.

856
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,679
Always keep that in mind.

857
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:37,718
You have to learn...

858
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:40,239
to restrain your bad temper and your so-called personality.

859
00:40:41,289 --> 00:40:42,440
You're good now.

860
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:44,199
You can come back.

861
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:46,239
Dr. Jiang, I know you mean well...

862
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,159
but I want to stay in the EICU.

863
00:40:54,769 --> 00:40:56,039
Have you thought it through?

864
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,639
Yes, I've thought it through.

865
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,719
You can go now. I'm done.

866
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,769
Thank you, Dr. Jiang.

867
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Bai Zhu.

868
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:27,000
- What's the hurry? - Xiao Yan's going to Switzerland.

869
00:41:27,329 --> 00:41:29,519
- A visit or a vacation? - She resigned.

870
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:31,519
She's going back there to work.

871
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,639
Why are you suddenly returning to Switzerland?

872
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,039
It's not sudden.

873
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:38,480
I signed a one-year contract...

874
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:40,239
with Tongshan Hospital.

875
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,480
A few days ago,

876
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:44,079
I got a call from my former director in Switzerland.

877
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:45,559
He wants me to go back.

878
00:41:45,809 --> 00:41:47,719
But there's no rush.

879
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,840
Besides,

880
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,159
it hasn't even been a year yet.

881
00:41:53,329 --> 00:41:55,809
Is it because yesterday, I...

882
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,359
It has nothing to do with you.

883
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,440
Then why?

884
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:01,840
When I was in Switzerland,

885
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,769
I didn't finish my project.

886
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:07,599
I've also learned a lot here.

887
00:42:07,769 --> 00:42:09,880
I wish I could go back and finish my project.

888
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,159
And my parents are there too.

889
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,480
They're old.

890
00:42:13,809 --> 00:42:15,769
I want to be with them.

891
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:19,159
Will you come back...

892
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,559
after going to Switzerland?

893
00:42:20,769 --> 00:42:23,440
I need to finish my project first.

894
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,599
I think Switzerland...

895
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:31,119
would be a better choice for me.

896
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:35,400
Of course, I'm still happy...

897
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:37,000
to have met all of you here.
