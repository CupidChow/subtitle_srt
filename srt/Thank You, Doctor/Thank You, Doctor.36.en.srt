00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:27,200
(Thank You, Doctor)

(Adapted from Sheng Li's novel "ICU 48 Hours")

3
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,000
(Episode 36)

4
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:19,719
You're awake.

5
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,039
Do you still have a fever?

6
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,530
I'm fine. The fever is gone now.

7
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,159
You shouldn't drink too much.

8
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,840
It's not worth it for anyone.

9
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,960
I'll make you some breakfast.

10
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,240
No, it's okay.

11
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,599
I guess you didn't sleep well last night.

12
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,439
You should go home and rest.

13
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,080
Then you should rest well too.

14
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,199
Thank you.

15
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,120
Drinking does mess things up.

16
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,560
Bring the medicine later for the patient.

17
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:35,400
- Okay. - No, doctor.

18
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,319
I don't take medicine.

19
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,080
Well, you see.

20
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:44,560
This medicine is extracted from your all-natural juice.

21
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,680
It's good for your condition.

22
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,240
Really?

23
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,360
Don't forget to take your medicine.

24
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,319
Okay then.

25
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,319
Why are you here?

26
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,360
I'm so sorry.

27
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,400
Who knew?

28
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,280
You actually came to the hospital.

29
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,719
We're all very disappointed.

30
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,439
I'm sorry.

31
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,599
I fainted.

32
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,680
I don't know how I ended up in the hospital.

33
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,199
All right. Let's not talk about that.

34
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:16,680
I came here today to tell you some good news.

35
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,639
We have an upgraded version of our all-natural juice.

36
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:26,120
The nutrition is extracted from eight rare types of fruit.

37
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:28,920
It's more nutritious and more effective.

38
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,399
- Really? - Yes.

39
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,560
Don't get too excited.

40
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:36,120
- That's great. - Yes.

41
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:38,360
That means our health...

42
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,439
is guaranteed, isn't it?

43
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,079
This is such a good juice.

44
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:44,120
Shouldn't we let more people know about it?

45
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,439
That's what we should do.

46
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,399
So the company has decided...

47
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,050
that you can buy 100 bottles first...

48
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,839
to promote it.

49
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:55,360
But I haven't sold all of my previous juices yet.

50
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,120
I don't have that much money now.

51
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:58,730
You sure are forgetful.

52
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,120
Have you forgotten?

53
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,560
Our All-Natural Juice has a partnership with daily loans.

54
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,120
You can get a loan first.

55
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:08,439
After you sell these,

56
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,639
you can pay back the loan slowly.

57
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,800
- Yes. - Am I right?

58
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,170
- She's already so sick. - That's...

59
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,560
Are you still trying to scam her?

60
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:16,879
- Actually... - Listen up.

61
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,199
If you dare visit Li Li again,

62
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,759
I'll hit you every time I see you.

63
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,800
Don't...

64
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:23,079
- You're mistaken. I'm her family. - Sir, this is the hospital.

65
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,319
- Who is your family? - Honey.

66
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,959
Dr. Bai.

67
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,199
Li Li.

68
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,680
- Li Li, are you okay? - Oxygen mask.

69
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,240
It's 5L per minute.

70
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,160
Li Li.

71
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,120
- How is she? - The patient will be fine for now.

72
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,480
Who was that?

73
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
He was the one who got my wife into selling those juices.

74
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,439
I'll catch that scammer sooner or later.

75
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,800
Can I see her now?

76
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:53,560
- Yes. - Thank you.

77
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,240
People nowadays still believe in this kind of pseudoscience?

78
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,560
We should just leave her be since she's so stubborn.

79
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,199
She'll come to her senses if she suffers a bit.

80
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,720
Then why did you lie to that patient...

81
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,000
saying the medicine was extracted from juice?

82
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:11,800
Communication between a doctor and a patient is an art.

83
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,639
You need to use different methods for different patients.

84
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,959
You know me quite well, Dr. Xiao.

85
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,600
Dr. Bai, why don't you order some juice from her...

86
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,720
to nourish yourself?

87
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,480
Then...

88
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:23,959
I'll give you a bottle.

89
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,480
Look.

90
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:28,639
What? We're eating.

91
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,360
That Wen Jin Jin says on Weibo...

92
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,800
that she's giving up on Dr. Bai.

93
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,240
That's good.

94
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,160
She finally sees his true colors.

95
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,879
What are you saying? Dr. Bai must have rejected her.

96
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,519
As if Dr. Bai would fall for her.

97
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,399
Already?

98
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,639
There are over 3,000 comments.

99
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,279
Let me read them for you.

100
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,040
"I thought they would end up together."

101
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,480
"I didn't expect it to end like this."

102
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,839
"I don't believe in love anymore."

103
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:52,639
This person must be nuts.

104
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,800
It's not like their parents got divorced.

105
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,720
What's with not believing in love anymore?

106
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,120
They're so dumb.

107
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,199
And this one.

108
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,120
"Poor girl, hugs."

109
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,639
"Why don't you hang in there a bit longer?

110
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,160
"Maybe Mr. Gorgeous will fall for you."

111
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,199
"But I'll always support your decision."

112
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:08,439
"You have to be happy."

113
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,480
Hang in there?

114
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,920
What's the point?

115
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,560
If persistence helps,

116
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,639
there won't be any losers.

117
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:14,759
I would've gone to Cambridge a long time ago.

118
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:15,920
You're just an angry kid.

119
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:22,600
I can finally laugh at this.

120
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,839
"This is a slap in the face for someone like the blogger"...

121
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:27,240
"who thinks she can get everything her way because of her looks."

122
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,920
"Do people have to like you just because you're pretty?"

123
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,240
"Chop logic."

124
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,399
What a great comment.

125
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,040
Finally, someone gets it.

126
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,560
I can't talk to someone like you.

127
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,879
Eat up. I want to eat this meat.

128
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,079
"If we were to meet"...

129
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,240
"at the right time and the right place,"

130
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,600
"I wonder if the ending would have been different."

131
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,879
This sounds bitter inside and out.

132
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,839
You must have hurt her badly.

133
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:56,360
I got her so many followers.

134
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,279
She'll wake up smiling in her sleep.

135
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,759
She doesn't have time for petty grievances.

136
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,399
You're too cold-blooded.

137
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,839
You don't cherish women at all.

138
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:05,160
This is great, Bai Zhu.

139
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,800
That plastic surgery girl won't follow you anymore.

140
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,519
You're quite well-informed.

141
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,040
Of course. I'm always keeping an eye out.

142
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,720
- Are you a bandit? - Sugar-free. Are you on a diet?

143
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,839
- Hang on. - What's the point?

144
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:21,879
Dr. Xiao, you're here.

145
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:23,600
Have you read that plastic surgery girl's Weibo?

146
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,319
Yes.

147
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:28,079
I guess you're also keeping an eye on my dear Bai Zhu.

148
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,090
Dr. Xiao doesn't have that much time on her hands.

149
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,279
Lin Zhi insisted on reading it to us.

150
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:37,330
Actually, I'm quite happy that you're paying more attention...

151
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:38,679
to my dear Bai Zhu.

152
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,799
I don't want some people to take advantage of it.

153
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,960
Just like that plastic surgery girl.

154
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,679
What do you mean by your Bai Zhu?

155
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,759
What's your relationship with Bai Zhu?

156
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,559
Since you're asking, I won't hide it anymore.

157
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:53,879
I like Bai Zhu.

158
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:55,559
One day, I'll become his girlfriend.

159
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:58,799
A match made in heaven.

160
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,960
You're so full of yourself.

161
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:02,519
Dr. Zheng, this is our office.

162
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:03,559
Don't talk nonsense.

163
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,090
Okay, I'll do as you say.

164
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,919
- It's sore. - Brush your teeth every day.

165
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,960
Then it won't be sore.

166
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,240
Hold on. Where are you going?

167
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,240
Zheng Ya Jie might get hyped up...

168
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,519
- by you-know-who. - Bai Zhu.

169
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,450
My friend gave me a few Angus steaks.

170
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,840
They are from Australia.

171
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,759
Are you free tonight? Come to my place for dinner.

172
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:29,450
- I'll cook for you. - Dr. Zheng.

173
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,450
Let me make this clear.

174
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,090
I don't have any feelings or whatsoever for you.

175
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,759
I know you like Dr. Xiao.

176
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:38,330
Who I like and want to be with are my business.

177
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,240
I don't want anyone else to interfere with my life.

178
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,240
That includes you.

179
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,330
Do you understand?

180
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:44,879
Xu Yi Ran, stop right there.

181
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,960
I know you hate me.

182
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,679
But I just want to be nice to you.

183
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,879
Everything I do is for you.

184
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,279
Zheng Ya Jie.

185
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,210
You have to understand.

186
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,330
I'm looking for a wife, not a mom.

187
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,000
You're only making me annoyed by you.

188
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:08,279
I think we should keep our distance.

189
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,120
Do you have to be so cruel?

190
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,120
You broke her heart this time.

191
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:23,799
Ya Jie is darn unlucky to have fallen in love with you.

192
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,879
If this drags on, it won't do anyone any good.

193
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,210
It's best to end this quickly.

194
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,679
Don't you know what he's like?

195
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,879
He can be persuaded but not cowed by force.

196
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:57,919
You're only pushing him away...

197
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:00,480
by coming unto him so strongly.

198
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:03,759
Don't take what he said to heart.

199
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,919
Just keep showing him that you care and stay by him.

200
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:10,799
You never know what will happen in the future.

201
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,919
I think...

202
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:17,039
I've really pushed him too hard.

203
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,679
Well done.

204
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,679
You sure have some good theories.

205
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,480
Of course.

206
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,639
Tongshan Hospital's number one casanova...

207
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,840
is not just in name.

208
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,720
Let me ask you.

209
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,480
When he pursued Dr. Xiao,

210
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,200
did you also offer him your lame advice?

211
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,600
When did I do that? He got plenty of ideas.

212
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:41,159
Fine. Are you supporting me and him?

213
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,480
Or are you supporting Xiao Yan and him?

214
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,399
Look. Both of you are my good friends.

215
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:49,120
Of course I hope both of you can be together.

216
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,120
If you two get married,

217
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,039
I still have to give you a wedding gift.

218
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,440
Darn you.

219
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:56,879
You're so calculative.

220
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:58,840
But when it comes to love,

221
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,960
it can't be forced.

222
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:04,879
I can't accept it.

223
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:09,279
I insist on making him like me.

224
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,440
Dr. Bai.

225
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,200
I have something to tell you.

226
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,519
You were sick yesterday.

227
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:26,879
You were so obedient when we huddled in bed.

228
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:30,279
I had never seen you so well-behaved.

229
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,600
What are you trying to say?

230
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,279
When I fed you the ginger soup,

231
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,679
I asked you a question.

232
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,240
I asked if you liked me.

233
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,519
You hummed.

234
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,639
I was delirious from the fever.

235
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I know.

236
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,120
That was just how I wanted to comfort myself.

237
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,559
But do you know?

238
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:05,960
When you gave me that answer,

239
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,480
I was actually quite happy.

240
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:12,799
Because of that happiness,

241
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I was able to make up my mind.

242
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:18,279
I told myself that I must have you.

243
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,759
I'll take good care of you.

244
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,039
I won't let anyone bully you again.

245
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:25,080
Let me put it this way, Zheng Ya Jie.

246
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,639
I don't love you, and that is it.

247
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,720
If two people get into a relationship reluctantly,

248
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,720
neither of them will be happy.

249
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:35,519
You shouldn't waste your time on me.

250
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:37,279
It's okay.

251
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,360
I've already wasted so many years.

252
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,399
I don't mind wasting a few more.

253
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:46,120
I won't give up so easily.

254
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:55,320
Dr. Xiao.

255
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,639
What's so good about Bai Zhu?

256
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:59,200
What do they see in him?

257
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,559
You have your own opinion of Dr. Bai.

258
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:03,720
I have my own opinion of Dr. Bai too.

259
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,440
Everyone has different perspectives.

260
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,639
That's normal.

261
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,559
But don't let that opinion affect a working relationship.

262
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:11,440
It won't be good if it ends up affecting our work.

263
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:13,120
I'm just saying.

264
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,600
Did I do anything to him?

265
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:17,720
It will be too late if it did affect your work.

266
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:19,159
And I think...

267
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,919
Dr. Bai isn't as bad as you say.

268
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,200
I'm a bit confused.

269
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:25,799
A few days ago,

270
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,559
I saw you two giving each other the cold shoulder.

271
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,360
Why are you defending each other now?

272
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:31,879
What's going on?

273
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,440
There are many things you don't understand.

274
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,919
Why don't you just let it go?

275
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,360
Look, it's getting late.

276
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,399
Why don't we go home and get some rest?

277
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:47,360
We have to work all day tomorrow.

278
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,159
- Dr. Xiao. - You're recovering well.

279
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,840
- Are you discharged? - That's right.

280
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,960
Look, Dr. Xiao.

281
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:08,080
I told you. I don't need to be hospitalized.

282
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,919
I'm cured by the nutrients extracted from my juice.

283
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:14,639
Li Li.

284
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,600
You haven't fully recovered yet.

285
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:19,480
I was going to tell you about it when we get home.

286
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,960
The people you trusted...

287
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:23,600
were arrested by the police.

288
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:28,879
Here. Take a look.

289
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,440
Even now,

290
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:34,399
do you still believe in that so-called juice?

291
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,960
The medicine you took wasn't extracted from the juice.

292
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,799
We lied to you.

293
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,039
Dr. Xiao and Dr. Bai treated you.

294
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,000
That's how you survived.

295
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:52,679
Li Li.

296
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,279
I know that it was all my fault.

297
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,960
I was too busy with my career and neglected you.

298
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,039
When you've recovered,

299
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,960
I want you to find a real job.

300
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,840
I'll support you no matter what you do.

301
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,639
How are you unwell?

302
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:16,639
Doctor.

303
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,000
Don't you remember me?

304
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,159
I had appendicitis two months ago.

305
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,480
You treated me.

306
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,519
I remember now.

307
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:26,240
What's wrong with you now?

308
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,240
Are you not recovering well?

309
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:29,919
After the surgery, I've been having intermittent abdominal pain.

310
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,399
I think the wound isn't healing well.

311
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:33,919
Please lie down. Let me examine you again.

312
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,159
It's all right.

313
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:38,679
My colleague's child works in Third Hospital.

314
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:40,360
This time,

315
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:42,759
I'm here to make a copy of my surgery record...

316
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,200
and test reports.

317
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,879
I want to ask my colleague's kid...

318
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:47,360
to take a look.

319
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,840
I wonder if that's okay.

320
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,960
The patient with gastroesophageal reflux...

321
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,320
is having difficulty breathing again.

322
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,320
I'll go take a look.

323
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,320
Doctor.

324
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:55,759
As for my records...

325
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,840
Lin Zhi, assist this patient...

326
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,919
in making copies of surgery records and test reports.

327
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:00,919
Okay.

328
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:03,519
Thank you.

329
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:07,650
Where's the patient who made the photocopies?

330
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,720
Has he left?

331
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:09,799
Yes.

332
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,119
I made copies of his surgery records and test reports.

333
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:15,039
I told him to get it from the Archive Department.

334
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,519
What's wrong?

335
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,410
Show me the copies he made.

336
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,759
I'm worried something is wrong.

337
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,960
Add this in.

338
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:30,119
He's adding another patient today.

339
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,680
He's being transferred. Record it.

340
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:43,839
Move this one over.

341
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Okay.

342
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:49,960
It's obvious. It's a tumor.

343
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,480
Dr. Bai, is it benign or malignant?

344
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,720
This is just a CT scan. It's hard to say.

345
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,440
What I can tell you now...

346
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,079
is there's definitely a tumor in his liver.

347
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,319
Tang Hua, I heard that the patient went to you...

348
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:05,440
for copies of his surgery record and test reports, right?

349
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,839
He came in the morning.

350
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:09,240
I was a little busy, so I didn't think much of it.

351
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:10,599
I just let him have the copies.

352
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:12,920
Dr. Lu.

353
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,519
I'm afraid the patient had come prepared.

354
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,200
The patient might have been informed of the tumor at another hospital.

355
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:20,359
They traced back to two months ago...

356
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,890
and realized that Tang Hua didn't notice the tumor.

357
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,599
So, in order to gather information to file a lawsuit,

358
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,319
he deliberately sounded casual...

359
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:29,039
in case he would alert us and arouse our suspicion.

360
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,799
What should we do, Dr. Lu?

361
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,410
Don't worry.

362
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:36,079
I'll report this to the Medical Administration Department.

363
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:39,039
Let's assume the worst-case scenario and prepare for it.

364
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:41,119
Don't worry, Dr. Lu.

365
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:44,200
I know things can't go wrong in the EICU at this time.

366
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,720
I won't implicate our department and the hospital.

367
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:50,680
I made the diagnosis and I handled his post-surgery care.

368
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,119
I'll bear the responsibility alone.

369
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,079
Dr. Lu, I'm also responsible for this.

370
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:55,680
If I hadn't pestered Dr. Tang,

371
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,650
she wouldn't have overlooked that shadow area.

372
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,119
Dr. Lu, I'll take responsibility for this.

373
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:02,079
All right now. This is not anyone's personal responsibility.

374
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,680
This concerns all of us.

375
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,039
If anything goes wrong, we'll face it together.

376
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:08,759
We'll face it together.

377
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,960
Why should we bear the consequences of one person's issue?

378
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:13,119
It's moral blackmail.

379
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:16,519
You should take responsibility for a wrong diagnosis.

380
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Don't you agree?

381
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:19,720
I'm willing to take responsibility.

382
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:21,359
Tang Hua is one of us.

383
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,170
- What are you doing? - What do you mean?

384
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:26,839
I just said there was a misdiagnosis.

385
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:28,799
I didn't say it was Tang Hua.

386
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,200
So what's your opinion?

387
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,920
Can I ask you guys...

388
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:37,680
to look at things from a different perspective?

389
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:40,170
Strictly speaking,

390
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:42,599
Tang Hua isn't responsible in this matter.

391
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,119
At that time, Fu Ming claimed...

392
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,410
that he had lower abdominal pain.

393
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,839
It had nothing to do with a liver tumor.

394
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:51,119
Based on the pain in the lower abdomen,

395
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:52,240
he was diagnosed with appendicitis.

396
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,079
The appendicitis surgery was a success.

397
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,480
There were no complications.

398
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,559
It was just an unexpected discovery...

399
00:19:57,559 --> 00:19:58,799
that the CT scan caught the liver tumor.

400
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,359
Any doctor couldn't possibly discover...

401
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:03,359
all of the patient's illnesses in such a short time.

402
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:07,279
So even if we go to court, I don't think we'll lose.

403
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:08,519
That's right.

404
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:09,599
That makes sense.

405
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:11,890
Bai Zhu analyzed it well.

406
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:14,200
Doctors aren't omnipotent. Right?

407
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:15,410
We aren't deities either.

408
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,319
Let's just see how the patient will react.

409
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:20,170
But it doesn't mean we should do nothing.

410
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:21,920
I think Bai Zhu is right.

411
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,440
We should contact the patient first.

412
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:24,650
Why?

413
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,240
The patient made a copy of the data.

414
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,000
They might not be able to figure out the issue.

415
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:30,359
I think if we contact them first,

416
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:32,079
we might get into trouble.

417
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:34,039
Whether that gets us into trouble or not,

418
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:35,799
we should contact the patient as soon as possible.

419
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:37,079
We don't want to delay his treatment.

420
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,759
I support Dr. Tang.

421
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:39,890
Me too.

422
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Me too.

423
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,170
Me too.

424
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,119
I'm very pleased that you put our patients first.

425
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,410
Regardless of how it might turn out,

426
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:49,960
the patient's health is at stake.

427
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:51,359
As doctors,

428
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,480
we can't keep quiet for fear of being held responsible.

429
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,440
Tang Hua, contact the patient quickly.

430
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,599
Perform the tumor assessment for him as soon as possible.

431
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,720
I'll take care of the rest.

432
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,599
Okay, I'll contact him right away.

433
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,079
Are you talking about this shadow?

434
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:15,359
We didn't notice it back then.

435
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,359
But now, it looks like it could be a tumor.

436
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,410
So we suggest you get a biopsy as soon as possible...

437
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:23,319
to see if it's benign or malignant.

438
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,039
We can then schedule the follow-up treatment.

439
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:27,200
You only noticed this shadow...

440
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,200
after I made the copies this morning, right?

441
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,000
I had overlooked it.

442
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,480
You took the initiative to tell me.

443
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:37,279
Aren't you afraid I'll sue you for negligence?

444
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:41,359
Negligence or not, I believe...

445
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:43,440
the Medical Malpractice Committee will make a fair judgment.

446
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,440
But as a doctor,

447
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,960
our priority is the patient's condition.

448
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:51,960
I knew about the shadow in my liver...

449
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,799
even before the appendectomy.

450
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,839
When I was very young,

451
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:00,119
I was diagnosed with two angiomas in my liver.

452
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,559
I've been getting them checked over the years.

453
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,839
And they are always benign.

454
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,920
The last time I was here,

455
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,240
I didn't think it had anything to do with the surgery.

456
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,200
That was why I didn't inform Dr. Tang.

457
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,039
That's good to know.

458
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:15,160
But because of your constant abdominal pain,

459
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,039
I suggest that you go for a checkup.

460
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,240
All right?

461
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:20,759
All right then.

462
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,279
It's nothing. Just make it clear to him.

463
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,279
- Mr. Fu. - Are the test results out?

464
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:29,079
What is it with this abdominal pain?

465
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,960
Your abdominal pain is due to chronic gastroenteritis.

466
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,000
It's unrelated to your angioma and the appendectomy.

467
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,160
It's good that I'm not seriously ill.

468
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,599
But is my chronic gastroenteritis serious?

469
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,079
Don't worry. It's a common illness.

470
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,880
Take the medicine I prescribed...

471
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,279
and you'll recover soon.

472
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,200
If you still feel any discomfort,

473
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,519
come to me.

474
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,200
I've been sick for a long time.

475
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:58,079
But I had never received a call from a doctor out of concern.

476
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:00,759
Your Emergency Department is the first to do so.

477
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:03,359
Thank you for caring.

478
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,480
- Thank you. - This is what we should do.

479
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,319
You should get your medicine. It's just around the corner.

480
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,160
Okay.

481
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:15,640
Good job.

482
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,240
Tang Hua, Lin Zhi told me you were looking for me.

483
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,119
By the way, Lin Zhi told me...

484
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,559
that patient with a shadow on his liver has gastroenteritis.

485
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:32,759
I'm sorry.

486
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,160
It's all my fault.

487
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:35,599
I made you worry.

488
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,960
Chen Zhi.

489
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,079
You don't have to pretend to be my boyfriend anymore.

490
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,920
Why are you saying this again, Tang Hua?

491
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,000
I made you pretend as my boyfriend to fool my mom.

492
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,359
Actually, I wanted my mom to leave me alone.

493
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,559
But this incident today reminded me.

494
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,519
If this continues, I'm giving you too much hope.

495
00:23:58,519 --> 00:23:59,759
It's unfair to you.

496
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,720
You and I are not the same kinds of people.

497
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,680
When it comes to Fu Ming's case,

498
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,599
I insist on contacting the patient.

499
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:08,480
But you worry too much.

500
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:10,440
How we look at things...

501
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,400
and the way we handle issues...

502
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,039
are way too different.

503
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,279
People who don't share the same core values...

504
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:17,480
can't be together.

505
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,079
Tang Hua, I know that there are differences between us.

506
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:21,440
It's all my fault.

507
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,720
It's all my fault, okay?

508
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,640
It's not about who's right or wrong.

509
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:27,200
It's just that everyone's perspective is different.

510
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,039
So the way we think and act in response to issues...

511
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,599
are naturally different.

512
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,200
For example,

513
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,200
you assumed that I misdiagnosed because you kept pestering me.

514
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,559
That's not true.

515
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,920
You don't trust my abilities.

516
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,440
Tang Hua, that's not what I meant.

517
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,400
How about this? I'll do whatever you say.

518
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,519
I'll listen to you, okay?

519
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:44,519
You can't do that.

520
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:46,160
You have to have a mind of your own.

521
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:47,559
As of today,

522
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,839
we have to put an end to this fake relationship.

523
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,319
What about your mom?

524
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,079
What are you going to tell her?

525
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:56,319
To be honest with you, I haven't thought about it.

526
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,680
But even if my mom and I have a huge fight over this,

527
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,480
I'm going to put an end to this relationship.

528
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:05,319
This must never happen again.

529
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:07,000
Tang Hua.

530
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,759
I was wrong. I'll do whatever you say.

531
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:11,079
I'll change from now on, okay?

532
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:13,079
I mean it. Don't be like this, okay?

533
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:14,359
I'm sorry.

534
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:15,880
It was all my fault.

535
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,960
My selfishness has given you too much delusional hope.

536
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,319
From now on, we're still colleagues.

537
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,359
Tang Hua.

538
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:32,079
Tang...

539
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:39,680
So it's really over between you two?

540
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,400
It should have been over ages ago.

541
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,960
A while ago,

542
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,440
I noticed that you've warmed up to Chen Zhi.

543
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:48,160
I thought you two had a chance.

544
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,920
Actually, that's what I'm afraid of.

545
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,279
You're quite a good judge of character.

546
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,279
I'm slowly getting used to his concern for me.

547
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,920
Isn't that nice?

548
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,119
Just yield to him.

549
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,559
Yield?

550
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,960
I don't want to fall in love and get married.

551
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,839
Besides, I'm not interested in Chen Zhi at all.

552
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,599
Perhaps it will hurt us less...

553
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:14,160
if I don't date him just out of dependency.

554
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,440
You say one thing and do another. I can't out-talk you.

555
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:19,440
But what about your mom?

556
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:21,279
She won't let this go, will she?

557
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,920
A true warrior...

558
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,279
has the courage to face the harsh reality of life.

559
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,240
You can do it.

560
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,240
Are you sure?

561
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:32,359
I'm sure.

562
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,480
What if I don't agree?

563
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:37,119
Whether you agree or not,

564
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:38,400
I'll break up with him.

565
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,720
Besides, you're my biological mother.

566
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,119
How can you really abandon me?

567
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:47,400
I did act quite outrageously.

568
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,240
I set you up with blind dates one after another.

569
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,559
That's because you're not young anymore.

570
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:54,640
And you don't care much about yourself.

571
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,400
I can't let you have your way.

572
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,440
I did all that to provoke you.

573
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,160
And now, Chen Zhi showed up.

574
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,440
Chen Zhi is so nice.

575
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:08,440
But now, you're telling me that your personalities clash.

576
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,119
Personality clash?

577
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:12,039
Which young people these days...

578
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:14,160
don't have a strong personality?

579
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,079
If your personalities clash,

580
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:17,960
you can compromise.

581
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,240
If you don't love him, you can try harboring feelings.

582
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,119
You're both doctors.

583
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,119
You work together all day in the hospital.

584
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,440
You have something in common. It's easy to cultivate affection.

585
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:31,799
You don't understand how young people think.

586
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,440
Is it that complicated?

587
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,400
Isn't it quite simple?

588
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,359
Chen Zhi came to our house.

589
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,640
I had no trouble getting along with him at all.

590
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,480
This is the foundation of a good marriage.

591
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,160
He's honest and upright.

592
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:47,839
If I marry you to him,

593
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,519
I really don't have to worry.

594
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:51,799
Mom.

595
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,200
Between me and Chen Zhi, it's not as simple as you think.

596
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,519
I've been there.

597
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:59,119
I can tell how well Chen Zhi treats you.

598
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,200
I saw it very clearly...

599
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,039
whether he truly cares for you and whether he loves you.

600
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,640
That's because his eyes don't lie.

601
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:10,920
I don't care whether he's rich or not.

602
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,839
What I care about now...

603
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:14,519
is how well he treats you...

604
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,599
and whether he really keeps you on his mind.

605
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,000
I understand what you're saying.

606
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:22,519
I'll take care of it.

607
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,680
Okay.

608
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,960
That's good.

609
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,720
That will save me the trouble of worrying about you...

610
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,200
all the time.

611
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,480
I was your age once.

612
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,079
I'm sure you'll understand when you reach my age.

613
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:42,559
By that time,

614
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,799
it will be too late to regret it.

615
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:22,440
Hua Er.

616
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:25,240
Someone is calling you downstairs.

617
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,880
It sounds like Chen Zhi.

618
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,880
Go and take a look.

619
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:33,599
Tang Hua!

620
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:35,279
It really is Chen Zhi.

621
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:38,200
- Tang Hua! - It's so cold out there.

622
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,240
And it's raining so hard.

623
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,440
He doesn't have an umbrella.

624
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,920
- Mom, go to bed. - Tang Hua!

625
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,920
I'll bring him an umbrella.

626
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:47,079
Talk to him nicely!

627
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:48,680
Tell him to go back soon.

628
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:51,559
Tang Hua.

629
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:53,599
Tang Hua.

630
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,480
You're finally willing to see me.

631
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,240
Did you drink?

632
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,519
I only drank a little.

633
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:01,599
Don't be such a loser.

634
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,720
Go home now.

635
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,000
Do you know?

636
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,880
I've been your boyfriend...

637
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,720
for such a long time.

638
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,480
I care for you.

639
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I take care of you.

640
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,119
I thought you would take me seriously...

641
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,720
as time goes by.

642
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:18,559
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

643
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,720
Go home now.

644
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:22,079
Tang Hua.

645
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,319
Don't make me despise you.

646
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:29,359
I don't want you to despise me.

647
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:32,720
Then go home.

648
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:37,680
I don't want you to despise me.

649
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,000
I'll go home right away.

650
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,480
Tang Hua, don't go.

651
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:47,960
I don't want you to despise me.

652
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,200
I'm going home.

653
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,160
Okay.

654
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,960
I'm going home.

655
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,440
Why did you have to get drenched in the rain?

656
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,880
She rejected you.

657
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:03,599
You caught a cold, didn't you?

658
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,400
Drink this up after you finish your food.

659
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:15,799
Aren't you overreacting, baby Chen Zhi?

660
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:18,119
I told you. There is plenty of fish in the sea.

661
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:19,279
Why do you insist on her?

662
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,160
Eat up.

663
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,160
Dr. Chen.

664
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,720
Are you okay?

665
00:31:57,759 --> 00:31:58,880
I'm fine.

666
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:08,319
She reeks of alcohol.

667
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,599
The patient came out of a hotel and passed out.

668
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,799
A passerby saw her and called an ambulance.

669
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
How long has she been unconscious?

670
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
It has been about half an hour...

671
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,240
since the ambulance was dispatched.

672
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,160
Let's run a blood test first to rule out alcohol intoxication.

673
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,279
If it's not alcohol intoxication,

674
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,640
we'll do a CT skull scan.

675
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,640
Okay.

676
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,359
The patient at bed three still has a swollen leg.

677
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:37,559
Let's keep an eye on her.

678
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:39,880
- Dr. Xiao, take a look quickly. - What's wrong?

679
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,920
The family of bed four is displeased with Chen Zhi.

680
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,960
He's so useless.

681
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,680
What's wrong with you?

682
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,880
Ping Ping has been allergic to alcohol since she was young.

683
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,880
She doesn't drink at all.

684
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,880
How could you suspect her of alcohol intoxication?

685
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:52,599
But why would she reek of alcohol?

686
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,319
There's no alcohol in her blood test.

687
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,319
What kind of a doctor are you?

688
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,839
Ping Ping is the breadwinner of our family.

689
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:05,920
If anything happens to her,

690
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,200
our family will be ruined!

691
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,319
Do you understand?

692
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:09,559
Ma'am.

693
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,599
What matters right now is to find out...

694
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:13,400
the cause of the patient's illness and give her timely treatment.

695
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,240
Tang Hua. Check if the CT scan is out yet.

696
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:17,559
Okay.

697
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,559
Based on the symptoms...

698
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,359
and the CT scan results,

699
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:36,039
I think it's a cerebral infarction.

700
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,599
Did the patient suffer any discomfort today?

701
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,359
This morning when she headed out,

702
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,880
she said she was a bit dizzy and she couldn't see very well.

703
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:45,759
She also said her shoulder was bothering her.

704
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,720
Then she went to work.

705
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:49,400
I don't know anything else.

706
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,799
She was out for a whole day.

707
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,640
You didn't even call to check on her?

708
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,079
She often feels uncomfortable here and there.

709
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:56,160
It's nothing serious.

710
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,279
Doctor, she's so young.

711
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,000
How could she have cerebral infarction?

712
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,720
Did you know that the patient has hypertension?

713
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,880
No, I didn't.

714
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,720
She has been to our hospital.

715
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:07,559
Based on her medical records,

716
00:34:08,769 --> 00:34:10,769
she has had high blood pressure for at least three years.

717
00:34:11,289 --> 00:34:12,289
She also has high blood sugar.

718
00:34:12,769 --> 00:34:14,239
She has been taking medication.

719
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,360
I didn't know.

720
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,329
We always have medicine for colds and coughs at home.

721
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,809
There's nothing else.

722
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,769
She never told us about that.

723
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,360
Let's get her to do a cranial MRI scan.

724
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,599
Okay.

725
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:29,840
According to the cranial MRI,

726
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,079
the patient has cerebral infarction.

727
00:34:31,329 --> 00:34:33,039
The infarction is inside the internal capsule.

728
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:34,360
It can easily affect physical movements...

729
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,880
when there's an infarction at this spot.

730
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:37,559
If we don't treat it soon,

731
00:34:37,769 --> 00:34:39,199
it might cause hemiplegia.

732
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,440
She needs thrombolysis.

733
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:41,880
What is thrombolysis?

734
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:44,719
It breaks down blood clots in the cerebral infraction.

735
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,559
We need the family's consent for the thrombolysis treatment.

736
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,159
Please take a look.

737
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,639
The patient is in a bad shape.

738
00:34:52,809 --> 00:34:54,199
She needs immediate treatment.

739
00:34:54,289 --> 00:34:56,809
If there isn't any question, please sign it quickly.

740
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:06,239
She can't feel anything on the right side of her body.

741
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:08,960
If we don't treat her soon,

742
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:11,159
the area affected by the cerebral infarction will expand.

743
00:35:11,329 --> 00:35:12,809
Is there any other way?

744
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,400
Yes, give it some thought.

745
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,840
There must be a safer treatment.

746
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:17,079
Here's the thing.

747
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:19,329
I checked the time when I came in earlier.

748
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,840
The patient has been unconscious for two hours.

749
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:23,880
The best time for thrombolysis treatment...

750
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,599
is within three hours after cerebral infarction symptom onset.

751
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:28,559
That means you have one hour left to discuss.

752
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,880
Here's my personal suggestion. The sooner, the better.

753
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:33,289
Doctors are good at scaring us.

754
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:36,360
I know you must have your concerns as the patient's family.

755
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,519
But judging from her condition,

756
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:40,440
I think thrombolysis is the best solution.

757
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:42,159
Statistics show...

758
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,920
that most patients improve substantially...

759
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:46,239
after thrombolysis treatment.

760
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:48,400
Of course this treatment isn't omnipotent.

761
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:52,289
Not all patients can fully recover after thrombolysis treatment.

762
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,440
Because the severity of every patient's vascular lesions...

763
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,920
and the individual constitution differ.

764
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:01,289
Even after the treatment,

765
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,679
the progression of some patients' condition can't be halted.

766
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,119
There have even been other patients...

767
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:08,289
with continued hemorrhage after the thrombolysis.

768
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,809
Some with severe hemorrhage that can even be life-threatening.

769
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:13,599
In our hospital,

770
00:36:13,809 --> 00:36:15,119
the success rate of the thrombolysis treatment...

771
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:16,480
is higher than average.

772
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,719
The risk of hemorrhage...

773
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,289
is lower than average.

774
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,000
That means the potential benefits of thrombolysis...

775
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,119
are far greater than the risks.

776
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,880
So we still recommend the thrombolysis treatment.

777
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,199
All right? It's fine.

778
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:31,519
If anything happens, you can contact me anytime.

779
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:35,000
Xiao Xiang, let's listen to the doctor.

780
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,289
Well, how much does it cost?

781
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,480
The cost of IV thrombolysis is about 5,000 yuan.

782
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,199
With the treatment and the checkup fees,

783
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:46,199
it's about 7,000 to 8,000 yuan.

784
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,360
It's so expensive.

785
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:50,719
All of our fees are approved by the Price Bureau.

786
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,329
A medicine costs 5,000 yuan?

787
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,119
Why don't you rob a bank?

788
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:55,809
That's the price of thrombolytics.

789
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,360
She has to stay in the EICU for thrombolysis.

790
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,360
It will cost even more.

791
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,920
Are you really going to rob us?

792
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,840
Is money more important than life?

793
00:37:02,809 --> 00:37:03,809
Here's what.

794
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:06,239
If we don't do the thrombolysis soon,

795
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:08,599
the area of her cerebral infarction will keep expanding.

796
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,599
If that happens, we won't be able to save her.

797
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:14,519
Xiao Xiang, let's listen to the doctors.

798
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:16,159
If anything happens to your sister,

799
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:17,480
our family is doomed.

800
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,880
That's enough.

801
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:20,079
I got it.

802
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,400
Go ahead.

803
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:23,769
Why did she have to get a stroke?

804
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:26,079
- Gosh. - Is that the right thing to say?

805
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,840
What kind of a family is that?

806
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,880
That's enough.

807
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,440
It's none of our business. Let's not discuss it.

808
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,880
Dr. Lu.

809
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,480
- It was my fault. - What should I say about you?

810
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:46,199
- I'm sorry. - That's enough.

811
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:48,199
The family has signed it.

812
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,599
You should get ready to do the treatment.

813
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:50,960
Okay, I'll make the arrangements.

814
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,679
What arrangements?

815
00:37:53,329 --> 00:37:54,639
Her family doesn't like you.

816
00:37:57,329 --> 00:37:59,039
I'll leave this matter to you. Okay?

817
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:01,719
Dr. Lu, let Dr. Chen handle it.

818
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,840
Tang Hua and I can assist him.

819
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,719
Everyone makes mistakes.

820
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:08,289
Do you know the predicament our department is in?

821
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:11,400
If you mess up again, I won't let you off.

822
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,440
Thank you, Dr. Xiao.

823
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,719
Don't be so careless again.

824
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:20,599
Pay more attention next time.

825
00:38:41,769 --> 00:38:42,769
Dr. Xiao.

826
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,360
- How is it? - An intravenous pump was inserted.

827
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,000
Artephrine will take effect in about an hour.

828
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,440
Okay.

829
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:56,480
Why are you still standing here?

830
00:38:57,289 --> 00:38:58,400
I'd better keep standing.

831
00:38:58,519 --> 00:38:59,719
It will wake me up.

832
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:03,239
Even though Dr. Lu criticized you,

833
00:39:03,329 --> 00:39:04,719
he didn't punish you to stand here.

834
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:08,480
I'd rather be scolded by Dr. Lu.

835
00:39:10,329 --> 00:39:13,000
Maybe it's because I'm not cut out to be a doctor.

836
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,559
Don't doubt yourself every time.

837
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:17,289
How could you get a PhD if you weren't cut out for it?

838
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:18,840
I'll be honest with you.

839
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,400
When I was in university,

840
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,599
I didn't know anything.

841
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:24,519
I didn't know what to do, so I chose this major.

842
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:26,360
I didn't hate it either.

843
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:28,400
But my parents...

844
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:30,880
are both workers...

845
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,360
and aren't well-educated.

846
00:39:32,769 --> 00:39:34,769
In a small town like ours,

847
00:39:34,769 --> 00:39:37,920
they feel proud...

848
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,769
that their son is a doctor.

849
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:42,329
Maybe it's my vanity...

850
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:44,119
that got me my doctorate degree.

851
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,960
That's why you have to work harder.

852
00:39:46,039 --> 00:39:47,840
Don't let all your hard work go to waste.

853
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,440
By the way, Dr. Xiao, why did you become a doctor?

854
00:39:55,289 --> 00:39:56,809
I think that being a doctor...

855
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,039
might be the only profession...

856
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:01,079
that can fight against death...

857
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:03,769
and seize a chance of survival for others.

858
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,880
What about you?

859
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,920
To make money.

860
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,329
Don't be ridiculous.

861
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,039
How much can a nurse make?

862
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,679
I only found that out after I started working.

863
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:15,039
It's too late for regrets.

864
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,000
We may be doctors,

865
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,400
but we're also ordinary people.

866
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,480
We have our own emotions.

867
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:25,480
That's why we have to work harder...

868
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:27,769
to not let our emotions get in the way.

869
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:29,239
You should know...

870
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,400
that if we make any mistake,

871
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,639
it will cause irreparable harm to the patients and their families.

872
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,239
But this is too difficult, Dr. Xiao.

873
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,809
I think most doctors do care for the patients.

874
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,079
We even care more about their health than their families.

875
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:46,599
But being a doctor is just a job.

876
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:48,440
It's a job to provide for our family.

877
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,519
To train a qualified doctor...

878
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:55,159
can take a dozen years or even decades.

879
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:58,519
I think there are a lot of issues that doctors have to tackle.

880
00:40:58,519 --> 00:41:01,199
Look at the many patients we have to face each day.

881
00:41:01,329 --> 00:41:03,840
We have to be responsible for every patient.

882
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,769
We also have to be skillful.

883
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,639
It's really tiring.

884
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:10,559
Not to mention we're required to offer our services with a smile.

885
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,289
So we can only do our best.

886
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,769
It's fine as long as we have a clear conscience.

887
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,440
All right.

888
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:22,809
Get back to work.

889
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:37,079
You're awake.

890
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,639
Is this a hospital?

891
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:44,960
What's wrong with me?

892
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,440
You have a cerebral infarction.

893
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,519
We're giving you a thrombolysis treatment.

894
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:49,719
Cerebral infarction?

895
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,119
Why would I have cerebral infarction?

896
00:41:58,239 --> 00:41:59,960
What's wrong with my body?

897
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,679
This is temporary paralysis caused by cerebral infarction.

898
00:42:03,289 --> 00:42:05,159
We're giving you a thrombolysis treatment.

899
00:42:05,329 --> 00:42:08,289
It's the most effective treatment for cerebral infarction.

900
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,360
Where's my family?

901
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,360
Your mom and brother are here.

902
00:42:14,809 --> 00:42:17,199
We'll let them know when the treatment is over.

903
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,809
You didn't drink. But why did you smell of alcohol?

904
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:23,519
I had lunch with a client.

905
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,920
When I was pouring drinks,

906
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:30,000
I accidentally spilled it on myself.

907
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:33,079
I'm sorry.

908
00:42:40,769 --> 00:42:41,880
What's wrong?

909
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,119
What lousy proposal is this?

910
00:42:45,289 --> 00:42:46,599
What idea did you come up with?

911
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:49,519
The audience doesn't like it at all. Do you know that?

912
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,480
If it's about the event proposal,

913
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,119
we can sit down and discuss it again.

914
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,880
You're a big company.

915
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,289
I'm sure you don't want a low-standard event proposal.
