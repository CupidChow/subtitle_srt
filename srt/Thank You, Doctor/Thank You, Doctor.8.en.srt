00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:39,820
Why is Eldest Brother's cell phone always turned off? Where is he? Use your phone to call him.

17
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,420
You don't need to look for your eldest brother.

18
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,850
He's been arrest by the police for assault.

19
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,480
- DId you call the police? 
 - No, I didn't.

20
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,590
- I called the police. 
 - You're really something as a doctor.

21
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,120
We can resolve our own family's affairs.

22
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,880
Why are you interfering?

23
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,110
That's right. Our eldest brother didn't do it deliberately. Why report to the police?

24
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,560
Besides, now that he's arrested,

25
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,080
will you take care of my father?

26
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,150
There's still the two of you, right?

27
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,310
If he could do the care by himself, why can't the two of you do it?

28
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,730
We aren't experienced.

29
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:12,650
You two can discussed about it then. I have other work to do.

30
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,830
Second Brother, I still need to rush home to cook for Nuo Nuo.

31
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,220
How about you work hard a little for a while.

32
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,120
No, I still have a bunch of things to handle in my store.

33
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,110
- Think of it as helping your younger sister, okay? 
 - Third Sister.

34
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,910
You know that I can't get away from my store. Can you be considerate of me?

35
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,090
It's all that female doctor's fault.

36
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,910
Why did she report to the police for nothing?

37
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,550
She's sick in her head.

38
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,510
Sure, no problem.

39
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:46,780
Dr. Xiao, you must have stayed abraod too long that you've become silly?

40
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,860
But I remember you only left the country after you graduated from high school.

41
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,710
You should have been mature already at that time.

42
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,160
What are you talking about?

43
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:02,120
Dr. Bai, just say what's on your mind. No need to beat around the bush.

44
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:12,380
In this world, when the sense of morality and justice rise

45
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,600
on something that doesn't concern onself, it's too easy to talk from the moral high ground.

46
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,800
But it's the most difficult to take care of an elderly Alzheimer patient day in an day out, year after year.

47
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,440
Cheng Wei Liang is arrested because of you, so who will take care of his father now?

48
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,650
Do you really pine your hope on his other son and daughter who only talk morally?

49
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,460
How do you know that they only know to talk morally?

50
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,250
This question of yours

51
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,700
is really stupid.

52
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,690
Those who say others are stupid are the most stupid.

53
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:51,430
Dad, didn't I tell you not to move the mask?

54
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,050
It's uncomfortable. I feel bad.

55
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,970
Let's do this then.

56
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,150
Lower it a little. Is this better?

57
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,120
Don't move it anymore.

58
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,260
Don't move it. What are you doing?

59
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,190
Second Brother, do something.

60
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,280
He has hands. What can I do?

61
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,400
Dad, don't move it anymore.

62
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,340
If you move it again, we won't take care of you.

63
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,150
I won't move. I won't move.

64
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,850
What are you doing now?

65
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,810
Dad, I beg you.

66
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,330
Spare me, okay? Don't mess around anymore.

67
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,650
I'm going to the restroom. Why are you following me?

68
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,060
I'm going to the restroom, too.

69
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,310
Don't worry. I won't sneak away.

70
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,780
You're worrying too much. I just want to go to the restroom.

71
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,670
What kind of people are they?

72
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,790
At first, I was actually touched when I saw that they cared about Cheng Guo Dong.

73
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,200
I didn't know it's all faked.

74
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,000
It's true that they care, but it's also true that they don't want to do the care work.

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,910
The human heart is complicated.

76
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,790
Dad, I beg you, don't torment me anymore, okay?

77
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,770
Can't you stop for a little while?

78
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,050
What are you doing again?

79
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,150
What are you doing?

80
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,550
It's raining. I need to close the windows.

81
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,810
There's no rain. The weather is good. Just lie down.

82
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,910
Secon Brother, give me a hand!

83
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,860
I'm busy.

84
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,630
Sure, you don't care?

85
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,840
I don't care either. Neither of us needs to do anything.

86
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,560
Drink water.

87
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:47,530
Wei Xiu, Wei Xiu.

88
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,090
Wei Jie.

89
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,820
Hello.

90
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,560
- What, he doesn't want it anymore? The contract is already signed, but he doesn't want it anymore? 
 - Wei Xiu.

91
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,820
Tell him to follow the contract.

92
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,200
If he doesn't want to, he'll lose money.

93
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,750
- Wei Xiu.  
 - A bunch of stupid things all day.

94
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,990
- What do you keep calling about? 
 - Wei Xiu. 
 - So much chirping noise.

95
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:14,220
- So annoying. 
 - Wei Xiu.

96
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,090
Hello? Baby.

97
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,860
- Mom is taking care of your grandfather in the hospital. 
 - Wei Jie.

98
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,880
You and you dad can order takeout, okay?

99
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,690
Hello, hubby. Eldest Brother isn't here.

100
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:31,250
I really can't get away right now.

101
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,520
Don't be upset. Listen to me.

102
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,480
Hello? Hello?

103
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,860
Hello?

104
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,060
When exactly can I leave?

105
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,410
I want water.

106
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:49,720
Second Brother, how can our dad

107
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,440
be so annoyinng?

108
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,140
He got indulged by Eldest Brother. Was our dad like this before?

109
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,570
What's that smell? So stinky.

110
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:04,860
Could it be that...

111
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,020
Dad pooped?

112
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,910
He pooped. Hurry and clean it up.

113
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,560
I clean up? You are a man, you clean it up.

114
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,230
What's this about man or woman. You are the daughter, so you clean it up.

115
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,530
How do I clean it up?

116
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:20,270
Hey, you can't eve settle such a trivial matter?

117
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,650
Sure, sure, I'll think of a solution.

118
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,720
- You... You... 
 - What's the use to have you?

119
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,170
Hello?

120
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:31,240
Hubby, don't be upset, okay?

121
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,350
Listen to me. This is what happened.

122
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,390
Eldest Brother isn't here.

123
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,530
The care worker we hired will be here soon.

124
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,190
If anything happens, how do we contact you?

125
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:47,380
My eldest brother will be released in a few days. If there's anything, just contact him.

126
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,130
Who are these people?

127
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,780
Lie down slowly. Good.

128
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:55,920
It's all cleaned up and changed. Feel comfortable now?

129
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:00,070
Wei Liang? Wei Liang? Wei Liang?

130
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,740
Xiao Li, sit here by his side for a while.

131
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,130
Wei Liang is here.

132
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,950
He's asking for Cheng Wei Liang again.

133
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,680
Xiao Li, just stay with him for a while.

134
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:23,370
It's wrong for a son to hit his father. He should be punished for his wrongdoing.

135
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,200
But if he doesn't take care of his dad because of this,

136
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,490
what will happen then?

137
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:31,490
Dr. Xiao will take care of it. When other people make mistakes, they should be punished.

138
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,510
When Dr. Xiao makes a mistake, shouldn't she also bear the responsibility?

139
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,680
I can bear it.

140
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,710
Such pretty talk.

141
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:42,900
You did what you claim to be the right thing, but Cheng Guo Dong is bearing the consequence.

142
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,320
I will take the responsiblity all the way.

143
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,930
I hope you'll do what you say.

144
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,580
It's really Dr. Xiao's eternal bad luck to run into you after coming back to the country.

145
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,510
Let me ask you then. Do you feel unlucky when you're with me?

146
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,490
I'm okay. I'm used to it.

147
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:05,370
That's right. So, is this my problem? It's her own problem.

148
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,230
Shameless.

149
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:32,040
- Old Mister, you've receovered well. 
 - Really?

150
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,210
Where is Wei Liang?

151
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,210
Wei Liang? Where is Wei Liang?

152
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,120
Dad.

153
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,670
Wei Laing.

154
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:43,990
I'm here. I'm here.

155
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,250
It's fine. I'm here.

156
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,750
Don't cry.

157
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,040
Weren't you arrested by the police?

158
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,420
No.

159
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,710
Dr. Xiao saw that I was in a bad mood, so she made me go home to rest.

160
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:16,650
Since the two of them were here, so I went home to stay for a day.

161
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,430
Last night, I thought about

162
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:25,320
a lot of things.

163
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:30,100
I was especially naughty when I was little.

164
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,220
I didn't listen to anyoe.

165
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,720
But no matter what annoying thing I did,

166
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,180
Dad never hit me.

167
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:45,570
He always reasoned with me over and over again.

168
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,100
He was so patient.

169
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:53,870
Now that he is old and sick,

170
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,880
I don't even have one thousandth of his patience.

171
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,030
I'm such a jerk.

172
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,120
You've already done very well.

173
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:17,890
If it weren't for Dr. Xiao reminding me, I probably would have never realized what's truly important to me.

174
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,540
Thank you, Dr. Xiao.

175
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,290
Don't say that again.

176
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,370
It's good that you can think it through by yourself.

177
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,830
Hurry and go stay with your father.

178
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,030
You're here? Did you happen to hear everything?

179
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,310
Pretending to be deaf and mute.

180
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:10,600
Head Nurse, haven't you finished your shift? You should hurry and go home.

181
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,470
I'm waiting for Si Si. She is late again.

182
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,820
You can't stay here by yourself.

183
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,590
Head Nurse, Head Nurse, sorry I'm late.

184
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,510
I must give you the midnight shift to cure you this problem of being late.

185
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:29,260
I'll talk to you tomorrow. Gotta leave now.

186
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,090
Head Nurse, you haven't changed your clothes yet.

187
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,650
Keys?

188
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,210
Thanks.

189
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,800
Head Nurse.

190
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,200
Head Nurse was in such a rush. Did something happen?

191
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,490
No one has answered the phone in Head Nurse's home. She's worried about her husband, so she is going back to check.

192
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,230
Her husband is at home at this time?

193
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,530
Is he sick?

194
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:09,280
You... didn't know?

195
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,300
Know what?

196
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,950
Hurry and tell.

197
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:19,980
Actually, many people in the emergency department know about it.

198
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:24,410
They probably didn't tell you. It's...

199
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:28,440
Head Nurse's husband was in a car accident, and he's paraplegic.

200
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,800
When did this happen?

201
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,100
It's been eight or nine years. They were planning to get married.

202
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,440
Head Nurse's family kept persuading her to think it over.

203
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,690
But Head Nurse still married her husband.

204
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,570
All these years, she's stayed with him.

205
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:48,010
Head Nurse is truly great. This is so hard for her.

206
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:52,990
Also, Head Nurse can handle well all these things in the emergency department.

207
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:56,070
Except in controling her own life.

208
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:59,290
Sometime ago, I even asked Head Nurse

209
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:02,940
why she and her husband were married a long time but didn't want children. I...

210
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,480
You really could ask questions.

211
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,470
You've never told me.

212
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,660
- Why are you here? 
 - I just finished my shift.

213
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,550
I'm in a rush to get home, but can't get a taxi now.

214
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,810
Has something happened at home?

215
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:31,790
I called my husband several times, but he never answered, so I'm a little worried.

216
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,040
Get in the car then. I'll drive you there.

217
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,750
No, no, I'll delay you.

218
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,030
- No need. 
 - I'll take care of my stuff later. It's no bother. Hurry and get in the car.

219
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,070
I'm bothering you.

220
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,630
Move aside! Move aside!

221
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,380
Move aside! Move aside!

222
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,900
- What's the situation? 
 - The patient is 35, passed out in the plane.

223
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,970
The right leg is infected. Cause unknown. There's a stench.

224
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,880
The connective tissue around the skin, muscles, blood vessels and nerves of his legs

225
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,430
have extensive infection and decay.

226
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:25,930
High fever persists. There is the possibility of complicated myocarditis at any time.

227
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:28,820
These are just symptoms. The most important thing right now

228
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,980
is to find the cause of the deases and prescribe the correct treatment.

229
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,220
It looks like some kind of bacterial infection.

230
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:38,520
We have to hurry. Once blood stream infection occurs leading to multiple organ failures, it'll be too late.

231
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,700
Has his family been contacted?

232
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,470
They've been contacted and will come soon.

233
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,520
Let's hope the family can provide some clues.

234
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:48,350
A few days, he and some friends went to Yunling Mountain and stayed there for a few nights.

235
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:53,010
Previously when I talked to him on the phone, he said he saw snakes in the mountain.

236
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,980
Could it be that he got bit by a venoumous snake?

237
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,210
Did he tell you that he was bit by a snake?

238
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,280
No. He didn't say anything clearly.

239
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,320
He only told me that he had fun during those days.

240
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,670
He said he was coming back today.

241
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:09,260
How can such a healthy person be unconscious?

242
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:13,450
Don't worry yet. We'll definitely do our best to save him.

243
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,710
Do you know how to contact his friends?

244
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:18,370
Okay, I got it. Thanks.

245
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:24,490
- How is it? 
 - His friend said He Chun Sheng was indeed bit by a cobra in Yunling Mountain.

246
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:29,800
They were in the mountain and didn't have any antivenom, so they used a local folk method as treatment.

247
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,530
Later, it seemed he was okay, so he didn't tell his wife.

248
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:36,260
That means the cobra's venom caused the infection?

249
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,910
- Let's fight against the venom first. 
 - Hurry and prepare the antivenom.

250
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,390
Okay.

251
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,000
Director Lu, thank you. You can go back now.

252
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,590
Wait. I'll go up with you, in case you need some help.

253
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,410
Oh, there's no need. I've bothered you already.

254
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:05,410
It's fine. I'm already here. I'll go up to see how Xian Yun is.

255
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,480
Okay, let's go.

256
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,780
Xian Yun!

257
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,280
Xian Yun!

258
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,880
What happened?

259
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,820
What happened?

260
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:22,310
- No, don't touch me. I have pee on me. 
 - Get the wheelchair!

261
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,240
You're hurting again? I'll get the medicine for you.

262
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,260
DId you fall?

263
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,230
What's the matter with the leg here?

264
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,250
I got scalded by boiling water.

265
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,750
Do you have any burn medication at home?

266
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,010
- Yes. 
 - Bring it over here.

267
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,880
- What's the matter? Where did he get burned? 
 - The leg got scalded.

268
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,420
Let me.

269
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,960
I'll go get the medication. Four pills?

270
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,520
Director Lu, you must find me ridiculous.

271
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,130
What are you saying?  Here.

272
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:59,240
Central Pain Syndrome can cause incontinence.

273
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,520
Everyone knows that there's no help when the pain starts.

274
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,260
It's fine.

275
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,950
- Here's the antivenom.
 - Prepare for an IV bolus.

276
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:24,930
He seems to be allergic.

277
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:28,380
Connect nasal connula. Give two liters of flow. Prepare a 5 mg dexamethasone bolus.

278
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,760
Okay.

279
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,110
It wasn't an infection caused by the cobra venom.

280
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,780
What is it then?

281
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,690
I'd also like to know.

282
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,570
<i>[Isolation Area]</i>

283
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:07,550
Director Lu, just leave it be. I'll clean it up later by myself.

284
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:10,000
It's fine. I'm done already over here.

285
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,270
It's my fault for being careless. I always boil some water every day to let it cool.

286
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,250
When Xiao Shan gets back, she can drink it.

287
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,790
My body suddenly developed pain today. My hand trembled and scalded myself.

288
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:22,210
Your burn wound just needs medication for a few times.

289
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:25,940
- But your Central Pain Syndome seems to be more serious than before. 
 - Yes.

290
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,630
It's getting more and more painful. I looked it up online.

291
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:33,040
There is no solution in the world when it comes to illness in the head. Who knows when it will end.

292
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,690
Don't say that. Technology is advancing quickly these days.

293
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,800
Brain science is developing in leaps and bounds.

294
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,150
There may  be a new treatment soon.

295
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,930
You should adjust your mental state first.

296
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:46,180
That's how I console myself.

297
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,680
Let me do it. Let me.

298
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,440
It's good already.

299
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,680
You got wet all over.

300
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,590
It's fine.

301
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:59,720
The burn wound can't touch water in the next few days. You must be careful.

302
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,560
I've bothered you, Director Lu. Look at how I messed up your clothes.

303
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,560
Don't say that.

304
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,750
Director, this is Xian Yun's clothes, but it's clean. You can change your clothes.

305
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,730
No, no, no need. I already have spare clothes in my car.

306
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:16,700
How about this? Just let him rest, and I'll go back to the hospital. Okay?

307
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,250
Take good care. I'll leave now.

308
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,280
I'll walk you downstairs then.

309
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,240
No need. I'll go down by myself.

310
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,780
Just take care of Xian Yun.

311
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:26,990
- If there's anything, we can chat about it later. I'm leaving now. 
 - No.

312
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,860
I...

313
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,680
I'll see him off.

314
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:37,820
Xian Yun's central pain seems to be worse than before.

315
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,950
Yes. It started getting worse since the second half of last year.

316
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,280
Medication can only give temporary relief.

317
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,330
I told him to go to the hospital to check. He just wouldn't go.

318
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,620
He needs to go to the hospital.

319
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:52,580
But his mental state still seems pretty good.

320
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,470
He used to be a teacher, so he has pride.

321
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:59,120
And now, he wouldn't tell me no matter how much pain he's in.

322
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,020
You always work hard, and still have to take care of him when you get home.

323
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,120
Why haven't you thought about hiring a nanny?

324
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,740
Of course I'd like to get a nanny.

325
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:13,880
Given Xian Yun's current condition, I really worry when he is home alone.

326
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,820
But, as you know, it's really hard to find a good nanny now.

327
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,810
In addition, the wage is too high.

328
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:23,560
As a head nurse, I can't afford it.

329
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:28,980
That's true. A nanny''s wage is really high right now.

330
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,730
You should hurry back to take care of him. I'm leaving then.

331
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,990
- Thank you, Director Lu. 
 - Don't be courteous. Hurry and go back.

332
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,490
Okay. I've bothered you.

333
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:38,720
- Bye bye. 
 - Okay.

334
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:53,790
Hello, Director Song. I'm Lu Ping An from Tongshan Hospital.

335
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:58,530
How are you? I have a small matter to ask you for a favor.

336
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:04,090
Help me see if you have a care worker in your hospital that is willing to do home care.

337
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:09,050
Yes. We want a male, someone who follows orders and is capable.

338
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:12,950
As the price, it's fine as long as it's outrageous.

339
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:18,220
It's not convenient for me to speak up in my own hospital.

340
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:22,330
Okay, okay, just ask around for me. Thank you.

341
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:26,210
Okay, okay, I'll wait for your news then. Thanks.

342
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:28,990
Okay, okay, thanks.

343
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,450
You gave him my clothes. Would he actually wear it?

344
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:47,400
I saw that he was

345
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,110
wet all over. So he should change.

346
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,250
Don't say it so tactfully.

347
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,660
Was it wet? It was soiled.

348
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,560
It's got pee all over him.

349
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,120
I really lost face completely today.

350
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,390
My reputation is ruined.

351
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,650
So embarrassing!

352
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:06,850
Don't worry about it. We see that every day in the hospital.

353
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:10,940
Yeah, you've seen it all and don't find it unusual.

354
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:19,030
Okay, I wasn't thoughtful.

355
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,460
Alright?

356
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,210
Look at you. You haven't recovered from your cold.

357
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:25,060
Why try to do so much?

358
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:28,360
Here. Hurry and drink the cold medicine.

359
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,900
Hold it well.

360
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,430
Get up.

361
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:35,590
I'm a useless person now.

362
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:38,020
No work, no money.

363
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:42,170
I rely on my wife to support me and to serve me.

364
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,300
What's the use for me to stay alive?

365
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,230
Lift your arms.

366
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,680
Does it make any sense?

367
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,900
Why doesn't it make sense? As long as you're alive,

368
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,400
our home is whole.

369
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,560
How is it whole?

370
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,510
- Is this whole? Is this whole? 
 - What are you doing?

371
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:03,620
Wife, I know you want a child.

372
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:06,530
A home is whole when there is a child.

373
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,950
Didn't we agree not to talk about child?

374
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:42,470
Look at you. You don't understand.

375
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:45,780
Right now, it's a popular trend called

376
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:49,110
"No children, stay safe." Get it?

377
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:52,180
Having a child? Do you know how hard it is to raise a child these days?

378
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:55,310
Enough of that. I've already done online searches.

379
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:59,080
That's called, "No marriage, no children, stay safe."

380
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,830
We are married.

381
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:06,240
Do you think I'm living like a human? Is this a normal person's life?

382
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,790
Xian Yun.

383
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:22,990
Aren't we living pretty well right now?

384
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:28,530
We eat what we want. We have our own home, and a vehicle.

385
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:30,970
They all say, even my moped can count as a vehicle.

386
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:34,420
I want you to live a better life.

387
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:48,490
I'm sorry.

388
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,090
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

389
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,530
Wife.

390
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:02,250
If I didn't have the car accident, our child could be six years old by now.

391
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:05,860
We agreed not to talk about child again.

392
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:13,390
Xian Yun, I know you want to share my burden.

393
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,110
You are doing very well already.

394
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,840
I'm quite happy.

395
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:24,830
Wife,

396
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,080
I noticed that you have more and more wrinkles on your face.

397
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,300
Why do you keep upsetting me then?

398
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,300
Sorry.

399
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,490
You probably didn't eat lunch, right?

400
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:50,790
The usual then. Noodles, and I'll cook two eggs for you. Okay?

401
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:52,550
Lie down then.

402
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,090
Just now, Yi Ran briefed everyone on the patient's condition.

403
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:13,230
What does everyone think?

404
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,840
We can discuss.

405
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,380
Perhaps he was bit by another kind of snake?

406
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,440
Such as a local snake in the Yunling Mountain.

407
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:25,050
I did a search. There are three common snakes around Yunling Mountain.

408
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:28,170
Asian moccasins, Chinese Green Tree Viper, and Mangshan pit viper.

409
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:31,210
The cobra antivenum that we injected to the patient

410
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:34,060
is effective against the Chinese Green Tree Viper and Mangshan pit viper.

411
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,740
That leaves the Asian moccasins.

412
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:39,480
I don't know. Other than the patient himself, probably no one else knows.

413
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,170
But the patient is unconscious, while the infection is getting worse and worse.

414
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:47,110
Maybe we should try the antivenom for the Asian mocassins?

415
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:49,190
But the patient is already allergic.

416
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:51,320
We can't use the antivenom again.

417
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:56,060
The key is that none of us knows which kind of snake bit the patient.

418
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:59,790
Does Dr. Xiao mean to let the patient wait until he dies?

419
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:06,460
Do you have any ideas? Either allergic reaction or death. Pick one.

420
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:16,520
Sure. Let's do this then. Let's try again with the antivenom for Asian mocassins.

421
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,680
- We must prepare thoroughly to avoid any mishap with the patient. 
 - Okay.

422
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,020
Let's try again then.

423
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:31,380
Doctor, will he be allergic again?

424
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,720
Don't worry. If any allergic reaction appears,

425
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,230
we will immeiately take measures to ensure your husband's safety.

426
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,850
Thanks.

427
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,360
Oxygen mask. 50% concentration.

428
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:56,280
Teacher Bai, Teacher Xu. What do we do next?

429
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,330
Maybe the cause of infection is not snake venom.

430
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:01,460
- What is it then? 
 - Group A Streptococcus.

431
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:04,310
The patient has Necrotizing Fasciitis?

432
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,140
Yes, it's what's called the flesh-eating disease.

433
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,450
Why are you so sure that it's Group A Streptococcus?

434
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,980
Previously, I met a patient when I was abroad.

435
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,720
His symptoms were almost identical with this patient.

436
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,660
After several examinations, we discovered this patient previously was in contact

437
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,510
with the feces of a very rare wild monkey.

438
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:23,070
There was a lot of Group A Streptococcus in the feces.

439
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:25,690
In that case, it has nothing to do with the snake venom?

440
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:27,470
It has some connection more or less.

441
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:32,040
Group A Streptococcus usually enter the human body through an open wound.

442
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,660
If he hadn't been bitten, he wouldn't have gotten infected.

443
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:37,140
But this is only our speculation.

444
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:41,880
Let's do this. Send the tissue section and analysis results to the Municipal Center for Desease Prevention and Control.

445
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,470
Let's go.

446
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,490
We've sent your husband's tissue sample from the infected area to the Municipal CDC.

447
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:55,410
As confirmed by them, you husband is infected with a very rase disease in this country.

448
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:58,570
It's called flesh-eating disease. Amputation is needed.

449
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:01,180
Amputation?

450
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:04,670
The Group A Streptococcus has a very strong ability to reproduce in the human body.

451
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,990
Existing antibiotics aren't very effective.

452
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:11,370
If amputation isn't performed, it can lead to necrosis of muscles and tissues throughout the body.

453
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:14,570
Just like his leg right now, and it'll ultimately take his life.

454
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:16,880
Doctors, I beg you.

455
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,400
Please save him. Think of another solution.

456
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,170
Doctors.

457
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:24,340
We understand how you feel.

458
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:27,520
But the patient's condition cannot be further delayed.

459
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,560
If other parts of the body are also infected,

460
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,480
what needs to be amputated won't only be the calf.

461
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,600
The amputation surgery requires the family's signature.

462
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,880
Please decided as soon as possible, so that we can arrange for surgery.

463
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:44,030
I... I'll sign. I'll sign.

464
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,700
We'll have the surgery.

465
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,850
Okay. We'll arrange it immediately.

466
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,400
<i>[Tongshan Hospital]</i>

467
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,590
Mom, I'm really dizzy. I'm not lying to you.

468
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:05,040
I think you just don't want to go to school.

469
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,370
After the doctor examines you, if there's nothing,

470
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:09,560
watch how I'll deal with you.

471
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,110
Doctor, how is it?

472
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,460
His blood pressure, heart, and lungs are normal.

473
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,870
That means there's no problem then.

474
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:24,200
Mom, I really feel dizzy.

475
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,960
Do you have tinnitus? Any vomiting?

476
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,220
No.

477
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,670
When you look at an object, does it seem spinning?

478
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:32,850
No.

479
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:35,460
So he isn't sick at all, right?

480
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,810
The preliminary examination indeed doesn't show any anomaly.

481
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:43,210
But I recommend doing a head CT scan to find the cause.

482
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,450
There's no need.

483
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:47,010
He is just pretending to be sick to skip school.

484
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:49,510
Previously, he wanted to skip school,

485
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:52,070
so he pretended to have diarrhea. It isn't the first or second time already.

486
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:55,030
Tell me the truth. Do you really feel dizzy?

487
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,460
I really feel dizzy.

488
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,090
Mom, why don't you believe me?

489
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:01,020
That's enough, don't pretend to me anymore.

490
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,140
Hurry and be good to go back to school with me.

491
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,880
You're already a high school senior.

492
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,250
You're still not studying hard. How can you enter a good college?

493
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,530
But I feel dizzy and can't study at all.

494
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:13,750
I really recommend that you let him do a head CT scan.

495
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:17,960
I've heard that the head CT is bad to the brain.

496
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,150
He is going to take the national university entrance exam. His brain cannot be impacted.

497
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,550
Mom.

498
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:25,060
Mom, can we do it please?

499
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:28,580
Stop it. Doing a CT scan will let you be idle for half a day.

500
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,970
Hurry and go back to school with me.

501
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,960
Go. Let's return to the school.

502
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,660
How about I prescribe some anti-dizziness medication?

503
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,440
No need. We have them at home.

504
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,340
Go. Go back to school.

505
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,390
What are you thinking? Meditating?

506
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,780
You can help me to analyze something here.

507
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:07,600
A patient was saying he's feeling dizzy.

508
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,890
The exam doesn't show any anomaly.

509
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:13,510
- DId he get a CT scan? 
 - To bad he didn't.

510
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:15,490
The patient is a student.

511
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:17,450
His mother insisted that he was pretending.

512
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:20,250
She said that he's trying to skip school, so she didn't let him do the CT.

513
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,750
Mothers know their children the best.

514
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,920
His mother said he's pretending, he must be pretending.

515
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,190
This kind of stuff happsn all the time. Don't worry.

516
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:30,310
I'm worried that he may have other malignant diseases of the brain.

517
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:33,390
There are many causes for dizziness.

518
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:35,900
How could it be so coincidental?

519
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,210
A few days ago, I saw a girl

520
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:41,220
who said she was dizzy, similar to what you said.

521
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:44,070
She kept saying she had a stomach and other discomforts.

522
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:46,380
It's all for...

523
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,960
Dr. Xiao?

524
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:00,630
- What happened? 
- There was an explosion at the chemical plant. He has burns on 70% of his body.

525
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:02,840
Hurry and get him inside! Be careful.

526
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,780
Be careful. Be careful.

527
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,600
Doctor, could you go a little faster?

528
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,250
I need to go catch a flight to Beijing.

529
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:21,120
Your blood pressure is fluctuating quite significantly. How many years have you had high blood pressure?

530
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,600
Around 7 or 8 years. It has always been like this.

531
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,250
It's essential hypertension.

532
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:27,930
Can you just prescribe me some medicine? I really am in a hurry.

533
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:30,390
If you keep rushing me, don't blame me for misdiagnosing you.

534
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:33,290
Fine, fine, fine. I won't rush you. I won't rush you.

535
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:35,680
Would you mind please going a little faster?

536
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,960
Did you previously work out the root cause?

537
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,680
How many times have I said it, it's essential hypertension!

538
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,930
You have had this hypertension for many years.

539
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:47,830
Although they may not have found any problems at the time, I recommend you do a full physical examination now.

540
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:50,310
If we can identify the root cause, we can prescribe the right medicine and you will quickly get better.

541
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:53,670
My son has taken me overseas to get examined countless times.

542
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:56,230
Every time, the diagnosis was essential hypertension.

543
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:59,600
I do not believe your hospital is better than an overseas one.

544
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,790
Since you think the standard of medical care is better overseas, then what are you doing here?

545
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:08,830
Then what do you plan on checking?

546
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:12,200
Go get a registration number from the outpatient department first. Get them to perform a full physical examination on you.

547
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,560
These have all been checked before. They all didn't have any issues.

548
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,900
Not having any issues previously does not mean that you do not have any issues now.

549
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:22,090
It is very likely that enlarged adrenal glands do not get spotted in the beginning.

550
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:24,260
So I recommend you go get checked up now.

551
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,980
Can you guarantee that you can find the root cause?

552
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:31,740
No one can guarantee this. But I can tell you that I am doing this out of concern for your health.

553
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:37,960
You are making me get so many tests.

554
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,170
How much money can you get from it?

555
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,310
How about this? Since you are in a hurry, I will just prescribe some medicine for you.

556
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:52,890
Isn't that the end of it then?

557
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:59,190
Done.

558
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:03,720
- How bothersome.
 - Your medical history.

559
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,270
Thank you.

560
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:40,510
- You're brooding again?
 - I was just thinking,

561
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:43,840
you know that patient that left who said he was dizzy,

562
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,660
- how is he doing?
- Their family wouldn't cooperate.

563
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:49,680
What else could we do? Stop thinking about it.

564
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,090
Doctors are really so passive sometimes.

565
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:56,760
Once a patient leaves our hospital doors, they cut off communication from us.

566
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,710
All doctors can do then is to give them their blessing.

567
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,830
You make it sound like dating.

568
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:12,590
Walk faster.

569
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,730
Let me tell you, my biggest regret

570
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:19,460
was not studying properly when I was young.

571
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,610
I couldn't get into any colleges because of my college entrance exam results,

572
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:24,460
so I could only sell vegetables at the market with your grandfather.

573
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:27,060
I have been selling vegetables for over twenty years now.

574
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,570
Rising early and sleeping late.

575
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:32,470
Mum! Why are you talking about this again? You've told me a hundred times already.

576
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:34,800
Don't get annoyed with me.

577
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,730
You need to study hard, be determined,

578
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:41,290
get into college. Once you graduate from college, take the civil service examination.

579
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:45,190
Enough, enough, enough. I know. I'm going to school.

580
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,740
Study hard, okay?

581
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,100
Xiao Nan? Xiao Nan!

582
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:59,150
<i>How could this happen?</i>

583
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:04,480
Doctor? Doctor, save my son!

584
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,060
Please save my son!

585
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,730
Don't worry, we will do our best.

586
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:12,250
- What's the patient's situation?
- The patient is 18 years old. He was unconscious for 20 minutes before coming into hospital.

587
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,200
He does not have a heartbeat and is not breathing.

588
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:24,000
Push one milligram of epinephrine.

589
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:28,230
Pushed one milligram of epinephrine.

590
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,440
The patient's heartbeat has been restored.

591
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:57,370
Tang Hua, contact Radiology.

592
00:38:57,370 --> 00:39:00,130
Once the patient is stable, perform a head CT.

593
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,550
Okay.

594
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:06,620
Get an emergency blood test for the four panels and an electrocardiogram.

595
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:13,370
Doctor, doctor, what is wrong with my son?

596
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,600
We do not know right now. We still have to conduct a head CT.

597
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,840
Still have to conduct a...

598
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,170
How could this happen?

599
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,910
Acute cerebral hemorrhage. The bleeding site is in the posterior fossa.

600
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:29,220
If there is too much blood in that area, then he can't be saved, right?

601
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,510
Reduce intracranial pressure first. Contact Neurosurgery.

602
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,160
Conduct a lateral ventricular drain.

603
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,870
Okay. I will go now.

604
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:39,810
Where there is bleeding in the posterior fossa, a common first sign is slight dizziness.

605
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:44,190
Because the space in this section is too small, if the bleeding is excessive,

606
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:46,560
and the bleeding rate is fast, it will compress the brain stem.

607
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,810
This causes breathing and the heart to stop.

608
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:51,150
You need to save him.

609
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:53,330
He is only 18 years old.

610
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:56,760
The patient's current prognosis is not good.

611
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,690
But do not worry, we will try our very best.

612
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,800
We have already contacted a neurosurgical specialist.

613
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,420
When the time comes, they will conduct a lateral ventricular drain on the patient.

614
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:07,700
This will first reduce the intracranial pressure. Then we will address the bleeding issue.

615
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,090
Okay.

616
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:13,330
Doctor, if we had listened to you at the time,

617
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,650
and let Xiao Nan do a CT,

618
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:18,400
would this not have happened?

619
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:23,970
Tell me the truth.

620
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:32,400
If we had done the CT at the time,

621
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,330
it is possible we would have spotted the signs of bleeding earlier.

622
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:38,780
If we had responded in time,

623
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:42,020
it is possible it would not have reached this current stage.

624
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:45,050
It is all my fault!

625
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:47,470
He said he was dizzy.

626
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:50,580
Why didn't I believe him?

627
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:56,020
Xiao Nan, I did this to you.

628
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,590
I should die for this!

629
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:02,280
Don't be like this. The patient still has a chance of surviving.

630
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:05,230
Doctor, you must save me.

631
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,630
We will do our best.

632
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,940
If Xiao Nan does not make it, I don't want to live either!

633
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:13,120
- We will do our best. 
- Save him.

634
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,950
Doctor Xiao, we can perform the surgery now.

635
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:18,410
Dural scissors.

636
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:28,280
Trocar needle.

637
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:37,870
Drainage tube.

638
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,460
The intracranial pressure has been reduced,

639
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,690
but the posterior cranium is still bleeding.

640
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:15,020
The patient is going to die sooner or later.

641
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,420
As long as the patient is still breathing,

642
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:19,980
we cannot give up.

643
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:23,410
He is so young.

644
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,590
Based on our current medical skills,

645
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:35,360
a massive hemorrhage to the posterior fossa is inoperable.

646
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,110
Even if Hua Tuo was reincarnated, he wouldn't be able to turn around this hopeless situation. 
(TN: Hua Tuo was a legendary Ancient Chinese surgeon)

647
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:39,580
What about pharmacological treatment?

648
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:42,870
Existing medicine can only partially stop the bleeding.

649
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:47,050
Medicine currently has no effect on a massive hemorrhage of the posterior fossa.

650
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:50,320
The patient is only 18 years old. I want to keep trying.

651
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,140
How about this? When we meet with the patient's family tomorrow,

652
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:55,990
let's seek out their opinion, okay?
