1
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:09,985
Why the hell did you whistle?

2
00:00:09,985 --> 00:00:12,134
Why are you all dolled up today when nobody cares?

3
00:00:12,134 --> 00:00:14,676
- You're the only one who doesn't care, Seonbae.
- Me?

4
00:00:14,676 --> 00:00:16,652
Don't say that. I think you look nice.

5
00:00:16,652 --> 00:00:18,434
Since you're all dolled up, should we grab a bite together?

6
00:00:18,434 --> 00:00:21,696
I have an important plan today, so don't ruin it.

7
00:00:21,696 --> 00:00:24,476
- What is it? Tell me.
- No.

8
00:00:24,476 --> 00:00:26,026
- What is it?
- I won't tell you.

9
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,977
What is it?

10
00:00:27,977 --> 00:00:29,124
It's none of your business.

11
00:00:29,124 --> 00:00:30,665
What? What is it?

12
00:00:30,665 --> 00:00:36,220
[Love Class 2]

13
00:00:36,822 --> 00:00:39,130
[Last night]

14
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:52,345
[Cat Shelter]

15
00:00:52,345 --> 00:00:54,951
[It's a shelter for cats. Please don't litter.]

16
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:15,202
Do you want some water?

17
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,543
It's for stray cats, though.

18
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,478
Thank you.

19
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:42,575
How could they say that?

20
00:01:42,575 --> 00:01:45,811
They have no boundaries.

21
00:01:45,811 --> 00:01:49,096
How can they say that kissing was a silly joke?

22
00:01:49,096 --> 00:01:51,966
If playing that kind of joke is what friends do,

23
00:01:51,966 --> 00:01:55,238
then I have zero friends.

24
00:01:55,238 --> 00:01:58,471
They're drunk on friendship.

25
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:01,712
I hate the word "friendship."

26
00:02:01,712 --> 00:02:05,699
Exactly. I hate that word.

27
00:02:07,464 --> 00:02:10,714
Have you ever had the same experience?

28
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:16,083
Staying friends with the person you have feelings for.

29
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,681
Of course.

30
00:02:17,681 --> 00:02:20,924
I had that experience.

31
00:02:20,924 --> 00:02:22,559
So what did you do?

32
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:26,390
My case was special.

33
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,962
It didn't work out.

34
00:02:27,962 --> 00:02:31,243
But I'm sure your case will be different!

35
00:02:33,037 --> 00:02:34,684
Do you think so?

36
00:02:34,684 --> 00:02:38,186
People like that need to lose everything to learn.

37
00:02:38,186 --> 00:02:42,687
They need to lose you.

38
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:49,028
They can't lose me.

39
00:02:49,028 --> 00:02:50,906
Let me help you.

40
00:02:52,187 --> 00:02:53,678
How?

41
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,553
Let's set up a plan.

42
00:02:57,553 --> 00:02:59,606
A plan?

43
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:05,099
So this is the plan?

44
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:06,144
Yes.

45
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:12,453
I'll pretend to help him, then slowly make him my boyfriend.

46
00:03:12,453 --> 00:03:15,660
Did you check?

47
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,405
- Check what?
- Did you check?

48
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,611
He's not.

49
00:03:20,611 --> 00:03:23,117
- You're a collector.
- I'm not.

50
00:03:23,117 --> 00:03:26,289
He's decent and tranquil.

51
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:29,749
He looks very pretty when he cries.

52
00:03:29,749 --> 00:03:32,230
Think carefully about where his decency and tranquility

53
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,127
originate from.

54
00:03:35,127 --> 00:03:37,300
This time, he definitely isn't.

55
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,302
I knew you were screwed

56
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:43,536
when you chose to have a crush on me, of all people.

57
00:03:43,536 --> 00:03:46,941
I never had a crush on you.

58
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:54,325
Aish. Maybe I do have a screwed-up taste.

59
00:03:54,325 --> 00:03:57,476
I wish you luck.

60
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,214
Are they dating?

61
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:19,311
They're both good-looking, right?

62
00:04:19,311 --> 00:04:21,344
Don't comment on students' looks.

63
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,851
Wow, are you jealous?

64
00:04:23,851 --> 00:04:25,550
Jealous of what?

65
00:04:26,621 --> 00:04:28,961
Of their beautiful personal lives?

66
00:04:49,398 --> 00:04:51,482
These are my friends.

67
00:04:51,482 --> 00:04:53,890
This is Min Wu, and this is Ma Ru.

68
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,324
Hello.

69
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:59,742
Hi, I'm Kim An.

70
00:04:59,742 --> 00:05:01,224
But...

71
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,764
- He's the rooftop—
- Hey!

72
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:08,736
I'm just repeating what I heard.

73
00:05:08,736 --> 00:05:10,875
Really? Now?

74
00:05:14,513 --> 00:05:15,944
Jagi!
(T/N: a term of endearment, also meaning porcelain/china)

75
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:18,890
Hey, Sa Ra. You're here.

76
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:21,044
- Do you want coffee?
- Yes. Thanks, Jagi.

77
00:05:21,044 --> 00:05:22,578
Have a seat.

78
00:05:24,437 --> 00:05:25,810
Did she call him "jagi"?

79
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,865
Dojagi, baekjagi, cheongjagi?
(T/N: means ceramics, white porcelain, celadon porcelain

80
00:05:27,865 --> 00:05:29,751
- What's wrong with you?
- Why would she call him that?

81
00:05:29,751 --> 00:05:32,041
Is she saying he's cute? All of a sudden?
(Korean "agijagi," meaning "small and cute" in Korean)

82
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,041
Huh?

83
00:05:35,573 --> 00:05:37,073
I'll just go and do my assignment, and then I'll be back.

84
00:05:37,073 --> 00:05:38,461
Oh, okay.

85
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,093
Who's she?

86
00:05:48,156 --> 00:05:49,754
My new girlfriend.

87
00:05:49,754 --> 00:05:51,828
- Wow.
- When?

88
00:05:51,828 --> 00:05:53,529
It hasn't been that long.

89
00:05:55,281 --> 00:05:57,537
Let's do the assignment.

90
00:05:57,537 --> 00:06:00,263
- Why didn't you tell us?
- About what?

91
00:06:00,263 --> 00:06:01,582
That you got a girlfriend.

92
00:06:01,582 --> 00:06:02,846
You never told me, either.

93
00:06:02,846 --> 00:06:04,696
Yes, because I don't have any.

94
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,293
Anyway, congrats.

95
00:06:08,293 --> 00:06:10,811
Oh Min Wu finally got a girlfriend.

96
00:06:10,811 --> 00:06:12,790
Thanks.

97
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,199
Yes, congratulations, Min Wu.

98
00:06:17,498 --> 00:06:19,771
Introduce us later.

99
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:25,773
- Jagi, I have to go.
- Okay.

100
00:06:25,773 --> 00:06:28,164
- Call me later.
- I'll call you.

101
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:42,784
The assignment...

102
00:06:45,003 --> 00:06:47,500
We've been friends since elementary school.

103
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,264
Oh, really?

104
00:06:49,264 --> 00:06:52,138
You look like good friends.

105
00:06:52,138 --> 00:06:53,724
Yes.

106
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,597
We were good friends.

107
00:06:57,597 --> 00:07:01,068
So good that we didn't have secrets.

108
00:07:01,068 --> 00:07:02,782
But one of us has become a traitor.

109
00:07:02,782 --> 00:07:05,167
What's going on? Did you guys fight?

110
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:06,476
Ask him.

111
00:07:06,476 --> 00:07:08,869
I know nothing because he told me nothing.

112
00:07:08,869 --> 00:07:11,552
You're the one who said you didn't need to know.

113
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,441
Hi.

114
00:07:24,106 --> 00:07:26,471
It seems the assignment isn't going very well.

115
00:07:26,471 --> 00:07:28,416
Do you want my help?

116
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:29,583
Hyeong, is he your...

117
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,248
He's not my friend.

118
00:07:33,532 --> 00:07:35,078
No.

119
00:07:35,078 --> 00:07:37,278
We're not friends.

120
00:07:37,278 --> 00:07:39,206
We're much closer than that.

121
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:46,182
Do they know about you?

122
00:07:47,619 --> 00:07:49,650
How much do they know?

123
00:08:01,636 --> 00:08:03,462
Wow.

124
00:08:03,462 --> 00:08:04,837
Is this your place, Hyeong?

125
00:08:04,837 --> 00:08:06,200
Yes.

126
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,872
How did you afford it?

127
00:08:07,872 --> 00:08:09,207
I just did.

128
00:08:09,207 --> 00:08:11,108
What?

129
00:08:11,108 --> 00:08:12,175
Let me take that.

130
00:08:12,175 --> 00:08:16,036
Everyone's amazed by you, and for a good reason.

131
00:08:16,036 --> 00:08:18,654
The financial aid isn't enough to buy this place.

132
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,700
You can earn money.

133
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,331
Doing what?

134
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,132
Does it matter?

135
00:08:31,334 --> 00:08:33,177
This is our home.

136
00:08:35,493 --> 00:08:37,269
Our home...

137
00:08:45,652 --> 00:08:49,237
Hyeong, how much was it? It must've been expensive.

138
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,970
It wasn't that expensive.

139
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,866
Give me your tuition account. I'll pay.

140
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,157
No, I got it.

141
00:08:55,985 --> 00:08:58,462
Give it to me, I have the money.

142
00:08:59,012 --> 00:09:00,684
I'll pay.

143
00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:06,494
- I have to go.
- Right now?

144
00:09:06,494 --> 00:09:09,072
- I'll be home in the morning.
- Where are you going?

145
00:09:09,072 --> 00:09:10,382
To work.

146
00:09:14,414 --> 00:09:16,082
Good evening.

147
00:09:30,358 --> 00:09:34,179
Hyeong, what are we?

148
00:09:35,604 --> 00:09:37,402
- Us?
- Yes.

149
00:09:37,402 --> 00:09:40,691
We're family.

150
00:09:40,691 --> 00:09:44,389
You're my family, and I'm your family.

151
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,073
What is it?

152
00:10:02,073 --> 00:10:06,481
It's just that we were forced to be a family for eighteen years

153
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:08,413
in the orphanage.

154
00:10:08,413 --> 00:10:10,816
Then what do you want us to be?

155
00:10:34,784 --> 00:10:37,350
It can end.

156
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,155
We won't let it end.

157
00:10:42,191 --> 00:10:43,978
Everything ends.

158
00:10:43,978 --> 00:10:45,490
I like family.

159
00:10:46,636 --> 00:10:48,234
Let's be family.

160
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,323
Won't you regret it?

161
00:10:57,595 --> 00:10:59,743
We're already family.

162
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,579
Why are you doing this to me?

163
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:14,090
I don't know, either.

164
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,597
Everything turned out as you wished.

165
00:11:16,597 --> 00:11:18,795
What more do you want?

166
00:11:23,422 --> 00:11:26,520
I didn't wish for any of this.

167
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,029
I don't even like this situation right now.

168
00:11:29,874 --> 00:11:32,271
I don't know about you, but...

169
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:44,770
you probably won't like it, either.

170
00:12:05,287 --> 00:12:07,009
Hey, Brother.

171
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:08,727
I'll kill you.

172
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,403
Aish.

173
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:23,680
Wow, look at you chug that down.

174
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:28,610
This is so unfair.

175
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:34,431
Why are you laughing?

176
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,356
I'm sorry, tell me.

177
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:40,851
You were right.

178
00:12:40,851 --> 00:12:42,286
I thought so.

179
00:12:42,286 --> 00:12:43,429
And you know what?

180
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,668
Not only that, but the guy he has a crush on

181
00:12:46,668 --> 00:12:48,422
is my type.

182
00:12:48,422 --> 00:12:50,271
He was so cute.

183
00:12:50,271 --> 00:12:52,958
I'm such a loser.

184
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,424
That's crazy.

185
00:12:54,424 --> 00:12:58,637
Seonbae, I question my taste in men.

186
00:12:58,637 --> 00:13:01,676
Since you started helping him, you should stick with it.

187
00:13:01,676 --> 00:13:03,074
Why should I?

188
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:07,219
It will be kind of nice to help out two guys of your type date each other.

189
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,060
It's none of my business.

190
00:13:16,303 --> 00:13:17,373
What are you doing here?

191
00:13:17,373 --> 00:13:19,035
Hey.

192
00:13:19,035 --> 00:13:22,854
I heard the ceiling was leaking.

193
00:13:22,854 --> 00:13:24,643
But it's not.

194
00:13:24,643 --> 00:13:26,317
They said...

195
00:13:30,247 --> 00:13:33,001
Wow, they're good-looking.

196
00:13:33,001 --> 00:13:34,230
What department are they in?

197
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,913
Do you comment on students' looks, too?

198
00:13:36,913 --> 00:13:38,810
You're jealous.

199
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,287
I hate that word.

200
00:14:06,806 --> 00:14:09,640
[- Art Major Yu Juhyeok -
Time to prove it! Come to L306.]

201
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:24,663
Jeez. That's it? No context?

202
00:14:26,203 --> 00:14:30,121
No explanations, and so abrupt.

203
00:14:31,433 --> 00:14:33,433
In a sacred lecture hall...

204
00:14:34,973 --> 00:14:36,564
A student...

205
00:14:52,065 --> 00:14:54,263
He's insane.

206
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,210
Hey, listen...

207
00:15:05,148 --> 00:15:06,512
Hello.

208
00:15:07,418 --> 00:15:09,379
Come on in, Assistant Teacher.

209
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,074
Next pose.

210
00:15:59,953 --> 00:16:02,215
- Let's finish it by next week.
- Okay.

211
00:16:02,215 --> 00:16:04,293
Okay, bye.

212
00:16:05,491 --> 00:16:08,217
Thank you for your hard work.

213
00:16:09,295 --> 00:16:10,871
Bye.

214
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:14,432
"Bye"?

215
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:17,743
Do you want me to go?

216
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,070
Oh, thank you.

217
00:16:21,421 --> 00:16:23,719
I mean... just like that?

218
00:16:24,882 --> 00:16:26,554
Yes.

219
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:31,459
Were you expecting something else?

220
00:16:50,074 --> 00:16:51,392
Wash up.

221
00:16:51,392 --> 00:16:52,721
Okay.

222
00:16:53,618 --> 00:16:56,905
There are new toothbrushes in the second drawer.

223
00:16:56,905 --> 00:16:59,818
The blue bottle is for your face, the brown ones are for your body and hair,

224
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:02,229
and the towels are in the cabinet.

225
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,611
Okay.

226
00:17:17,841 --> 00:17:19,940
There aren't any toothbrushes.

227
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,440
What?

228
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,328
There aren't any toothbrushes.

229
00:17:28,373 --> 00:17:30,535
I don't have anything to wear.

230
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,948
Did you put it on?

231
00:17:52,948 --> 00:17:54,338
Yes.

232
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,066
Come on, you know better.

233
00:18:02,066 --> 00:18:03,674
Do I have to apologize?

234
00:18:03,674 --> 00:18:05,067
Whatever.

235
00:18:06,793 --> 00:18:08,247
Hyeon.

236
00:18:08,247 --> 00:18:09,938
Come on, stop.

237
00:18:09,938 --> 00:18:11,634
- What?
- Don't.

238
00:18:11,634 --> 00:18:12,635
- Just once.
- Go away.

239
00:18:12,635 --> 00:18:15,208
- Please?
- I said stop.

240
00:18:24,025 --> 00:18:26,153
Are you okay down there?

241
00:18:26,153 --> 00:18:27,917
I'm fine.

242
00:18:28,849 --> 00:18:30,302
Sorry.

243
00:18:30,302 --> 00:18:32,471
I'll be gone tomorrow.

244
00:18:34,191 --> 00:18:36,574
You can stay forever.

245
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:41,286
You must have really had nobody to turn to

246
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,457
to come to my house.

247
00:18:44,993 --> 00:18:47,389
If I could,

248
00:18:47,389 --> 00:18:49,868
I would let you live here.

249
00:18:55,326 --> 00:18:58,217
I had nowhere else to go, but

250
00:18:59,317 --> 00:19:02,345
that's not the only reason I came here.

251
00:19:14,939 --> 00:19:19,949
Maybe I wanted to come and see you.

252
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:28,423
The phone is turned off.

253
00:19:28,423 --> 00:19:32,080
Please leave a message after the beep.

254
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,941
Additional charges may apply.

255
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,490
Hey, Min Wu!

256
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,651
Now that you've got a girlfriend, you don't even tell me when you're not coming home?

257
00:19:39,651 --> 00:19:41,180
How could you?

258
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:45,103
You should have at least told me.

259
00:19:45,103 --> 00:19:48,398
I'll lock all the doors so you can't step a foot inside.

260
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:54,768
I'm joking, wake me up even if you come home late.

261
00:19:54,768 --> 00:19:57,837
I want to see you before I get to sleep.

262
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,354
Hey, Min Wu!

263
00:20:19,354 --> 00:20:21,546
Now that you've got a girlfriend, you don't even tell me when you're not coming home?

264
00:20:21,546 --> 00:20:23,031
How could you?

265
00:20:23,031 --> 00:20:26,369
You should have at least told me.

266
00:20:40,402 --> 00:20:45,871
[Love Class 2]

267
00:20:49,284 --> 00:20:50,571
Seonsaengnim.

268
00:20:50,571 --> 00:20:53,025
My parents are fighting again.

269
00:20:53,025 --> 00:20:56,313
I left because it was too noisy,

270
00:20:56,313 --> 00:20:58,087
but I have nowhere to go.

271
00:20:58,087 --> 00:21:02,144
You said I could contact you anytime, so I'm calling you.

272
00:21:09,349 --> 00:21:10,754
Lee Hyeon!

273
00:21:13,659 --> 00:21:14,982
Seonsaengnim...

274
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:19,151
You can't wander around at this hour.

275
00:21:19,151 --> 00:21:20,733
I was worried...

276
00:21:44,324 --> 00:21:45,938
You're home late.

277
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:47,738
Yes.

278
00:21:47,738 --> 00:21:49,747
I have something to tell you.

279
00:21:49,747 --> 00:21:51,292
What is it?

280
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:00,866
I don't

281
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,257
want us to be family anymore.

282
00:22:13,459 --> 00:22:15,019
Don't do this.

283
00:22:20,816 --> 00:22:22,436
Why?

284
00:22:22,436 --> 00:22:25,145
You're the one who said you wouldn't regret it.

285
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:56,210
♫ That moment when you, whom I have been waiting for, ♫

286
00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:00,110
♫ Appeared before me ♫

287
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:06,950
♫ When life gives only you light ♫

288
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:11,380
♫ Be the light by my side. The way you look ♫

289
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:15,220
♫ Raises me up again ♫

290
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:21,940
♫ It makes my heart feel full, makes my heart flutter ♫

291
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,240
♫ It's you ♫
