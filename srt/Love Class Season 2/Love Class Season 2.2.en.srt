[Love Class 2]

2
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:25,167
So...

3
00:00:25,167 --> 00:00:28,946
I've been watching for a while, and you two haven't said anything to each other yet.

4
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:33,191
Why don't you guys start talking?

5
00:00:33,191 --> 00:00:35,740
- Okay.
- Sure.

6
00:00:43,368 --> 00:00:46,079
- Excuse me, Seonsaengnim...
- Don't talk to me.

7
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,758
Why...

8
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:54,239
The professor told us to talk.

9
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,598
All right, let's have a normal conversation.

10
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,993
Nice weather.

11
00:01:02,887 --> 00:01:05,060
Can't you tell me?

12
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:07,475
Did you have lunch?

13
00:01:07,475 --> 00:01:10,045
- Why did you suddenly disappear?
- What did you have?

14
00:01:10,045 --> 00:01:11,488
Why aren't you telling me?

15
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:14,190
Lower your voice. We are in class.

16
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,452
If you disappeared just like that, you should at least tell me why.

17
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:20,030
Do you know how hard it was to find you?

18
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,532
I hope this class ends soon.

19
00:01:22,532 --> 00:01:23,961
Hey.

20
00:01:25,462 --> 00:01:27,738
Watch your tone.

21
00:01:27,738 --> 00:01:30,716
I never once held a grudge against you.

22
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:34,720
I knew we would meet one day, and you would explain everything.

23
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,522
So I waited and waited.

24
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:45,063
Fuck. Are you running away again?

25
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:51,311
You two.

26
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:54,005
Stay behind after class.

27
00:01:59,194 --> 00:02:03,890
Is there a serious problem between you two?

28
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,702
Was there violence or something unethical?

29
00:02:07,702 --> 00:02:09,203
No, Ma'am.

30
00:02:10,705 --> 00:02:12,749
It's a personal matter.

31
00:02:12,749 --> 00:02:15,993
I'm sorry for disturbing the class.

32
00:02:17,462 --> 00:02:19,047
Is that true?

33
00:02:19,047 --> 00:02:20,437
Yes.

34
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:25,345
You're not even enrolled in my class.

35
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:28,857
I can't take any more students because it's already full.

36
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,859
Then...

37
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,120
I'll just audit.

38
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,524
I don't recommend that because it doesn't involve any responsibilities.

39
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:41,305
There are more assignments and presentations than you expect.

40
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:45,782
I'll work just as hard as everyone else.

41
00:02:45,782 --> 00:02:48,572
Why? You won't get a grade.

42
00:02:49,577 --> 00:02:51,171
Um...

43
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,107
I just...

44
00:03:00,496 --> 00:03:02,749
I'll give you two a special assignment.

45
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:05,543
Write about what you want to say to each other.

46
00:03:05,543 --> 00:03:07,804
It's an extra assignment, so you'll present it at the very end.

47
00:03:07,804 --> 00:03:11,398
Oh, that's on top of the other assignments, of course.

48
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:18,606
I'll just drop this class. Goodbye.

49
00:03:18,606 --> 00:03:20,600
Why are you doing this to me?

50
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,477
I should ask you the same question.

51
00:03:22,477 --> 00:03:24,413
Did you come to this school because of me?

52
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:27,757
If I did, you should be proud of me.

53
00:03:27,757 --> 00:03:30,259
I studied really hard, you know.

54
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,513
Aren't you happy to see me?

55
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:35,146
Why not?

56
00:03:36,991 --> 00:03:39,368
I was so glad to finally see you again.

57
00:03:39,368 --> 00:03:41,539
Why isn't it the same for you, Seonsaengnim?

58
00:03:42,955 --> 00:03:44,916
What do you want from me?

59
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:48,562
We didn't break up on bad terms.

60
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:51,672
We weren't serious.

61
00:03:51,672 --> 00:03:53,556
Did something happen?

62
00:03:54,342 --> 00:03:55,832
No.

63
00:03:59,055 --> 00:04:01,182
What do you think you're doing?

64
00:04:02,975 --> 00:04:05,052
Don't you dare drop the class.

65
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:08,804
It's the least you could do

66
00:04:08,804 --> 00:04:11,013
after ruining my high school life.

67
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:15,527
And don't ignore my calls from now on.

68
00:04:44,433 --> 00:04:46,745
- Ma Ru, Ma Ru!
- What took you so long?

69
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,145
I was so bored.

70
00:04:48,145 --> 00:04:51,023
Oh, were you? Were you bored?

71
00:04:51,023 --> 00:04:53,067
Ma Ru finished his coffee.

72
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:55,653
Do you want something else? We'll get you one when we order ours.

73
00:04:55,653 --> 00:04:57,831
- What do you want?
- Really?

74
00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:59,674
Then...

75
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,325
Strawberry juice.

76
00:05:01,325 --> 00:05:03,661
Strawberry juice? Okay, okay.

77
00:05:03,661 --> 00:05:04,704
Let's go.

78
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:06,247
- Hurry.
- All right.

79
00:05:06,247 --> 00:05:07,290
What will you get?

80
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,508
For me...

81
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:11,783
Iced... Iced Americano?

82
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,482
Hey, did you hear?

83
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,551
There's a ghost at our school.

84
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:21,053
Every school has that kind of story.

85
00:05:21,053 --> 00:05:22,739
That's for high schools.

86
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,849
No, it's every school.

87
00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:27,810
Maybe it's because kids have a lot of energy.

88
00:05:28,352 --> 00:05:30,438
- To suppress it?
- Yes.

89
00:05:30,438 --> 00:05:34,901
I heard the ghost at our school is related to a real case.

90
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:38,446
Ghosts aren't scary. People are the scariest.

91
00:05:38,446 --> 00:05:40,448
You won't regret saying that, will you?

92
00:05:40,448 --> 00:05:42,575
Stop.

93
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:45,162
But ghosts really do exist.

94
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:50,203
I've heard of people who are only book-smart.

95
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,919
I'm talking about you.

96
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,462
Oh, okay.

97
00:05:54,462 --> 00:05:57,173
Why do you keep wiping this same table?

98
00:05:57,173 --> 00:05:59,039
Can't you see there are other tables?

99
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,941
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,488
I guess...

101
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,815
you're not that smart.

[Business Administration '22 Lee Hyeon]

103
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:46,283
You picked up.

104
00:07:47,783 --> 00:07:49,544
You told me to.

105
00:07:49,544 --> 00:07:51,495
Good boy.

106
00:07:51,495 --> 00:07:53,527
Hang up if you have nothing to say.

107
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:57,725
Your voice sounds groggy. Were you sleeping?

108
00:07:59,302 --> 00:08:01,851
I called because you didn't reply to my text.

109
00:08:02,423 --> 00:08:04,550
I know that it's a bit late.

110
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:08,751
I woke you up, didn't I? Sorry.

111
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:11,282
No, you didn't.

112
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,601
Why did you call?

113
00:08:13,601 --> 00:08:16,896
We should meet up to work on the assignment.

114
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,747
Read the text and write me back.

115
00:08:19,747 --> 00:08:21,450
Okay.

116
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,098
Then...

117
00:08:27,615 --> 00:08:29,324
I'll hang up now.

118
00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:28,926
Hey, how can you leave without saying anything?

119
00:09:28,926 --> 00:09:32,477
What if I had gotten sick from sleeping in the coffee shop all night?

120
00:09:33,055 --> 00:09:35,471
Will you take care of me if I get sick?

121
00:09:37,434 --> 00:09:39,812
How could you leave me there?

122
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:42,815
You knew I had fallen asleep while waiting for you.

123
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:46,443
I've been so nice to you these days,

124
00:09:46,443 --> 00:09:49,672
and you're taking advantage of it, aren't you?

125
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,323
Hey, Min Wu.

126
00:09:51,323 --> 00:09:52,931
Well?

127
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,571
When is this going to stop?

128
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:04,295
What is?

129
00:10:04,295 --> 00:10:08,732
You've been acting like this toward me lately.

130
00:10:09,925 --> 00:10:11,687
I haven't.

131
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,674
I know.

132
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:18,255
You think I'm pathetic.

133
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:23,814
I didn't quit my job just because I wanted to stay home and do nothing.

134
00:10:23,814 --> 00:10:26,613
I wanted to tell you first, but...

135
00:10:27,818 --> 00:10:30,067
you avoided me.

136
00:10:36,118 --> 00:10:38,413
We're still best friends, right?

137
00:10:38,413 --> 00:10:40,164
I like you.

138
00:10:40,164 --> 00:10:42,333
I like you most in the whole wide world.

139
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,123
You know, right?

140
00:10:45,794 --> 00:10:47,565
Let's head inside.

141
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,871
Wait a second.

Hey, Eun Jeong.

Where are you?

00:11:01,143 --> 00:11:02,936
What are you doing?

145
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:07,172
Right now? But it's too late.

146
00:11:08,359 --> 00:11:12,235
Hey, don't do that. You have to be more careful.

147
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:15,808
All right, I'm coming.

148
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:18,328
No, it's okay. Yes.

149
00:11:18,328 --> 00:11:21,525
Be careful, and stay somewhere bright. I'm on my way.

150
00:11:21,525 --> 00:11:23,193
Okay.

151
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,201
I should get going.

152
00:11:34,802 --> 00:11:36,016
Here.

153
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,908
Don't lend your jacket to anyone else, okay?

154
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:42,893
Only me. Got it?

155
00:11:42,893 --> 00:11:44,439
See you tomorrow.

156
00:12:04,581 --> 00:12:07,386
- Hey, Ma Ru.
- Here, take one.

157
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,484
It's tasty. What is it?

158
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,759
This?

159
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:17,411
That's a green tea milkshake mixed with

160
00:12:17,411 --> 00:12:19,872
a chocolate milkshake made with half the chocolate powder,

161
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:22,391
swirled with one pump of chocolate syrup and one pump of caramel syrup,

162
00:12:22,391 --> 00:12:25,394
some chocolate chips blended into the drink and some sprinkled on top,

163
00:12:25,394 --> 00:12:29,442
and cream whipped softly so it mixes well with the drink.

164
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:31,859
Okay.

165
00:12:31,859 --> 00:12:34,903
I ordered this at the coffee shop where Min Wu works at their busiest time.

166
00:12:34,903 --> 00:12:37,489
- Did Min Wu make this?
- No, he's not there.

167
00:12:37,489 --> 00:12:40,700
Only the manager who's bullying Min Wu.

168
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,953
I see.

169
00:12:42,953 --> 00:12:44,163
Do you have plans for tonight?

170
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:45,331
No.

171
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:48,625
- Come to Gilmok. Let's hang out.
- Okay.

172
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,669
- By the way, Lee Hyeon...
- What?

173
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:51,837
It's five minutes to nine.

174
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:53,589
Whoa! Bye!

175
00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:55,900
- Thanks.
- See you later.

00:13:00,262 --> 00:13:01,917
Hello.

178
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:07,311
What do you like to eat? Japanese? Chinese?

179
00:13:07,311 --> 00:13:10,464
No. Hello, Teaching Assistant, hello...

180
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,860
- Teaching Assistant, hello.
- Oh, hi.

181
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,153
I'll make sure I pay you back.

182
00:13:16,153 --> 00:13:17,237
Oh, okay.

183
00:13:17,237 --> 00:13:19,823
I have to go because I'm running late, but let me treat you next time.

184
00:13:19,823 --> 00:13:21,207
Okay, sure.

185
00:13:24,495 --> 00:13:28,497
Teaching Assistant, hello.

186
00:13:28,497 --> 00:13:30,285
Yes, hello.

187
00:13:37,069 --> 00:13:38,443
Are you busy these days?

188
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:41,495
Yes, as usual.

189
00:13:41,495 --> 00:13:42,930
But you still eat, right?

190
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,515
Yes, I do.

191
00:13:44,515 --> 00:13:46,765
Then let's go eat together.

192
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:51,397
- I think I'm good.
- "You're good"?

193
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:52,717
Yes.

194
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,111
Is it because of what happened the other day?

195
00:13:57,111 --> 00:13:59,530
Well, not really, but...

196
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:00,656
What?

197
00:14:00,656 --> 00:14:03,474
I mean, last time—

198
00:14:03,474 --> 00:14:07,955
Oh! You feel bad because you're not in my department, right?

199
00:14:07,955 --> 00:14:09,719
I'm really okay.

200
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,752
Good luck with your classes.

201
00:14:28,016 --> 00:14:30,255
So this is what you look like.

202
00:14:31,145 --> 00:14:34,048
I should have taken a picture.

203
00:14:34,048 --> 00:14:36,383
I regretted that so much.

204
00:14:36,383 --> 00:14:40,578
I couldn't remember the small things.

205
00:14:41,989 --> 00:14:43,942
You have pretty ears.

206
00:14:45,075 --> 00:14:46,326
Stop staring.

207
00:14:46,326 --> 00:14:48,287
Can't I even look at you?

208
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,194
Aren't we going to do the assignment?

209
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:52,833
Then...

210
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,627
I'll ask you questions instead of looking at you.

211
00:14:55,627 --> 00:14:57,045
What do you do when you're alone?

212
00:14:57,045 --> 00:14:58,338
I don't do anything.

213
00:14:58,338 --> 00:15:01,084
- What about hobbies?
- I don't have any.

214
00:15:02,092 --> 00:15:03,760
What's your favorite food?

215
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,387
I just eat anything.

216
00:15:05,387 --> 00:15:07,514
- What's your MBTI type?
- I don't know.

217
00:15:07,514 --> 00:15:09,288
Those answers are terrible.

218
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:14,999
Then I'll ask a question that you can't answer shortly.

219
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:20,887
What happened in the past three years?

220
00:15:22,996 --> 00:15:25,349
Are you dating someone?

221
00:15:25,349 --> 00:15:26,927
Yes? Or

222
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:28,324
no?

223
00:15:31,121 --> 00:15:32,992
Let's go somewhere else.

224
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:43,016
No way.

225
00:15:44,384 --> 00:15:45,911
Are you serious?

226
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,181
Come on.

227
00:15:51,808 --> 00:15:54,940
It's not the time to read books.

228
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,285
Seonsaengnim.

229
00:16:10,285 --> 00:16:11,870
Seonsaengnim!

230
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,441
Hey, Kim An!

231
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,627
What are we doing here?

232
00:16:18,627 --> 00:16:21,046
- What?
- What are we doing here?

233
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:22,839
I can't hear you.

234
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:25,057
This is so frustrating.

235
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:43,313
[What are we doing here?]

236
00:16:49,032 --> 00:16:50,826
[The assignment.]

237
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:05,674
[You talk too much.]

238
00:17:17,544 --> 00:17:21,164
[Are you not observing me? I am, so it doesn't matter.]

239
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,723
[It would only be possible if you had four eyes.]

240
00:18:05,525 --> 00:18:08,362
Should we eat dinner?

241
00:18:08,362 --> 00:18:09,651
No.

242
00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:17,384
People might think I hit you.

243
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,915
Sorry.

244
00:18:19,915 --> 00:18:21,708
Can't you talk to me?

245
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,293
What about?

246
00:18:23,293 --> 00:18:24,670
Anything.

247
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,197
Don't you have anything to say to me?

248
00:18:27,197 --> 00:18:28,340
I don't.

249
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,405
Can I walk you home then?

250
00:18:35,597 --> 00:18:36,932
What are you trying to do?

251
00:18:36,932 --> 00:18:39,518
I'm just frustrated.

252
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:41,269
We haven't seen each other in three years.

253
00:18:41,269 --> 00:18:44,497
Even strangers would be happier than this to see each other.

254
00:18:45,482 --> 00:18:47,692
Did I do something wrong?

255
00:18:51,113 --> 00:18:53,320
I just don't get it.

256
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:57,448
Seonsaengnim, why did you change so much?

257
00:18:59,329 --> 00:19:02,124
I wasn't a good tutor to you anyway.

258
00:19:02,124 --> 00:19:03,910
Don't expect anything from me.

259
00:19:06,253 --> 00:19:09,570
You're right. You're not my tutor anymore.

260
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,538
So I'll call you hyeong.

261
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,502
Did you hear me?

262
00:19:24,354 --> 00:19:26,106
- Let's drink.
- Cheers.

263
00:19:26,106 --> 00:19:28,324
Good to see you.

264
00:19:30,527 --> 00:19:32,279
- Buddy, if you're drunk,
- Yes.

265
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:33,947
pay the bill and go home.

266
00:19:33,947 --> 00:19:36,307
I'm done for today, man.

267
00:19:40,829 --> 00:19:42,831
- Let's drink.
- Drink up.

268
00:19:42,831 --> 00:19:45,191
Good to see you.

269
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:54,009
Why are you drinking alone, Hyeon?

270
00:19:54,009 --> 00:19:57,471
Because you're going around the tables like a puppy.

271
00:19:57,471 --> 00:19:59,055
Where is Min Wu?

272
00:19:59,055 --> 00:20:03,035
He's always so busy with work and school.

273
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,913
- Did you even call him?
- Of course.

274
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,765
- Be nice to him.
- Hey!

275
00:20:08,765 --> 00:20:11,129
I know that already.

276
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,836
Why did you quit your job?

277
00:20:14,654 --> 00:20:17,741
Because I didn't want to waste my youth.

278
00:20:17,741 --> 00:20:22,621
Are you spending your youth well drinking in a bar?

279
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,080
Did you have to?

280
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,874
The company had great potential.

281
00:20:25,874 --> 00:20:27,751
I don't know. Whatever.

282
00:20:27,751 --> 00:20:29,313
I won't live like that anymore.

283
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:31,052
I'm going to travel,

284
00:20:31,052 --> 00:20:34,608
I'm going to date people...

285
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,339
That's how I'm going to live.

286
00:20:37,385 --> 00:20:40,430
Ma Ru, go easy on the dating.

287
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:44,768
- Your bones will become brittle.
- You're not the one to say that.

288
00:20:44,768 --> 00:20:46,765
You're...

289
00:20:47,771 --> 00:20:49,898
Min Wu! You're here!

290
00:20:49,898 --> 00:20:51,675
What took you so long?

291
00:20:51,675 --> 00:20:54,736
Hey, Ma Ru.

292
00:20:56,738 --> 00:20:58,949
- Are you Ma Ru's friend?
- Yes.

293
00:20:58,949 --> 00:21:01,426
Nice to meet you.

294
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,661
- Ma Ru.
- Yes?

295
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,538
You're so cute.

296
00:21:04,538 --> 00:21:06,477
- Then give me a pat.
- Okay.

297
00:21:09,764 --> 00:21:11,753
Hello.

298
00:21:11,753 --> 00:21:13,446
Hello.

299
00:21:13,964 --> 00:21:15,507
So cute.

300
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:17,342
Where's your table?

301
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:18,301
- Over there, over there.
- Over there?

302
00:21:18,301 --> 00:21:20,053
I was right here.

303
00:21:20,053 --> 00:21:23,148
Let's go have another drink at your table.

304
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:25,378
- Okay.
- Let's have another drink.

305
00:21:29,273 --> 00:21:30,945
Hey, are you leaving?

306
00:21:31,648 --> 00:21:33,245
Hey, Hyeon.

307
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,195
Let's go back inside. We haven't hung out in a while.

308
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:40,932
No, I came too late.

309
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:42,951
Maybe next time.

310
00:21:42,951 --> 00:21:44,578
Are you really going?

311
00:21:44,578 --> 00:21:46,686
Yes, I'll just go.

312
00:21:49,165 --> 00:21:50,949
Min Wu.

313
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,088
You know he's always like that. He's drunk too.

314
00:21:55,088 --> 00:21:57,647
I'm not leaving because of Ma Ru.

315
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:00,994
All right, bye.

316
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,681
But he'll go to your place anyway.

317
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:46,005
Hello?

318
00:22:46,005 --> 00:22:48,642
You answered my call again.

319
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:55,173
Do you know how badly I've been wanting to hear your voice all this time?

320
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:57,166
Did you drink?

321
00:22:59,719 --> 00:23:02,362
You're answering my calls now.

322
00:23:05,367 --> 00:23:07,290
That's enough for me.

323
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:10,413
That's all I need.

324
00:23:14,617 --> 00:23:16,251
Good night.

325
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:58,086
Hey, I saw him at school a few days ago.

326
00:23:58,086 --> 00:23:59,379
- Do you mean Kim An?
- Yes.

327
00:23:59,379 --> 00:24:01,131
He came back.

328
00:24:01,131 --> 00:24:02,465
I thought he would never come back.

329
00:24:02,465 --> 00:24:04,384
Wasn't he expelled?

330
00:24:04,384 --> 00:24:08,054
No, we only saw him get arrested. No one saw what happened after that.

331
00:24:08,054 --> 00:24:09,114
Was he found innocent?

332
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,325
Wow, was it that serious?

333
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:13,059
Did he commit a crime?

334
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:17,497
He pushed someone off the rooftop, so the police came and took him.

335
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:20,967
Maybe they interviewed him as a witness.

336
00:24:20,967 --> 00:24:23,753
I don't know, but it was my first time seeing the police arrest someone on campus.

337
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:25,697
Hold on, so he was dragged out wearing handcuffs?

338
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:26,781
That's what I heard.

339
00:24:26,781 --> 00:24:28,844
You mean, it was like a murder?

340
00:24:30,952 --> 00:24:32,916
Anyway, it's scary.

341
00:25:01,483 --> 00:25:02,845
Who is it?

342
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:21,878
[Love Class 2]

343
00:25:21,878 --> 00:25:24,130
This is a common logarithm.

344
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:26,674
And you write it

345
00:25:26,674 --> 00:25:30,011
as log 1.

346
00:25:30,011 --> 00:25:33,206
What will you do for me if my grade increases?

347
00:25:33,206 --> 00:25:35,433
Well, that's good for you, not me.

348
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:38,019
I need motivation.

349
00:25:38,019 --> 00:25:40,256
What do you want?

350
00:25:42,023 --> 00:25:44,526
Your phone number, maybe?

351
00:25:44,526 --> 00:25:47,028
I can give it to you right now. 010...

352
00:25:47,028 --> 00:25:48,738
What? Just like that?

353
00:25:48,738 --> 00:25:50,990
I can give you my number even if you get the lowest grades in class.

354
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:55,478
Actually, that's when I should give it to you so that I can keep tutoring.

355
00:25:55,478 --> 00:25:57,705
All you care about is money.

356
00:25:57,705 --> 00:25:59,274
Pass me your phone.

357
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:09,949
Call me any time if anything happens.

358
00:26:10,885 --> 00:26:12,633
Any time?

359
00:26:13,388 --> 00:26:15,309
Any time.
