[Love Class 2]

3
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,871
This is nice.

4
00:01:58,871 --> 00:02:00,662
I know, right?

5
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,141
I smell grilled fish.

6
00:02:06,787 --> 00:02:08,904
What do you want for lunch?

7
00:02:08,904 --> 00:02:10,724
Anything.

8
00:02:10,724 --> 00:02:12,059
Whatever you want.

9
00:02:12,059 --> 00:02:14,143
I want what you want.

10
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,358
Cucumber gimbap?

11
00:02:21,034 --> 00:02:22,893
- How cute of you.
- Okay, okay.

12
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:25,772
- All right.
- You only remember things I hate.

13
00:02:25,772 --> 00:02:27,814
I remember things you like too.

14
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,316
Like what?

15
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,711
Me.

16
00:02:30,711 --> 00:02:33,008
Are you crazy?

17
00:02:34,581 --> 00:02:36,750
Okay, okay, okay.

18
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:47,793
- Why don't you look for him anymore?
- Whom?

19
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:50,856
You were looking for someone last semester.

20
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,533
Did you know about that?

21
00:02:53,533 --> 00:02:54,533
Yes.

22
00:02:55,374 --> 00:02:58,267
What about you? When did you last talk to Ma Ru?

23
00:02:59,105 --> 00:03:00,440
I don't know.

24
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,057
I told you to call him often

25
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:04,377
because he gets lonely easily.

26
00:03:04,377 --> 00:03:05,435
You do it.

27
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,046
I do.

28
00:03:07,046 --> 00:03:08,689
Call him now.

29
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,096
Right now?

30
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:15,254
He must be at work.

31
00:03:15,254 --> 00:03:16,488
Just do it.

32
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,736
He will hang up if it's a bad time.

33
00:03:20,493 --> 00:03:21,911
Oh, come on.

34
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:29,807
Hang up. Let's do a video call.

35
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,774
- What did he say?
- He wants to do a video call.

36
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,761
Put a shirt on while I'm asking nicely.

37
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,065
- Hey, Guys.
- Come on.

38
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,151
What's wrong with him?

39
00:03:45,151 --> 00:03:47,699
Exactly.

40
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,289
Why did you hang up?

41
00:03:50,289 --> 00:03:51,648
Why did you take off your shirt?

42
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,326
I was working out.

43
00:03:53,326 --> 00:03:55,110
Do you take your clothes off at work too?

44
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,529
Should I come over to you guys and show you my muscles?

45
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:58,998
Is it your day off?

46
00:03:58,998 --> 00:04:00,233
Not really.

47
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:05,287
You have to see it in person so you can bow down to me.

48
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:09,166
Ma Ru, you're taking off clothes at work and talking nonsense.

49
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,876
Work hard.

50
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,379
Don't get on everyone's bad side.

51
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:16,961
Yes, make lots of money and buy us something yummy.

52
00:04:17,483 --> 00:04:19,022
I love you.

53
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:22,304
He hasn't changed.

54
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:23,889
I wonder if something's wrong.

55
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,058
He kind of felt weird just now.

56
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:26,993
Do you think so?

57
00:04:26,993 --> 00:04:28,694
You can ask him later.

58
00:04:28,694 --> 00:04:30,196
You ask him.

59
00:04:30,196 --> 00:04:33,896
You know him better than I do.

60
00:04:36,536 --> 00:04:37,870
I'll get going.

61
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,906
- Your part-time job?
- Yes.

62
00:04:39,906 --> 00:04:42,408
- Bye.
- Bye.

63
00:05:34,196 --> 00:05:36,696
[Kim An]

64
00:06:02,188 --> 00:06:03,256
Yes.

65
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,828
No, as I said before,

66
00:06:08,828 --> 00:06:11,112
it would be difficult.

67
00:06:14,467 --> 00:06:15,868
No, yes.

68
00:06:15,868 --> 00:06:18,404
We are not in charge of those materials.

69
00:06:18,404 --> 00:06:20,506
Yes, yes.

70
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:22,615
That's true, but...

71
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:25,967
Yes.

72
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:28,013
- Oh...
- Just do it.

73
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:29,806
I said, just do it.

74
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,434
Just do as I tell you!

75
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:35,187
I'll bring it to you in a couple of hours.

76
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:38,569
Yes, before 3 o'clock...

77
00:06:40,059 --> 00:06:41,294
Yes.

78
00:06:41,294 --> 00:06:44,823
Sure, goodbye, Professor.

79
00:06:48,467 --> 00:06:50,157
What is it?

80
00:06:50,936 --> 00:06:52,709
Here you go.

81
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:00,379
You were supposed to submit this before the semester began.

82
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:02,881
Why are you handing it in so late? Don't you have any friends?

83
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,113
No.

84
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:08,087
Oh, really?

85
00:07:08,087 --> 00:07:10,656
There's only one locker left,

86
00:07:10,656 --> 00:07:12,158
but it's locked with a lock.

87
00:07:12,158 --> 00:07:14,517
I told them to remove it, but they must have forgotten.

88
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,929
I'll unlock it for you right away.

89
00:07:16,929 --> 00:07:19,356
Is the locker A-23?

90
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,767
Oh, was it?

91
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:23,134
I locked it.

92
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,153
You did?

93
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,572
Yes.

94
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:28,799
So I can unlock it.

95
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,687
Okay.

96
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:55,559
Hello.

97
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:58,380
- Hello.
- Hello.

98
00:08:00,673 --> 00:08:01,807
Excuse me.

99
00:08:01,807 --> 00:08:05,026
Excuse me, Professor Min wants you in the art room.

100
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,412
The art room?

101
00:08:06,412 --> 00:08:07,980
- Yes.
- Not the storage?

102
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,880
Yes. Hurry, he's waiting.

103
00:08:18,724 --> 00:08:20,059
Why are you so late?

104
00:08:20,059 --> 00:08:21,293
This way.

105
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:23,044
- Yes, I—
- I'll take that.

106
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,331
I have lots of work to do.

107
00:08:25,331 --> 00:08:27,173
What is this?

108
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,636
Professor Min asked me to move it.

109
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:33,539
Anyway, you can get undressed in there.

110
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,141
Undressed?

111
00:08:35,141 --> 00:08:36,733
Professor Min?

112
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,085
There are sixty of us waiting for you.

113
00:08:40,846 --> 00:08:42,188
Sixty?

114
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,608
But me?

115
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:46,980
Yes, let's go.

116
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,940
E-Excu—

117
00:09:02,902 --> 00:09:05,128
Did you get undressed? Can I open the door?

118
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:06,772
No, no.

119
00:09:06,772 --> 00:09:08,607
I'm sorry, but can you hurry?

120
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,106
Okay.

121
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,517
Do you see the robe?

122
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,670
Put that on.

123
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,268
Okay.

124
00:09:27,493 --> 00:09:28,761
I'm sorry.

125
00:09:28,761 --> 00:09:30,129
I found the model.

126
00:09:30,129 --> 00:09:32,864
What are you saying? He's in here.

127
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:36,872
What are you talking about? He's here.

128
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:45,258
Who are you?

129
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:49,652
I'm Kim Seung Min, a teaching assistant in Business Administration.

130
00:10:02,528 --> 00:10:03,829
Goodbye.

131
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:06,732
Please put the materials in the storage.

132
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:08,567
Sure. I'm sorry.

133
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:10,603
No, it's fine.

134
00:10:26,051 --> 00:10:28,354
So what should we eat?

135
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,173
Hello.

136
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,527
Is there anything we need?

137
00:10:34,527 --> 00:10:36,070
Have a look.

138
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:39,298
What the hell?

139
00:10:39,298 --> 00:10:41,267
It's me, your Ma Ru.

140
00:10:41,267 --> 00:10:43,569
Of course, I know it's you.

141
00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:45,353
Why are you here right now?

142
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,739
What about work?

143
00:10:46,739 --> 00:10:49,174
I quit.

144
00:10:49,174 --> 00:10:50,109
What?

145
00:10:50,109 --> 00:10:52,485
Do you want to see my muscles?

146
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,279
Don't change the subject.

147
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:57,616
What? Let me show you.

148
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:59,752
Seriously...

149
00:10:59,752 --> 00:11:00,686
Go back to your table.

150
00:11:00,686 --> 00:11:02,288
I will show you.

151
00:11:02,288 --> 00:11:04,056
Go.

152
00:11:06,891 --> 00:11:08,460
Aren't you going to work?

153
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,467
- Hurry.
- Yes, I'm sorry.

154
00:11:15,868 --> 00:11:18,037
- Ma Ru!
- Hey, over here.

155
00:11:18,037 --> 00:11:20,773
Hey, you lost so much weight.

156
00:11:20,773 --> 00:11:23,028
I'm on a diet.

157
00:11:23,028 --> 00:11:24,910
You did lose a lot of weight.

158
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,646
We live in the same neighborhood.

159
00:11:35,187 --> 00:11:36,696
Is this right?

160
00:11:38,223 --> 00:11:39,933
Maybe not.

161
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:19,894
I'm sorry, but what class did you just take?

162
00:13:19,894 --> 00:13:21,521

163
00:13:21,521 --> 00:13:23,422

00:13:28,758 --> 00:13:29,935
Thank you.

166
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:31,833
Musical class.

167
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,354
Thank you.

00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,328
History of Cultural Arts.

169
00:13:35,328 --> 00:13:37,133
Thank you.

170
00:13:51,824 --> 00:13:53,041
Kim An?

171
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,693
You know him, right?

172
00:13:54,693 --> 00:13:56,426
He's in our department, right?

173
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,798
Yes, he was a freshman in 2020.

174
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:02,835
Can you tell me his phone number?

175
00:14:02,835 --> 00:14:06,178
That's personal information.

176
00:14:07,439 --> 00:14:09,407
I can't tell you that.

177
00:14:13,512 --> 00:14:15,188
What is it about?

178
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,902
But...

179
00:15:01,006 --> 00:15:02,261
Hey.

180
00:15:02,261 --> 00:15:03,729
When is your friend going to leave?

181
00:15:03,729 --> 00:15:06,824
I ordered three drinks.

182
00:15:12,805 --> 00:15:14,606
- Hey.
- Yes?

183
00:15:14,606 --> 00:15:16,791
Did you see that TV series?

184
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,744
"Seven Connectors."

185
00:15:18,744 --> 00:15:20,654
No.

186
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:22,181
Then...

187
00:15:22,181 --> 00:15:23,649
What about that variety show?

188
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:25,751
"After Dating."

189
00:15:25,751 --> 00:15:28,353
I don't think I've seen it.

190
00:15:28,353 --> 00:15:31,824
Why is a young guy like you not watching these shows?

191
00:15:31,824 --> 00:15:34,704
You do weird stuff at home like a geek, right?

192
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:39,105
See? I knew it.

193
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,800
I've seen a lot of guys like you.

194
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,136
Guys that look like you are all geeks

195
00:15:44,136 --> 00:15:46,338
but are into weird stuff.

196
00:15:46,338 --> 00:15:49,274
You like antisocial stuff, don't you?

197
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:53,645
They're all losers.

198
00:15:53,645 --> 00:15:55,769
When I see you, I think...

199
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:00,319
- Hey.
- Yes?

200
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:02,831
Go and get me some cigarettes.

201
00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:04,423
Okay.

202
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:06,191
The menthol ones. You know that, right?

203
00:16:06,191 --> 00:16:07,439
Yes.

204
00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:25,268
Don't run errands for him.

205
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,146
He will keep asking you.

206
00:16:28,146 --> 00:16:30,694
Give someone an inch, and they'll take a mile.

207
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:37,122
You're too nice.

208
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:38,289
I'm not nice.

209
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:40,292
Then why are you doing this for him?

210
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:42,411
I don't want trouble.

211
00:16:44,096 --> 00:16:47,699
I can make him quit.

212
00:16:57,175 --> 00:16:58,844
Nice to meet you, everyone.

213
00:16:58,844 --> 00:17:02,280
I'm Professor Kim Yeong Ju.

214
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:12,124
Marriage and family begin from an understanding of "community."

215
00:17:12,124 --> 00:17:17,329
Marriage and family are both types of relationships in this society.

216
00:17:18,063 --> 00:17:20,966
I'm sure some of you saw the word "marriage"

217
00:17:20,966 --> 00:17:23,735
and decided to take this class.

218
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:28,589
I know that this class is known

219
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,309
as a great place to date someone.

220
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:33,011
Thanks to that, I get more and more students each semester.

221
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:37,682
But if you give this class a bad review because it doesn't work out,

222
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,059
it upsets me.

223
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,230
You guys won't do that, right?

224
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:51,063
But...

225
00:17:53,665 --> 00:17:57,936
I guess I can tell you which elective class he's taking.

226
00:17:57,936 --> 00:18:00,621
It's "Marriage and Family."

227
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,731
I remember because I never imagined him taking that class.

228
00:18:03,731 --> 00:18:06,821
The class starts at...

229
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:10,407
Right now. Building A, room 501.

230
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,262
Now, the most important part.

231
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:19,724
Let's choose your partners for this semester.

232
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:23,161
Stand up one by one and tell us your name, your major,

233
00:18:23,161 --> 00:18:27,032
and what makes you the happiest these days.

234
00:18:27,032 --> 00:18:28,600
Okay?

235
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,636
Hello, I'm Seo Ji Min. I study Veterinary Medicine.

236
00:18:31,636 --> 00:18:34,740
My name is Yun Se Yeon. I'm an English major.

237
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,408
I'm Hwang Seung Jun. I'm a Theater major.

238
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:39,160
These days, I feel the happiest

239
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,747
when I watch Netflix at home.

240
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:45,249
A lot of people come and give me flowers,

241
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,611
and they recognize my talent.

242
00:18:46,611 --> 00:18:48,847
My dog is eighteen years old.

243
00:18:48,847 --> 00:18:52,250
He can barely eat or keep his eyes open.

244
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,576
So when he eats the snacks I make for him—

245
00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:17,586
I want to partner up with that guy.

246
00:19:20,934 --> 00:19:26,543
[Love Class 2]

247
00:19:26,543 --> 00:19:28,887
The number on the bottom.

248
00:19:28,887 --> 00:19:30,555
It's the exponent of this number.

249
00:19:30,555 --> 00:19:33,358
How many times do I have to tell you?

250
00:19:33,358 --> 00:19:36,328
You never listen to me!

251
00:19:36,328 --> 00:19:38,630
How many times have I told you not to do that?

252
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:41,466
I've been saying it for years. I can't do this anymore!

253
00:19:41,466 --> 00:19:42,901
Jeez!

254
00:19:42,901 --> 00:19:44,936
Stop, stop! What the hell are you doing?

255
00:19:44,936 --> 00:19:47,172
You can't tutor me. You're only a few years older than me.

256
00:19:47,172 --> 00:19:50,258
How dare you yell at me?

257
00:19:50,258 --> 00:19:52,077
Get a grip!

258
00:19:52,077 --> 00:19:54,045
We can't live like this forever.

259
00:19:54,045 --> 00:19:58,049
I'll leave. I'll leave this place and die.

260
00:19:58,049 --> 00:20:00,051
- Get out! Get out!
- Yes, we're only a few years apart

261
00:20:00,051 --> 00:20:01,575
I can't be your tutor.

262
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,539
Let's play a game.

263
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:05,437
The loser buys pizza.

264
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,002
What kind of tutor are you?

265
00:20:17,002 --> 00:20:19,604
What kind of student are you?

266
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:29,000
♫ That moment when you, whom I have been waiting for, ♫

267
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,810
♫ Appeared before me ♫

268
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:39,750
♫ When life gives only you light ♫

269
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:44,160
♫ Be the light by my side. The way you look ♫

270
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,920
♫ Raises me up again ♫

271
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:54,670
♫ It makes my heart feel full, makes my heart flutter ♫

272
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,860
♫ It's you ♫
