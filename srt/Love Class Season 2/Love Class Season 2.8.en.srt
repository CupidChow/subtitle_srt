00:00:00,587 --> 00:00:05,964
[Love Class 2]

2
00:00:40,494 --> 00:00:42,043
Ma Ru?

3
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:50,801
Min Wu...

4
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,048
Yes?

5
00:00:52,048 --> 00:00:54,244
Where are you going?

6
00:00:54,244 --> 00:00:56,218
You're burning up.

7
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,768
I'm sick.

8
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,728
Are you okay?

9
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,465
Why are you sick?

10
00:01:03,465 --> 00:01:05,404
What happened?

11
00:01:06,242 --> 00:01:09,187
I don't know. It's all because of you.

12
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,156
Did you eat something?

13
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,590
You need to take some medicine.

14
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,343
No.

15
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:21,893
You ate, right? Spaghetti...

16
00:01:21,893 --> 00:01:22,997
What?

17
00:01:23,785 --> 00:01:27,066
You had a nice lunch earlier.

18
00:01:27,066 --> 00:01:28,708
Om nom nom...

19
00:01:29,259 --> 00:01:30,481
It looked delicious.

20
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:34,084
Hang in there. I'll go buy some medicine.

21
00:01:34,722 --> 00:01:36,644
No.

22
00:01:37,504 --> 00:01:38,907
Why?

23
00:01:47,591 --> 00:01:49,207
Ma Ru.

24
00:01:49,812 --> 00:01:51,671
Don't talk.

25
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,273
Is this a prank?

26
00:02:25,264 --> 00:02:27,261
Does it feel like a prank?

27
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:00,655
Lee Si Wu.

28
00:03:37,256 --> 00:03:39,873
You scared me.

29
00:03:39,873 --> 00:03:42,027
Why are you doing this?

30
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,162
Kim An.

31
00:03:47,162 --> 00:03:48,763
Yes, what?

32
00:03:49,408 --> 00:03:50,996
Decide.

33
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,511
Decide what?

34
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,018
Do you want to stay with me

35
00:03:58,426 --> 00:04:02,663
or be a villain by yourself?

36
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,933
What do you mean?

37
00:04:11,993 --> 00:04:14,072
At the host club,

38
00:04:15,896 --> 00:04:18,249
I worked under your name.

39
00:04:19,923 --> 00:04:22,981
Your professor that we saw on the street...

40
00:04:24,827 --> 00:04:27,253
She was easy to seduce.

41
00:04:27,253 --> 00:04:30,349
I told her I needed money, and she gave it to me.

42
00:04:30,349 --> 00:04:32,614
I gave her...

43
00:04:34,345 --> 00:04:36,394
your name.

44
00:04:36,999 --> 00:04:39,616
I showed her your student ID.

45
00:04:42,736 --> 00:04:44,586
Do we look alike?

46
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:48,114
She thought I was you.

47
00:04:49,027 --> 00:04:50,671
Hyeong.

48
00:04:51,428 --> 00:04:54,499
If I disappeared right now, you could live as me.

49
00:04:55,225 --> 00:04:57,433
What do you think?

50
00:04:57,433 --> 00:04:59,557
Should I disappear?

51
00:04:59,557 --> 00:05:01,315
Why did you do such a thing?

52
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:06,175
I don't know.

53
00:05:07,046 --> 00:05:09,545
I guess I knew this day would come.

54
00:05:16,412 --> 00:05:18,502
If I fall from here,

55
00:05:20,972 --> 00:05:23,639
people will think you pushed me.

56
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,723
There are people down there.

57
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:33,306
Hyeong, come down from there.

58
00:05:33,306 --> 00:05:35,038
Decide.

59
00:05:38,528 --> 00:05:40,320
Do you want to stay with me

60
00:05:42,446 --> 00:05:45,585
or live like garbage alone?

61
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:57,180
You're not saying anything.

62
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,870
The hideout!

63
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:34,976
This reminds me of that day.

64
00:06:34,976 --> 00:06:36,767
Should I fall again?

65
00:06:38,103 --> 00:06:40,269
Please don't be like this.

66
00:06:41,266 --> 00:06:43,483
You don't have to do this.

67
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:48,698
I don't know why this keeps happening.

68
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,454
Hyeong.

69
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,650
Where did it all go wrong?

70
00:06:58,454 --> 00:07:00,388
How can we...

71
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,120
Should I push you?

72
00:07:12,851 --> 00:07:14,781
Maybe I'll just push you.

73
00:07:19,334 --> 00:07:20,960
Go ahead.

74
00:07:26,825 --> 00:07:28,989
Do you think I can't do it?

75
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,439
I think you can.

76
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,354
Do you want to die?

77
00:07:40,921 --> 00:07:42,908
No, I want to live.

78
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,968
And why is that?

79
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,438
Why do you want to live?

80
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:53,024
You...

81
00:07:53,581 --> 00:07:56,834
You don't know what I've done to survive.

82
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,660
I didn't have a mom or a dad to protect me,

83
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,667
and my only brother left, leaving behind fucking rumors.

84
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:09,795
I was treated like a dog at school and became a social outcast, yet I...

85
00:08:11,112 --> 00:08:13,041
I still want to live.

86
00:08:13,971 --> 00:08:16,062
I want to live happier than anyone else.

87
00:08:17,126 --> 00:08:18,848
But what can I do?

88
00:08:20,425 --> 00:08:22,978
If you want to kill me, you should just go ahead.

89
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,806
That will be my fate.

90
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:27,968
Right?

91
00:08:32,526 --> 00:08:34,229
So do as you wish.

92
00:09:01,305 --> 00:09:03,284
How strange.

93
00:09:07,427 --> 00:09:09,906
No matter how hard I try to ruin you,

94
00:09:11,058 --> 00:09:13,443
you never become like me.

95
00:09:18,995 --> 00:09:24,685
I always thought we were similar.

96
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,140
Maybe I was wrong.

97
00:09:49,378 --> 00:09:51,153
Take care.

98
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:56,040
Let's not see each other anymore.

99
00:10:18,278 --> 00:10:19,688
Hyeong!

100
00:10:24,087 --> 00:10:26,002
Did something happen?

101
00:10:26,002 --> 00:10:28,603
You wouldn't pick up my calls. I got so worried.

102
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,330
I'm hungry.

103
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,563
What?

104
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,964
I'm hungry.

105
00:10:34,964 --> 00:10:36,772
Let's go eat.

106
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,018
Eat.

107
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,703
Let's eat.

108
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,770
Hyeon.

109
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:07,083
Yes?

110
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:11,749
I don't

111
00:11:14,402 --> 00:11:16,670
have family anymore.

112
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:29,287
Hyeong.

113
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:09,953
It's fixed.

114
00:12:11,404 --> 00:12:13,347
Did you fix it?

115
00:12:13,347 --> 00:12:15,516
No, I called the district office.

116
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,300
There's that smile.

117
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:25,057
Seriously... When you started crying,

118
00:12:25,057 --> 00:12:26,871
my heart dropped.

119
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,973
I'm sorry.

120
00:12:29,973 --> 00:12:32,267
Don't apologize.

121
00:12:33,842 --> 00:12:35,345
I was taken aback.

122
00:12:35,345 --> 00:12:37,088
It was so...

123
00:12:39,136 --> 00:12:40,672
So what?

124
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,283
Only cry in front of me now.

125
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,565
Just say okay.

126
00:12:55,565 --> 00:12:57,119
Okay?

127
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,850
Okay.

128
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,344
Let's go.

129
00:13:07,595 --> 00:13:08,926
Get inside.

130
00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:10,930
Okay.

131
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,486
By the way, your house is a mess.

132
00:13:28,064 --> 00:13:30,415
It is, isn't it?

133
00:13:31,025 --> 00:13:33,035
I'm an expert at cleaning, you know?

134
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:35,682
It's all right, I can do it.

135
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:37,725
Two are faster.

136
00:13:41,347 --> 00:13:43,523
I'm really good at it.

137
00:13:59,136 --> 00:14:00,932
[It would only be possible if you had four eyes.]

138
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,898
Yes, Professor.

139
00:14:32,898 --> 00:14:33,898
Yes.

140
00:14:34,764 --> 00:14:35,764
Yes.

141
00:14:36,582 --> 00:14:37,582
Pardon?

142
00:14:38,381 --> 00:14:41,231
Dropped... What?

143
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,424
Of course, I can find it for you.

144
00:14:49,424 --> 00:14:51,543
Where did you drop it?

145
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,701
Oh, here it is.

146
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,792
- It was a bug.
- There are bugs here.

147
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:34,792
Yes.

148
00:16:00,971 --> 00:16:02,280
Min Wu.

149
00:16:05,072 --> 00:16:07,262
Check if my fever went down.

150
00:16:08,662 --> 00:16:09,961
Sure.

151
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,436
I think it did.

152
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,380
Good.

153
00:16:58,047 --> 00:16:59,911
- Min Wu.
- Yes?

154
00:16:59,911 --> 00:17:01,485
Do you want to hold hands?

155
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,509
What?

156
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,641
I'm going to eat at your school cafeteria.

157
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,869
- Okay.
- What's on the menu?

158
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:22,300
I don't know.

159
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,164
How can you not know? It's your school.

160
00:17:25,164 --> 00:17:27,458
I don't know.

161
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,573
I hope grilled mackerel is on the menu.

162
00:17:36,895 --> 00:17:39,752
- I have plans.
- What plans?

163
00:17:41,776 --> 00:17:44,469
Would you look at them?

164
00:17:45,134 --> 00:17:46,762
Who was it again?

165
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,179
- Hello.
- Oh, Sa Ra.

166
00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:52,000
You two are looking good.

167
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,156
- Sa Ra, do you want to fight?
- Hey.

168
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,264
Come on, you're supposed to back me up.

169
00:17:56,264 --> 00:17:58,062
What's your name?

170
00:17:58,906 --> 00:18:01,638
I'm Ma Ru. Shin Ma Ru.

171
00:18:01,638 --> 00:18:03,615
Jeez, even his name is cute.

172
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:05,157
Hey, Cutie,

173
00:18:05,157 --> 00:18:08,827
thank me for bringing you two together.

174
00:18:08,827 --> 00:18:11,085
Better pay me back with something good. Got it?

175
00:18:11,085 --> 00:18:12,219
Got it.

176
00:18:14,702 --> 00:18:17,211
What is she talking about?

177
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:20,161
That looks heavy.

178
00:18:23,325 --> 00:18:27,198
Thank you for your unnecessary kindness.

179
00:18:27,198 --> 00:18:30,239
Members of society should be kind to one another.

180
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:31,671
Stop being nice.

181
00:18:31,671 --> 00:18:34,348
I keep getting the wrong idea because everyone is so nice.

182
00:18:34,348 --> 00:18:35,662
- Sa Ra.
- What?

183
00:18:35,662 --> 00:18:38,143
Admit that you have a type.

184
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,164
Mission success?

185
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,753
A massive success.

186
00:18:44,753 --> 00:18:46,792
Look at them holding hands on campus.

187
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,252
Can you believe that?

188
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,715
Then that leaves me.

189
00:18:50,715 --> 00:18:52,798
Do you want me to help you out too?

190
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,401
Seong Min won't answer my calls. It's weird.

191
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:56,552
Did something happen between you two?

192
00:18:56,552 --> 00:19:00,063
- I kinda played hard to get.
- You did?

193
00:19:00,063 --> 00:19:01,432
Yes.

194
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:04,185
Why did you do that when he's already tired as it is?

195
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:06,528
- Aren't you supposed to play hard to get?
- Gosh...

196
00:19:06,528 --> 00:19:08,814
If you play too hard, you'll kill him.

197
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,775
That's extreme.

198
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:14,507
He's not a student. He works here.

199
00:19:14,507 --> 00:19:16,447
You might not think it's a big deal,

200
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:21,247
but he must have concerns because this is his workplace.

201
00:19:21,247 --> 00:19:23,245
It will make things only harder if you confuse him.

202
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,827
He seemed to enjoy it.

203
00:19:24,827 --> 00:19:27,041
You like trouble.

204
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:30,332
It's only fun for troublemakers like you.

205
00:19:30,332 --> 00:19:32,157
Then what am I supposed to do?

206
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:35,653
Just tell him how you feel. Don't drag it out.

207
00:19:35,653 --> 00:19:37,668
Then he'll respond.

208
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,860
I'm scared.

209
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,941
Love is only for brave people.

210
00:19:43,941 --> 00:19:45,368
Fighting.

211
00:19:45,368 --> 00:19:46,997
Fighting.

212
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:51,112
Love is only for...

213
00:19:51,112 --> 00:19:52,311
Love is only for brave people.

214
00:19:52,311 --> 00:19:53,776
Hey, you'll do well.

215
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,462
Hold this.

216
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:57,334
Why did you even offer to carry it in the first place?

217
00:19:57,334 --> 00:19:59,162
Okay...

218
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,445
I was very young.

219
00:20:03,445 --> 00:20:06,497
When I found someone that I liked,

220
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:10,000
I wanted to share everything that I liked with him.

221
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,557
So I took him to eat my favorite food,

222
00:20:14,557 --> 00:20:17,302
which was naengmyeon.

223
00:20:17,976 --> 00:20:19,861
I love naengmyeon.

224
00:20:19,861 --> 00:20:24,817
I brought him to naengmyeon places three times a day,

225
00:20:25,677 --> 00:20:29,284
and he ended up in the hospital.

226
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:35,461
Every relationship is a process of trial and error.

227
00:20:35,461 --> 00:20:39,561
But those moments help you learn more about each other.

228
00:20:39,561 --> 00:20:44,935
I wish I had found that out before he had to go to the hospital.

229
00:20:44,935 --> 00:20:48,220
Kim An and Hyeon, you're late.

230
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,498
I'm sorry.

231
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,585
You'll be the first ones to present your next assignment.

232
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,337
Okay

233
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:58,943
Speaking of which, I'll tell you about your next assignment.

234
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,978
It's the "date mission" that you've all been waiting for.

235
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,045
What is the definition of a "date"?

236
00:21:11,045 --> 00:21:13,855
The dictionary definition of "date" is...

237
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,667
I can't wait for our date.

238
00:21:17,355 --> 00:21:18,915
And you?

239
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,182
We've already done everything.

240
00:21:22,182 --> 00:21:26,217
Wow, you're the exact opposite of romantic.

241
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:35,762
[Ma Ru]
[Let's hang out!]

242
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,453
What if Hyeon gets angry?

243
00:21:38,453 --> 00:21:40,295
I know.

244
00:21:40,295 --> 00:21:43,373
He might call us traitors for breaking our friendship...

245
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:49,223
but I won't give up.

246
00:21:49,223 --> 00:21:50,819
Give up on what?

247
00:21:52,071 --> 00:21:54,121
My love for you.

248
00:21:58,031 --> 00:22:00,861
- What are you laughing about?
- You're here.

249
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,851
What do you want to eat?

250
00:22:02,851 --> 00:22:05,006
It's my treat.

251
00:22:05,903 --> 00:22:08,875
You two look extra friendly today for some reason.

252
00:22:09,776 --> 00:22:11,045
We have something to tell you.

253
00:22:11,045 --> 00:22:12,716
What is it?

254
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,660
Thank you.

255
00:22:17,215 --> 00:22:18,695
- You tell him.
- Me?

256
00:22:18,695 --> 00:22:20,688
I can't do it.

257
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,469
Are you guys dating?

258
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,972
How did you know?

259
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:33,227
Finally, after a million years, you guys are dating.

260
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:34,958
You knew?

261
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,814
- I had some idea.
- How?

262
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:39,060
I just knew it.

263
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,163
He's a psychic.

264
00:22:41,803 --> 00:22:44,258
You guys were super obvious.

265
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:48,784
So... are you upset?

266
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:52,417
Because we broke our friendship?

267
00:22:52,417 --> 00:22:54,619
Just be happy together.

268
00:22:54,619 --> 00:22:57,570
As long as I'm here, our friendship will be maintained.

269
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:06,496
Let's drink.

270
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,352
Excuse me!

271
00:23:28,211 --> 00:23:30,367
You're still in your office.

272
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,822
Hello?

273
00:23:31,822 --> 00:23:34,147
Hi, you're still in your office.

274
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:42,459
For some odd reason, it feels like you're avoiding me.

275
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:56,012
Wow, this is killing me.

276
00:23:57,502 --> 00:24:00,166
Assistant Teacher, can I call you Hyeong from now on?

277
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:01,608
No.

278
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:04,692
No?

279
00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:08,348
I don't think you should.

280
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:19,643
There's nothing going on between us,

281
00:24:19,643 --> 00:24:22,187
but I'm getting a strange feeling.

282
00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:26,608
It feels like something happened that I don't know about.

283
00:24:27,874 --> 00:24:29,638
Am I right?

284
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:33,997
As you said,

285
00:24:33,997 --> 00:24:37,226
nothing's going on between us, so how can anything happen?

286
00:24:38,139 --> 00:24:40,170
Nothing happened.

287
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,655
Seriously...

288
00:24:43,539 --> 00:24:46,245
It's so difficult.

289
00:24:51,445 --> 00:24:54,139
Could it be that you're dumping me?

290
00:24:55,064 --> 00:24:58,225
Or was this bound to happen from the start?

291
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,258
If you have to say it, spit it out now

292
00:25:04,258 --> 00:25:07,773
so I can go and research

293
00:25:07,773 --> 00:25:10,075
how to keep you interested in me.

294
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,780
Is that all you can say?

295
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,178
What about you? How do you feel?

296
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:22,346
And have you ever thought how I would feel talking like this to you?

297
00:25:23,953 --> 00:25:26,458
What more do I have to do?

298
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,720
What more do I have to do to...

299
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:42,472
Do you know how hard it is to dig deeper into something

300
00:25:42,472 --> 00:25:44,628
that I know nothing about?

301
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:50,735
Even now, I feel stupid for wanting to see you smile at me.

302
00:25:50,735 --> 00:25:52,263
I'm the idiot.

303
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,204
Oh, Hyeong!

304
00:26:16,204 --> 00:26:18,615
Over here.

305
00:26:18,652 --> 00:26:21,955
Hyeon kept asking for you.

306
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,791
I'm sorry, it's late.

307
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:25,417
How much did he drink?

308
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,732
He drank quite a lot.

309
00:26:27,732 --> 00:26:31,639
It was our fault.

310
00:26:31,639 --> 00:26:34,199
We didn't do anything wrong.

311
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:40,475
Hey, it's my boyfriend!

312
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,119
So soft.

313
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:50,652
My boyfriend's cheeks are so soft.

314
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:53,410
So cute.

315
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:55,554
Such a cutie.

316
00:26:57,811 --> 00:27:00,452
He must be out of his mind. He's talking nonsense.

317
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:03,622
No, I'm not drunk at all.

318
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,499
I'm a bit drunk.

319
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:07,725
No, I'm not drunk.

320
00:27:07,725 --> 00:27:10,827
But Kim An is my boyfriend.

321
00:27:14,808 --> 00:27:16,355
I'll take him home.

322
00:27:16,355 --> 00:27:17,920
Okay, I'll give you his address.

323
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,935
It's okay, I know where he lives.

324
00:27:21,463 --> 00:27:24,101
You can talk casually with us now.

325
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:27,448
Hyeon's boyfriend is our friend.

326
00:27:27,448 --> 00:27:29,719
No, no, he just...

327
00:27:29,719 --> 00:27:33,038
No, no, he's my boyfriend.

328
00:27:34,264 --> 00:27:35,604
Bye, Hyeong.

329
00:27:35,604 --> 00:27:37,136
We'll call you later.

330
00:27:37,136 --> 00:27:38,220
Get home safely.

331
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,366
Let's hang out sometime.

332
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,159
Sure.

333
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,087
Isn't my boyfriend cute? Bye.

334
00:27:44,087 --> 00:27:45,903
Bye bye.

335
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:58,631
We're all dating now.

336
00:27:58,631 --> 00:28:00,273
Yeah.

337
00:28:00,931 --> 00:28:02,630
Let's go home.

338
00:28:06,911 --> 00:28:08,438
Let's go.
