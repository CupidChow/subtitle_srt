Min Wu.

00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,776
Min Wu.

3
00:00:31,776 --> 00:00:34,380
Min Wu. Oh Min Wu

4
00:00:38,812 --> 00:00:40,916
What is it, Ma Ru?

5
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:43,584
Nothing, go back to sleep.

6
00:00:43,584 --> 00:00:45,014
Can't you sleep?

7
00:00:45,014 --> 00:00:47,422
I'm okay. Go back to sleep.

8
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:48,651
Sleep.

9
00:00:48,651 --> 00:00:51,919
Sweet dreams.

10
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,016
Min Wu.

11
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:10,779
This is perfect.

12
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:21,074
I think it's better to tell you

13
00:01:21,074 --> 00:01:22,989
when you're half asleep and can't tell if it's a dream or reality.

14
00:01:26,932 --> 00:01:29,608
I have something to tell you.

15
00:01:31,496 --> 00:01:33,384
You see...

16
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,314
It feels like I've been through a very long journey.

17
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:43,394
I've traveled step by step

18
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:44,948
for a long time

19
00:01:44,948 --> 00:01:48,901
to finally reach you.

20
00:01:51,139 --> 00:01:54,665
But while I was on that journey,

21
00:01:55,806 --> 00:01:58,222
you always stood there by me.

22
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:01,688
Always.

23
00:02:02,314 --> 00:02:04,076
Consistently.

24
00:02:07,345 --> 00:02:11,525
That's the only form of love I know.

25
00:02:17,616 --> 00:02:20,309
But now, I'm going to discover another form of love.

26
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:21,946
And this time,

27
00:02:23,632 --> 00:02:25,876
I'll show you.

28
00:02:29,227 --> 00:02:32,226
I'll be by your side from now on.

[Love Class 2]

30
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,717
Are you awake?

31
00:03:31,717 --> 00:03:33,034
What are you doing?

32
00:03:33,034 --> 00:03:35,098
I'm making soup.

33
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:44,474
I was going to do it.

34
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:48,010
All you have to do is have a good night's sleep

35
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,571
and enjoy the food I make.

36
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,508
Still...

37
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,572
But then... Do you even know how to cook?

38
00:03:58,572 --> 00:03:59,906
Well...

39
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,450
It's all on the internet.

40
00:04:16,038 --> 00:04:17,048
Hey.

41
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,884
Why are you so calm?

42
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,450
We've done this before.

43
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,632
How else am I supposed to react?

44
00:04:23,483 --> 00:04:28,440
So you're only going to react to something we've never done before?

45
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,379
Hyeon, close the valve.

46
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:40,132
Close the valve.

47
00:04:41,702 --> 00:04:43,781
Hyeong!

48
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,703
- Let's have that soup first.
- No.

49
00:04:53,703 --> 00:04:54,949
It will get cold.

50
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:56,722
It'll be fine.

51
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:08,311
Wow.

52
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:22,037
Is it okay?

53
00:05:22,074 --> 00:05:24,185
You can't go wrong with lunchboxes.

54
00:05:31,718 --> 00:05:33,564
Did you make all this?

55
00:05:34,527 --> 00:05:35,973
Yes.

56
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,756
Hey! Hey!

57
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,046
Look at these adorable tentacles.

58
00:05:42,046 --> 00:05:43,505
Hello.

59
00:05:45,047 --> 00:05:48,472
These rolls are perfectly round.

60
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,149
This reminds me of something.

61
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,943
Of what?

62
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:04,015
You never brought lunch to school picnics in high school.

63
00:06:04,015 --> 00:06:05,785
Because I got so many from others.

64
00:06:05,785 --> 00:06:07,395
Exactly.

65
00:06:18,324 --> 00:06:19,921
Are you cold?

66
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,124
Thanks.

67
00:06:38,035 --> 00:06:39,720
Let's eat.

68
00:07:00,676 --> 00:07:02,464
What is considered a date?

69
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:04,132
What?

70
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:07,644
I think there are unspoken rules for

71
00:07:07,644 --> 00:07:10,643
what couples should do together.

72
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:14,033
Is having a picnic in a park one of them?

73
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,461
I think so.

74
00:07:16,461 --> 00:07:19,621
It's symbolic.

75
00:07:19,621 --> 00:07:21,691
Symbolic...

76
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:26,821
You want to be different from others, have something that is just yours,

77
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,032
but if you deviate too far from the symbolic stuff,

78
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:30,867
you become unsure and worried

79
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:34,120
if you're doing okay.

80
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,927
I think that's what romantic dates represent.

81
00:07:36,927 --> 00:07:38,540
- Min Wu.
- Yes?

82
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,128
You're so...

83
00:07:41,956 --> 00:07:43,269
Never mind.

84
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,132
Am I boring you?

85
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,885
No, you're so freaking interesting.

86
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,659
I'm boring you.

87
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:53,494
No, that was so interesting, Min Wu.

88
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,073
- I'm just kidding.
- No food for you.

89
00:07:56,073 --> 00:07:57,312
I'm kidding!

90
00:07:57,312 --> 00:07:59,168
It really was interesting.

91
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,715
This tastes so good.

92
00:08:03,715 --> 00:08:06,276
- You're boring, but the food is delicious.
- Help yourself.

93
00:08:06,276 --> 00:08:07,762
Thanks.

Professor Yu.

97

Aren't you going to answer it?

98
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:24,893
You answer it.

99
00:08:24,893 --> 00:08:26,230
Why?

100
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,742
He's not even a professor in my department.

101
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:33,038
He always asks you to do stuff.

102
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:34,806
He hung up.

103
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,391

Professor Yu, hello.

106
00:08:52,725 --> 00:08:54,497
Oh, Seong Min had to step out for a moment,

107
00:08:54,497 --> 00:08:57,241
so I answered the phone for him.

108
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:59,432
Oh, the workshop?

109
00:08:59,432 --> 00:09:01,532
We got permission from the city government.

110
00:09:01,532 --> 00:09:04,439
You can ask the administration office.

111
00:09:05,174 --> 00:09:07,130
Printout?

112
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,924
Oh, you put Seong Min in charge of it?

113
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,927
He is good at that stuff, yes.

114
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:16,103
I'll tell him to bring it to you when he comes back.

115

116
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,227
Did you fight?

117
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,313
You don't fight with a professor.

118
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,857
I thought you and Professor Yu got along well.

119
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:27,484
What do you mean, "get along"?

120
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,253
I just do things for him.

121
00:09:29,253 --> 00:09:30,904
You said you liked his poems.

122
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,989
Only his poems.

123
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,389
He mentioned the 200-page printout, right?

00:09:35,389 --> 00:09:37,029
Yes.

125

You helped us get together, so you're our friend.

165
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,434
Yes.

166
00:11:45,963 --> 00:11:48,423
I'm sorry about everything.

167
00:11:48,423 --> 00:11:49,744
Pardon?

168
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,193
You know.

169
00:11:52,193 --> 00:11:56,018
I did a lot of thinking, and it made me look back on my behavior.

170
00:11:56,018 --> 00:11:58,034
I wasn't in my right mind.

171
00:11:58,034 --> 00:12:00,137
I forgive you.

172
00:12:02,383 --> 00:12:05,208

What? What?

178
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,804
Can you add some syrup?

179
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:20,285

I do. Plenty.

184
00:12:43,789 --> 00:12:45,833
I knew it.

185
00:12:48,423 --> 00:12:50,147
Wait!

186
00:12:50,147 --> 00:12:55,792
I have many boy friends, but not a single girl friend.

187
00:12:59,241 --> 00:13:01,354

00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,061
Are you busy these days?

192
00:13:30,061 --> 00:13:32,045
No, Sir.

193
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:33,359
Is something wrong?

194
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:36,279
You don't call me or come to me when I ask for you.

195
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,420
Are you avoiding me?

196
00:13:41,282 --> 00:13:43,114
- Professor.
- Yes?

197
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:45,992
You're not a Business School professor.

198
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,326
I'm not.

199
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,248
Then why do you keep calling me?

200
00:13:49,248 --> 00:13:51,712
You have many assistants in your department.

201
00:13:52,474 --> 00:13:54,207
Do you think I'm a pushover?

202
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,794
Sunbae, he's a professor.

203
00:13:56,794 --> 00:14:00,923
No, I just like you.

204
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,771
It seems like I made a mistake.

205
00:14:02,771 --> 00:14:05,770
He said he's doing it because he likes you.

206
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,452
What's going on here?

207
00:14:14,452 --> 00:14:16,379
Who are you?

208
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:18,520
Don't mess with him.

209
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,340
Hey, he's a professor.

210
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,868
I just like him.

211
00:14:23,868 --> 00:14:27,172
Why would a professor say he likes a teaching assistant?

212
00:14:27,172 --> 00:14:29,008
Professor.

213
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,866
What's going on?

214
00:14:32,866 --> 00:14:34,375
Who is this?

215
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:37,210
I can take them. Give me a signal.

216
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,706
No, no, we're just talking.

217
00:14:39,706 --> 00:14:42,413
It doesn't look like you're just talking.

218
00:14:42,413 --> 00:14:44,240
It seems like you're being harassed, Professor.

219
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,684
I told you to use your words, didn't I?

220
00:14:47,684 --> 00:14:51,096
That's why I'm holding back

221
00:14:51,096 --> 00:14:53,647
until you give me a signal.

222
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,187
We are just talking.

223
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:58,600
I was having a chat with my uncle.

224
00:14:59,856 --> 00:15:02,860
Oh, are you his nephew?

225
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,498
Yes, I'm Yu Ju Hyeok.

226
00:15:05,498 --> 00:15:07,949
Hello, I'm Park Jae Hyeon.

227
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:09,816
Nice to meet you.

228
00:15:09,816 --> 00:15:12,086
You, too.

229
00:15:15,361 --> 00:15:16,998
Goodbye.

230
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:34,719
I don't know what's wrong with my uncle.

231
00:15:35,777 --> 00:15:37,103
I'm sorry.

232
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:40,790
I apologize on his behalf, and I'll tell him to stop.

233
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,858
No.

234
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,147
I was out of line.

235
00:15:44,147 --> 00:15:46,074
He can call me.

236
00:15:46,074 --> 00:15:48,197
It's what I do anyway, so...

237
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,584
Still.

238
00:15:49,584 --> 00:15:53,242
He shouldn't call you when you're not one of his assistants.

239
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:57,107
I think he did that

240
00:15:57,107 --> 00:15:59,609
because I told him I had feelings for you.

241
00:15:59,609 --> 00:16:03,436
Do you have feelings for me?

242
00:16:03,436 --> 00:16:04,736
Yes.

243
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:08,522
Why would I act this way if I didn't?

244
00:16:09,965 --> 00:16:12,647
Hey...

245
00:16:12,647 --> 00:16:15,465
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

246
00:16:19,227 --> 00:16:21,447
What is it? Are you okay?

247
00:16:23,434 --> 00:16:25,242
I didn't know.

248
00:16:25,242 --> 00:16:27,103
You didn't know what?

249
00:16:27,103 --> 00:16:33,013
I saw you with Professor Yu.

250
00:16:34,742 --> 00:16:37,438
Oh, behind the Liberal Arts building?

251
00:16:37,438 --> 00:16:38,831
Yes.

252
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,833
We try to stay away from each other on campus

253
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,680
because he's a professor.

254
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,326
But that day, we had to talk about a family matter.

255
00:16:45,326 --> 00:16:46,672
So we talked for a bit.

256
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,251
But what about it?

257
00:16:48,251 --> 00:16:50,075
I thought...

258
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:54,013
you two had something going on, too.

259
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,599
Are you crazy?

260
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:57,267
What do you take me for?

261
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:58,776
But you said you like me, too.

262
00:16:58,776 --> 00:17:00,068
So?

263
00:17:00,068 --> 00:17:03,980
Do you think you and my uncle are on the same level?

264
00:17:04,826 --> 00:17:07,687
To me, you're sexy.

265
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,206
Ju Hyeok.

266
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,988
Yes?

267
00:17:21,988 --> 00:17:25,669
Let's go on a date.

268
00:17:27,157 --> 00:17:28,557
Okay.

269
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,283
How about tomorrow evening?

270
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:32,629
Okay.

271
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:37,103
Tiger's?

272
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:41,415
No, let's not drink.

273
00:17:41,415 --> 00:17:45,397
Okay, good idea.

274
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:52,113
Oh, please apologize to Professor Yu for me.

275
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:54,092
Sure, don't worry.

276
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,940
Okay, okay.

277
00:18:25,315 --> 00:18:28,274
One, two, three.

278
00:18:38,593 --> 00:18:41,312
Oh, it's a good one.

279
00:18:41,312 --> 00:18:42,926
Not really.

280
00:18:42,926 --> 00:18:45,766
No, you look nice.

281
00:18:45,766 --> 00:18:48,069
It's not my best picture.

282
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,480
I don't know.

283
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,040
You look nice to me all the time.

284
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,132
She said anyone who starts dating will get an A plus.

285
00:19:01,132 --> 00:19:02,828
Really?

286
00:19:03,449 --> 00:19:04,922
Should we tell the entire class?

287
00:19:04,922 --> 00:19:07,123
That we're dating?

288
00:19:07,123 --> 00:19:08,098
Like...

289
00:19:08,098 --> 00:19:10,556
Show them a picture of us kissing at the school entrance?

290
00:19:10,556 --> 00:19:13,275
Wow, that's bold.

291
00:19:13,275 --> 00:19:16,128
You took my idea one step further.

292
00:19:16,128 --> 00:19:17,900
I'm falling in love all over again.

293
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:22,410
Once I decide on something, I don't go back.

294
00:19:23,116 --> 00:19:24,550
Me, too.

295
00:19:25,663 --> 00:19:27,389
I know.

296
00:19:40,368 --> 00:19:42,458
Why are we here at this hour?

297
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:44,372
I like this time of the night.

298
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,101
Okay.

299
00:19:47,101 --> 00:19:48,773
We're almost there.

300
00:19:49,857 --> 00:19:51,481
Are you cold?

301
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,318
- You?
- I'm okay.

302
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,251
You're still asleep.

303
00:20:51,865 --> 00:20:53,496
It's chilly.

304
00:20:54,191 --> 00:20:55,896
Is it?

305
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:25,936
Here.

306
00:21:25,936 --> 00:21:27,413
Thanks.

307
00:21:32,409 --> 00:21:35,671
Is it good? I made it myself.

308
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:38,210
Yes, it's good.

309
00:21:49,861 --> 00:21:51,911
It's not chilly anymore.

310
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,030
Why?

311
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,460
Because I'm here?

312
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:58,579
Or because of the coffee I made?

313
00:21:58,579 --> 00:22:00,476
Both.

314
00:22:05,899 --> 00:22:07,936
I've never done this before.

315
00:22:07,936 --> 00:22:09,208
Never done what?

316
00:22:09,872 --> 00:22:12,353
Hanging out in a park at such a late hour.

317
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:14,785
Yes, thought so.

318
00:22:14,785 --> 00:22:18,404
It's my first time bringing the coffee I made myself

319
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:21,293
and finishing food someone made for me.

320
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,039
What did you do with the lunchboxes all the other kids gave you?

321
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:28,906
I had a taste and gave them to my friends.

322
00:22:33,337 --> 00:22:35,174
Anyway, everything's new to me.

323
00:22:35,174 --> 00:22:36,146
Right!

324
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:39,165
It's the first time someone carried me on his back during a date too.

325
00:22:39,165 --> 00:22:40,933
Okay.

326
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:45,174
We're in a symbolic place right now,

327
00:22:45,174 --> 00:22:46,632
but you're different.

328
00:22:47,689 --> 00:22:49,726
Everything I do with you is a first for me.

329
00:22:52,618 --> 00:22:54,448
- Ma Ru.
- Hmm?

330
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,918
I love you, too.

331
00:23:03,086 --> 00:23:05,134
That was also my first time pushing someone who said they loved me.

332
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:07,181
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

333
00:23:07,181 --> 00:23:09,391
I can tell it's your first time.

334
00:24:05,473 --> 00:24:06,505
Hey, where are you going?

335
00:24:06,505 --> 00:24:08,362
Me? On a date.

336
00:24:08,362 --> 00:24:09,473
What the hell!

337
00:24:09,473 --> 00:24:11,062
- Bye!
- I'm jealous!

338
00:24:27,185 --> 00:24:28,529
Teaching Assistant!

339
00:24:40,757 --> 00:24:42,898
I just thought of something.

340
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,370
What?

341
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:46,310
The first day I saw you.

342
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:50,324
Oh... Please forget about that day.

343
00:24:50,324 --> 00:24:51,875
Why? It was so much fun.

344
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:54,158
No, I really want to forget about it.

345
00:24:55,362 --> 00:24:58,080
You could have gotten angry, but you didn't.

346
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,003
I couldn't get angry.

347
00:25:00,003 --> 00:25:01,500
I would havbe been angry if I were you.

348
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,795
You had to strip down to your underwear in front of all those people.

349
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:07,117
It was nobody's fault.

350
00:25:07,117 --> 00:25:10,658
It just happened.

351
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:14,888
I have a question.

352
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,498
What is it?

353
00:25:16,498 --> 00:25:19,153
People say you're too kind, don't they?

354
00:25:19,697 --> 00:25:21,097
No.

355
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:24,782
But I do get a lot of comments saying I'm sexy.

356
00:25:25,363 --> 00:25:27,365
- Good night.
- Okay, bye.

357
00:25:27,365 --> 00:25:28,696
Bye.

358
00:25:31,609 --> 00:25:32,699
Hyeong, seriously...

359
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:35,619
- Get a grip.
- Got it.

360
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:37,536
Stop, stop.

361
00:25:40,435 --> 00:25:42,213
But...

362
00:25:42,213 --> 00:25:44,563
That's what I liked about you.

363
00:25:44,563 --> 00:25:45,961
What do you mean?

364
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,380
You didn't even frown.

365
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,228
You even bowed politely and left.

366
00:25:51,228 --> 00:25:53,308
I thought that was cool.

367
00:25:53,308 --> 00:25:58,099
And that you were very thoughtful and trying hard.

368
00:25:58,844 --> 00:26:00,986
It's hard to live like that.

369
00:26:02,844 --> 00:26:04,897
This isn't like you.

370
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,347
- That's why I acted like an ass.
- What?

371
00:26:07,347 --> 00:26:08,893
If I hadn't acted like an ass to you,

372
00:26:08,893 --> 00:26:11,521
you would have made sacrifices to be kind to me.

373
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,128
The way I see it,

374
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,165
being an ass is your nature.

375
00:26:30,165 --> 00:26:31,173
It is not.

376
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:33,425
I'm a good boy.

377
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,968
I don't believe you.

378
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,585
I can be obedient

379
00:26:36,585 --> 00:26:38,327
at important moments.

380
00:26:39,013 --> 00:26:40,855
Fair enough.

381
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:54,329
Still...

382
00:26:55,705 --> 00:26:58,017
I was able to be honest with you.

383
00:26:59,501 --> 00:27:01,406
And I liked that.

384
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,208
I have quite a personality, you know.

385
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:07,340
- How about right now?
- Right now?

386
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,154
Are you being honest right now?

387
00:27:12,216 --> 00:27:14,680
Do you want me to be honest?

388
00:27:42,847 --> 00:27:45,094
Do you want to go to my place?

389
00:27:46,546 --> 00:27:48,137
Yes.

390
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:51,205
It's true.

391
00:27:51,205 --> 00:27:52,985
What do you mean?

392
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:55,791
You are obedient

393
00:27:55,791 --> 00:27:58,343
at important moments.

394
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,752
Let's make lots of important moments

395
00:28:00,752 --> 00:28:02,689
from now on.

396
00:28:02,689 --> 00:28:04,664
I'll be a good boy.

397
00:31:13,894 --> 00:31:19,633
[Love Class 2]

398
00:31:34,152 --> 00:31:35,655
Excuse me.

399
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,355
Excuse me.

400
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:40,420
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

401
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,983
You can't sleep here. It's freezing.

402
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,983
What's your major?

403
00:31:43,983 --> 00:31:46,696
I live in the dorm.

404
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:47,904
What?

405
00:31:47,904 --> 00:31:49,984
The dorm, the dorm...

406
00:32:00,871 --> 00:32:03,044
For heaven's sake.

407
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:05,217
We're almost there.

408
00:32:05,217 --> 00:32:07,131
Almost there, almost there.

409
00:32:07,131 --> 00:32:08,798
We're here.

410
00:32:10,801 --> 00:32:12,013
I'm sorry.

411
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,908
I'm so sorry.

412
00:32:15,801 --> 00:32:17,980
It's okay.

413
00:32:19,523 --> 00:32:21,379
Are you joining the army?

414
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,280
Yes...

415
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,158
Time will go by quickly.

416
00:32:28,158 --> 00:32:30,073
I'll see you when you get back.

417
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:32,083
What year are you in?

418
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,731
What major?

419
00:32:34,308 --> 00:32:37,059
Fourth year, Business Administration.

420
00:32:37,757 --> 00:32:40,002
Then you'll be graduating.

421
00:32:40,002 --> 00:32:41,221
Pardon?

422
00:32:41,221 --> 00:32:43,324
If you graduate...

423
00:32:44,665 --> 00:32:47,150
I won't be able to see you again.

424
00:32:53,864 --> 00:32:57,229
I won't be able to see you again if you graduate.

425
00:33:01,935 --> 00:33:05,101
I won't be able to see you.

426
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:37,270
♫ That moment when you, whom I have been waiting for, ♫

427
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:41,110
♫ Appeared before me ♫

428
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:47,840
♫ When life gives only you light ♫

429
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,420
♫ Be the light by my side. The way you look ♫

430
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:56,240
♫ Raises me up again ♫

431
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:02,920
♫ It makes my heart feel full, makes my heart flutter ♫

432
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,240
♫ It's you ♫
