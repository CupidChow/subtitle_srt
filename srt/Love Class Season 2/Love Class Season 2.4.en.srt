00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,862
Ma Ru!

2
00:00:24,153 --> 00:00:26,021
Shin Ma Ru!

3
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:11,738
[Love Class 2]

4
00:01:12,669 --> 00:01:13,776
What are you doing?

5
00:01:13,776 --> 00:01:15,227
Where have you been?

6
00:01:15,227 --> 00:01:16,618
I was out to get breakfast.

7
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,288
Your place has nothing to eat.

8
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:20,544
You'll lose your muscle mass.

9
00:01:20,544 --> 00:01:22,709
You have to eat properly.

10
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:46,026
- Do you want milk?
- Yes.

11
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,226
Is it better that way?

12
00:02:00,226 --> 00:02:01,937
I need to eat up today.

13
00:02:01,937 --> 00:02:03,512
It feels fuller this way.

14
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:08,260
Today, we have an important mission to accomplish.

15
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,626
An important mission?

16
00:02:27,243 --> 00:02:28,231
Hello.

17
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,745
- Oh, you're here.
- Hi.

18
00:02:30,745 --> 00:02:32,644
You're here early.

19
00:02:32,644 --> 00:02:35,812
Yes, I had to receive the delivery.

20
00:02:35,812 --> 00:02:38,151
Oh... I could've done that, though.

21
00:02:39,373 --> 00:02:42,648
Did anything happen?

22
00:02:42,648 --> 00:02:45,133
No, nothing happened.

23
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:46,749
Hey...

24
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,965
- Is your friend coming today?
- My friend?

25
00:02:51,965 --> 00:02:54,970
You know, the guy with big eyes.

26
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:57,499
He didn't say anything to me.

27
00:02:57,499 --> 00:02:59,114
Oh, really?

28
00:03:00,031 --> 00:03:02,466
- Hey.
- Hi.

29
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,337
Man...

30
00:03:08,337 --> 00:03:10,131
Okay, got it.

31
00:03:11,193 --> 00:03:15,665
I came early to receive the delivery, so you organize them. Okay?

32
00:03:15,665 --> 00:03:17,293
We've got new containers,

33
00:03:17,293 --> 00:03:19,397
so put new labels on them.

34
00:03:19,397 --> 00:03:22,163
Organize them so they're easy to find.

35
00:03:22,163 --> 00:03:24,253
- Got it?
- Yes.

36
00:03:24,253 --> 00:03:26,198
All right, I'll be back.

37
00:03:26,198 --> 00:03:27,518
Bye.

38
00:03:27,518 --> 00:03:29,175
Yes.

39
00:03:35,863 --> 00:03:37,593
Now, he's an ass.

40
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:38,838
Yes.

41
00:03:39,608 --> 00:03:42,877
- Coffee?
- Yes, iced Americano.

42
00:03:42,877 --> 00:03:44,184
Just a second.

43
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,515
If I pay for yours, can we drink them together?

44
00:03:48,515 --> 00:03:51,648
I'm going to pay for yours, and we'll drink them together.

45
00:03:58,086 --> 00:04:01,039
Do you go to another coffee shop these days?

46
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:03,100
I didn't mean to.

47
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,887
Ma Ru wouldn't let me come here.

48
00:04:04,887 --> 00:04:06,390
Ma Ru?

49
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:10,347
He says I have to order something else here, not iced Americano,

50
00:04:10,347 --> 00:04:12,166
like a milkshake or something.

51
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,768
- Why?
- I don't know.

52
00:04:15,827 --> 00:04:18,682
He's probably up to something weird again.

53
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:23,243
Ma Ru is staying at my place.

54
00:04:23,243 --> 00:04:25,290
But he's always there.

55
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,143
He got kicked out for good.

56
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,610
His parents found out he quit his job.

57
00:04:31,512 --> 00:04:33,612
I knew that would happen.

58
00:04:33,612 --> 00:04:35,583
But...

59
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,537
you also live alone.

60
00:04:37,537 --> 00:04:39,000
And?

61
00:04:39,848 --> 00:04:43,916
So why didn't Ma Ru go to you?

62
00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:51,506
Exactly. I wonder why.

63
00:04:51,506 --> 00:04:53,393
What?

64
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,154
Why does he do that

65
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,614
every time?

66
00:04:58,614 --> 00:05:00,803
Are you upset by that?

67
00:05:01,414 --> 00:05:03,007
No.

68
00:05:03,007 --> 00:05:05,046
Oh, I'm relieved.

69
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:10,396
I'm not upset at all, so you guys get along.

70
00:05:10,396 --> 00:05:12,780
Come over and hang out with us.

71
00:05:21,097 --> 00:05:23,312
I found him.

72
00:05:23,312 --> 00:05:25,694
- The guy you were looking for?
- Yes.

73
00:05:25,694 --> 00:05:27,363
Who is it?

74
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:30,928
I'll introduce him to you later.

75
00:05:42,085 --> 00:05:43,923
You guys go ahead. I'll catch up.

76
00:05:43,923 --> 00:05:45,178
Why? Where are you going?

77
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,587
I'm going to reap the boxers I sowed.

78
00:05:47,587 --> 00:05:48,882
Bye.

79
00:06:07,082 --> 00:06:08,703
What was that for?

80
00:06:08,703 --> 00:06:09,754
To make you happy to see me.

81
00:06:09,754 --> 00:06:11,656
You don't have to. I'm already happy.

82
00:06:11,656 --> 00:06:13,950
Your face says otherwise.

83
00:06:19,194 --> 00:06:21,433
Your hand seemed lost.

84
00:06:21,433 --> 00:06:24,161
- It was heading toward its destination.
- No.

85
00:06:24,161 --> 00:06:27,347
This way is blocked.

86
00:06:27,347 --> 00:06:29,482
- This is pissing me off.
- What?

87
00:06:29,482 --> 00:06:31,209
You talk informally with the other students, right?

88
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:32,580
So why do you talk formally with me?

89
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,979
Because I feel like I should.

90
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,414
Is it because of my age?

91
00:06:37,414 --> 00:06:40,108
I talk to you more politely,

92
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,302
but you don't like that?

93
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:44,730
Am I some kind of exception? Why?

94
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,782
It's nice to be polite.

95
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:52,072
A gentleman is polite to even those

96
00:06:52,072 --> 00:06:53,911
who aren't polite to him.

97
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:58,025
Is it because of the gift I gave you?

98
00:06:58,025 --> 00:07:00,969
Can we just stop talking about underwear?

99
00:07:00,969 --> 00:07:02,639
I never said underwear.

100
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,439
You said it.

101
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,777
Hey, listen.

102
00:07:05,777 --> 00:07:08,902
I have no reason to receive something like that from a student.

103
00:07:08,902 --> 00:07:10,805
I wrapped them up,

104
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,308
so come to the office and take them back.

105
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,032
Keep them.

106
00:07:15,032 --> 00:07:16,684
I know you're too busy and have no time to even buy underwear.

107
00:07:16,684 --> 00:07:20,195
That's none of your business.

108
00:07:21,021 --> 00:07:22,383
Right?

109
00:07:25,694 --> 00:07:29,029
If what's inside isn't that great, at least the packaging should look nice.

110
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:31,097
That's why I picked

111
00:07:31,097 --> 00:07:32,889
the nicest ones.

112
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,826
What are you trying to tell me?

113
00:07:37,826 --> 00:07:40,085
Exactly what you're thinking.

114
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:42,698
In that case, I don't even need any packaging.

115
00:07:42,698 --> 00:07:44,133
Is that so?

116
00:07:47,123 --> 00:07:48,164
Forget about it.

117
00:07:48,164 --> 00:07:49,841
You can show it to me to prove me wrong.

118
00:07:49,841 --> 00:07:51,962
Are you crazy?

119
00:07:52,884 --> 00:07:55,257
It's nice to see your honest self.

120
00:07:55,257 --> 00:07:56,671
You're not that much of a gentleman, after all.

121
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,666
Seriously...

122
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:02,377
There are too many eyes watching us.

123
00:08:02,377 --> 00:08:03,720
Let's meet outside of campus.

124
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,818
Why would I do that?

125
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,330
At Tiger's, tonight at 8.

126
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,329
If you stand me up,

127
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:12,672
I'll post what I saw that day on the community board.

128
00:08:15,093 --> 00:08:16,035
Hey!

129
00:08:16,035 --> 00:08:17,386
Hey...

130
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:42,410
How much longer will this take?

131
00:08:43,153 --> 00:08:44,842
Until I finish drawing this.

132
00:08:44,842 --> 00:08:47,937
Why do you have to redo everything?

133
00:08:47,937 --> 00:08:51,140
I always wanted to do it this way if it's with you.

134
00:08:51,767 --> 00:08:54,109
Hey, don't move.

135
00:08:56,474 --> 00:08:59,614
I'm not done yet.

136
00:08:59,614 --> 00:09:01,730
I can't do this anymore.

137
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,405
Once I'm done drawing,

138
00:09:03,405 --> 00:09:08,135
we can eat lunch, take a nap, read,

139
00:09:08,135 --> 00:09:10,382
and have a nice chat.

140
00:09:10,382 --> 00:09:12,246
That's my ideal hobby set.

141
00:09:12,246 --> 00:09:13,890
This is not a park.

142
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,746
We are on campus.

143
00:09:15,746 --> 00:09:18,042
Does that mean you want to go to the park?

144
00:09:18,042 --> 00:09:19,333
Let's go.

145
00:09:23,528 --> 00:09:25,128
Hey, Hyeong!

146
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:18,424
Hyeong, I've never been on the rooftop.

147
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,727
Don't go too far.

148
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,070
♫ I don't remember when it started ♫

149
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:41,990
♫ At some point, I started only thinking about you ♫

150
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:47,780
♫ I'm falling more and more into you ♫

151
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:53,540
♫ I'm scared, but I want to be brave ♫

152
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:59,580
♫ Whatever I'm looking at, now I only see you ♫

153
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:06,010
♫ Even in my dreams, I always want to stay together by your side ♫

154
00:11:06,013 --> 00:11:08,093
Don't let people see you,

155
00:11:08,093 --> 00:11:10,244
or they'll start a rumor.

156
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:23,940
♫ I fall asleep thinking it's just one night tonight ♫

157
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,720
♫ I will miss all these things ♫

158
00:11:48,046 --> 00:11:49,600
This is good.

159
00:11:50,798 --> 00:11:52,278
Did you make them?

160
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,968
Jeez, of course...

161
00:11:54,968 --> 00:11:56,671
I bought them.

162
00:12:42,797 --> 00:12:44,530
Sit down.

163
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,243
When's your manager coming?

164
00:12:51,243 --> 00:12:53,141
Why do you ask?

165
00:12:53,961 --> 00:12:55,356
No reason.

166
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:58,142
This is delicious. What flavor is this?

167
00:13:00,354 --> 00:13:02,123
Orange.

168
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:08,019
You're back.

169
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:10,873

So?

187
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:58,209
So I was thinking of bullying him until he quits.

188
00:14:58,209 --> 00:14:59,467
So?

189
00:14:59,467 --> 00:15:02,070
So I put on a show...

190
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,460
A show?

191
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:05,710
Hey, it was really hard, you know.

192
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:08,257
I almost got beat up when I went to borrow this suit from my uncle.

193
00:15:08,257 --> 00:15:11,925
My dad had told him everything

194
00:15:11,925 --> 00:15:14,563
I had to beg to borrow these shoes from the shoemaker.

195
00:15:14,563 --> 00:15:17,427
- And flowers and a microphone...
- Hey.

196
00:15:18,566 --> 00:15:21,182
- Are you a slut?
- What?

197
00:15:21,859 --> 00:15:26,615
Dating whoever, hugging whoever, and asking whoever out on a date.

198
00:15:27,728 --> 00:15:29,467
That's being a slut.

199
00:15:29,467 --> 00:15:31,428
What the fuck?

200
00:15:31,428 --> 00:15:34,360
You've been that way your whole life, so you might not know.

201
00:16:00,815 --> 00:16:02,143
Hyeong.

202
00:16:02,143 --> 00:16:03,616
Hyeong, wake up.

203
00:16:03,616 --> 00:16:05,730
You said you're meeting your team for your assignment.

204
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,821
Get up, let's go.

205
00:16:08,285 --> 00:16:09,889
Let's go.

206
00:16:35,822 --> 00:16:37,719
Weren't you scared?

207
00:16:37,719 --> 00:16:39,214
Scared?

208
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,608
Being on the rooftop with me.

209
00:16:42,608 --> 00:16:44,589
And?

210
00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:47,660
I could have pushed you.

211
00:16:51,953 --> 00:16:54,687
A rumor is a rumor.

212
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,030
What do you mean?

213
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:00,128
Until you tell me the truth,

214
00:17:00,128 --> 00:17:04,509
I'll consider rumors to be only rumors.

215
00:17:07,054 --> 00:17:10,244
Why do you think rumors get started?

216
00:17:10,244 --> 00:17:13,088
Just tell me. Stop being so vague.

217
00:17:13,088 --> 00:17:16,290
If you're not straightforward with me, I'll just take it positively.

218
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:19,032
"Hyeong brought me to his hideout."

219
00:17:19,032 --> 00:17:21,280
"This is a special day."

220
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,740
Like that.

221
00:17:38,337 --> 00:17:39,600
Where are you headed to?

222
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,476
I'll walk you there.

223
00:17:41,476 --> 00:17:43,771
You don't have to. We're on campus.

224
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,359
I want to stay with you longer.

225
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:48,655
You're so good at saying that kind of thing.

226
00:17:48,655 --> 00:17:50,891
I can do more.

227
00:17:50,891 --> 00:17:54,662
I can wait until you're done with your group assignment

228
00:17:54,662 --> 00:17:57,563
and walk you home.

229
00:17:57,563 --> 00:17:59,160
Don't you dare.

230
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,318
Should I?

231
00:18:00,318 --> 00:18:02,204
Was I being vague again?

232
00:18:02,204 --> 00:18:04,962
Your face? Your eyes?

233
00:18:06,793 --> 00:18:08,209
Don't.

234
00:18:08,209 --> 00:18:09,638
Go home.

235
00:18:09,638 --> 00:18:11,298
I'll think about it.

236
00:18:30,439 --> 00:18:31,856
Sorry.

237
00:18:37,686 --> 00:18:39,376
Are you Kim An's friend?

238
00:18:47,457 --> 00:18:49,840
Just a friend?

239
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,258
I don't know if he considers me a friend.

240
00:18:55,595 --> 00:18:57,808
That's who he is.

241
00:18:59,223 --> 00:19:02,717
How much do you know about Kim An?

242
00:19:06,262 --> 00:19:07,938
You're a freshman, right?

243
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,209
Yes.

244
00:19:10,728 --> 00:19:15,664
Haven't you felt anything strange about him?

245
00:19:23,868 --> 00:19:25,442
Well, no...

246
00:19:25,442 --> 00:19:26,796
Not really.

247
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,080
The police came to the school.

248
00:19:31,511 --> 00:19:33,355
That's not something that happens all the time,

249
00:19:33,355 --> 00:19:36,233
and that's why everyone knows about it.

250
00:19:36,233 --> 00:19:38,294
On top of that,

251
00:19:38,294 --> 00:19:40,260
people said he used to work at a host club,

252
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,149
and he had an affair with a professor.

253
00:19:44,096 --> 00:19:47,437
The professor resigned and stuff, so...

254
00:19:52,329 --> 00:19:54,140
People love to talk

255
00:19:54,937 --> 00:19:57,508
about other people, right?

256
00:20:00,965 --> 00:20:02,834
But

257
00:20:03,999 --> 00:20:06,415
nobody wants to be the bad guy,

258
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:08,781
so they leave out the details.

259
00:20:08,781 --> 00:20:11,310
They just whisper and gossip.

260
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,087
But you should at least know what everyone else knows,

261
00:20:19,087 --> 00:20:20,832
Lee Hyeon.

262
00:20:21,848 --> 00:20:23,130
Oh, okay.

263
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:26,269
I'll get going.

264
00:20:26,269 --> 00:20:28,316
I have plans.

265
00:20:28,316 --> 00:20:29,757
- Okay.
- Bye.

266
00:20:29,757 --> 00:20:31,487
Goodbye.

267
00:20:42,328 --> 00:20:44,439
What a weirdo.

268
00:20:49,895 --> 00:20:55,055
But you should at least know what everyone else knows, Lee Hyeon.

269
00:20:55,055 --> 00:20:58,013
But how did he know my name?

270
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,768
Oh... You came.

271
00:21:33,768 --> 00:21:35,544
You're not even trying to hide it,

272
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,297
how unexcited you are about this meeting.

273
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:42,105
I was threatened, and you expected excitement?

274
00:21:42,105 --> 00:21:44,109
What's good here?

275
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:47,616
Are you really here because I threatened you?

276
00:21:47,616 --> 00:21:52,786
If you want to know, you should have asked me politely.

277
00:21:53,617 --> 00:21:57,656
You would have never said yes if I had asked politely.

278
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:11,296
Cheers.

279
00:22:11,925 --> 00:22:13,829
All kinds of thoughts.

280
00:22:44,077 --> 00:22:45,923
Oh Min Wu...

281
00:23:21,803 --> 00:23:23,303
Ma Ru.

282
00:23:28,364 --> 00:23:30,052
The slut is here.

283
00:23:30,653 --> 00:23:33,029
Are sluts allowed in here?

284
00:23:35,437 --> 00:23:39,814
You're a bad guy.

285
00:23:41,078 --> 00:23:44,277
That's what you always thought of me, isn't it?

286
00:23:44,277 --> 00:23:45,708
No.

287
00:23:48,268 --> 00:23:51,023
I know.

288
00:23:51,023 --> 00:23:55,903
I know by the way you look at me.

289
00:24:02,294 --> 00:24:07,695
You sometimes stare at me with the strangest eyes.

290
00:24:08,528 --> 00:24:11,435
And that makes me feel weird.

291
00:24:15,643 --> 00:24:17,350
Ma Ru.

292
00:24:19,863 --> 00:24:21,611
Apologize to me.

293
00:24:21,611 --> 00:24:23,151
Now.

294
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:27,087
I'm sorry.

295
00:24:28,048 --> 00:24:30,160
I was wrong.

296
00:24:31,602 --> 00:24:33,157
Come here.

297
00:24:37,308 --> 00:24:39,758
I forgive you.

298
00:24:40,577 --> 00:24:43,633
Don't ever talk like that again.

299
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,263
Okay.

300
00:24:46,934 --> 00:24:49,125
I won't ever do it again.

301
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:55,327
But even if you do it again,

302
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,444
I won't hate you.

303
00:24:57,444 --> 00:24:59,262
Because...

304
00:25:01,326 --> 00:25:03,679
we are best friends.

305
00:25:09,017 --> 00:25:10,620
Ma Ru.

306
00:26:09,257 --> 00:26:14,704
[Love Class 2]

307
00:26:15,496 --> 00:26:17,895
These are numerical sequences.

308
00:26:17,895 --> 00:26:19,836
Write down a number in the lower right

309
00:26:19,836 --> 00:26:23,713
to show the sequence...

310
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:39,180
♫ Start the day with the phone call that wakes me ♫

311
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:46,280
♫ I start the day thinking about you ♫

312
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:54,930
♫ It's my first time seeing myself like this. It feels a little strange ♫

313
00:26:54,930 --> 00:27:01,320
♫ My heart is racing, filled with my love ♫

314
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:05,800
♫ That moment when you, whom I have been waiting for, ♫

315
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,570
♫ Appeared before me ♫

316

♫ When life gives only you light ♫

317
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:20,880
♫ Be the light by my side. The way you look ♫

318
