00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:06,068
[Love Class 2]

2
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,134
Did you sleep well?

3
00:01:05,754 --> 00:01:07,538
It's delicious.

4
00:01:07,538 --> 00:01:09,175
You're really good.

5
00:01:09,175 --> 00:01:10,696
My cooking is okay, isn't it?

6
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:14,622
My parents neglecting me has its benefits.

7
00:01:14,622 --> 00:01:15,831
You're all grown up.

8
00:01:15,831 --> 00:01:17,977
Do you really think so?

9
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:20,455
Yes, you can cook for yourself.

10
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:24,691
You think I'm all grown up, and you still slept so well?

11
00:01:24,691 --> 00:01:26,006
What?

12
00:01:26,006 --> 00:01:27,879
It's so unfair.

13
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,556
You slept like a baby with me by your side.

14
00:01:30,556 --> 00:01:32,132
This isn't your house, you know.

15
00:01:32,132 --> 00:01:34,730
Hey, how can you say that?

16
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:37,352
I was really nervous,

17
00:01:37,352 --> 00:01:38,915
but you seemed to sleep well.

18
00:01:38,915 --> 00:01:41,281
You're the one who fell asleep first.

19
00:01:41,281 --> 00:01:42,509
Me?

20
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:45,397
- Yes, you fell asleep first.
- No, I didn't.

21
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:49,323
Yes, you did! I stared at you sleeping for a long time.

22
00:01:49,323 --> 00:01:52,007
- "You stared at me"?
- Yes.

23
00:01:52,007 --> 00:01:53,822
- Why?
- What do you mean?

24
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:56,575
Staring at someone sleeping...

25
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:58,676
Isn't that what lovers do?

26
00:01:58,676 --> 00:02:00,447
No, I stared at you because it was interesting.

27
00:02:00,447 --> 00:02:01,885
"Wow, he sleeps so well."

28
00:02:01,885 --> 00:02:04,606
"He sleeps well because he's a baby."

29
00:02:04,606 --> 00:02:06,071
"Baby"?

30
00:02:09,883 --> 00:02:11,394
Baby...

31
00:02:13,441 --> 00:02:15,254
Don't do that.

32
00:02:16,271 --> 00:02:17,914
Don't.

33
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,877
Leave your stuff here.

34
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,946
Won't you come back anyway?

35
00:02:30,946 --> 00:02:33,306
I'm not that easy, you know.

36
00:02:33,306 --> 00:02:35,148
You think I'm a baby anyway.

37
00:02:35,148 --> 00:02:37,310
Nothing's going to happen, right?

38
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,858
Are you upset?

39
00:02:39,858 --> 00:02:41,373
No.

40
00:02:43,502 --> 00:02:44,639
You are, aren't you?

41
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,013
I'm not.

42
00:02:46,013 --> 00:02:48,583
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

43
00:02:55,961 --> 00:02:57,567
Welcome.

44
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,570
Hi, Jagi.

45
00:03:08,701 --> 00:03:11,195
He's not here today.

46
00:03:14,548 --> 00:03:17,110
Why didn't you tell me it was a guy?

47
00:03:18,373 --> 00:03:20,236
Oh... I didn't think that far.

48
00:03:20,236 --> 00:03:22,327
Were you surprised?

49
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,962
Not really.

50
00:03:26,327 --> 00:03:30,769
Anyway, you can stop now.

51
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,504
He's already angry.

52
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,974
I don't think it will work out.

53
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,269
Thank you for your help.

54
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:43,863
Why am I so nice?

55
00:03:44,911 --> 00:03:46,101
Min Wu.

56
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:51,073
You have to stick to the plan in a situation like this.

57
00:03:51,073 --> 00:03:52,252
What?

58
00:03:52,252 --> 00:03:53,705
This is your chance.

59
00:03:53,705 --> 00:03:58,128
You have to keep going to win him over.

60
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,165
When do you get off work today?

61
00:04:23,682 --> 00:04:25,406
- Min Wu.
- Hi, Sa Ra.

62
00:04:25,406 --> 00:04:26,882
- I'll get ready in a second.
- Okay.

63
00:04:26,882 --> 00:04:28,799
- One moment.
- Sure.

64
00:04:44,372 --> 00:04:46,413
- Let's go.
- Okay.

65
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,433
Why am I following them?

66
00:05:40,953 --> 00:05:42,947
We're on a fun date.

67
00:05:42,947 --> 00:05:44,515
- That's right.
- Right?

68
00:05:44,515 --> 00:05:46,092
Is Ma Ru watching?

69
00:05:46,092 --> 00:05:47,636
Let me see.

70
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:51,311
He's following us.

71
00:05:51,311 --> 00:05:52,648
Hey, don't look back.

72
00:05:52,648 --> 00:05:54,481
Instead, I'll stand here,

73
00:05:54,481 --> 00:05:58,038
and you can pretend to stroke my hair and have a peek.

74
00:05:58,038 --> 00:05:59,761
He's behind the tree.

75
00:06:07,812 --> 00:06:09,286
- I saw him.
- You saw him?

76
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,043
- So?
- He's following us.

77
00:06:11,043 --> 00:06:12,658
Oh, really?

78
00:06:16,718 --> 00:06:18,232
Totally...

79
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:25,668
Mmm! This is good!

80
00:06:25,668 --> 00:06:26,977
- Like this?
- Yes.

81
00:06:26,977 --> 00:06:29,669
Look at that doofus being all head over heels for her.

82
00:07:21,823 --> 00:07:23,376
You're back.

83
00:07:27,657 --> 00:07:29,452
Where are you going?

84
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,352
I asked, where are you going?

85
00:07:41,177 --> 00:07:42,474
Hey.

86
00:07:49,648 --> 00:07:51,322
Don't touch me.

87
00:07:52,324 --> 00:07:54,312
Where were you last night?

88
00:07:56,406 --> 00:07:58,422
I'm going to leave this place.

89
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,992
I know you have nowhere else to go.

90
00:08:03,992 --> 00:08:05,819
I'll go anywhere.

91
00:08:10,535 --> 00:08:12,034
An.

92
00:08:14,804 --> 00:08:16,936
It's been hell for me.

93
00:08:21,104 --> 00:08:23,601
How do you think it has been for me?

94
00:08:25,076 --> 00:08:26,701
I'm sorry.

95
00:08:31,902 --> 00:08:34,525
But you understand me, don't you?

96
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,973
Don't you?

97
00:08:38,497 --> 00:08:41,390
Nobody gets you like I do.

98
00:08:43,031 --> 00:08:44,929
You know that.

99
00:08:48,168 --> 00:08:50,152
Yes, I made a mistake.

100
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,347
I was young.

101
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:57,471
I didn't know what to do.

102
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:01,141
But not anymore.

103
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,609
I can change from now on.

104
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,645
Stay with me.

105
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:14,611
By my side.

106
00:09:20,588 --> 00:09:23,007
I'll be your everything.

107
00:09:31,211 --> 00:09:34,364
I met Yu Jeong's friends.

108
00:09:34,364 --> 00:09:37,489
Her friends like to sing and dance...

109
00:09:37,489 --> 00:09:39,124
Lee Hyeon.

110
00:09:39,124 --> 00:09:41,290
Did Kim An not come to school today?

111
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,728
No, he didn't.

112
00:09:42,728 --> 00:09:44,876
Did you not do your assignment?

113
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:49,214
I did, but I can't reach him right now.

114
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:52,079
He might come later.

115
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:54,443
Nothing else is going on, right?

116
00:09:54,443 --> 00:09:55,856
No.

117
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,691
That's a bit scary.

118
00:10:02,691 --> 00:10:03,870
Scary?

119
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,524
The professor knows your name.

120
00:10:05,524 --> 00:10:07,055
I got chills.

121
00:10:07,055 --> 00:10:10,145
She remembers everyone's name.

122
00:10:10,145 --> 00:10:12,445
Then she'll remember that you didn't do your assignment.

123
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,579
That's terrifying.

124
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:15,965
She'll remember if you doze off or pick your nose.

125
00:10:15,965 --> 00:10:18,022
You're practically wearing a name tag.

126
00:10:18,022 --> 00:10:19,786
Why would I pick my nose during class?

127
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,038
It can happen.

128
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,961
Why did you want to see me?

129
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,953
- Listen.
- Yes.

130
00:10:28,658 --> 00:10:30,901
The thing is...

131
00:10:30,901 --> 00:10:32,488
Spit it out.

132
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:35,505
- I stalked Min Wu.
- What?

133
00:10:36,321 --> 00:10:37,517
Why?

134
00:10:37,517 --> 00:10:39,908
He was on a date.

135
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,606
Because he has a girlfriend.

136
00:10:43,606 --> 00:10:45,220
Is that what you wanted to see?

137
00:10:46,101 --> 00:10:49,076
I don't know. I just started to follow them.

138
00:10:49,076 --> 00:10:50,507
And?

139
00:10:50,507 --> 00:10:51,857
I was hiding.

140
00:10:51,857 --> 00:10:53,333
What did they do?

141
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,644
They walked around and ate.

142
00:10:55,644 --> 00:10:57,392
So it was a normal date.

143
00:10:58,342 --> 00:11:00,168
- But...
- Yes.

144
00:11:00,168 --> 00:11:01,762
It feels like...

145
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,581
Like shit?

146
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,727
No, not that.

147
00:11:06,727 --> 00:11:08,384
I feel betrayed.

148
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:13,121
- Betrayed...
- He didn't even tell me.

149
00:11:13,121 --> 00:11:14,980
He can't tell you everything.

150
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,691
Then what am I supposed to do? I'm so curious.

151
00:11:17,691 --> 00:11:19,387
Then you should ask him.

152
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:22,401
I don't want to ask him. It's so annoying.

153
00:11:22,401 --> 00:11:24,904
Then try to figure it out by yourself.

154
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,898
Figure it out by myself?

155
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:33,877
[How to figure things out.]

156
00:11:38,032 --> 00:11:39,875
Yoga?

157
00:11:40,855 --> 00:11:42,648
A cold shower?

158
00:11:44,711 --> 00:11:46,337
Meditation?

159
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:09,987
My mind is blank.

160
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:16,428
I'm so embarrassed.

161
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:24,125
My mind is blank.

162
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,347
Ouch... It hurts so much.

163
00:12:27,088 --> 00:12:31,444
My mind is blank.

164
00:12:31,444 --> 00:12:33,163
Dang, it's so cold!

165
00:13:16,591 --> 00:13:18,170
See you later.

166
00:13:30,752 --> 00:13:32,100
Hey.

167
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,906
Hey.

168
00:13:36,409 --> 00:13:37,968
Hey!

169
00:13:49,237 --> 00:13:50,688
What are you doing?

170
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,160
Did you enter all the grades?

171
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,872
They need those grades as soon as possible.

172
00:13:55,872 --> 00:13:58,138
Yes, I'm almost done.

173
00:13:59,295 --> 00:14:01,352
Hurry.

174
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:07,000
What is this?

175
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,710
[rrrrrrrrrrrrrr]

176
00:14:20,696 --> 00:14:23,887
The number you have dialed is currently unavailable...

177
00:14:29,179 --> 00:14:32,394
The number you have dialed is currently unavailable...

178
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:36,442
[Kim An]
[Why weren't you in class?]

179
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:40,755
[Call me back. I'm getting worried.]

180
00:14:42,278 --> 00:14:44,079
Hyeon, what are you doing here?

181
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,515
- Let's go to class.
- Let's go.

182
00:14:55,701 --> 00:14:57,730
- Hello?
- Oh...

183
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,633
Hey, it's me.

184
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:01,004
Who is this?

185
00:15:01,004 --> 00:15:04,549
It's me, Kim Seong Min, the teaching assistant.

186
00:15:04,549 --> 00:15:06,697
I know. I was messing with you.

187
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,814
Oh, okay.

188
00:15:08,814 --> 00:15:12,203
So... Where are you right now?

189
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,890
At school.

190
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:17,725
Oh... Can you come out for a second?

191
00:15:17,725 --> 00:15:20,064
Sorry, I'm a bit busy right now.

192
00:15:20,996 --> 00:15:22,355
Oh, you are?

193
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:26,309
Yes, we're pulling an all-nighter for an assignment.

194
00:15:26,309 --> 00:15:27,592
Oh... I see.

195
00:15:28,325 --> 00:15:29,647
Why? What's up?

196
00:15:29,647 --> 00:15:31,559
No, nothing's up.

197
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:33,098
All right, bye.

198
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,364
Bye.

199
00:15:34,364 --> 00:15:35,817
Yes.

200
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,257
What's so funny?

201
00:16:01,365 --> 00:16:02,396
Playing hard to get.

202
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:04,562
Oh, are you dating?

203
00:16:04,562 --> 00:16:06,061
Just wait and see.

204
00:16:06,061 --> 00:16:09,288
It's going to be awesome.

205
00:16:12,742 --> 00:16:13,898
[Kim Seong Min]

206
00:16:13,898 --> 00:16:16,355
[I left some snacks at the entrance for you and your friends.]

207
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:43,580
I'm just getting started, and he's already fired up.

208
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,397
Cute.

209
00:17:24,562 --> 00:17:26,029
Min Wu.

210
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,085
Are you sick?

211
00:17:29,085 --> 00:17:30,479
Yes.

212
00:17:32,238 --> 00:17:34,633
I did too much

213
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:36,998
thinking.

214
00:17:38,619 --> 00:17:41,664
But I still can't figure it out.

215
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,250
Don't be sick.

216
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,856
Okay.

217
00:17:47,856 --> 00:17:49,591
Sa Ra.

218
00:18:54,877 --> 00:18:56,035
Hyeong?

219
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:57,707
An Hyeong?

220
00:19:02,751 --> 00:19:04,884
Hyeong, it's me.

221
00:19:05,943 --> 00:19:07,791
Are you there?

222
00:19:41,241 --> 00:19:46,936
[Love Class 2]

223
00:20:13,955 --> 00:20:16,191
The number you have dialed is currently unavailable.

224
00:20:16,191 --> 00:20:20,458
Please leave a message after the beep.

225
00:20:21,298 --> 00:20:22,555
Teacher.

226
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:26,043
I got my report card today, and my grades improved a lot.

227
00:20:26,043 --> 00:20:29,109
So come quickly, and tell me I did a good job, okay?

228
00:21:04,944 --> 00:21:06,914
- Hello?
- Hyeon.

229
00:21:06,914 --> 00:21:08,865
Did you misbehave in front of the tutor?

230
00:21:08,865 --> 00:21:10,660
He says he'll quit and return all the tuition fee.

231
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,872
What?

232
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,877
Kids these days

233
00:21:14,877 --> 00:21:16,985
have no sense of responsibility.

234
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,966
He's not coming anymore, okay?

235
00:21:26,207 --> 00:21:28,506
[Kim An]
[I can't tutor you anymore.]

236
00:21:28,506 --> 00:21:30,263
[I'm sorry, and take care.]

237
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:02,450
♫ That moment when you, whom I have been waiting for, ♫

238
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:06,240
♫ Appeared before me ♫

239
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:13,100
♫ When life gives only you light ♫

240
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:17,610
♫ Be the light by my side. The way you look ♫

241
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:21,310
♫ Raises me up again ♫

242
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:28,290
♫ It makes my heart feel full, makes my heart flutter ♫

243
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,940
♫ It's you ♫
