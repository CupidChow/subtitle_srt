00:00:09,369 --> 00:00:14,837
[Love Class 2]

2
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:26,447
I thought you had gone to Min Wu's place.

3
00:00:26,447 --> 00:00:30,921
I'm giving you the honor of taking care of me today.

4
00:00:30,921 --> 00:00:33,223
Wash up and go to bed.

5
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,205
I went up to Min Wu's front door and turned back.

6
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,289
Why?

7
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,587
I was afraid he wouldn't open the door.

8
00:00:41,587 --> 00:00:43,223
You don't know him at all, do you?

9
00:00:43,223 --> 00:00:45,637
I don't know. The lights were off.

10
00:00:45,637 --> 00:00:48,766
Still, you went all that way just to come back?

11
00:00:48,766 --> 00:00:51,056
Jeez, wash up and go to bed.

12
00:00:51,056 --> 00:00:54,353
What was I supposed to do? I'm scared of the dark.

13
00:00:58,267 --> 00:00:59,757
Ma Ru.

14
00:01:00,385 --> 00:01:02,204
What?

15
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:10,153
The thing you guys were talking about at your table.

16
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,738
What do you mean?

17
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,449
About the day the police showed up on campus.

18
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,902
Oh, that.

19
00:01:16,902 --> 00:01:18,797
Someone pushed his friend off the roof.

20
00:01:18,797 --> 00:01:20,256
What?

21
00:01:20,256 --> 00:01:21,799
Is it someone you know?

22
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,726
No, no... Why?

23
00:01:23,726 --> 00:01:25,085
Why did he do it?

24
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,186
I don't know.

25
00:01:29,981 --> 00:01:32,444
Why do you ask? Should I do a little digging?

26
00:01:32,444 --> 00:01:34,668
I'm great at that kind of stuff.

27
00:01:34,668 --> 00:01:36,669
I heard his name. What was it?

28
00:01:36,669 --> 00:01:38,069
Kim...

29
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:39,850
- Kim...
- Never mind.

30
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,518
Leave it to me. I know lots of people at the school.

31
00:01:43,518 --> 00:01:46,331
How come you know lots of people at my school?

32
00:01:47,225 --> 00:01:49,999
Because my friends go there.

33
00:01:50,748 --> 00:01:52,478
Jeez...

34
00:01:57,521 --> 00:01:59,192
Hey.

35
00:01:59,192 --> 00:02:02,239
Have you noticed anything different about Min Wu?

36
00:02:03,772 --> 00:02:06,556
He's the same he has always been.

37
00:02:07,682 --> 00:02:10,191
To me, he feels a bit different.

38
00:02:10,834 --> 00:02:12,320
In what way?

39
00:02:13,207 --> 00:02:15,368
He's become cold.

40
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:17,556
If that's how you feel, then that must be it.

41
00:02:17,556 --> 00:02:19,742
That's it?

42
00:02:19,742 --> 00:02:20,918
What do you want me to say?

43
00:02:20,918 --> 00:02:23,978
It's not like I know what's going on inside his head.

44
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:33,064
You're easy to read,

45
00:02:33,064 --> 00:02:35,389
but Min Wu isn't.

46
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:39,243
It's because you have more interest in him than in me.

47
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:41,747
Is it harder to read if you're more interested?

48
00:02:41,747 --> 00:02:45,677
The more interest you have,

49
00:02:45,677 --> 00:02:48,347
the harder it is to judge by only what you see.

50
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,520
You show me everything.

51
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,853
I don't.

52
00:02:54,853 --> 00:02:56,505
Really?

53
00:02:56,505 --> 00:02:58,337
You probably don't, either.

54
00:03:00,553 --> 00:03:01,959
Show me everything.

55
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:03,046
Show me everything.

56
00:03:03,046 --> 00:03:04,998
What the...

57
00:03:04,998 --> 00:03:06,706
Everything.

58
00:03:07,483 --> 00:03:10,627
- Go to sleep.
- I won't sleep until you show me everything.

59
00:03:10,627 --> 00:03:12,560
Do you want me to kick you out?

60
00:03:13,706 --> 00:03:15,271
Go to sleep.

61
00:03:18,785 --> 00:03:20,775
Do you have beer?

62
00:03:22,665 --> 00:03:24,021
Let's get coffee.

63
00:03:24,021 --> 00:03:25,514
No.

64
00:03:25,514 --> 00:03:27,905
- No?
- You're going to get an iced Americano, right?

65
00:03:27,905 --> 00:03:29,616
Yes. Can't I?

66
00:03:29,616 --> 00:03:31,737
You can't. I'm on a mission.

67
00:03:31,737 --> 00:03:33,797
Go to another coffee shop if you want an iced Americano.

68
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:36,530
Then what can I order here?

69
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,344
First, watch my thirty-minute performance.

70
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,929
Then get a milkshake made with green tea powder,

71
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,661
diced strawberries at the bottom, blended with Java chips,

72
00:03:42,661 --> 00:03:44,730
a swirl of caramel syrup, change the milk to oat milk—

73
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,079
Never mind.

74
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,826
Bye.

75
00:03:57,815 --> 00:04:00,289
Let the mission begin!

76
00:04:26,374 --> 00:04:27,215
Hey...

77
00:04:27,215 --> 00:04:28,668
Excuse me.

78
00:04:30,246 --> 00:04:31,730
What do you think you're doing?

79
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,730
Me?

80
00:04:33,413 --> 00:04:35,023
What about me?

81
00:04:35,023 --> 00:04:37,765
This is too much.

82
00:04:37,765 --> 00:04:39,411
What is too much?

83
00:04:39,411 --> 00:04:41,476
I mean, look at this.

84
00:04:41,476 --> 00:04:44,626
I brought this for other people.

85
00:04:44,626 --> 00:04:47,420
That's why I'm using only one power outlet.

86
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,738
I mean...

87
00:04:48,738 --> 00:04:50,686
You're using too much electricity.

88
00:04:50,686 --> 00:04:53,434
- Can't I do that?
- Of course, you can't.

89
00:04:53,434 --> 00:04:55,879
This guy says we can't use electricity.

90
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,555
What?

91
00:04:57,555 --> 00:05:00,610
No, no, no.

92
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,135
You can use it, you can use it.

93
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,026
No, no.

94
00:05:04,026 --> 00:05:06,505
Don't... Don't go.

95
00:05:07,325 --> 00:05:10,171
Can I use electricity?

96
00:05:12,968 --> 00:05:14,287
Yes.

97
00:05:16,095 --> 00:05:17,276
Oh.

98
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,611
I haven't ordered yet.

99
00:05:24,397 --> 00:05:25,809
Wow.

100
00:05:25,809 --> 00:05:28,010
They all look so good.

101
00:05:35,094 --> 00:05:37,240
I'm just going to get a drink.

102
00:05:38,444 --> 00:05:39,999
First of all,

103
00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:41,731
put some diced strawberries at the bottom,

104
00:05:41,731 --> 00:05:43,584
then add a green tea milkshake made with extra green tea powder

105
00:05:43,584 --> 00:05:44,830
and blended with Java chips,

106
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:48,175
swirl caramel syrup inside the cup two times, and change the milk to oat milk.

107
00:05:48,175 --> 00:05:50,940
Drizzle strawberry syrup three times so that it falls against the walls of the cup.

108
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,119
Add two shots of espresso, and top it with espresso whipped cream

109
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:55,939
with a bit of sprinkle and cinnamon powder.

110
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,035
And less ice.

111
00:05:57,035 --> 00:05:59,487
No, a lot.

112
00:05:59,487 --> 00:06:01,450
Never mind, a little. Sorry about that. A lot.

113
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,221
No, actually! Medium!

114
00:06:03,221 --> 00:06:05,098
Right, a medium amount of ice.

115
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:08,217
And here, I have a coupon too.

116
00:06:16,158 --> 00:06:18,207
- Teaching Assistant.
- Hey.

117
00:06:18,207 --> 00:06:19,731
What is this? Is this for me?

118
00:06:19,731 --> 00:06:21,574
Yes, it's yours.

119
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,445
Oh. This coffee tastes great.

120
00:06:26,445 --> 00:06:27,599
Where did you get it from?

121
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:31,196
It's a new coffee shop across the road from the back gate.

122
00:06:31,196 --> 00:06:32,777
Oh, that place.

123
00:06:32,777 --> 00:06:34,809
I haven't been there yet.

124
00:06:34,809 --> 00:06:36,485
Thanks.

125
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:41,254
Um, Teaching Assistant.

126
00:06:41,254 --> 00:06:42,596
Yes?

127
00:06:46,442 --> 00:06:47,914
Never mind.

128
00:06:49,673 --> 00:06:51,154
Okay.

129
00:06:53,854 --> 00:06:57,474
Can I ask you something about Kim An Seonbaenim?

130
00:06:57,474 --> 00:06:58,960
Kim An?

131
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,617
What about him?

132
00:07:00,617 --> 00:07:03,538
I've heard some rumors about him.

133
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:05,696
Rumors?

134
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,815
That he pushed someone off the roof,

135
00:07:09,815 --> 00:07:13,190
and the police came.

136
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,585
Is it true?

137
00:07:16,585 --> 00:07:17,671
It's a rumor, right?

138
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:19,587
Have you heard of it?

139
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:22,588
Even if I have,

140
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:26,201
a rumor is just a rumor.

141
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,639
You're right.

142
00:07:59,426 --> 00:08:01,837
Kangha University roof...

143
00:08:08,435 --> 00:08:10,935
Nothing's coming up.

144
00:08:13,306 --> 00:08:16,396
Maybe I should have asked Ma Ru to do some digging.

145
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,601
Were you surprised to get an assignment in the very first week?

146
00:08:45,601 --> 00:08:49,779
The assignment was to help you get to know each other faster.

147
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,596
So I hope you understand.

148
00:08:51,596 --> 00:08:54,442
Our first week's assignment was an observation log.

149
00:08:54,442 --> 00:08:58,423
You'll now present your observations.

150
00:08:58,423 --> 00:09:03,269
Yu min has cauliflower ears because he's a judo major.

151
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:04,812
She reminds me of a cat.

152
00:09:04,812 --> 00:09:07,359
She behaves like a cat.

153
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:11,807
He gets at least three rice refills,

154
00:09:11,807 --> 00:09:14,742
but he doesn't eat vegetables.

155
00:09:14,742 --> 00:09:17,223
The next presenters are...

156
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,338
Lee Hyeon and Kim An.

157
00:09:19,338 --> 00:09:21,791
Come up and present your assignments.

158
00:09:28,862 --> 00:09:32,781
Professor, I did do the assignment,

159
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:36,155
but I think I did it wrongly.

160
00:09:36,155 --> 00:09:37,354
Really?

161
00:09:37,354 --> 00:09:40,136
Yes. It's different from everyone else's.

162
00:09:40,136 --> 00:09:42,762
It's okay. Let's hear it.

163
00:09:42,762 --> 00:09:44,162
Okay.

164
00:09:49,735 --> 00:09:52,276
He took me to the library.

165
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:57,665
It was so quiet that I couldn't ask him any more questions.

166
00:09:58,827 --> 00:10:00,809
The face that I had missed for a long time

167
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:04,107
was right there in front of me,

168
00:10:04,107 --> 00:10:06,618
in the flesh.

169
00:10:07,466 --> 00:10:11,636
His eyes, which were reading a book, were sharper than I remembered.

170
00:10:11,636 --> 00:10:14,364
I kept thinking of the old days.

171
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:18,712
In a space where I couldn't speak or hear him talk.

172
00:10:18,712 --> 00:10:21,169
I thought of the past.

173
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:25,117
Can people change?

174
00:10:25,617 --> 00:10:30,609
Why did I think he wouldn't change when I myself have changed?

175
00:10:32,188 --> 00:10:34,260
But I still want to believe

176
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:38,051
it's the time that's changed and not the person.

177
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,670
In Kim An's time,

178
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,534
I lost two years and a few months.

179
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,021
Kim An wears

180
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,870
the face of lost time.

181
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:03,643
Lee Hyeon, twenty years old, 183 cm.

182
00:11:03,643 --> 00:11:06,886
Fair skin and almond-shaped eyes.

183
00:11:06,886 --> 00:11:09,366
A prominent nose and nice lips.

184
00:11:09,366 --> 00:11:12,874
His lower jaw is sharp rather than rounded.

185
00:11:12,874 --> 00:11:15,867
He doesn't speak fast, but he's talkative.

186
00:11:15,867 --> 00:11:19,108
He tends to slur his words at the end.

187
00:11:19,108 --> 00:11:20,680
He draws well

188
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,694
and gives his drawings as gifts.

189
00:11:25,363 --> 00:11:27,058
That's it.

190
00:11:31,987 --> 00:11:35,680
Two very different observation logs.

191
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,418
Thank you.

192
00:11:38,767 --> 00:11:44,272
The next presenters are Kim Hyeon Ji and Lee Yu Dong.

193
00:12:23,718 --> 00:12:25,554
You're busy, right?

194
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,082
I am.

195
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:39,653
Tell me.

196
00:12:45,283 --> 00:12:47,871
Do you know where I was this morning?

197
00:12:47,871 --> 00:12:50,647
Professor Lim's seminar?

198
00:12:50,647 --> 00:12:52,557
Yes.

199
00:12:52,557 --> 00:12:55,191
- I went to the seminar, but...
- But?

200
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:58,187
In the middle of presentations, he kept calling me

201
00:12:58,187 --> 00:13:00,323
to say there was a cockroach in his room,

202
00:13:00,323 --> 00:13:03,037
and he wanted me to catch it.

203
00:13:03,037 --> 00:13:05,688
Why didn't he call the front desk?

204
00:13:05,688 --> 00:13:09,672
That's what I told him.

205
00:13:09,672 --> 00:13:12,525
He insisted that I come.

206
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,767
So I went and caught it.

207
00:13:14,767 --> 00:13:18,164
I talked to the front desk to change his room,

208
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,623
and then it was his turn to present, so I clicked through the slides

209
00:13:20,623 --> 00:13:23,011
I couldn't even have lunch and just came back right away.

210
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,774
That sucks.

211
00:13:24,774 --> 00:13:26,233
He's driving me crazy.

212
00:13:26,233 --> 00:13:28,535
You know what he's like.

213
00:13:35,553 --> 00:13:36,962
Yes?

214
00:13:38,482 --> 00:13:40,482
Hello, hi.

215
00:13:45,878 --> 00:13:47,732
What brings you here?

216
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,774
I came to give you this,

217
00:13:50,774 --> 00:13:52,735
to apologize for what happened last time.

218
00:13:52,735 --> 00:13:55,064
You didn't have to.

219
00:13:55,064 --> 00:13:56,850
It's nothing big.

220
00:13:57,425 --> 00:13:58,474
I'll go.

221
00:13:58,474 --> 00:14:00,656
Okay. Thanks.

222
00:14:08,211 --> 00:14:10,672
Wow, Kim Seong Min.

223
00:14:10,672 --> 00:14:12,124
Must be great to be a teaching assistant,

224
00:14:12,124 --> 00:14:14,314
getting presents from students.

225
00:14:14,314 --> 00:14:15,885
That's not what this is.

226
00:14:15,885 --> 00:14:17,575
Let's see what's inside.

227
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:26,365
- Can we make copies here?
- No.

228
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,048
It's urgent. Just this once.

229
00:14:28,048 --> 00:14:30,861
You know the rules.

230
00:14:30,861 --> 00:14:33,227
We brought paper.

231
00:14:33,227 --> 00:14:34,691
Please.

232
00:14:35,204 --> 00:14:37,271
I said no.

233
00:14:39,394 --> 00:14:40,982
What's this?

234
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:47,687
What is that?

235
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,272
They're very pretty.

236
00:14:54,343 --> 00:14:56,015
One underwear per day.

237
00:14:56,015 --> 00:14:57,833
[Ju Hyeok.]

238
00:15:00,497 --> 00:15:02,355
Next week's assignment is

239
00:15:02,355 --> 00:15:06,053
to share each other's hobbies.

240
00:15:06,053 --> 00:15:08,576
Find out what your partner does

241
00:15:08,576 --> 00:15:11,102
when they're alone, bored,

242
00:15:11,102 --> 00:15:13,957
or lonely.

243
00:15:13,957 --> 00:15:16,677
Interview your partner about their hobbies,

244
00:15:16,677 --> 00:15:19,561
and try them out together.

245
00:15:19,561 --> 00:15:23,797
Oh, and submit your work as a video.

246
00:15:25,346 --> 00:15:27,403
You can just use your phone.

247
00:15:27,403 --> 00:15:29,428
Your kids are good at that, right?

248
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,059
The video can be less than two minutes.

249
00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:33,835
Okay? Easy, right?

250
00:15:33,835 --> 00:15:35,370
No...

251
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,246
One last thing.

252
00:15:37,246 --> 00:15:41,581
There's a team that got a special assignment last time,

253
00:15:41,581 --> 00:15:46,021
to write down what they wanted to say to each other.

254
00:15:46,021 --> 00:15:50,130
Lee Hyeon and Kim An, please stand up and make your speeches.

255
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:57,691
First, stop being mean to me,

256
00:15:59,617 --> 00:16:02,567
and answer my calls.

257
00:16:07,981 --> 00:16:10,656
What I want to say to Lee Hyeon is...

258
00:16:12,569 --> 00:16:17,788
It's all my fault. I'm sorry.

259
00:16:20,965 --> 00:16:23,910
Why did you say that?

260
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,638
It made me sad.

261
00:16:32,528 --> 00:16:34,932
You scared me. Are you trying to kidnap me?

262
00:16:34,932 --> 00:16:37,410
Why are you worrying about that? You're useless.

263
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,405
Then can you let go of me?

264
00:16:41,385 --> 00:16:42,926
That's Kim An.

265
00:16:42,926 --> 00:16:44,078
What?

266
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:46,058
That guy is Kim An,

267
00:16:46,058 --> 00:16:49,183
the guy who pushed his friend off the roof.

268
00:16:50,575 --> 00:16:53,124
So he's really taking classes.

269
00:16:53,124 --> 00:16:56,724
I hear he's partnered up with a freshman. I feel bad for that guy.

270
00:16:58,243 --> 00:16:59,936
What does he look like?

271
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:02,600
You must have seen him today. Who is he?

272
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,021
Should I find out?

273
00:17:04,021 --> 00:17:06,247
- Ma Ru.
- Yes?

274
00:17:06,744 --> 00:17:09,001
It's me, so shut up.

275
00:17:10,219 --> 00:17:11,864
Shut up.

276
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:23,145
[Did you miss me?]

277
00:17:33,563 --> 00:17:36,896
[Did you miss me?]

278
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,937
Can't you act surprised?

279
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,870
I was surprised.

280
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,579
What did you think of my presentation?

281
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:47,770
It was good.

282
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:48,949
In what way?

283
00:17:48,949 --> 00:17:50,561
You wrote it well.

284
00:17:50,561 --> 00:17:53,211
Which part in particular?

285
00:17:53,211 --> 00:17:55,212
Didn't you hear my presentation?

286
00:17:55,212 --> 00:17:56,760
I did.

287
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,350
You talk too much.

288
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,877
I didn't hear that part.

289
00:18:01,877 --> 00:18:04,792
- This is why I can't be vague with you.
- That's right.

290
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,957
When you're vague, I'll interpret it in my own way.

291
00:18:07,957 --> 00:18:10,005
"Talkative"?

292
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,544
That means it's fun to hang out with me.

293
00:18:12,544 --> 00:18:14,063
Like that.

294
00:18:17,384 --> 00:18:19,131
We have to do the assignment.

295
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,856
Why are you so eager when you're just auditing?

296
00:18:21,856 --> 00:18:24,495
Because I always do my best.

297
00:18:24,495 --> 00:18:27,521
Are you going to the classes for your major?

298
00:18:27,521 --> 00:18:30,023
You seem more focused on electives.

299
00:18:30,023 --> 00:18:32,264
I'm still a freshman.

300
00:18:32,264 --> 00:18:34,830
I want to gain a broad spectrum of knowledge.

301
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,782
Time flies faster than you think.

302
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,703
Keep that in mind.

303
00:18:38,703 --> 00:18:41,488
Now you're forced to tell me your hobbies.

304
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:43,983
I'm being forced to make hobbies.

305
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:47,760
Should we make one now?

306
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,283
You should think of another hobby. This isn't it.

307
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,515
Be quiet during the game.

308
00:19:21,515 --> 00:19:24,572
Let's find something you can do while sitting down.

309
00:19:24,572 --> 00:19:26,353
Minesweeper?

310
00:19:26,353 --> 00:19:28,173
Puzzles?

311
00:19:28,173 --> 00:19:30,063
Hand me the ball.

312
00:20:22,191 --> 00:20:24,516
I'm not going to bite you.

313
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:26,974
I know that.

314
00:20:31,131 --> 00:20:32,781
Then why did you do that?

315
00:20:32,781 --> 00:20:35,130
Were you scared I would bite your hand?

316
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,147
Don't cross the line.

317
00:20:57,677 --> 00:20:59,290
What are you doing?

318
00:20:59,914 --> 00:21:01,606
Stop.

319
00:21:04,986 --> 00:21:07,447
I forgot to film you playing basketball.

320
00:21:07,447 --> 00:21:09,677
We can do it next time.

321
00:21:09,677 --> 00:21:12,274
Okay, next time.

322
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:16,300
I like that there will be a next time.

323
00:21:21,267 --> 00:21:23,267
Will we always have

324
00:21:23,267 --> 00:21:25,867
a "next time" now?

325
00:21:36,248 --> 00:21:39,194
I don't understand why you're doing this.

326
00:21:40,998 --> 00:21:43,669
Are you lying?

327
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:46,589
I don't get why you don't understand this.

328
00:21:49,698 --> 00:21:53,044
We have a past.

329
00:21:56,389 --> 00:21:58,795
Is the past that important to you?

330
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:07,124
Did you really push someone off the roof?

331
00:22:11,961 --> 00:22:13,812
And then what happened?

332
00:22:18,048 --> 00:22:20,615
Everyone knows about it, so why wouldn't you?

333
00:22:20,615 --> 00:22:24,328
I've done more serious things, so look into those too.

334
00:22:24,328 --> 00:22:26,868
I'm just trying to understand.

335
00:22:26,868 --> 00:22:29,080
What happened during those two years?

336
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,565
Why didn't you call me,

337
00:22:32,175 --> 00:22:34,986
and why are you giving me the cold shoulder?

338
00:22:35,746 --> 00:22:37,848
Has it ever occurred to you that I don't like you anymore?

339
00:22:37,848 --> 00:22:39,048
No.

340
00:22:39,682 --> 00:22:41,296
It never occurred to me once.

341
00:22:41,296 --> 00:22:42,766
Hey!

342
00:22:43,373 --> 00:22:46,052
Not even now.

343
00:22:50,542 --> 00:22:52,555
You don't look like it.

344
00:22:56,325 --> 00:22:58,863
This is familiar.

345
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,397
I'll call you.

346
00:23:01,397 --> 00:23:03,722
You have to try my hobbies too.

347
00:23:03,722 --> 00:23:06,051
It's dark, so get home safely.

348
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:09,635
I want you to text me that you got home safely,

349
00:23:09,635 --> 00:23:11,636
but I'm sure you won't, so I'll call you.

350
00:23:11,636 --> 00:23:13,071
Pick up, okay?

351
00:23:27,635 --> 00:23:28,818
Min Wu!

352
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:33,631
How long have you been waiting? You should have called me.

353
00:23:33,631 --> 00:23:34,897
I didn't wait that long.

354
00:23:34,897 --> 00:23:37,063
I had a feeling you would come soon.

355
00:23:37,063 --> 00:23:38,514
Let's go inside.

356
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,778
You know my parents.

357
00:23:47,778 --> 00:23:51,599
I'm in trouble for quitting my job.

358
00:23:53,151 --> 00:23:55,439
I can't go home.

359
00:23:55,439 --> 00:23:57,782
I'll have to sneak in

360
00:23:57,782 --> 00:24:00,360
and get rid of all the golf clubs.

361
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,066
And the knives.

362
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:04,289
The baseball bat? The drying rack?

363
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:07,000
Damn it, anyway...

364
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,852
I'll have to get rid of those things first to go back home.

365
00:24:10,852 --> 00:24:13,701
They'll understand.

366
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:16,725
They won't.

367
00:24:16,725 --> 00:24:18,910
Listen to this.

368
00:24:26,524 --> 00:24:27,968
Ma Ru.

369
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:31,404
I did my best to raise you,

370
00:24:31,404 --> 00:24:35,432
even when you bought a motorcycle with lesson fees,

371
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:38,332
even when I got called to your school

372
00:24:38,332 --> 00:24:40,333
because you shot the principal

373
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:42,606
with paint,

374
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,529
even when you bought ice cream

375
00:24:44,529 --> 00:24:48,945
for the whole class with my credit card on sports day.

376
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:52,074
He paid in full.

377
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:55,873
So when you finally got a job,

378
00:24:55,873 --> 00:25:01,290
your dad and I felt like we were on top of the world.

379
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,794
But...

380
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:05,208
But...

381
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,389
when you quit that great job

382
00:25:08,389 --> 00:25:13,064
and started drinking with college students,

383
00:25:13,064 --> 00:25:16,135
your mom and I shook our heads.

384
00:25:17,912 --> 00:25:19,840
Let's abandon him.

385
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,382
Abandon him.

386
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,000
Ma Ru.

387
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,015
Your dad and I have decided to abandon you.

388
00:25:28,015 --> 00:25:30,491
So don't ever call us again.

389
00:25:30,491 --> 00:25:32,698
If you do,

390
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:36,011
we're going to break your limbs.

391
00:25:37,428 --> 00:25:39,699
What am I going to do?

392
00:25:39,699 --> 00:25:42,194
They abandoned me.

393
00:25:42,194 --> 00:25:44,627
It's tough right now,

394
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:47,321
but they'll understand eventually.

395
00:25:49,064 --> 00:25:52,207
Were you the one who bought ice cream for everyone

396
00:25:52,207 --> 00:25:53,832
in second grade?

397
00:25:53,832 --> 00:25:55,508
Yes.

398
00:25:55,508 --> 00:25:59,299
I wanted ice cream but felt bad about eating it alone.

399
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:12,636
Hey, Min Wu.

400
00:26:12,636 --> 00:26:13,773
Yeah?

401
00:26:14,778 --> 00:26:17,302
Please let me move in with you.

402
00:26:22,793 --> 00:26:25,802
I got my severance pay, and I'm getting unemployment benefits.

403
00:26:25,802 --> 00:26:27,803
I'll pay half the rent.

404
00:26:27,803 --> 00:26:30,818
Please? Please, Min Wu. Help me out.

405
00:26:30,818 --> 00:26:34,257
Huh? Please.

406
00:26:34,257 --> 00:26:35,358
Just this once.

407
00:26:35,358 --> 00:26:37,306
Help me out.

408
00:26:38,357 --> 00:26:39,912
Deal?

409
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,487
Thanks.

410
00:26:55,915 --> 00:26:57,897
[Kim An] I got home safely.

411
00:26:59,024 --> 00:27:01,052
So don't call me.

412
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:04,183
I was going to call you,

413
00:27:04,183 --> 00:27:07,423
but I got scared of getting hurt if you didn't pick up.

414
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:12,834
Don't push me away.

415
00:27:12,834 --> 00:27:14,694
It hurts my feelings.

416
00:27:20,175 --> 00:27:23,132
Okay, good night.

417
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:28,405
Let's not be greedy.

418
00:27:28,405 --> 00:27:30,298
I'm fine with the way it is.

419
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:42,100
[Love Class 2]

420
00:28:12,825 --> 00:28:14,498
It's really late.

421
00:28:14,498 --> 00:28:15,872
Exactly.

422
00:28:15,872 --> 00:28:17,660
Hurry and open the door.

423
00:28:28,256 --> 00:28:32,604
What you need is the length of two sides and the included angle.

424
00:28:32,604 --> 00:28:35,961
When the included angle is 90 degrees, that's the classic...

425
00:28:35,961 --> 00:28:40,305
1/2 times its base times its height...

426
00:28:40,305 --> 00:28:42,561
My parents are getting divorced.

427
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,718
My dad is having an affair.

428
00:28:44,718 --> 00:28:46,575
He must be out of his mind.

429
00:28:47,127 --> 00:28:48,890
Why cheat...

430
00:28:51,674 --> 00:28:54,204
Everyone has a normal life,

431
00:28:55,254 --> 00:28:56,893
except for me.

432
00:29:02,961 --> 00:29:04,470
It must be tough.

433
00:29:08,961 --> 00:29:12,452
Do your parents get along?

434
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,008
They're not with us.

435
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:23,336
They passed away when I was young.

436
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:27,861
So I...

437
00:29:29,753 --> 00:29:31,996
I'm a bit jealous of you.

438
00:29:32,825 --> 00:29:35,137
I know you don't want to hear that.

439
00:29:36,445 --> 00:29:38,994
Then...

440
00:29:39,786 --> 00:29:42,115
Are you struggling, too?

441
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,332
Well...

442
00:29:46,332 --> 00:29:48,704
I have friends. I'm fine.

443
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:50,682
Still...

444
00:29:50,682 --> 00:29:53,110
I'm fine enough to help you out when you're struggling.

445
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:55,147
So don't worry.

446
00:29:59,064 --> 00:30:00,366
What's important is...

447
00:30:00,366 --> 00:30:03,041
When the included angle is smaller or bigger than 90,

448
00:30:03,041 --> 00:30:07,294
you have to use the trigonometric function that we're studying right now

449
00:30:07,294 --> 00:30:09,815
to find the area.

450
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:31,440
♫ That moment when you, whom I have been waiting for, ♫

451
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,080
♫ Appeared before me ♫

452
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:42,050
♫ When life gives only you light ♫

453
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:46,550
♫ Be the light by my side. The way you look ♫

454
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:50,360
♫ Raises me up again ♫

455
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:57,260
♫ It makes my heart feel full, makes my heart flutter ♫

456
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,500
♫ It's you ♫
