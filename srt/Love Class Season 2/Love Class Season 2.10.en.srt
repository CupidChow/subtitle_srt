- Ma Ru, did you book this place?
- Yes

00:00:17,944 --> 00:00:19,966
I'm good at stuff like this.

We didn't properly introduce ourselves.

I picked it because it was popular.

64
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:34,064
I wanted to hide in the crowd so no one could pay attention to me.

65

Why do you keep calling "Mr."?

87
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,604
Because it sounds more formal?

88
00:04:34,604 --> 00:04:36,276
But you've called me "Hyeong" from the first day we met.

89

You have to feed it water and food every day.

You can put it to sleep at night or walk all night.

- Are you insane?
- What?

00:10:23,405 --> 00:10:25,542
You guys are so cringy.

188
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,469
Sorry.

189
00:10:27,469 --> 00:10:28,837
But...

190
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:31,214
you guys are, too.

191
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,065
We're not as bad as you guys.

192
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:35,320
You are.

193
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,557
I never imagined this would happen.

194
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,350
Me, neither.

195
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,477
All of us together.

196
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,895
It's cool.

197
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,326
Yes.

198
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,802
I used to be jealous of you.

199
00:10:51,802 --> 00:10:54,153
Why?

200
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,738
You know...

201
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,288
Having deep feelings for someone,

202
00:10:58,288 --> 00:11:02,544
focusing on that feeling, and getting heartbroken because of it.

203
00:11:03,176 --> 00:11:05,479
Do you enjoy getting your heart broken?

204
00:11:06,678 --> 00:11:09,669
I just thought I was incapable of it.

205
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,908
And?

206
00:11:10,908 --> 00:11:13,176
How does it feel to finally experience it?

207
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,884
At first, I was worried because

208
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:19,255
I thought that I was the one who made that situation.

209
00:11:19,255 --> 00:11:22,982
I couldn't feel anything for anyone for a long time.

210
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:27,085
But in the end, I found him.

211
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:31,708
Because Ma Ru is Ma Ru.

212
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:33,749
That's right.

213
00:11:33,749 --> 00:11:35,745
Ma Ru is Ma Ru.

214
00:11:36,874 --> 00:11:38,883
I can understand

215
00:11:38,883 --> 00:11:40,831
why you like him.

216
00:11:41,724 --> 00:11:44,124
Me, too.

217
00:11:44,676 --> 00:11:48,739
But I don't know when or how it started.

218
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,172
You guys were talking about me, weren't you?

219
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:55,256
Yeah, you dumbass.

220
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,780
Like what?

221
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,049
That you're pretty.

222
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:02,610
Shit, my eyes!

223
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,685
Why do you do that after apologizing for it?

224
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:09,527
Nobody can stop my love.

225
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:12,378
Sorry.

226
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,519
You guys are killing me.

227
00:12:19,898 --> 00:12:21,532
Wow, you're good at this.

228
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:22,909
This is my first time.

229
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,911
- Really?
- Yes.

230
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,845
I watched it on YouTube.

231
00:12:26,845 --> 00:12:29,126
- Do you want to try it?
- Sure.

232
00:12:34,404 --> 00:12:36,523
Thank you.

233
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,656
Mm, it's good.

234
00:12:52,656 --> 00:12:54,615
- Yes?
- Yes.

235
00:12:56,773 --> 00:12:59,133
When you learn something, do you usually pick it up quickly?

236
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:03,791
Generally, yes.

237
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:09,240
Is there anything you think you'll never be able to do?

238
00:13:10,448 --> 00:13:13,824
Something I'll never be able to do?

239
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:20,669
I don't know.

240
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,512
Let me know if you think of one.

241
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:25,764
I'm going to master it.

242
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:27,196
Why?

243
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,978
It'll be nice to have something like that.

244
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:32,707
It's just a feeling I have.

245
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:37,705
Come here.

246
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:49,551
- Are you crazy?
- Be careful! The coffee.

247
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,256
I'm in shock.

248
00:13:56,758 --> 00:13:59,876
It feels like I'm losing right now.

249
00:13:59,876 --> 00:14:02,482
I can't beat you at that.

250
00:14:08,911 --> 00:14:09,946
Do it.

251
00:14:09,946 --> 00:14:12,241
You must be crazy, Hyeong.

252
00:14:12,241 --> 00:14:14,663
Don't!

253
00:14:14,663 --> 00:14:16,329
Seriously...

254
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,323
Do bugs like you?

255
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:28,618
Not as much as you, but they're quite fond of me.

256
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:29,994
Do you want it?

257
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,346
Sure.

258
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,773
Let's go for a walk.

259
00:14:43,773 --> 00:14:45,077
Right now?

260
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:47,075
Me?

261
00:14:47,075 --> 00:14:48,262
Yes.

262
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,792
Didn't they tell you?

263
00:14:49,792 --> 00:14:52,196
- I begged them to tell me.
- Right.

264
00:14:52,196 --> 00:14:55,214
But they never told me.

265
00:14:55,214 --> 00:14:59,231
So I still don't know what happened.

266
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:03,569
Nothing happened.

267
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,808
But some things were said.

268
00:15:05,808 --> 00:15:07,480
Like what?

269
00:15:08,143 --> 00:15:10,115
I'm not going to tell you.

270
00:15:29,992 --> 00:15:31,884
Why...

271
00:15:31,884 --> 00:15:34,426
Did you bring me here to do that?

272
00:15:35,633 --> 00:15:38,676
No, that's not the only reason...

273
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,018
Why? Don't you like it?

274
00:15:52,334 --> 00:15:57,171
This is the last time we kiss in a dark and deserted place.

275
00:15:57,171 --> 00:15:58,785
Remember that.

276
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,088
Then where do we kiss?

277
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,215
In a bright and crowded place?

278
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,675
In Myeongdong?

279
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,302
Gangnam Station?

280
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,470
Right in the middle of Gwanghwamun Square?

281
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,517
Or in front of the other guys?

282
00:16:13,517 --> 00:16:15,406
Give them a good show?

283
00:16:21,101 --> 00:16:22,581
I'm sure there's one, at least.

284
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:24,657
There isn't.

285
00:16:26,082 --> 00:16:27,485
There it is.

286
00:16:29,704 --> 00:16:31,346
Should we enlist together?

287
00:16:32,109 --> 00:16:33,534
Enlist together?

288
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,185
What about you?

289
00:16:36,185 --> 00:16:37,902
Did you serve in the military?

290
00:16:37,902 --> 00:16:39,079
I was exempt.

291
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:40,851
Oh, that's right.

292
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,084
Will you wait for me?

293
00:16:44,084 --> 00:16:45,904
That depends on you.

294
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,771
I guess I have to go then.

295
00:16:49,771 --> 00:16:51,581
Of course.

296
00:16:52,569 --> 00:16:54,758
Let's enlist together!

297
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:05,711
I'm happy that I've already done it.

298
00:17:05,711 --> 00:17:07,360
Really?

299
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,077
Yes.

300
00:17:09,077 --> 00:17:11,154
I won't have to leave you.

301
00:17:13,152 --> 00:17:16,699
Have you never thought I might pursue a doctorate?

302
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:18,694
Are you?

303
00:17:19,203 --> 00:17:21,013
I don't know.

304
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,235
But...

305
00:17:23,235 --> 00:17:25,926
professors love me.

306
00:17:27,174 --> 00:17:29,852
It might be my fate.

307
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:33,747
We can still meet even if you do a Ph.D.

308
00:17:33,747 --> 00:17:36,488
But you can't meet when you're in the army.

309
00:17:37,238 --> 00:17:39,451
A Ph.D...

310
00:17:39,451 --> 00:17:41,312
I don't know what to tell you

311
00:17:41,312 --> 00:17:44,195
because I haven't done it yet.

312
00:17:45,092 --> 00:17:46,627
Will you wait for me?

313
00:17:46,627 --> 00:17:48,609
Will you wait for me?

314
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,179
Of course, I will.

315
00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:52,012
What if I go abroad for three months?

316
00:17:52,012 --> 00:17:53,469
I'll go with you.

317
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,572
Won't you get a job?

318
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:01,235
What do you do that allows you to follow me around constantly?

319
00:18:01,235 --> 00:18:03,082
That's scary. Don't say that.

320
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,721
Ju Hyeok...

321
00:18:04,721 --> 00:18:06,735
You'll be in your fourth year soon.

322
00:18:06,735 --> 00:18:08,443
No job?

323
00:18:12,434 --> 00:18:16,736
It's funny that you're worrying about me when you're the one planning to do a Ph.D.

324
00:18:16,736 --> 00:18:21,590
But I can't help but worry.

325
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:52,287
We'll remember this day forever.

326
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,878
Wherever we are.

327
00:18:54,878 --> 00:18:56,905
Whenever it is.

328
00:18:56,905 --> 00:18:58,660
We will.

329
00:18:59,644 --> 00:19:01,822
It feels like a dream.

330
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:05,756
It might be a dream.

331
00:19:05,756 --> 00:19:08,468
Even if it's a dream, I'll take it.

332
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:17,775
Cheers, Guys.

333
00:19:17,775 --> 00:19:19,167
Okay.

334
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:24,390
Cheers.

335
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:49,647
The students who were tardy last week will present their assignments first.

336
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,273
Kim An, Lee Hyeon.

337
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,817
She remembers.

338
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,148
She does.

339
00:19:54,148 --> 00:19:58,530
Could you each display your photo assignment?

340
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,969
Whose picture should we see first?

341
00:20:00,969 --> 00:20:03,175
- Professor.
- Yes?

342
00:20:03,175 --> 00:20:05,380
Ours is in one photo.

343
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,910
Is it?

344
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:09,874
We took it together.

345
00:20:11,462 --> 00:20:14,230
Okay, let's see it

351
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:51,640
♫ That moment when you, whom I have been waiting for, ♫

352
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,370
♫ Appeared before me ♫

353
00:20:55,370 --> 00:21:02,280
♫ When life gives only you light ♫

354
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,700
♫ Be the light by my side. The way you look ♫

355
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,500
♫ Raises me up again ♫

356
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:17,380
♫ It makes my heart feel full, makes my heart flutter ♫

357
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,340
♫ It's you ♫
