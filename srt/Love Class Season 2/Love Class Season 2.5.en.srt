00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:05,023
[Love Class 2]

2
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,620
I'm sorry.

3
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,824
No, no, it's okay.

4
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:16,260
He's my friend, so it's my fault.

5
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,911
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,539
No.

7
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:22,960
I've learned a lot from this.

8
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,000
What?

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,377
I'll just

10
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,946
go home and rest.

11
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:34,399
I'll be splitting my shifts with the other part-timers for a while.

12
00:01:36,052 --> 00:01:38,555
It's also comfortable for me to stay at home

13
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:45,216
Nobody was available this afternoon, so I asked my friends to come and help out.

14
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:05,380
I'm making you look like a good basketball player.

15
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,727
Let's go.

16
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:08,800
Did you see that?

17
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,388
What? I didn't see it.

18
00:02:10,388 --> 00:02:12,850
Do it again. I didn't get it on camera.

19
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,173
Keep your camera on the ball.

20
00:02:17,784 --> 00:02:19,665
Failed.

21
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:43,131
What was Hyeon doing?

22
00:02:43,131 --> 00:02:45,248
He was drawing.

23
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:48,331
I filmed him because I thought his eyes were striking.

24
00:02:48,331 --> 00:02:50,265
What was he drawing?

25
00:02:51,366 --> 00:02:53,154
Me...

26
00:02:59,425 --> 00:03:02,675
Good work on your assignments.

27
00:03:02,675 --> 00:03:07,026
Is it bringing you and your partner closer?

28
00:03:07,026 --> 00:03:08,589
Yes.

29
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:12,033
I hope it was a new experience to watch someone

30
00:03:12,033 --> 00:03:14,605
being absorbed in something they enjoy.

31
00:03:14,605 --> 00:03:17,702
Here's your next assignment.

32
00:03:17,702 --> 00:03:21,969
Your next assignment is to meet with your partner's friends.

33
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:25,236
Meet and talk to the people who have shared

34
00:03:25,236 --> 00:03:27,222
your partner's history.

35
00:03:27,222 --> 00:03:33,274
Write about the things you saw, heard, and felt in an essay.

36
00:03:33,274 --> 00:03:34,957
Oh...

37
00:03:34,957 --> 00:03:38,008
Think of it as a journal.

38
00:03:40,128 --> 00:03:41,946
Wow.

39
00:03:41,946 --> 00:03:43,021
What?

40
00:03:43,021 --> 00:03:45,058
Did you like my eyes?

41
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,085
I said "striking."

42
00:03:47,085 --> 00:03:48,648
It's the same thing.

43
00:03:49,456 --> 00:03:50,807
When should we do the assignment?

44
00:03:50,807 --> 00:03:52,655
I'll gather my friends.

45
00:03:52,655 --> 00:03:54,131
When are you free?

46
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:55,318
I'm not doing this assignment.

47
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,162
Why not?

48
00:03:57,162 --> 00:03:58,782
Why?

49
00:03:58,782 --> 00:04:00,338
No reason.

50
00:04:00,338 --> 00:04:02,639
My friends want to see you.

51
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:04,479
I said I'm not doing it.

52
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:11,179
I don't have any friends suitable for this assignment.

53
00:04:11,179 --> 00:04:12,334
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:15,353
Maybe not very close ones,

55
00:04:15,353 --> 00:04:16,740
but you still have friends, right?

56
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,505
I really don't.

57
00:04:18,505 --> 00:04:20,169
I saw a friend of yours the other day.

58
00:04:20,169 --> 00:04:21,640
What?

59
00:04:24,505 --> 00:04:26,060
Nothing.

60
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,768
Whom?

61
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:31,104
I don't know his name. It was brief.

62
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,923
Where?

63
00:04:32,923 --> 00:04:34,024
On campus.

64
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,877
What did he say to you?

65
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,456
Well...

66
00:04:38,456 --> 00:04:40,505
What does he look like?

67
00:04:40,505 --> 00:04:42,441
Just normal.

68
00:04:42,441 --> 00:04:46,976
Don't talk to strangers.

69
00:04:46,976 --> 00:04:48,246
I'm not a child.

70
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,020
Got it?

71
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,306
Yes.

72
00:04:53,845 --> 00:04:56,023
Let's eat together.

73
00:04:57,521 --> 00:04:58,750
I'm hungry.

74
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,959
I'm really hungry.

75
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:02,735
I think we should go.

76
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,693
Rooftop, rooftop.

77
00:05:11,693 --> 00:05:15,003
He's Kim An, the rooftop guy.

78
00:05:18,607 --> 00:05:20,139
That's him.

79
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:21,505
Rooftop.

80
00:05:21,505 --> 00:05:23,588
I lost my appetite.

81
00:05:27,806 --> 00:05:30,012
Do you still not eat cucumbers?

82
00:05:30,012 --> 00:05:32,158
They don't taste good.

83
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:36,370
Do you still remember that?

84
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,505
Wow.

85
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:39,877
You haven't forgotten a single thing about me.

86
00:05:39,877 --> 00:05:41,226
Be honest.

87
00:05:41,226 --> 00:05:43,816
Did you think about me a lot when you couldn't see me?

88
00:05:44,712 --> 00:05:47,304
Shut up and eat.

89
00:05:47,322 --> 00:05:51,288
I thought about you all the time at first,

90
00:05:51,288 --> 00:05:54,098
and it slowly stopped.

91
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:56,845
But I thought of you once in a while.

92
00:05:56,845 --> 00:05:59,190
When that happened...

93
00:06:00,536 --> 00:06:02,836
When that happened,

94
00:06:03,425 --> 00:06:05,584
it lasted long.

95
00:06:06,424 --> 00:06:08,232
It lasted really long.

96
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:13,099
What's that face?

97
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:14,931
Are you touched?

98
00:06:15,505 --> 00:06:17,584
You look touched.

99
00:06:17,584 --> 00:06:19,664
Are you touched by my profound love?

100
00:06:19,664 --> 00:06:21,474
Be quiet.

101
00:06:23,805 --> 00:06:26,282
But I didn't feel sad

102
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,342
because I knew I would see you again one day.

103
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,424
Who are they?

104
00:06:49,424 --> 00:06:50,945
The manager's friends.

105
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:52,917
Where is the manager?

106
00:06:52,917 --> 00:06:55,124
He's taking a break.

107
00:07:01,301 --> 00:07:04,166
- What's wrong?
- I got something in my eye.

108
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,566
Did you get something in your eye?

109
00:07:05,566 --> 00:07:07,343
Let me see.

110
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:11,505
They must be best friends.

111
00:07:11,505 --> 00:07:13,016
Yes.

112
00:07:17,109 --> 00:07:18,853
I should go.

113
00:07:18,853 --> 00:07:19,749
See you at home.

114
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:21,898
- Okay.
- Thanks for the drink.

115
00:07:27,297 --> 00:07:28,829
Hello, Professor.

116
00:07:28,829 --> 00:07:32,134
Yes, I set up your computer.

117
00:07:32,134 --> 00:07:36,183
You should have everything you need.

118
00:07:36,183 --> 00:07:37,665
Oh, the chair?

119
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,043
The screw at the bottom...

120
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:43,361
No, I'll come in early tomorrow and fix it.

121
00:07:43,361 --> 00:07:45,090
Yes.

122
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,846
Okay, Professor, goodbye.

123
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,924
Are you even fixing his chairs now?

124
00:07:51,924 --> 00:07:54,383
You're spoiling him.

125
00:07:54,383 --> 00:07:57,155
Who caught a cockroach for him?

126
00:07:57,155 --> 00:08:00,429
Oh, that was me.

127
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:05,686
But I have my limits. You don't.

128
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:08,036
- I do.
- I doubt it.

129
00:08:08,036 --> 00:08:10,658
He calls you because you do everything for him.

130
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:12,318
Stop acting nice.

131
00:08:12,318 --> 00:08:13,919
It will just make you get old.

132
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:16,989
I already feel old.

133
00:08:16,989 --> 00:08:19,425
- Exactly.
- What?

134
00:08:19,425 --> 00:08:21,277
Did you just say "exactly"?

135
00:08:22,157 --> 00:08:24,080
You should learn the art of flattery.

136
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,845
Oh, my mouth told the truth again.

137
00:08:26,845 --> 00:08:30,235
Hey, I think I'll get going.

138
00:08:35,866 --> 00:08:38,726
What the hell are you doing?

139
00:08:40,867 --> 00:08:43,639
Hey, listen...

140
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:45,709
What we did yesterday—

141
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:47,128
"We"?

142
00:08:47,128 --> 00:08:49,688
You screwed me over and ran.

143
00:08:49,688 --> 00:08:52,167
- No, that's not what I mean.
- I bet you had a blast.

144
00:09:04,274 --> 00:09:06,277
Don't you dare light that cigarette.

145
00:09:06,277 --> 00:09:09,330
Don't you dare throw me in the gutter.

146
00:09:13,106 --> 00:09:14,506
Look.

147
00:09:15,907 --> 00:09:18,174
That's not what I'm doing.

148
00:09:18,174 --> 00:09:22,221
I know we were a bit drunk, but it's not like we didn't agree...

149
00:09:22,221 --> 00:09:24,707
- I know. I had fun, too.
- So did I.

150
00:09:24,707 --> 00:09:26,807
But why did you run away?

151
00:09:26,807 --> 00:09:29,045
You left me in that cold motel room.

152
00:09:29,045 --> 00:09:31,580
It wasn't cold. The heating was on.

153
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:35,934
And it wasn't just a motel room, I booked the premium suite.

154
00:09:35,934 --> 00:09:39,084
Is it okay then to wake up alone in a warm premium suite?

155
00:09:39,084 --> 00:09:40,931
I called you, wondering if you went out for just a second,

156
00:09:40,931 --> 00:09:42,732
but your phone was turned off.

157
00:09:42,732 --> 00:09:44,505
Do you think that was okay?

158
00:09:44,505 --> 00:09:46,100
No...

159
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,237
I mean...

160
00:09:49,663 --> 00:09:51,363
I'm sorry.

161
00:09:52,582 --> 00:09:54,753
I didn't know you would think that way.

162
00:09:54,753 --> 00:09:57,866
What did you think I would think?

163
00:10:02,405 --> 00:10:04,383
Are you really sorry?

164
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:07,663
Really?

165
00:10:07,663 --> 00:10:09,163
Yes.

166
00:10:10,274 --> 00:10:12,603
Then prove it to me...

167
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:29,057
with your body.

168
00:11:16,219 --> 00:11:17,646
Hello?

169
00:11:17,646 --> 00:11:19,412
Where are you?

170
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:22,390
Min Wu, I can't hear you. What did you say?

171
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,017
Never mind.

172
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,652
I'll be home later. Don't stay up waiting for me.

173
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:29,524
Okay, come home safely.

174
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:47,052
I did it without thinking.

175
00:11:47,052 --> 00:11:50,036
You didn't even have the basics.

176
00:11:50,036 --> 00:11:51,787
That's harsh.

177
00:11:51,787 --> 00:11:55,505
I know because I tutored you.

178
00:11:55,505 --> 00:11:59,417
You didn't know everything about me.

179
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:04,028
I believe I knew everything grade-wise.

180
00:12:04,028 --> 00:12:06,676
You barely know me.

181
00:12:07,313 --> 00:12:09,787
You'll be surprised.

182
00:12:10,505 --> 00:12:12,765
I doubt it.

183
00:12:15,128 --> 00:12:16,885
By the way, where are you going?

184
00:12:18,021 --> 00:12:20,042
Wherever you're going.

185
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:22,986
Did you just follow me here?

186
00:12:22,986 --> 00:12:25,100
Yes, why not?

187
00:12:26,406 --> 00:12:29,420
Behind this tunnel is where I live.

188
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,295
Oh, really?

189
00:12:32,115 --> 00:12:34,304
Did you bring me to your place?

190
00:12:34,304 --> 00:12:39,312
You were following me, but I didn't have anywhere else to go.

191
00:12:39,312 --> 00:12:41,586
I'll walk you home every day.

192
00:12:41,586 --> 00:12:43,134
That's not why I brought you here.

193
00:12:43,134 --> 00:12:45,031
I can do it.

194
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,007
The lights went out.

195
00:12:51,007 --> 00:12:52,674
It happens sometimes.

196
00:12:53,895 --> 00:12:56,054
Do you have work gloves?

197
00:12:56,054 --> 00:12:57,923
Work gloves?

198
00:12:57,923 --> 00:12:59,781
I'm going to fix them.

199
00:12:59,781 --> 00:13:02,364
You'll get an electric shock.

200
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,300
Are you worried about me?

201
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:11,136
Hyeong.

202
00:13:11,136 --> 00:13:12,396
Stop.

203
00:13:12,396 --> 00:13:13,975
What?

204
00:13:15,054 --> 00:13:16,110
Don't come closer.

205
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:21,870
♫ Would you please show me only good things? ♫

206
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:28,020
♫ Whenever, forever, breathe beneath me ♫

207
00:13:31,295 --> 00:13:32,895
No.
♫ I want to go up with you to the highest point ♫

208
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:40,280
♫ Into a world just for you ♫

209
00:13:43,947 --> 00:13:45,421
Let's go.

210
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:58,811
I came all this way, can I at least get a glass of water?

211
00:13:58,811 --> 00:14:00,331
Just go.

212
00:14:01,366 --> 00:14:02,800
Go inside first.

213
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,934
I'll leave once you get in.

214
00:14:04,934 --> 00:14:07,221
I'll go inside once you leave.

215
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,771
No, you go in first.

216
00:14:09,771 --> 00:14:11,471
Fine.

217
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:14,479
See you.

218
00:14:29,485 --> 00:14:31,058
Come in.

219
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,401
You didn't change the lock combination.

220
00:14:48,228 --> 00:14:49,988
Were you waiting for me?

221
00:14:51,008 --> 00:14:52,700
What are you doing?

222
00:14:57,058 --> 00:14:58,899
Come on.

223
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:01,056
Where's my welcome?

224
00:15:03,342 --> 00:15:04,898
Get out.

225
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,092
I have nowhere to go.

226
00:15:09,907 --> 00:15:12,553
You shouldn't be here, Hyeong.

227
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:17,534
Why not?

228
00:15:18,867 --> 00:15:20,692
You know why.

229
00:15:20,692 --> 00:15:23,804
Where else can we go if not to each other?

230
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,732
You know that.

231
00:15:48,135 --> 00:15:49,577
You're still awake.

232
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,374
This is a rare sight, Oh Min Wu drinking?

233
00:15:54,374 --> 00:15:55,961
Is everything okay?

234
00:15:58,489 --> 00:15:59,861
Hey.

235
00:15:59,861 --> 00:16:02,695
If you can drink this well, why don't you drink with us?

236
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,705
It's always me who gets drunk.

237
00:16:04,705 --> 00:16:06,211
I just...

238
00:16:06,211 --> 00:16:09,685
I'm worried I'll say things when I'm drunk.

239
00:16:09,685 --> 00:16:13,303
Do you have big secrets?

240
00:16:13,303 --> 00:16:19,048
Like the PIN for the bank account with your family's fortune?

241
00:16:19,048 --> 00:16:21,615
You don't need to know.

242
00:16:21,615 --> 00:16:23,211
Sure.

243
00:16:23,211 --> 00:16:26,201
We know too much about each other.

244
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,378
I kind of want to clean everything up,

245
00:16:34,378 --> 00:16:36,274
but it's too late, isn't it?

246
00:16:37,401 --> 00:16:38,940
Hey.

247
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,590
For now, let's go to bed together and leave that for tomorrow.

248
00:16:47,419 --> 00:16:48,816
Sure.

249
00:16:52,802 --> 00:16:54,526
Sure.

250
00:16:55,466 --> 00:16:58,292
If friends sleep together and stuff,

251
00:16:58,883 --> 00:17:00,937
I can do that, too.

252
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,848
Let's sleep together.

253
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:05,280
You go ahead.

254
00:17:25,998 --> 00:17:28,262
Hey, what are you doing?

255
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:38,895
Hey.

256
00:17:38,895 --> 00:17:40,978
My hair is still wet.

257
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:42,861
Can I just dry my hair?

258
00:17:48,451 --> 00:17:50,451
What's going on?

259
00:17:58,204 --> 00:18:01,155
You're acting weird.

260
00:18:11,331 --> 00:18:12,640
Are you okay?

261
00:18:13,618 --> 00:18:16,269
You were acting strange like this last time too.

262
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:18,770
When?

263
00:18:20,117 --> 00:18:22,391
When I got drunk.

264
00:18:23,153 --> 00:18:25,870
Didn't you pull a prank on me that time?

265
00:18:27,776 --> 00:18:29,598
Like how?

266
00:18:30,578 --> 00:18:33,653
I don't know, it was just a silly prank.

267
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:37,205
You never do anything silly.

268
00:18:37,205 --> 00:18:39,998
But you were acting weird that day.

269
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,341
I think I need some fresh air.

270
00:18:46,341 --> 00:18:48,412
- Right now?
- Yes.

271
00:18:48,412 --> 00:18:50,609
Where are you going? I'll come with you.

272
00:18:50,609 --> 00:18:52,993
No, it's okay.

273
00:18:52,993 --> 00:18:55,189
You're drunk.

274
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,712
No, I'm sober.

275
00:18:58,712 --> 00:19:00,429
Go to sleep.

276
00:19:27,986 --> 00:19:30,787
I told you to stay on the app.

277
00:19:30,787 --> 00:19:36,465
Why did you have to pick the teaching assistant and take the hard way?

278
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,270
Why are you having a go at me? It was your choice.

279
00:19:43,886 --> 00:19:46,394
Aigoo, all right, all right.

280
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:51,107
Stop whining and come up with a plan.

281
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:55,136
Although I'm not sure your plan will work.

282
00:19:55,136 --> 00:19:58,055
I think you've already messed it up.

283
00:20:00,006 --> 00:20:02,438
All right, I'm going to hang up.

284
00:20:03,563 --> 00:20:05,761
It's an emergency.

285
00:20:05,761 --> 00:20:09,871
Something important is about to happen.

286
00:20:26,285 --> 00:20:28,117
I'll pay back the debt.

287
00:20:29,774 --> 00:20:31,323
What debt?

288
00:20:32,055 --> 00:20:35,517
I have some money saved up, so I'll bring it to you tomorrow.

289
00:20:38,915 --> 00:20:41,185
What are you talking about?

290
00:20:41,185 --> 00:20:43,337
Do you think I'm here for money?

291
00:20:44,288 --> 00:20:46,345
Then why are you here?

292
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:49,745
Because I can't live without you.

293
00:20:54,827 --> 00:20:57,021
And I know you can't live without me.

294
00:20:57,732 --> 00:20:59,835
We finished talking about this on the rooftop two years ago.

295
00:20:59,835 --> 00:21:01,670
It never ends when you're family.

296
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:04,662
You're my family,

297
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,535
and I'm your family.

298
00:21:08,264 --> 00:21:10,306
Nothing is over for us, ever.

299
00:21:20,709 --> 00:21:22,036
Where are you going?

300
00:21:23,629 --> 00:21:26,102
I have other places to stay.

301
00:21:27,732 --> 00:21:29,990
Are you going to Hyeon?

302
00:21:36,236 --> 00:21:38,100
He knows everything.

303
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:41,326
Knows what?

304
00:21:42,692 --> 00:21:44,074
You know.

305
00:21:44,907 --> 00:21:46,400
Everything.

306
00:22:01,543 --> 00:22:02,793
Hyeong?

307
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:05,609
Huh? You're still here.

308
00:22:05,609 --> 00:22:08,732
Yes, I was waiting for you to turn off the lights.

309
00:22:08,732 --> 00:22:10,549
What?

310
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:12,811
I could have stayed up all night.

311
00:22:12,811 --> 00:22:14,978
Then I would have been here all night.

312
00:22:14,978 --> 00:22:18,243
Stop being so reckless.

313
00:22:18,243 --> 00:22:20,740
Did you come back out to scold me?

314
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,569
Where are you going?

315
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:29,966
Can I sleep over at your place?

316
00:22:29,966 --> 00:22:35,603
[Love Class 2]

317
00:23:03,394 --> 00:23:06,084
I should go.

318
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:07,914
It's late.

319
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:54,310
♫ That moment when you, whom I have been waiting for, ♫

320
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:58,150
♫ Appeared before me ♫

321
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:04,940
♫ When life gives only you light ♫

322
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:09,460
♫ Be the light by my side. The way you look ♫

323
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:13,260
♫ Raises me up again ♫

324
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:20,110
♫ It makes my heart feel full, makes my heart flutter ♫

325
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:22,150
♫ It's you ♫
