It's a festival of foreign origins.

22
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,000
Pretty much the same as our Double Seventh Festival,

These flowers are called Blue Succubus.

168
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,240
Who is it?

169
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,680
How am I supposed to know?

170
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,680
It's you, right?

171
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,800
What are you talking about?

172
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,160
You wanted to give this to some guy

173
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,280
but you feared my parents might find out,

174
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,600
so you slipped it into my schoolbag.

175
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,080
I can never bring myself to buy such pricey chocolate.

176
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,200
Impressive, Tan Xin.

177
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,040
You've never even

178
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,440
received a love letter,

179
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,120
and yet the first chocolate you got is so expensive.

180
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,080
Stop staring at it. Let's just go.

181
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,080
You know what?

182
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,120
The one who gave you this chocolate

183
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,560
definitely lives on Xiaoji Street.

184
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,120
Think about it. Who might it be?

185
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,160
Maybe it's Lee from the tofu store

186
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,480
who's repeated his senior year three times.

187
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,080
That's absolutely impossible.

188
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,680
I haven't seen him for days.

189
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,400
Tan Xin!

190
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,680
The greatest favor requires no gratitude.

191
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,080
Just remember to buy me a soda.

192
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,160
See you.

193
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,600
Do you think it's Chen Cheng?

194
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,120
It can't be.

195
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,520
Would you like to ask him?

196
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,640
I'll ask him for you.

197
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,920
Don't do that!

198
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,600
Zhou Lizi!

199
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,920
You guys are all going without me?

200
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,400
Wait up!

201
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,520
Hurry.

202
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,560
Remember to come down and play basketball later.

203
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,400
Alright!

204
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,520
Okay, see you around.

205
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,320
Don't leave too early after class.

206
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,840
Tan Xin.

207
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,240
Listen to me.

208
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,440
It's got to be Chen Cheng who sent you that chocolate.

209
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,000
I mean, why else was he so kind as to finish your assignment for you?

210
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,560
And he's always been a cheapskate.

211
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,400
How about... we just forget this whole thing?

212
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,640
How can you do that?

213
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,120
You don't want to know who gave you the chocolate?

214
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,320
Yes.

215
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,760
And no.

216
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,320
If it's really Chen Cheng or Lee,

217
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:12,880
what would I do?

218
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,480
That's all the more reason to find out.

219
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,760
Since you accepted his chocolate,

220
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,000
you need to take responsibility for what you did to him.

221
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,120
Heck no!

222
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,640
I must return it.

223
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,320
Which is why...

224
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,720
you've got to figure out

225
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,680
who sent you

226
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,760
such expensive chocolate.

227
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,720
This is a very serious matter.

228
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,480
We can't jump to conclusions.

229
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,560
Right now, what we're sure of is that...

230
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,720
the crime scene

231
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,480
is No. 39, Xiaoji Street,

232
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,720
in Guo Fucheng's home.

233
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,360
To be more precise,

234
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,680
it's their living room.

235
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,440
[The living room]
Only four people

236
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,640
[The living room]
had access to my schoolbag.

237
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,760
Chen Cheng.

238
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,400
Gao Zhiyuan.

239
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,720
Guo Fucheng.

240
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,760
And the last one?

241
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,240
Are you sure you're not kidding me?

242
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,600
I had a hard job finishing my assignment.

243
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,680
I don't have time for kidding you.

244
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,240
Alright then.

245
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,640
Let's analyze this.

246
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,560
No drinks. Write your assignment.

247
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,840
Stop eating. Hurry up with your assignment.

248
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,200
You guys need to stop sitting in a daze.

249
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,360
Or I'll go home as well.

250
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,280
Gao Zhiyuan.

251
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,960
Taking advantage of his good grades,

252
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,800
he enjoys lecturing people even more than my dad does.

253
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,680
And he has an old school mindset.

254
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,960
I think he doesn't even know

255
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,160
what Valentine's Day is, let alone sending girls chocolate.

256
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,360
He's clear of suspicion as well.

257
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,240
I think Chen Cheng is the prime suspect.

258
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,480
If you two help us out,

259
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,040
I'll buy you soda for a full week.

260
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,040
Cut the crap.

261
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,800
I won't do it even if you buy me soda for the whole semester.

262
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,760
I'll give you two all the chocolate

263
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,520
I receieve tomorrow.

264
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,480
Last year I received double what you received.

265
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,640
If you help us out of this,

266
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,480
I, Tan Xin, will be

267
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,440
at your command for the rest of my life.

268
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,200
At whose command?

269
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,320
Chen Cheng's always been sharp-tongued.

270
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,520
He not only didn't scold you,

271
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,680
but also showed much concern for you.

272
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,120
Besides, his schoolbag

273
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,320
was right above yours.

274
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,200
He had a big motive.

275
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,400
I'll take this home and finish it.

276
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,440
This is the best I can do.

277
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,600
Most crucial of all,

278
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,160
he actually finished your assignment for you.

279
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,640
Only a moment ago you were saying it was Lee.

280
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,920
That was me kidding you.

281
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,360
Enough! Enough! Cut it out!

282
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,440
Clear the trash off the floor right away!

283
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,480
Otherwise Yang will beat us!

284
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,120
Time for class. Time for class.

285
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,240
Collect your thoughts, guys.

286
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,360
Let me see. Who's still immersed in the festive vibes?

287
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,000
Class begins! Stand up!

288
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,400
Good morning, Mr. Yang!

289
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,800
Good morning, class. Sit down, please.

290
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,840
Guys, let's take a look at this problem.

291
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,080
This problem

292
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,080
was the last major problem

293
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,640
of the 1996 college entrance examination.

294
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,000
It can be put this way.

295
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,920
If you solve this problem,

296
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,840
you'll have no trouble

297
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,400
gaining admission to Tsinghua University or Peking University.

298
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,680
Even in Class 1,

299
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,080
few students

300
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,680
had it right,

301
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,600
but a student of our class...

302
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,640
not only did she get it right,

303
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,200
but her method is also very ingenious.

304
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,960
Well, next,

305
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,600
let's have this student

306
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,800
expound to us

307
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,880
her insight into the solution to the problem.

308
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,640
Okay?

309
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,760
Okay!

310
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,720
Tan Xin.

311
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,200
Please step up to the teacher's desk.

312
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,400
Tan Xin,

313
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,640
I've checked your solution to the problem.

314
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,120
It's quite ingenious.

315
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,040
Even I didn't think of this.

316
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,280
Share your insight with your classmates.

317
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,400
Was it Chen Cheng?

318
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,920
Mr... Mr. Yang, I don't know how to solve it.

319
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,040
Copy out this test paper fifty times.

320
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,240
I want the copies on my desk before end of school.

321
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,920
You're not to go home until you get it done.

322
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,520
Now go back.

323
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,080
Guys, it's okay if you're unable to solve the problems,

324
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,160
but you must not plagiarize.

325
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,760
It's not only a waste of time

326
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,640
but also self-deception.

327
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,000
What are you looking at?

328
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,600
What's this about?

329
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,960
What the heck? You scared me.

330
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,360
You know very well what this is about.

331
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,040
No. You came to me.

332
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,480
Do you think they'll scrap?

333
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,880
They won't.

334
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,880
Chen Cheng will surely make concessions to Tan Xin.

335
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,880
He's never made any concessions to anybody for his whole life.

336
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,070
You don't understand.

337
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,240
Things are different this time.

338
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,560
The last major problem of that maths test paper?

339
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,040
You deliberately had it right to embarrass me.

340
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:21,110
No.

341
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,760
No. Did... Did me helping you out make me the bad guy?

342
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,000
You call that "helping me out"?

343
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,720
Your teacher, Yang, made a big deal out of nothing!

344
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,560
The last major problem's so simple.

345
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,920
I can think of three ways to solve it with my feet!

346
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,560
Feet?

347
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,520
Say that again!

348
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:38,960
Hold on!

349
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,560
Hold... Hold on!

350
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,720
What the heck are you guys doing?

351
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,440
What are you doing?

352
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,840
I'm sure he did it on purpose.

353
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,560
Even so, you shouldn't have hit him.

354
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,000
What if you really got into a fight?

355
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,080
It was definitely not Chen Cheng.

356
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,800
Tan Xin!

357
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,520
Don't be sad!

358
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,840
Don't cry!

359
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,280
It's just a test paper.

360
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,360
I'll copy it out for you.

361
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,400
Guo Fucheng.

362
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,360
The case is solved.

363
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,440
It's sure as heck Guo Fucheng.

364
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,000
I mean, why else is he copying out the test paper for you?

365
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,240
He's always been such a lazy guy.

366
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,040
Really?

367
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,640
I'll take that.

368
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:43,960
Done.

369
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,280
I'll take that one.

370
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,760
They're buying lunch.

371
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,680
Please hurry up a bit, madam.

372
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,680
Lizi!

373
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,120
Tan Xin! Over here!

374
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,200
Okay. Coming.

375
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,480
Gimme some more of this.

376
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,320
Thanks.

377
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,040
I want them all.

378
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,800
All of them.

379
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,880
All of them. Two chicken drumsticks.

380
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,880
Okay. You got it.

381
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,920
Two. Two... Two of these.

382
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,800
I'll help myself.

383
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,280
What's going on?

384
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,480
What's the matter?

385
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,080
Why do you always have to be such an ingrate?

386
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,920
What did I do? You're not making any sense.

387
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,320
Fifty copies.

388
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,640
Fifty copies.

389
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,160
I nearly broke my hand copying out that thing.

390
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,600
Yang likes to make a mountain out of a molehill. It's just a little thing.

391
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,680
That's not making a mountain out of a molehill.

392
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,560
Yang did that because he had responsibility towards his students.

393
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,520
Right?

394
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,080
If so, why are you being so talky?

395
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,640
Well, I'm okay with it.

396
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,120
It's just Tan Xin suffered a lot.

397
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,320
Since when do you care so much about Tan Xin?

398
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,680
Tell me about it. He definitely harbors evil intentions.

399
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,200
Cut the crap.

400
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,800
Everybody knows Tan Xin and I

401
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,400
are the closest friends on Xiaoji Street.

402
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,040
Tan Xin,

403
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,840
have a chicken drumstick.

404
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,480
I'll pass on that.

405
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,560
I usually eat little.

406
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,440
Tan Xin, this is for you.

407
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,600
Take it. Take it.

408
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,320
What are you looking at?

409
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,520
Tan Xin,

410
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,720
The girl wearing a high-necked sweater over there...

411
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,800
You know her, right?

412
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,440
Stop pretending.

413
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,080
I saw you two hanging out together the other day.

414
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,760
Well, this is embarrassing.

415
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,760
You know, today is that festival,

416
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,120
and I swung a piece of chocolate.

417
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,720
I need you to deliver it to her for me.

418
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,040
Dig in. Dig in. Dig in.

419
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,800
There must be something wrong.

420
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,720
Well, forget it.

421
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,200
You receieved so much chocolate,

422
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,680
but you don't know all the senders.

423
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,760
That's different.

424
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,320
Receiving so much has desensitized me,

425
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,680
but for you, this is the only time.

426
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,600
Besides,

427
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,960
that box of chocolate of yours

428
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,560
is worth more than all of mine combined.

429
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,560
Are you really not curious about who the sender is?

430
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,360
I should copy out the test paper first.

431
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,320
Yang will definitely keep me here unless I get it done.

432
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,280
Gimme a couple of sheets. I'll share your burden.

433
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,720
Thanks.

434
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,080
Fifty cents each.

435
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,800
Tan Xin, Tan Xin, you've got a visitor.

436
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,520
Zhiyuan and I made these copies.

437
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,680
You guys...

438
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,040
Take them.

439
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,880
Although this doesn't concern me,

440
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,400
it was my excessive excellence

441
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,960
that caused you to be punished.

442
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,720
As a friend,

443
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,720
I think I've done my part properly.

444
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:38,880
That's it.

445
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,800
Thanks.

446
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,400
What did Chen Cheng say?

447
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,040
Now I can go home after school.

448
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,880
My goodness! He wrote these?

449
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,440
What did he say?

450
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,400
He said he was the reason I got punished,

451
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,480
so he gave me a hand.

452
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,960
I can assure you

453
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,720
that box of chocolate

454
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,160
was from Chen Cheng.

455
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,560
He has feelings for you!

456
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,280
Are you stupid? He's made it so obvious!

457
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:21,960
What are you going to do?

458
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,080
Are you going to try puppy love with him?

459
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,240
How's that possible?

460
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,600
What... What is possible?

461
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,760
What is impossible?

462
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,080
I need to focus on my studies.

463
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,840
Besides, Chen Cheng having feelings for me

464
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,520
doesn't mean I feel the same way about him.

465
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,600
Then you're toast.

466
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,000
I mean, he's gone so far.

467
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,320
It's no different from a profession of love,

468
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,600
and you two

469
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,280
will see a lot of each other.

470
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,440
No.

471
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,080
I need to make it clear to him.

472
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,680
I can't let him distract me from my studies.

473
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,680
Where are you going?

474
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,280
Being frivolous on the first day of a new semester, aren't you?

475
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,720
The college entrance examination is only 100-odd days away!

476
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,720
Do you know that?

477
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,840
Even recess time should be spent on review.

478
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,480
Unbelievable!

479
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,280
Tan Xin, are you crazy?

480
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,240
This chocolate...

481
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:32,840
Yes!

482
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,760
Chen Cheng,

483
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,720
I know you're kind, handsome,

484
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,880
and also have good grades,

485
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,920
and you're Chen's little brother, and I like her.

486
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,680
Seriously, take this chocolate.

487
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,760
It's not mine. You...

488
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,520
Take it!

489
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,280
Before our classmates see it!

490
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,400
See it? It surprises me you care about that!

491
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,000
Take it!

492
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,480
No!

493
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,560
The college entrance examination is nearing!

494
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,280
This is unbelievable.

495
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
What do you think you're doing?

496
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,280
Go!

497
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,960
The college entrance examination is only 100-odd days away.

498
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,680
Instead of working hard, you two...

499
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,760
How did they end up in the Teaching Affairs Office?

500
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,240
Mind-boggling news:

501
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,800
Tan Xin has feelings for Chen Cheng.

502
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,840
She got caught by the director

503
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,840
when giving him a box of chocolate.

504
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,360
Cut the crap.

505
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,560
That chocolate was a gift for Tan Xin from Chen Cheng.

506
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,800
Tan Xin was trying to return it to him,

507
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,400
but the director misunderstood.

508
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,080
I heard you even had someone write your winter-vacation assignment.

509
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,640
Was it you who wrote it for her?

510
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,360
No, Mr. Liang.

511
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,840
I, uh, I just felt that as fellow students,

512
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,560
we should help each other and make progress together.

513
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,160
That... That's...

514
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:44,800
Enough. Enough. Enough.

515
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,560
My intention.

516
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,200
I've heard it.

517
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,240
Your solution to that problem is very methodical.

518
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,360
But you must not slack.

519
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,520
You must keep it up!

520
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,840
I will. Thank you, Mr. Liang.

521
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,360
Tomorrow...

522
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,680
I need you two to bring your parents to school.

523
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:07,680
This issue

524
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,240
must be taken seriously by your parents.

525
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,760
Mr. Liang,

526
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,680
my... my parents have to come as well?

527
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,760
I'm trying to be responsible for you here.

528
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,840
Teachers

529
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,200
are happy to see overachievers

530
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,280
helping underachievers out,

531
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,760
but you two...

532
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:23,760
Mr. Liang,

533
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,880
the chocolate really is not mine.

534
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,760
Well, this is interesting.

535
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,880
Whose is it?

536
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,640
It... It was him who gave it to me.

537
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,240
He slipped it into my schoolbag.

538
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,600
I wanted to return it to him, and then he just...

539
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,760
Is... Is that true?

540
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,440
She... She's making a false accusation!

541
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,640
I... I never even

542
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,800
touched that chocolate!

543
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,600
Making a mistake is not unforgivable.

544
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,000
You need to bravely face it and rectify it,

545
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,880
but if you shift the responsibility like this

546
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,800
and pin the blame on a fellow student,

547
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,800
then the nature of this issue becomes different. It becomes more serious.

548
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,480
Mr. Liang, I'm not lying.

549
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,040
Then whose is it exactly?

550
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,000
Surely it's not mine?

551
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,320
I

552
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,640
It's mine.

553
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,600
I gave Tan Xin that chocolate.

554
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:34,760
Listen to me,

555
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,360
neither of the kids is coming back for dinner today,

556
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,440
so we may make do with this.

557
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,280
You fill our bowls with rice. I'll go and heat up the dishes.

558
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,820
[Neck protection and the prevention]

559
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,840
Here. It's ready.

560
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,840
Honey,

561
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,240
happy Valentine's Day!

562
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,640
You... You made this with your hands?

563
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,240
It's so disgusting!

564
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,560
There's no way I'm eating this!

565
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,040
Hold on. Hold on.

566
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,320
Hold on. Wait a moment. Wait a moment.

567
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,520
Waiter!

568
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,120
How long till you serve our courses?

569
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,640
We've waited ages!

570
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,280
Drinking on an empty stomach is bad for stomach health.

571
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

572
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,320
You're a head nurse.

573
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,200
How could you not have such commen sense?

574
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,320
[Must be kept secret]

575
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,040
Chen Cheng,

576
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,720
let me ask you something.

577
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,600
Was that chocolate really not yours?

578
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,320
A real man owns up to his actions.

579
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,880
If it were mine, I would've admitted.

580
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,240
It really wasn't me.

581
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,360
And it wasn't you either?

582
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,320
Then why did you say it was you?

583
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,440
Tan Xin is a girl.

584
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,240
I couldn't very well let her take the fall, could I?

585
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,000
Then who's the sender?

586
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,080
I can't think of anybody else.
