I'm reading books.

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,280
Don't worry.

24
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,560
I've cleaned the house.

25
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,600
It's very clean.

26
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,800
I've cleaned the windows.

27
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,600
OK.

28
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,880
Take care.

29
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,080
Dad, I have to go.

00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,880

Bye!

When I was a child,

34
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,520
the Chinese New Year was a grand festival.

35
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,440
We ate delicious food and wore new clothes.

36
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,400
That happiness was pure.

37
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,520
After we grow up,

38
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,360
the Chinese New Year is a time for family reunion.

39
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,400
Everyone is looking forward to reunion with family.

40
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,760
Lizi and Guo Fucheng were the first

41
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,720
to feel it.

42
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,080
My aunt who is far away in a foreign country

43

and Uncle Guo who is driving around

44
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,080
are coming home for the New Year.

some fried dough twists later.

I almost missed you.

59
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,680
Has your dad called?

60
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,560
He has just called, saying that the road situation was bad

61
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,400
and he was late.

62
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,120
Yes.

63
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,080
It's snowing over there, just like here.

64
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,880
Will you come to my house for dinner today?

65
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,640
I've fried some meatballs.

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,680
Meatballs?

67
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,160
Yes.

68
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,760
I love the meatballs you made.

69
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,200
It's so cold today.

70
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:47,920
It's fine.

71
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,480
Let's go.

72
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,640
I'll take this piece.

73
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,280
This piece is good.

74
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,040
They're all good.

75
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,240
Wenying, you want some meat?

76
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,440
Are you going to work?

77

Go ahead.

82
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm leaving.

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,160
Cut it thinner.

84
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,560
Why do you want so much meat?

85
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,480
That'll do.

86
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,840
Your sister-in-law is coming back for the New Year?

87
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,880
You're right.

88
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,160
She's devoted to her career.

89
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,560
She hasn't come back for many years.

90
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,400
I asked him to take his lunch box with him,

91
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,560
but he still forgot it.

92
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,640
Tan Xin, Tan Xin!

93
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,160
Get up!

94
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,080
Your dad forgot his lunch box.

95
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,680
Go and deliver it.

96
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,520
Get up!

97
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,280
You go to bed late and get up late every day.

98
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,160
Get up! Do you hear me?

99
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,080
Get up!

100
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,640
Get up! Hurry!

101
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,360
Hurry up!

102
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,760
Don't move slowly.

103
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,240
My dad said he was delayed by the snow

104
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,840
and he'll be back soon.

105
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,480
Aunt,

106
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,320
your cooking is so delicious.

107
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,960
I will come to your house for breakfast every day from now on.

108
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,280
Then be my guest.

109
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,520
Eat it all.

110
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,800
Slow down.

111
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,840
Don't get choked.

112
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,240
Now many places in the north

113
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,400
are blocked by heavy snow.

114
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,800
Your dad should drive carefully.

115
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,000
Aunt, don't worry.

116
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,440
My dad has been driving for more than ten years

117
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,920
and he has never had any accidents.

118
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,240
He still wants to bring food for everyone.

119
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,760
Yes.

120
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,320
Your dad is always thinking about us.

121
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,160
Fucheng,

122
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,280
if your dad can't come back on the Chinese New Year's Eve,

123
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,360
come to my house

124
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,520
and I'll cook

125
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,400
some dishes you like.

126
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,760
Thank you.

127
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,560
But my dad will definitely be back tomorrow morning.

128
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,160
He came back at this time last year.

129
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,160
Eat slowly and don't get choked.

130
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,400
Come and have some porridge.

131
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,360
Dad!

132
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,040
It's snowing heavily.

133
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,560
Dad!

134
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,040
You came here to bring me the food.

135
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,520
Here.

136
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,640
Tip me!

137
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,560
You want me to tip you for the food?

138
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,600
Are you blackmailing me?

139
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,240
Don't say that.

140
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:24,960
See?

141
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,280
What an actress!

142
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,560
It's windy and snowing.

143
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,760
Just tip me a little bit.

144
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,040
Your mother must have given you money.

145
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,240
You want more?

146
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,360
You know how stingy

147
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,280
she is.

148
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:39,800
Here.

149
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,000
I want the big one.

150
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,800
Thanks.

151
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,120
OK, I'm leaving.

152
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,240
Go home quickly.

153
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:51,880
Dad.

154
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's snowing and the road is slippery.

155
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,560
OK.

156
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,440
Why does my mom like this?

157
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,360
You know,

158
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,960
when we were young, we all loved to eat it.

159
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,680
It smells bad,

160
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,920
but it tastes great.

161
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,640
I won't eat it.

162
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,720
You're back.

163
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,680
Mom.

164
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,200
Is our sewer pipe blocked?

165
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,640
Don't talk nonsense.

166
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,600
I'm making dumplings for your aunt.

167
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,440
It's the fennel and chives again!

168
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,560
Go wash your hands and help me.

169
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,320
Lizi

170
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,800
has been helping me this morning.

171
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,120
I don't believe it.

172
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,960
She was asleep when I got up in the morning.

173
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,440
What are you talking about?

174
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,600
I said she is really good.

175
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,520
You go and peel that daikon.

176
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,120
I'll pickle some salted daikon

177
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,440
for your aunt.

178
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,960
Why does she like

179
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,520
those stinky foods?

180
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,120
Don't talk nonsense!

181
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,120
Go.

182
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,520
Is it ready?

183
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,760
I think so, Aunt.

184
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,920
Defend heavily.

185
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,680
Look! Look!

186
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,400
Bravo!

187
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,960
You're watching TV, you little one!

188
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,840
How could you peel it like this?

189
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,760
This is unacceptable!

190
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,240
You just stop.

191
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,030
You're making troubles here.

192
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,910
Lizi, peel it for me.

193
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:40,960
Peel that daikon.

194
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,000
Peel it thinner.

195
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,030
Lizi, come.

196
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,000
It died again.

197
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,000
When will your dad come back?

198
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,840
He'll definitely be home tomorrow.

199
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,160
He won't buy the wrong one, will he?

200
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,720
For all these years,

201
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,840
he has never bought the wrong ones.

202
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,720
Good then.

203
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,040
We'll have a new game to play.

204
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,920
If only my dad could come back today.

205
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,680
I hope

206
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,480
your dad could come back today.

207
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:15,880
Go!

208
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,080
I'll move.

209
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,240
The newspaper says

210
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,800
that our road is closed due to heavy snow

211
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,200
and many cars can't come back.

212
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,080
Where is the road closed?

213
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,760
What's up?

214
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,520
[According to the news from the China Meteorological Administration, heavy snow will fall in most parts of China in the coming week, and the roads will be icy, which will affect road traffic safety.]

215
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,790
[Drivers should pay attention to traffic safety. At 9:40 in the morning, the traffic team issued a road condition information reminder: most areas are snowy, the roads are icy, and the traffic is poor.]

216
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,660
[At present, temporary traffic control has been implemented on some road sections. The traffic team is going all out to clear the road.]

217
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,640
The New Year is coming.

218
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,000
Give me a present.

219
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,520
Do you have no sense of shame?

220
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,360
I know

221
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,920
here is a scarf for my aunt.

222
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,920
But it's been a few years.

223
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,560
It has been three years.

224
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,080
It's out of fashion now.

225
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,040
Scarfs are never out of fashion.

226
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,640
It'll keep her warm.

227
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,280
Sure.

228
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,360
I saved up for a whole semester

229
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,520
for this scarf.

230
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,000
Do you think my mom

231
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,040
would like me in this?

232
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:32,920
Do I look pretty?

233
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,000
Yes.

234
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:35,880
Right?

235
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,320
But

236
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,040
I think my mother would like me in skirts.

237
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,840
How could you wear skirts in the cold winter?

238
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,120
It's cold,

239
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,280
but I can put on the long johns.

240
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,360
That would be quite warm.

241
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,400
But my aunt would be worried about your taste.

242
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,440
My taste?

243
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,360
How dare you say that?

244
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,600
Look what you are wearing!

245
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,080
What do you mean?

246
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,800
You know what?

247
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,600
After Chen is gone, in the whole Xiaoji Street,

248
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,840
I'm the prettiest girl.

249
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,840
Cut it out.

250
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,600
Look at you.

251
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,720
You look exactly like my uncle from behind!

252
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,040
OK, I got it.

253
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:09,920
You're just jealous.

254
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,160
When school starts,

255
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,280
I'll be the prettiest girl in school.

256
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,140
Come on, I'm jealous of you?

257
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,220
Look at you.

258
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,480
Hello?

259
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,240
Chunhua,

260
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,440
why is it you?

261
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,880
Aren't you on the plane?

262
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,320
OK.

263
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,200
OK.

264
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,120
OK.

265
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,360
Fucheng,

266
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,720
I've been busy preparing

267
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,280
the New Year's goods these days.

268
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,680
Let's have noodles tonight.

269
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,520
It's simple and easy to cook.

270
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,680
It's fine.

271
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,880
I love the noodles you cook.

272
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,280
I don't want anything else.

273
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,840
You like noodles?

274
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,200
Come to our house to eat every meal.

275
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,080
OK.

276
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,840
Cucumber.

277
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,000
Thank you.

278
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,120
You're welcome.

279
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,920
What is Minghui doing these days?

280
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,520
The business is good

281
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,520
and he's busy with it.

282
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,640
He doesn't sell anything

283
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,720
every day

284
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,840
and you call it a good business?

285
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,800
That's nonsense!

286
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,200
Let's eat.

287
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,000
Stop. I don't want it.

288
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,840
I'll have some wine first.

289
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,280
I really regret.

290
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,080
I shouldn't have

291
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,080
let him open that shop.

292
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,120
It's TV time.

293
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,480
Mom, don't change the channel.

294
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,480
Let's see the weather forecast.

295
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,880
Yes, the weather forecast.

296
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,360
Yes, let's see the weather forecast.

297
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,480
When your dad comes back...

298
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,480
Mom,

299
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,200
I'll bring the dinner to my brother.

300
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,040
It's still hot.

301
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,760
Don't tell your dad.

302
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,960
Ask your brother to come back for the New Year's Eve dinner.

303
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,680
Got it?

304
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,840
OK.

305
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,840
Are we going to eat the New Year's Eve dinner early?

306
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,360
Why are there so many dishes?

307
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,400
Enjoy it.

308
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,000
Lizi,

309
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,400
enjoy it.

310
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,600
You like these.

311
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,440
Eat more.

312
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,560
Why didn't my mom call

313
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,600
after getting off the plane?

314
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,880
Let's eat and then talk about it.

315
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,360
Yes.

316
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,040
Come. Let's eat.

317
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,400
Eat it.

318
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,480
Eat more.

319
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,320
Lizi, eat it.

320
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,600
Come, let's eat.

321
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:41,920
Enjoy it.

322
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,920
Uncle, Aunt,

323
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:49,680
is my mom not coming back again?

324
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,000
Here.

325
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,480
Have some drink.

326
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,920
Lizi,

327
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,640
it's not easy for your mom

328
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,400
to be abroad alone

329
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,440
and sometimes,

330
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,840
she can't

331
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,200
decide it on her own.

332
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,200
It's fine.

333
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,400
It has happened before

334
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,160
and I'm used to it.

335
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,880
You've grown up

336
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,560
and you're much more sensible.

337
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,800
Yeah, yeah.

338
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,200
Lizi has grown up.

339
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,840
A few years ago,

340
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,520
when she knew her mother wouldn't come back,

341
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,640
she cried.

342
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,320
Now, in the blink of an eye,

343
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,840
she has grown into a young lady.

344
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,320
Minghui.

345
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,720
Minghui.

346
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,240
What's up?

347
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,320
No customers again?

348
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,360
Mom cooked some noodles

349
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,320
and she asked you

350
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,240
to eat it when it's still hot.

351
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,320
I don't have an appetite. I'll eat later.

352
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,600
OK.

353
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,080
Mom asked me to ask you

354
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,480
what you want to eat tomorrow.

355
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,240
Tomorrow?

356
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,240
Dad didn't say it,

357
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,640
but he wants you to go back home.

358
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,240
Tomorrow is the New Year's Eve.

359
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,360
And family members should be together

360
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,680
to have a good meal.

361
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,160
Aunt will

362
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,600
have this scarf next year.

363
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,240
There's a blizzard.

364
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,640
Snowfall is expected to get heavier

365
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,440
from tonight to tomorrow during the day.

366
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,520
There will be local blizzards

367
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,440
in the area north of the Huaihe River,

368
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,160
and there will be strong winds of scale 5 to 6.

369
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,720
Under the influence of strong winds,

370
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,440
the temperature will also...

371
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,880
Cheng, make it smoother.

372
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,720
Tan Qiang!

373
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,280
Where is he?

374
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,640
Tan Xin!

375
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,560
Go and get your dad back home.

376
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,960
Pass it or not?

377
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,200
What are you waiting for?

378
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,360
It's hard to decide.

379
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:10,840
Hurry up.

380
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,800
Hurry up.

381
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,440
I'll play a pair of 8.

382
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,440
No!

383
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,360
OK?

384
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,400
A pair of J.

385
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,120
A pair of J?

386
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,560
OK, go ahead.

387
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,280
I'll play a pair of K.

388
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,080
Right?

389
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,680
Dad!

390
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,840
Tan Xin is here.

391
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,760
Aunt.

392
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,560
Uncle.

393
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,240
Tan Xin.

394
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,120
Dad, let's go home.

395
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,280
What are you doing here?

396
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,120
My mom asked you to go home and cook.

397
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,680
Tan, go back home now.

398
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,040
Wenying needs your help.

399
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,680
-You tell her. -Whatever.

400
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,560
Tell your mom

401
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,480
that we're all here.

402
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,000
He'll be back in a while.

403
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,600
Yeah.

404
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,400
Here, have some peanuts.

405
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,480
Well...

406
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,640
OK.

407
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,040
I don't want it. You just go home!

408
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,120
No.

409
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:56,920
It's your call.

410
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,440
Go and tell your dad

411
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,760
to cut it out.

412
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,600
Otherwise,

413
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,760
I won't cook the dinner.

414
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,760
No, Mom.

415
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,720
It's the New Year's Eve,

416
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,360
and we have to have the dinner.

417
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,600
Go!

418
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,000
Mom, the phone.

419
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:16,920
Go and answer it.

420
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,360
Hello?

421
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,720
Aunt.

422
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,080
Lizi!

423
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,040
Go and get your dad back home.

424
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,800
Me?

425
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,640
Get him back home!

426
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,040
Go and get him back home!

427
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,440
Go!

428
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,840
Tell him that if he's not coming back home,

429
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,200
he'll be in troubles.

430
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,560
Hurry up.

431
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,040
Chunhua,

432
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,800
yes.

433
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,760
I've cooked a lot of dishes.

434
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,640
Lizi is happy.

435
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,080
Tan Xin.

436
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,000
What are you doing in a hurry?

437
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,480
Why do men and women get married?

438
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,920
Tan Xin, take a look for me.

439
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,280
Is it right?

440
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,800
Pretty good.

441
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,960
More or less right.

442
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,760
More or less right?

443
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,320
You call everything more or less right.

444
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,040
Isn't life like this?

445
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,880
More or less right.

446
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,640
Stop eating.

447
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,200
How many have you eaten?

448
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,640
Won't you eat the New Year's Eve dinner?

449
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,560
Don't mention it.

450
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,680
My mom just made some dumplings.

451
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,120
And it's the fennel and chives dumplings!

452
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,400
The Eve dinner is nowhere to be found yet.

453
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,040
By the way,

454
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,720
have you put up the couplets at home?

455
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,040
My mom said it should be done in the morning.

456
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,280
In a while.

457
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,560
I dare not go home now.

458
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,600
It's the New Year's Eve,

459
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,400
and you dare not go home.

460
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,400
Come on!

461
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,080
Hurry up! I'm going to die!

462
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,600
Has my dad really had an accident?

463
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,640
That's impossible!

464
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,000
You said it yourself

465
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,400
that your dad had been driving for more than ten years

466
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,000
and he has never had an accident before.

467
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,480
He must be safe and sound.

468
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,520
Where is Lizi?

469
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,680
My aunt said she would come back and then she can't,

470
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,640
so she's disappointed at home.

471
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,360
Well,

472
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,920
we have two disappointed pals here.

473
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,920
This is going to be bad.

474
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,520
How about we play Monopoly,

475
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,800
her favorite game

476
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,080
together?

477
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,320
So childish.

478
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,640
I don't want to play it.

479
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,600
I have no time for that.

480
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,080
It's afternoon

481
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,560
and my dad hasn't called yet.

482
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,880
Your dad is driving

483
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,920
and he has no time to call.

484
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,400
But he had got home at this time last year.

485
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,880
What's wrong with him?

486
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,360
It's been several times.

487
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,520
He rushed outside at the sound of a car.

488
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,800
Wasn't he fine yesterday?

489
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,760
He's not home, is he?

490
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,160
How could you step on the food?

491
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,400
You made it stink.

492
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,600
I'll eat it.

493
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:22,600
You...

494
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,640
Go to my house for dinner tonight.

495
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,440
By the way, my mom asked you to come for dinner.

496
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,480
My grandma, too.

497
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,400
Tell me

498
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,520
what you're having for dinner,

499
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,240
and the winner

500
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,640
can have me tonight.

501
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,320
Zhiyuan, you go first.

502
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,040
Braised Carp,

503
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,880
Pickled Cabbage Braised Ribs,

504
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,840
Fried Meatballs and...

505
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,640
That's enough.

506
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,600
And you?

507
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,360
We have

508
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,040
Stewed Ribs with Potatoes and Long Beans.

509
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,040
Good.

510
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,240
Braised Pork,

511
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,760
Braised Pork Balls in Gravy Sauce, Braised Prawns...

512
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,960
Good. That's enough.

513
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,520
My turn now.

514
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,320
You're directly out.

515
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:14,800
I...

516
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,320
Everyone knows that you'll have

517
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,680
fennel and chives dumplings.

518
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,800
Yes.

519
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,280
If only I could go to someone's house for dinner.

520
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,960
You can come to our house for dinner.

521
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,240
No, my mom would beat me.

522
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,440
Think about it.

523
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,160
Zhiyuan,

524
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,600
I'm yours tonight.

525
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,760
We'll have Braised Prawns and Braised Pork Balls in Gravy Sauce.

526
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,480
How could I lose?

527
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,440
Your Braised Prawns are indeed slightly better,

528
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,040
but your grandma is terrible,

529
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,200
so I chose Zhiyuan.

530
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,760
I'll go to your house.

531
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,760
OK, I'll tell my mom about it.

532
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,320
You're right.

533
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,040
Dad,

534
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,680
I'm hungry.

535
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,360
You are?

536
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,520
Then let's eat.

537
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,200
Lizi,

538
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,520
let's eat.

539
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,280
Come. Dinner is ready.

540
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,040
You enjoy it.

541
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:17,960
I'm not hungry.

542
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,800
You are not?

543
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,560
Then we can eat later.

544
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,800
We can eat together later

545
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,080
when you're hungry.

546
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,600
What's wrong with you?

547
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,280
Do you think you're the only one who's suffering?

548
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,480
Don't you think Aunt wants to come back?

549
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,080
You have us with you,

550
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,600
but she's all alone far away.

551
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,720
Don't mention the New Year's Eve dinner.

552
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,400
She might not have time to have a proper dinner.

553
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,240
I...

554
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,760
What's wrong with you?

555
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,240
How could you do this?

556
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,280
Just because you're upset,

557
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,760
everyone is upset because of you!

558
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,400
You child,

559
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,360
what are you talking about on the New Year's Eve?

560
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,800
People don't hit their children on the New Year's Eve, do they?

561
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,800
You shut up!

562
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,520
Say it again,

563
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,200
and you won't get any lucky money!

564
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,480
Lizi, come.

565
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,800
Let's have dinner together.

566
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,120
You like these dishes.

567
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,720
Come and sit here.

568
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,960
You're so insensible.

569
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,280
How could you say that to her

570
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,560
on the New Year's Eve?

571
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,160
Go to eat.

572
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,520
Come and eat.

573
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,520
So rude!

574
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,920
OK, I'm insensible.

575
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,920
I'm the bad guy here, OK?

576
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,520
Fucheng,

577
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,720
enjoy it.

578
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,200
Eat whatever you like.

579
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,040
Help yourself.

580
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,240
Aunt Yang Mei, don't mind me.

581
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,320
I'm not hungry at all.

582
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,800
How can you not be hungry?

583
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,040
You ate so little at noon.

584
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,120
Come and have some fish.

585
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:32,960
Eat it.

586
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:36,840
Uncle,

587
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,000
can I have some wine?

588
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,400
I want to have some wine.

589
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,120
You wish.

590
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,560
Behave yourself here.

591
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,000
Come.

592
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,200
Have some Coke instead.

593
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,040
Your dad will be home safe and sound.

594
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,480
Yes, come.

595
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,400
Let's drink together.

596
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,600
Your dad

597
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,720
is honest and careful,

598
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,120
so he'll be safe and sound.

599
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,160
Just be patient.

600
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,240
You can't have wine.

601
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,480
Enjoy the dinner here

602
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,360
and your dad will be home soon.

603
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,480
Thank you.

604
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:14,960
Wait.

605
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,200
Listen!

606
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,920
Is Uncle Guo back?

607
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,120
Let's go and have a look.

608
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:22,920
Let's go.

609
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,960
Let's go and see.

610
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,040
Go and take a look.

611
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,360
It might be your dad.

612
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,040
Forget it. I've taken a hundred looks

613
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,920
and it has never been him.

614
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,320
Uncle Guo is back!

615
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,320
Zhengkuan.

616
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,160
Qiang.

617
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:53,880
You're back!

618
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,840
It was not easy on the road, was it?

619
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,040
It was snowing heavily.

620
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,040
And the road was closed.

621
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,320
But I've brought back

622
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,280
the things you want.

623
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,040
I'm just a little late.

624
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,440
Zhengkuan, don't say that.

625
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,400
Yeah, you don't have to say that.

626
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,000
Dad!

627
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,320
In the sound of firecrackers every year,

628
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,280
we grow up slowly.

629
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,920
We are no longer kids

630
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,960
who cry when sad and laugh when happy.

631
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,080
We feel disappointed for the first time,

632
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,920
we worry about our family members for the first time

633
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,440
and we conceal our sadness for the first time

634
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,000
in order to take care of other people's emotions.

635
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,720
I can see Lizi's disappointment

636
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,080
after my aunt didn't come back as she promised.

637
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,480
But she carefully conceals her sadness,

638
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,640
tries her best to raise the corners of her mouth,

639
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,360
and shares the happiness of our reunion.

640
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,520
You brat,

641
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,240
you've grown taller.

642
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,160
I'll take it for you, Dad.

643
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,560
I eat well every day,

644
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,520
so I've grown taller.

645
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,880
The house is kept clean.

646
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,800
My pals and I study at our house every day.

647
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,040
After finishing my studies, I clean the house.

648
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,080
It's so clean every day.

649
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:01,960
Cut it out.

650
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,080
Don't brag.

651
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,200
Dad, you haven't had dinner yet, have you?

652
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,600
I'll get you a bowl of noodles.

653
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,440
OK.

654
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,960
Why are you here?

655
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:31,960
Waiting for you.

656
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,800
I knew that your family

657
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,000
would send delicious food to Uncle Guo.

658
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,320
I've never seen you so clever.

659
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,480
It smells so good. What is this?

660
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,000
Fried Meatballs.

661
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,280
Eat slowly. It's hot.

662
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,400
By the way,

663
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,680
can I take some for Lizi?

664
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,800
She hasn't had dinner tonight.

665
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,040
OK, that's enough.

666
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,440
That's enough.

667
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,760
Thanks.

668
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,520
Tan Xin!

669
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,040
Happy New Year!

670
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,040
Happy New Year!

671
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,760
Get it ready for grandma.

672
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,840
It's good. Good.

673
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,040
Right? Especially this pattern.

674
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,840
It's coming.

675
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,080
Come.

676
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,040
The soup is here.

677
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:33,920
Sit down.

678
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,160
What were you talking about?

679
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,760
We were talking about mom's clothes.

680
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:37,640
Is it pretty?

681
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,640
Grandma looks nice in that.

682
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,280
Good.

683
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,280
It's good.

684
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,080
Your mother chose it for me.

685
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,280
She did? No wonder.

686
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:44,800
What a good taste!

687
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,640
My mom has a good taste

688
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,560
and my grandma looks great in it.

689
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,440
Am I right, Dad?

690
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,360
What a sweet talker my grandson is!

691
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,920
Later, I'll give you

692
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,200
a big red envelope.

693
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,880
Thank you, Grandma!

694
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,480
Here, Zhiyuan.

695
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,800
Thank you.

696
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,640
Happy New Year!

697
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,360
Minghui.

698
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,480
Dad, I've grown up

699
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,600
and you don't have to give me lucky money anymore.

700
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,080
Even if you've grown up,

701
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,520
you're still my son.

702
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,360
Take it.

703
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,560
Take it since your dad wants you to.

704
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,720
Thank you.

705
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,880
Pay your utility bills

706
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,720
and pay off your debts.

707
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,800
And then do your business well.

708
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,600
Wenying, hurry.

709
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,920
The countdown is on! Hurry.

710
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,480
-Coming! -Come.

711
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,360
-Ten. -Coming.

712
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,040
Nine!

713
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,760
Eight!

714
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,240
Seven!

715
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:04,920
Dad, Mom, I'm back.

716
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,080
-Six! -Come in!

717
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,280
-Five! -I've brought something delicious for you.

718
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,520
Four!

719
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,080
-Three! -I went to get you something delicious.

720
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,240
Two!

721
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,640
One!

722
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,880
Happy New Year!

723
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,240
Come.

724
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,640
Kids, Happy New Year!

725
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,280
What are you eating?

726
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,280
Where did the meatballs come from?

727
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,320
Mom, have some.

728
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,200
Where did you get them?

729
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,240
Gao Zhiyuan gave them to me.

730
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,160
Are they delicious?

731
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:24,760
Yes!

732
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,080
It must be my mom.

733
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,160
Hello, Mom?

734
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,440
Happy New Year!

735
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,640
On the most important day,

736
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,160
we want to be with the most important people.

737
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,040
Even if we're far away from each other,

738
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,280
as long as we make a phone call,

739
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,280
our hearts can be connected together.

740
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,120
With the bell of the new year,

741
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:19,000
we ushered in the 18 years of age we'd yearned for.

742
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,880
♫Give you all♫

743
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,440
