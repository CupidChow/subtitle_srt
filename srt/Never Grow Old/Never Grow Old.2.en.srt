As soon as this video shop opens,

you can listen to any album

he doesn't even have ten yuan with him now.

it's not a problem for my brother.

Bring the box over here.

It's an emergency case. I must go now.

He's been like this since afternoon.

Ma'am, my dad is an amazing doctor.

171
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,520
He can surely cure him.

172
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:38,960
It's fine.

173
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,240
No big deal.

174
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,910
I'll give you a prescription in a while.

175
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,120
Antidiarrheal

176
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,520
and medicine to protect the intestinal mucosa.

177
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,840
He'll be fine after taking medicine.

178
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,920
Huang, let's thank Dr. Tan.

179
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,680
You little bastard!

180
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,000
You really pissed me off!

181
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,680
You think I can't discipline you anymore?

182
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,200
Don't make me mad again!

183
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,440
Hello.

184
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,600
Diarrhea again?

185
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,200
What diarrhea?

186
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,840
Why did you take so long to answer the phone?

187
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,200
Tan, I beat Minghui.

188
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,640
Four years of studying in Beijing has made this kid wild.

189
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,240
After graduation…

190
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,480
What's wrong with Dad?

191
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,160
He got drunk again.

192
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,160
And I took a couple of blows for you just now.

193
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,200
You got beaten?

194
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,960
Of course.

195
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,240
Where did you get beaten?

196
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,320
He spanked me.

197
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,400
What do you mean by "right"?

198
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,800
You told me not to beat kids, didn't you?

199
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,400
Why are you saying this is right now?

200
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,720
What are you talking about?

201
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,920
Tan?

202
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,720
Tan?

203
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,840
Answer the phone.

204
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,800
No, no.

205
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,600
It's either Qiang or Meng who would call me so late.

206
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,040
Let's sleep.

207
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,440
Wouldn't you answer it if it's for you?

208
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,440
No, no!

209
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,360
Yumei! Yumei!

210
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,480
Chen?

211
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,480
It's me, Gao!

212
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,720
Chen Jianguo!

213
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,040
Meng, what's wrong with you?

214
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,640
You always call me in the middle of the night!

215
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,200
Can't you just wait until tomorrow?

216
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,280
I just want to talk…

217
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,080
Hang up on me, huh?

218
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,600
You…

219
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,440
Meng,

220
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,480
my heart just thumps

221
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,840
when I hear the telephone ring.

222
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,280
Just stop calling!

223
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
And don't get drunk anymore!

224
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,280
Hello, I'll sleep right away, Ma'am.

225
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,800
Go to bed right now.

226
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,400
Hey, don't push me.

227
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,200
I haven't changed my shoes yet.

228
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,160
Minghui, go back to your room quickly.

229
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,360
Why are you up so early?

230
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,160
You still want to win the TV?

231
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,600
You just had to mention that, didn't you?

232
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,480
Have you seen Uncle Liu, the postman?

233
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,120
It's too early.

234
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,280
He's still far away from this area.

235
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,200
Tan Xin.

236
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,280
Why are you up so early too?

237
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,280
Put it on.

238
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,040
Minghui.

239
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,480
You have to deliver the goods, right?

240
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,400
Yeah.

241
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,280
And I need you to take care of the shop for me.

242
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,400
I'll be right back.

243
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,080
How's your bottom now?

244
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,040
Dad must have hit you hard.

245
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,280
Uncle Gao spanked you?

246
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,640
Good students like you

247
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,720
also got beaten at home?

248
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,240
It's none of your business.

249
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,320
Uncle Liu!

250
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,640
You got the letters?

251
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,640
There's a letter to you.

252
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,720
See if it's from the girl of the Chen family.

253
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,080
It must be from Chen. Definitely.

254
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,120
Thank you, Uncle Liu!

255
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:05,840
You are welcome.

256
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,920
Here you are!

257
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,660
[To Tan Xin
138 Xiaoji Street, Ningyuan City, Jiangdong Province
Jiangmin Street, Ningjin City]

258
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,280
Tan Xin, how are you doing recently?

259
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,040
Have you been waiting for my letter?

260
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,680
I'm fine.

261
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,400
But I really miss you.

262
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,240
Here, every time I pass by the stall of baked sweet potatoes,

263
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,520
turn on the TV,

264
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,960
or even spit shells of melon seeds,

265
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,240
I always think of you.

266
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,520
On several occasions,

267
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,400
I thought I vaguely heard you

268
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,400
run up the stairs and come to me.

269
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,000
Then I opened the door and remembered

270
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,080
that I was not in Xiaoji Street.

271
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,440
And sometimes, the alarm clock rang in the morning,

272
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,560
and I just wanted to put on my coat

273
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,400
and lift your covers

274
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,200
to see how you dawdle in bed.

275
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,920
And when I calmed down, I realized how funny it was.

276
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,000
So, you see,

277
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,040
I didn't forget you.

278
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,720
I just have to adapt to

279
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,280
the new environment.

280
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,600
By the way, I went to a photo studio

281
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,240
to develop photos that we had taken that day.

282
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,520
I kept a few of them.

283
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,080
The rest were sent to you together with the letter.

284
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,720
Please give them to everyone as a souvenir.

285
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,760
Anyway, I'm fine.

286
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,360
And I wish you all well too.

287
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,640
Don't miss me too much.

288
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,200
Chen Chen.

289
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,120
What are you looking at?

290
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,280
Photos sent by Chen.

291
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,600
Let me see.

292
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:51,920
This one is not bad.

293
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,480
What are you doing?

294
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,920
I haven't seen them all!

295
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,720
Where are you going? Tan Xin!

296
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,560
Can you get it or not?

297
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,040
Take it easy.

298
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,400
Hurry up!

299
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,840
I found it!

300
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,480
Zhiyuan!

301
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,680
Don't say we keep good things to ourselves.

302
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,920
We've been hiding it for a long time.

303
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,920
Hey, guys.

304
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,720
What are you doing here?

305
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,360
Stop yelling at me! You think I want to come here?

306
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,040
Here are the photos for you.

307
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,320
See you later.

308
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,200
Never see you again!

309
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,560
All right?

310
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,600
Zhiyuan.

311
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,480
Minghui!

312
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,040
Give it to me.

313
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,920
What are you doing?

314
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,280
No, nothing.

315
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,080
Nothing.

316
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,440
You guys look weird.

317
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,480
Hello, 407525.

318
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,240
Who left the message?

319
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,440
Okay, thank you.

320
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,680
Minghui, what happened?

321
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,240
Dad asked me to go home for dinner this evening.

322
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,520
I guess I didn't take the two blows

323
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,600
in vain.

324
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,080
What are you two rummaging over there?

325
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,360
Nothing.

326
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,360
Nothing, Minghui.

327
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,720
It's okay. Okay. Okay.

328
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,560
You may do your own work.

329
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,840
Why do you guys look so weird today?

330
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,840
Dad, Minghui and I are back.

331
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,920
Dad.

332
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,080
Seriously,

333
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,200
can't you go back earlier

334
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,000
when I told you to come back for dinner?

335
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,350
They are right on time.

336
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,760
The last dish is just done.

337
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,830
Let's have dinner.

338
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,440
Pour me some liquor.

339
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:19,920
Is this all right?

340
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:20,920
Okay.

341
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,350
Great.

342
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:29,280
This is what a harmonious family should be like.

343
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,160
A great man rarely stoops to pettiness.

344
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,800
And you,

345
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,640
just don't get carried away.

346
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,360
Get yourself ready in two days

347
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,600
and report for duty in the factory.

348
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,280
No, Dad.

349
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,640
Report? What do you mean?

350
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,600
Your work.

351
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,320
I got you the job.

352
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,600
Dad, I mean…

353
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,120
I don't want the job.

354
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,560
You feel embarrassed?

355
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,600
You don't have to.

356
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,680
Your dad

357
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,120
at least has some prestige in the factory.

358
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,520
After you report for duty,

359
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,600
just work hard.

360
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,120
Don't embarrass me and that's enough.

361
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:24,840
No.

362
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,080
Look, Dad,

363
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,640
I've just

364
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,880
rented the shop.

365
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,800
Throw the lease quickly.

366
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,600
Throw it!

367
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,080
Yeah, the rent.

368
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,600
As for the rent,

369
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,240
get the money back

370
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,480
as much as possible.

371
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,240
If you really can't get it back,

372
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,200
just forget it.

373
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,480
No.

374
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,000
Dad,

375
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,440
here's the thing.

376
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,840
I'll definitely

377
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,400
not close my shop.

378
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,280
And I'm opening this weekend.

379
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,160
Who has permitted you to open?

380
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,480
And who has permitted you

381
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,120
to get me the job?

382
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,200
Who are you talking to?

383
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,360
How can you talk to your father like this?

384
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,320
What's the problem?

385
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,400
You show no respect for your father.

386
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,520
Show no respect?

387
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,520
I'm always like this!

388
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,640
Come on, can you stop arguing?

389
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,720
We've just started the meal, and now you are falling out like this.

390
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,280
Minghui, take it easy.

391
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,160
Let's discuss this matter later.

392
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,120
No discussion!

393
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,720
Let me tell you.

394
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,560
No room for discussion on this matter.

395
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,880
That's final!

396
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,160
And let me tell you.

397
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,080
My own business,

398
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,760
my own decision!

399
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,360
Then let me tell you today.

400
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,120
If you don't close the shop,

401
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,680
don't go back home!

402
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,440
You…

403
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,480
How can you say that? You…

404
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,120
You think I can't fix you?

405
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,400
Minghui!

406
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,200
Your dad said that in anger.

407
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,560
Don't listen to him.

408
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,120
Great! Let him go if he wants to.

409
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,360
Stop it!

410
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:01,880
Mom.

411
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,400
Just go!

412
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,360
I'll be in the shop.

413
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,280
It's more convenient there.

414
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,800
It could have been a happy meal,

415
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,440
yet you ruined it.

416
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,600
Can't we eat

417
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,800
without him?

418
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,280
Here, have some meat.

419
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,440
I don't want to eat meat.

420
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,520
Then, eat vegetables.

421
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,840
I'm not a kid anymore.

422
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,240
I will pick whatever I want to eat.

423
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,480
What do you want to do?

424
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,320
What the hell do you want to do?

425
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,000
You have grown up, huh?

426
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,160
And you get bored with this family, right?

427
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,160
You are like your brother.

428
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,720
Just go if you have the ability!

429
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,800
Don't try to persuade me.

430
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,320
It's useless to talk to me.

431
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,440
Go back home quickly.

432
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,600
No, Minghui.

433
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,800
I guess tonight,

434
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,640
I have to sleep here too.

435
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,080
You?

436
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,600
Great. You can sleep here.

437
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:10,720
Minghui!

438
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,160
Where are you going to sleep?

439
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,720
Don't worry about me.

440
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,000
Zhiyuan,

441
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,080
let me ask you a question.

442
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,320
All right.

443
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,080
Do you think

444
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,040
I can open this video shop successfully?

445
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,560
Of course.

446
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,520
But there is a condition.

447
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,000
You need to buy a bed,

448
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,400
because you can't sleep here forever.

449
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:54,840
All right.

450
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,760
Go to work!

451
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:43,920
Dad.

452
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,720
Good morning.

453
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,960
Why?

454
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,640
It's my dad. He doesn't want my brother to open the shop.

455
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,160
No!

456
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,320
I've been looking forward to this video shop for a long time.

457
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,040
Zhiyuan, you and Minghui must hold on.

458
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,000
You must not submit to your father!

459
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,400
You all know

460
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,320
my dad's temper.

461
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,800
Right.

462
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,120
I just get cold feet

463
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,960
at the thought of your father's glare.

464
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,640
Yeah. Every time I cried as a young child,

465
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,960
my dad scared me with your dad.

466
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,560
I'm afraid of your dad, too.

467
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,800
I think Minghui is cool.

468
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,880
I support him mentally.

469
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,440
Me, too.

470
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,480
Tan Xin.

471
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,960
That doesn't sound like you.

472
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,040
Yeah!

473
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,040
Since when have you been so supportive of Minghui?

474
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:57,760
I…

475
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,280
Wenying.

476
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,720
The food is ready. Where are you going?

477
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,560
Gao Meng treats the factory manager to dinner.

478
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,800
I'm also invited.

479
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,480
Why do you join them when he treats his guest?

480
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,000
You don't know, do you?

481
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,520
I saved the factory manager's dog life!

482
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,000
No,

483
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,400
I mean the life of the manager's dog.

484
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,280
You know?

485
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,200
I brought the dying dog back to life.

486
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,840
And the dog is in great shape now.

487
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,640
Otherwise, do you think

488
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,800
anyone can invite such a big shot to dinner?

489
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,920
Fine, fine, you are a big deal, all right?

490
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,840
Gao Meng thinks that

491
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,080
it's almost done with Minghui's job.

492
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,320
So, he wants me

493
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,120
to talk to the manager again

494
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,320
and get things settled, making Minghui his successor.

495
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,280
Come on!

496
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,440
The father and son haven't figured out everything.

497
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,840
Don't make trouble.

498
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,960
Goodbye.

499
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,240
Where are you going?

500
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,240
Mom, it's urgent. I must go!

501
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,840
Where's your brother?

502
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:12,920
My brother?

503
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,600
He hasn't come back yet.

504
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,800
My dad went to your home.

505
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,040
He mentioned some factory manager

506
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,240
who would get your brother a job.

507
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,520
What?

508
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,520
Tan Xin,

509
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,560
I have to go out for a while.

510
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,760
Take care of the shop for me.

511
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,040
Uncle Xu!

512
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,400
Oh, Zhiyuan.

513
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,400
Why are you

514
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,560
standing at the door and not going inside?

515
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,920
I want to talk with you.

516
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,280
What's the matter?

517
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:00,600
Okay.

518
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,040
You know,

519
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,360
my brother is a college graduate.

520
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,440
He learns everything fast.

521
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,760
And he's really smart.

522
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,400
So…

523
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,880
I know what you want to say.

524
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,040
Don't worry.

525
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,400
After going through formalities,

526
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,200
your brother can go to work.

527
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,360
No!

528
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,600
I mean, my brother

529
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,360
is smart indeed,

530
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,520
but his passion never lasts long.

531
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,600
He simply has no sticking power.

532
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,920
And my brother, he…

533
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,080
He's really a sleepyhead.

534
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,360
He often struggles to get out of bed

535
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,440
and wakes up grumpy.

536
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,600
So, he would definitely be late for work.

537
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,040
And everything in my home

538
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,240
touched by my brother

539
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,440
would become completely broken.

540
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,920
I remember that last time,

541
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,080
the fuse blew in our house,

542
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,040
and I asked my brother to fix it.

543
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,640
Then, my brother almost set the house on fire.

544
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,880
So, I was thinking,

545
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,280
if he works in the factory

546
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,920
and breaks the machine,

547
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,120
the loss must be heavy.

548
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,640
So, why don't you think it over?

549
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,400
How's that possible?

550
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,360
That's not what your father told me.

551
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,040
What did my father say?

552
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,080
He said…

553
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,080
Let me put it this way.

554
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,080
In your father's eyes,

555
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,560
you and your brother

556
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,960
make him so proud.

557
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,680
Tan Xin, you're here.

558
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,760
Zhiyuan!

559
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,040
My dad went to your home,

560
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,120
saying that that the factory manager paid a visit.

561
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,920
Zhiyuan went home as soon as he heard this.

562
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,760
Thank you, Tan Xin.

563
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,360
It's fine.

564
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,520
I also like this video shop.

565
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,000
I thought it belonged to Chen Cheng and the others,

566
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,400
so I took it out to have a look.

567
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,320
It's okay.

568
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,200
You may watch whatever you want.

569
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,480
This…

570
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,720
I remember that Chen loved it very much.

571
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,280
She queued for a long time but still failed to buy one.

572
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,000
This…

573
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,480
It was supposed to be a gift to her.

574
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,200
But now, I don't have the chance.

575
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,400
Chen wrote to me some time ago,

576
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,240
saying that she was doing well.

577
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,760
I see.

578
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,880
I have to go now.

579
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,720
Bye, Minghui.

580
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,800
Take care.

581
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,000
What's for dinner tonight?

582
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,640
What do you want to eat?

583
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,640
Whatever you cook.

584
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,280
Then let's just follow the routine.

585
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,840
We don't have vinegar at home.

586
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,320
I will buy some.

587
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,040
Wait a minute.

588
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,640
Now I remember.

589
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,440
There was a sales promotion several days ago.

590
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,720
And I bought a few bottles.

591
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,640
All right. Go buy some salt.

592
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,600
We don't have salt at home.

593
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,160
Just wait here.

594
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,600
Zhiyuan.

595
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,080
Yes?

596
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,720
Can you put the new tapes

597
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,680
at the entrance?

598
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,120
All right.

599
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,240
Sixteen.

600
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,200
Dad.

601
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:10,880
Dad.

602
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,800
I'm going to buy some salt and just pass by here.

603
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,400
Dad, the grocery is at the corner of the block, not here.

604
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,480
It was closed.

605
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,280
Closed at six?

606
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,480
Maybe the shopkeeper had something else to do.

607
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,000
It is not as good as your mom said it was.

608
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,800
What a tiny place!

609
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,560
Where did you get these shelves?

610
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,440
"A Chinese Ghost Story".

611
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,680
No, I mean, isn't it illegal to put this thing here?

612
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,360
Look what they are wearing!

613
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,280
I've also got "The Art of War" here.

614
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,920
And "Travel around Xishuangbanna".

615
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,360
Dad,

616
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:19,960
running this shop

617
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,000
is the happiest thing for me.

618
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,600
Can you leave me alone?

619
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,160
You just like this kind of indecent things.

620
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,200
I mean, Dad,

621
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,320
can you see merit in me?

622
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,240
I can see no merit in these things!

623
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,000
No, I just… You…

624
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,960
It took me a lot of effort to make it.

625
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,520
This is nothing but eye candy,

626
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,480
just like you,

627
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,520
so unreliable!

628
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,520
Dad!

629
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:04,960
Dad!

630
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,360
Dad, wait for me.

631
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,520
My brother had a hard time

632
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,230
renting this shop.

633
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,360
Can you…

634
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,760
I got a job for him and he wouldn't go.

635
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,520
He chose to look for trouble!

636
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,600
My brother only loves this job.

637
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:26,560
We should

638
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,230
try our best to support him.

639
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,600
I knew you would stand by your brother.

640
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,800
Do you think you are helping him?

641
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,320
No, you are doing him harm!

642
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,280
If he falls down again,

643
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,520
can you take the responsibility?

644
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,040
No, I can't.

645
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,560
And neither can you.

646
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,840
Just go home.

647
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:25,760
Okay.

648
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,640
Happy opening, Minghui!

649
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,560
Happy opening!

650
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,640
Good luck with your business!

651
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,040
You guys are so early.

652
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,040
Ma'am!

653
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,880
Great! Great!

654
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,040
Welcome, Ma'am!

655
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,520
Why not find someone to sing and raise the atmosphere?

656
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,080
We don't need singing here!

657
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,880
You'll know in a while.

658
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,760
Then let us raise the atmosphere for you!

659
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,960
Minghui, good luck with your business!

660
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,360
Thank you. Thank you.

661
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,360
Good luck!

662
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,480
Ma'am, Ms. Zhao,

663
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,520
you may look around here.

664
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,600
Just look around.

665
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,440
Yeah, yeah.

666
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,680
Mom!

667
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,000
Why did you get everyone here?

668
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,880
Everyone knows that your new shop opens today.

669
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,160
They said they wanted to come and have a look.

670
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,760
I can't stop them, can I?

671
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,360
I was scared to death by this surprise!

672
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,880
Besides, today is the opening day.

673
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,440
More people will bring you better luck.

674
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,320
Gao, come in. Come in.

675
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,640
Have a seat.

676
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,240
Yeah.

677
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,320
No, no, no! No need.

678
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,880
I just have a few words to tell you.

679
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,000
I mean, Minghui's job, you know…

680
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,000
Gao,

681
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,440
I know you are worried about your son's job,

682
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,600
but you have to wait this time.

683
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,040
No, I want to say that Minghui's job…

684
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,320
Let's just forget it.

685
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,640
Sorry for making you work in vain.

686
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,320
I'm really sorry for that.

687
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,280
Look,

688
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,120
you don't have to say sorry to me.

689
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,760
Children are grown up.

690
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,560
Just let them strike out on their own.

691
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

692
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,240
They just don't listen to me.

693
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,440
You know what?

694
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,880
You take your good fortune for granted.

695
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,600
I really envy you

696
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,800
having two good sons!

697
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,480
Even to this day, my dad still can't understand

698
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,200
what my brother's beloved rock and roll

699
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,480
and the freedom he pursues

700
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,760
actually are.

701
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,960
Likewise, my brother would never accept

702
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,560
the kind of smooth and steady life that my dad wants him to live.

703
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,640
Yeah!

704
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,400
Since when have you been so supportive of Minghui?

705
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,600
I just feel that it's really a pity

706
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,840
if you can't do

707
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,040
what you want to do.

708
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,480
But so what?

709
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,520
Even if the difference of ideas is like a mountain between us,

710
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,720
love can always tramp over the mountain.

711
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:28,180
[The day before opening]

712
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,480
Okay. Come on.

713
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,080
Lift it up.

714
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:49,680
All right.

715
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,520
Don't tell your brother that I fixed this.

716
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,920
They say in this world,

717
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,560
parents always give in to their children.

718
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,600
What really makes them give up without a fight

719
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,880
is actually the heart that cannot bear to hurt the children.

720
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,140
♫Give you all♫

721
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,700
♫All my memory♫

722

♫I want to leave it to cry in a dream♫

00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:17,820
♫Time flies by♫

♫Let bygones be bygones♫

728

♫Tightly hug the memory and kiss the memory♫
