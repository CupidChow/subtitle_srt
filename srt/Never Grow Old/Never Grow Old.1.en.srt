00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,080
There're a lot of people over there.

167
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,600
When there's something big in one family, everyone goes to help them.

168
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,280
Aunt.

169
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,640
Chen Chen is getting married

170
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,000
and everyone living in the street

171
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,920
is trying to help.

172
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Good luck!

173
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,960
Tan Xin.

174
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,240
Don't run. Slowly.

175
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,030
OK.

176
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,790
You're here.

177
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,240
Yes.

178
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,080
-Come, have some sweets. -Where is Chen?

179
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:36,670
Upstairs.

180
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:37,320
OK!

181
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,200
Thank you.

182
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:38,790
Aunt.

183
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,670
Congratulations, Uncle Chen.

184
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:42,840
Dad, Mom,

185
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,880
I'm going upstairs to see Chen Chen.

186
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,600
Go ahead.

187
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,360
Chen!

188
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:45,840
OK.

189
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,760
Pass or not?

190
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,840
Hurry up.

191
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,200
It looks really good.

192
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,400
It makes Chen Chen look even prettier.

193
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,400
Chen!

194
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,680
It's pretty.

195
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,760
You look so great!

196
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,080
Right?

197
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,400
Tan Xin,

198
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,960
don't you think it's a little loose here?

199
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,480
Why do you have new clothes?

200
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,960
Sure.

201
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,600
I'm the bridesmaid.

202
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,920
It's Chen getting married, not you.

203
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,280
Cut it out.

204
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,760
Chen is the prettiest.

205
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:40,960
Chen,

206
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:42,840
Chen,

207
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,840
happy marriage.

208
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,360
What is it?

209
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,120
This is too expensive.

210
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,120
I can't accept it.

211
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,400
But thank you.

212
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,600
My mother brought it back for me from the United States.

213
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,200
I want you to have it.

214
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,800
I knew it was your mother

215
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,080
who bought it for you two,

216
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,240
so I can't accept it.

217
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,600
We don't need it anyway.

218
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,920
Please accept it,

219
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,040
for the sake that I'm your bridesmaid.

220
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,560
OK then.

221
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,720
Thank you.

222
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,000
Chen,

223
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,400
this dress is so beautiful

224
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,640
and it would be a waste

225
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,560
if it goes with a pair of sneakers.

226
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,400
Please lend me a pair of leather shoes.

227
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,800
They're in the cabinet.

228
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,200
Take whatever you like.

229
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,720
Thank you.

230
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,280
Tan Xin.

231
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,000
Tan Xin!

232
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,680
Tan Xin,

233
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,000
come over here.

234
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,640
I want to show you something.

235
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,760
What's wrong?

236
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,040
Chen,

237
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,720
I'll give you a better gift

238
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,440
than this hair dryer.

239
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,800
Aunt Chunhua bought this hair dryer for you two,

240
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,600
so it's a gift from you two.

241
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,640
No!

242
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,400
I'll give you a better one.

243
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,640
If you really want to give me something better,

244
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,320
help me out with the invitations here.

245
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,800
So many!

246
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,200
I'll assign the work.

247
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,520
Those with good handwriting

248
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,960
write the invitations.

249
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,080
Tan Xin,

250
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,040
write the names on them.

251
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,480
Why does she do such an easy job?

252
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,680
Her handwriting is not good.

253
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,400
Says who?

254
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,080
My handwriting is good.

255
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,320
Tan Xin, come on.

256
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,080
Your handwriting is bad.

257
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,400
Where is the pen?

258
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,400
How can we write

259
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,360
without a pen?

260
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,600
OK, I'll go and get them.

261
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,960
Hurry up.

262
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,440
Watch me take out my sword

263
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,920
and kill all the heartless people in the world!

264
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,000
Take it off

265
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,960
and I'll wash it for you.

266
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,920
I've been practicing lately

267
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,320
and I can wash it clean. Trust me.

268
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,200
No, I don't trust you.

269
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,240
I'll wash it myself.

270
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,080
It doesn't matter if you don't trust me,

271
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,720
but you have to trust Panda Laundry Detergent.

272
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,520
Take it off.

273
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,680
No, I can do it myself.

274
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,640
Take it off! Tan Xin asked you to take it off.

275
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,680
Come on, hurry up.

276
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,240
Give it to her.

277
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,160
What are you doing?

278
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,200
Take it off.

279
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,280
It's all dirty.

280
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,480
Tan Xin, the invitations.

281
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,480
She left without the invitations.

282
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,040
You've been away for a day.

283
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,640
Does it affect your business?

284
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,160
No, it doesn't.

285
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,760
Look.

286
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,320
Wenying.

287
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,120
I put the money on the counter.

288
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,640
OK, I got it.

289
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:00,920
Wenying.

290
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,040
-I'm going home. -You go back home.

291
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,840
Excuse me,

292
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,880
I took two jin of eggs.

293
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,720
OK.

294
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,280
I put it on the counter.

295
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:05,680
OK.

296
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,680
See?

297
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,720
It doesn't affect anything.

298
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,000
Ah, Mei.

299
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,720
Mei.

300
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,880
My back hurts again,

301
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,960
and I went to see the doctor,

302
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,840
so I didn't go there with you.

303
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,760
How is it?

304
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,880
Don't worry.

305
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,120
It has been taken care of.

306
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,000
She's good at it.

307
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,960
How time flies!

308
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,440
In a blink of an eye,

309
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,440
this girl from the Chen family is getting married.

310
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,880
You're right.

311
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,320
We watch them grow up.

312
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,080
I'm wondering when Minghui

313
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,840
will get married.

314
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,440
Why did Minghui come back home

315
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,200
from Beijing?

316
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,040
Yeah.

317
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,480
He studied there for four years

318
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,000
and he should have stayed there.

319
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,320
Beijing is much better.

320
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,600
It's crappy here.

321
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,200
You can ask about it here,

322
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,400
but don't mention it in my house.

323
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,840
But this,

324
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,440
don't ask about this and don't mention that.

325
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,240
Well, this,

326
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:57,880
this is,

327
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,240
it's never easy to be a stepmother.

328
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,280
Don't say that.

329
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,600
Minghui lost his mother since he was a child

330
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,920
and you brought him up,

331
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,760
so you're the only mother he has.

332
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,920
Yes.

333
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,400
Gao Minghui, what are you doing?

334
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,400
If you had told her you love her,

335
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,680
she wouldn't want to marry someone else.

336
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,400
It's between us

337
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,320
and it's none of your business.

338
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,640
Her business is my business.

339
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,320
You two stop fighting!

340
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,800
Or I'll tell Chen!

341
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,880
Please give this to Chen Chen.

342
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,320
Give it to her yourself.

343
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,200
I tried,

344
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,080
but she didn't accept it.

345
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,520
Please give it to her for me.

346
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,760
It's not too much,

347
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,560
but it's my wish for her.

348
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,440
Please tell her

349
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,680
that I can't make it to her wedding.

350
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,640
Attending her wedding

351
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,920
will be too cruel for me.

352
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,200
But I

353
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,920
wish her all the best.

354
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,240
Since Chen doesn't accept it,

355
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,040
I can't take it for her.

356
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,760
But I will take the message for you.

357
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,760
Also,

358
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,920
Chen will be happy.

359
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,080
She'll be happy

360
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,240
for sure.

361
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,800
Gao Minghui,

362
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,520
don't flatter yourself.

363
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,880
Chen wants to get married

364
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,080
because she loves her husband.

365
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,160
I know.

366
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,040
Good.

367
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,360
You're back.

368
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,640
Dinner is ready.

369
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,360
OK.

370
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,440
Why are you back so late?

371
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,240
We were all waiting for you.

372
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,360
It's not late.

373
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,240
Just in time.

374
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,560
The last dish is just ready.

375
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,720
Minghui,

376
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,280
what's wrong with your hand?

377
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,040
It's fine, Mom.

378
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,720
Just a scratch.

379
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,800
Go and get the medicine kit.

380
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,590
It's fine, Mom.

381
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,640
I'll just wash it in a while.

382
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,400
Where did you get it?

383
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,480
So careless.

384
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,310
Against the wall.

385
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,310
It's fine, Mom.

386
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,830
Hurry up. Got it?

387
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:18,560
Mom, Mom.

388
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,110
Here, this.

389
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:20,920
It hurts.

390
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,760
Enough!

391
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:22,920
Come and eat!

392
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,440
Ignore him.

393
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,000
You...

394
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,800
You mess around all day

395
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,440
and hang out with the hooligans.

396
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,160
You even want to open some video shop.

397
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,280
It doesn't

398
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,320
sound like anything decent.

399
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,360
What's decent?

400
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,360
Tell me about it.

401
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,200
Chen is getting married

402
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,400
and Minghui must be feeling bad about it.

403
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,680
He's not feeling good, so what?

404
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,600
OK, that's enough.

405
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,600
Save your breath!

406
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,200
Stop talking nonsense!

407
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,360
Let's eat.

408
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,360
Come.

409
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,440
Eat it.

410
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,840
What is this?

411
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,840
I don't understand it at all.

412
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,800
I think it must be No. 1.

413
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,680
I think

414
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,360
it must be No. 2.

415
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,080
Look how much it looks like No. 2.

416
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,160
Let's do this.

417
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,640
Old rules, let's have a bet.

418
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,160
Then let Chen Chen be the judge next week.

419
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,360
I won't be able to watch it with you next week.

420
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,640
I don't know if there is a signal pot over there.

421
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,480
If there isn't,

422
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,080
I won't know the result.

423
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,080
Tan Xin,

424
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,800
call me and tell me the result then.

425
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,920
What's wrong?

426
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,000
Are you going to cry?

427
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,760
No tears.

428
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,520
Getting married is happy.

429
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,640
Why are you crying?

430
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,120
Hold back the tears!

431
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,680
How about this?

432
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,040
Let's have a toast.

433
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,000
Come.

434
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,240
Wish me a happy marriage.

435
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,520
Go for it! Go for it!

436
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,080
Go for it! Go for it!

437
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,960
The young girl is turning very fast.

438
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,640
The fifth lap, the sixth lap.

439
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,440
Go for it! Go for it!

440
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,080
Come and cheer them on!

441
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,680
Come on!

442
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,520
OK, she's going over.

443
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,480
Come on!

444
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,440
Be careful and watch out!

445
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,560
[Prize]
Where have you been, Tan Xin?

446
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,080
We've been looking for you for a long time.

447
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,080
I...

448
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,720
Did you forget that Chen Chen

449
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,120
asked us to write the invitations?

450
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,560
Now it's done and you're back.

451
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,760
You're so lazy.

452
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,760
Sorry.

453
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,760
My sister shouldn't have been so kind to you.

454
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,280
Do you even care about Chen Chen getting married?

455
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,040
I don't know what you've been doing.

456
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,240
Tan Xin,

457
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,720
it's inappropriate this time.

458
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,720
Tan Xin.

459
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,760
I got it.

460
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,760
I was wrong

461
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,600
and ungrateful,

462
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,360
OK?

463
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,160
Chen,

464
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,520
sorry.

465
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,960
You're getting married,

466
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,360
but I haven't given you anything.

467
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,080
I didn't even write the invitations for you.

468
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,200
Don't worry.

469
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,360
I will give you

470
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,360
the best wedding gift ever.

471
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,720
Silly girl,

472
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,840
I'm looking forward to it.

473
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,200
Young lady,

474
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,400
what time is it now? Why are you still up?

475
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,200
Huh?

476
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,200
Dad, I'll go to bed after finishing it here.

477
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,600
Don't be late tomorrow morning.

478
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,160
Chen Chen is having the wedding tomorrow.

479
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:06,760
Right?

480
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,440
I got it, Dad.

481
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,440
You go to bed first.

482
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,520
You child.

483
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,200
You don't know how to do it.

484
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:22,880
Put it here.

485
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,600
Put it here.

486
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,320
What's wrong?

487
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,880
Mom, this...

488
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,640
Don't spray it with your mouth.

489
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,280
We have a watering can.

490
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,400
The watering can is not as good as my mouth.

491
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:32,960
No!

492
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,360
We need this.

493
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,400
Spray some water

494
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,800
and put this white cloth on it.

495
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,520
Iron it this way.

496
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,840
Mom, keep your hands away.

497
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,400
Jianguo.

498
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,240
You take care of that box

499
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,200
of firecrackers tomorrow.

500
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,600
Before the wedding,

501
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,520
divide that box of firecrackers into two.

502
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,480
One half at our door

503
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,360
and the other half at the door of the restaurant.

504
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,040
Mom,

505
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,680
I will have to entertain guests tomorrow.

506
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,560
How will I have time for firecrackers?

507
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,640
I have.

508
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,640
Do you want me to do it?

509
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,040
No, I didn't mean that.

510
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,200
No, Grandma can't do that.

511
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,080
I'll leave it to you tomorrow.

512
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,640
Take good care of it.

513
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,640
OK!

514
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,680
Just leave it to me.

515
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,600
Let's listen to Grandma.

516
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,280
OK.

517
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,640
Let's see how it is.

518
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,160
Cheng,

519
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,080
take care of the firecrackers tomorrow morning.

520
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,920
Grandma asked you to do it.

521
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,120
I'll leave it to you

522
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,200
and you must take good care of it.

523
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,240
OK, OK.

524
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,320
Chen,

525
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:36,840
this,

526
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,800
give it to me.

527
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,760
Where did you get it?

528
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,760
Over there.

529
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,600
My dear,

530
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,240
I haven't finished the sweater yet,

531
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,680
but you just pulled out the needle.

532
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,440
-How could you? -Stop yelling.

533
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,240
Mom.

534
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,440
It's so late.

535
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,200
Mom, I didn't mean to.

536
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,400
You made my heart ache.

537
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,680
Sorry.

538
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,720
I'm so sorry.

539
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,280
This...

540
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,360
Sorry, Mom.

541
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,920
It's getting messier.

542
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,280
I'm so sorry, Mom.

543
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,680
What's up?

544
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,520
You're so sneaky.

545
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,960
I'm not sneaky.

546
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,200
I've just come here.

547
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,400
Mom asked me to keep an eye on you.

548
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,880
Don't mess your hair

549
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,120
with this.

550
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,160
I'm so exhausted.

551
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,920
Getting married

552
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,040
is exhausting.

553
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,400
Everyone does it.

554
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,720
What is it?

555
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,960
Open it and see.

556
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,080
Chocolate?

557
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:48,920
Well,

558
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,040
you'll have a lot of wine tomorrow

559
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,280
and you might not have time to eat,

560
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,680
so eat something now.

561
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,600
There are some liver-protection medicines

562
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,720
from mother's closet.

563
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,760
Drink it

564
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,800
before you have wine tomorrow.

565
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,560
Thank you.

566
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,920
You've grown up

567
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,400
and now you can take care of me.

568
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,840
Chen,

569
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,000
I don't want you to get married.

570
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,560
Really?

571
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,520
Sure.

572
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,880
What's on that table?

573
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,200
Those are...

574
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,760
Grandma said

575
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,920
that after you get married,

576
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,920
this room shouldn't be vacant.

577
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,400
And I've grown up.

578
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,240
I need a bigger room,

579
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,000
so I can take this room.

580
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,240
You brat,

581
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,160
I'm not married yet

582
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,280
and you want to take my room.

583
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,520
No, I mean...

584
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,200
You brat!

585
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,000
I didn't mean to.

586
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,200
-I just moved something into this room. -How dare you!

587
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,640
-How dare you! -I just moved the things.

588
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,760
Have I left? You've moved your things in here.

589
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,320
No, I just think

590
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,880
it's better to move them in.

591
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,080
You want this room for a long time, don't you?

592
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,120
No.

593
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,000
You're here.

594
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,440
Come in, please.

595
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,120
Mom, why are you here?

596
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,840
Didn't they take you to the restaurant?

597
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,000
Why are you back?

598
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,120
Thank you. Thank you.

599
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,040
Why did you take me

600
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,200
to the restaurant so early?

601
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,680
There're so many guests at home

602
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,400
and I have to be here.

603
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,440
It's too crowded here.

604
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,480
Is Chen ready now?

605
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,000
Yes, don't worry about it.

606
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,000
I'll go check on her.

607
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,680
She's worried about her granddaughter.

608
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,720
She doesn't want to leave her granddaughter.

609
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,440
Mom, Mom.

610
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,400
The groom is here!

611
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,600
The groom is here!

612
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,040
Hurry up!

613
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,160
Dad, Mom.

614
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,000
Come.

615
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,080
Cheng,

616
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,200
stop them!

617
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,200
Red envelope! Red envelope!

618
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,320
Thank you. Thank you.

619
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,760
Give me the red envelope!

620
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,000
Brother-in-law, give me a red envelope.

621
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,200
Give them all to me.

622
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,760
I want more! Give me more!

623
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,040
It's not enough! I want more!

624
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,120
Bros, come on!

625
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,440
They're coming!

626
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,400
Oops!

627
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,240
What's wrong?

628
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,240
They're all coming!

629
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,440
Give her the bouquet!

630
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,520
Exactly.

631
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,800
Get ready.

632
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,520
Have you hidden the shoes?

633
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,920
Have you? You just played with them.

634
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,720
The shoes!

635
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,040
Have you hidden them?

636
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,440
Forget it. Let them look for them.

637
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,360
OK.

638
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,640
They're coming out.

639
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,080
Slowly. Slowly.

640
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,080
Slow down.

641
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:45,960
Cheng,

642
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,240
how many firecrackers have you lit?

643
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,320
All of it.

644
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,120
You lit all of it?

645
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,040
Nobody asked me to save any of it.

646
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,800
Jianguo!

647
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,320
Grandma, take it easy.

648
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,480
Don't worry about it.

649
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,520
Put it out.

650
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,680
I got it, Grandma.

651
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,400
I'll put it out.

652
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,020
♫I was young♫

653
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,780

Slow down.

Stand still.

673

Mom, slow down.

674
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,760
Our neighbors are like a family.

675
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,680
The bridegroom has brought a camera.

676
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,800
Let's take a group photo

677
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,640
to wish Chen Chen and Zhang Hua a happy marriage.

678
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,400
Come.

679
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,400
Minghui, Minghui,

680
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,360
where are you going?

681
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,520
Come over here. Hurry.

682
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,680
Come.

683
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,640
Hurry up.

684
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,720
Come over here.

685
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,360
Why are you hiding there? Come over!

686
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:10,920
Minghui,

687
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,880
what are you doing over there?

688
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,600
Come and let's take a photo together.

689
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,560
Who is he?

690
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,800
We grew up together.

691
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,800
Lizi, where is Tan Xin?

692
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,880
Well, she went out when it was still dark.

693
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,480
Wait a minute, Dad.

694
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,000
Tan Xin hasn't come back yet.

695
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,920
Yeah, where is Tan Xin?

696
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,640
Where is Tan Xin?

697
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,960
Do you know where Tan Xin is?

698
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:26,760
I don't know.

699
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,480
Don't wait for her.

700
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,960
My mother is waiting for us to go back to eat.

701
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,160
It's late now.

702
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,440
Wait a minute.

703
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,000
Let's take it when Tan Xin comes back.

704
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,680
Won't you be late for the train?

705
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,440
How about this?

706
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,800
Let's take some solo photos

707
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,040
and then we take the group photo when Tan Xin comes back.

708
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,600
Mom, what do you say?

709
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,840
OK.

710
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,240
You go back first.

711
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,080
Come.

712
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,880
Your family is so troublesome.

713
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,960
We're not troublesome.

714
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,840
All the neighbors here

715
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,920
are our family members.

716
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,760
Yes, you're right, Grandma.

717
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,680
Yes, you're right.

718
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,200
Grandma, you're right.

719
00:30:59,200 --> 00:30:59,920
Yeah, come.

720
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,040
Come, ready?

721
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,560
You say one, two, three and we say cheese.

722
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,080
OK.

723
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,240
Come. One, two, three.

724
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,000
Cheese.

725
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,040
OK, one more.

726
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,960
Come. One, two, three.

727
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,240
Cheese.

728
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,120
What is our first prize?

729
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,200
Let's take a look.

730
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,440
Hong Kong Solo 5-Day Tour.

731
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,640
OK, the prize for the second place

732
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,920
is also very exciting.

733
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,160
One Panda 24-inch color TV.

734
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,160
Bravo!

735
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,160
Let's cheer them on.

736
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,760
Let's see who get

737
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,240
the top three prizes.

738
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,480
Come, let's cheer them on.

739
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,120
OK.

740
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:04,800
Cheese!

741
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,280
OK.

742
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:05,880
Good.

743
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,680
OK?

744
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,920
Very good.

745
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,600
Pretty good.

746
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,240
That's good.

747
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,840
Save some.

748
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,720
Save some for the group photo.

749
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,600
Yes, we have to take a group photo.

750
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,080
Where is Tan Xin?

751
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,920
It's almost eleven o'clock and she still hasn't come back.

752
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,560
Let's not wait for her and take a photo.

753
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,000
Should we wait a little longer?

754
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,000
No, no need for that.

755
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,560
OK.

756
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,280
Then let's line up again.

757
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:23,840
Come.

758
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,720
Come over.

759
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,520
OK. OK.

760
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,080
Get ready and on your positions.

761
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,520
Come, three, two, one.

762
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,400
Tan Xin is here!

763
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,400
Tan Xin is here!

764
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,480
She's coming!

765
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,440
Watch out!

766
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,520
Stand up!

767
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,520
Are you OK?

768
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:06,880
What's wrong?

769
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,960
It's fine. Get her up.

770
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:09,800
Tan Xin.

771
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,360
What happened?

772
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,120
-This kid. -What happened?

773
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,080
It's fine.

774
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,240
What's in the box?

775
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,520
Where have you been?

776
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,240
How childish you are!

777
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,160
Aunt, stop it.

778
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,240
Look at you.

779
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,200
You're too immature.

780
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,880
Why are you so dirty?

781
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,040
What did you do?

782
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,000
What happened to you?

783
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,680
Chen,

784
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,280
sorry.

785
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,760
I wanted

786
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,720
to win a color TV for you.

787
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,920
I went there several times,

788
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,560
but I only got the washing powder.

789
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,880
Silly girl,

790
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,920
whether it is a color TV or washing powder,

791
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,440
it's the same to me

792
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,160
because it's a gift from you.

793
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,760
No.

794
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,800
Washing powder is great.

795
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,320
I can use it to wash clothes.

796
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,080
I don't want you to do all the cleaning and cooking

797
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,000
after getting married.

798
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:01,960
Nonsense.

799
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:02,760
Hurry.

800
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,480
In the graduation yearbook of the sixth grade of elementary school,

801
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:12,360
it's written that even the finest feast comes to an end.

802
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,040
In the second grade of junior high school,

803
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,040
we learned

804
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:20,320
that men have their weal and woe, parting and meeting, and the moon has her dimness and brightness, waxing and waning.

805
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,230
In 1997,

806
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,670
we were 18 years old.

807
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,230
Chen Chen got married

808
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,840
and our hearts were broken.

809
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,400
I didn't win that TV,

810
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,920
but I got a box of washing powder.

811
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,280
It went to the bathrooms

812
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,640
of every house on Xiaoji Street,

813
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,920
as if telling me

814
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,720
that only by taking every parting seriously,

815
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,320
can youth be more meaningful.

816
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,300
