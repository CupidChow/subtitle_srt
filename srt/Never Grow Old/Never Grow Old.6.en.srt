00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,960
Be careful.

174
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,720
Jin Zhi.

175
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:44,880
Jin Zhi.

176
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,040
You're really capable.

177
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,360
Where did you get the glass?

178
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,360
The shops are still closed.

179
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,240
I'm flattered.

180
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,280
Anyone else

181
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,280
can get the glass.

182
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,680
I broke the glass.

183
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,000
It's inappropriate

184
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,280
to let you buy it.

185
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,720
We can't say that.

186
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,000
I bought the fireworks.

187
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,600
If someone must take the blame,

188
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,880
I should be to blame.

189
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,800
There's no one to blame.

190
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,000
It was just an accident.

191
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yeah.

192
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,600
In that case,

193
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,680
I'll set up the glass for you guys.

194
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,560
Guo Fucheng, what are you doing?

195
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,280
I...I...

196
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,880
I'm thinking.

197
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,160
What are you thinking?

198
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,320
Last week, I went...

199
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,760
Thank you.

200
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,440
Stop!

201
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,400
What's under your sleeve?

202
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,520
Take out.

203
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,680
Ms.

204
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,160
I won't do this again.

205
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,280
Ms.

206
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,440
Please...give me one more chance.

207
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,120
I won't do this again.

208
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,000
Take it out.

209
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,520
It's confiscated.

210
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,680
You're ridiculous.

211
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,560
Ms.

212
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,720
You stand in the back.

213
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,000
I want one student

214
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,440
to tell your answer.

215
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,120
The new student.

216
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,840
The new student.

217
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,000
Tell me your answer.

218
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,080
I don't know.

219
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,760
I don't know.

220
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,520
Where are you going?

221
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,840
Answer the question!

222
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,000
I don't know.

223
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,000
You don't know!

224
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,440
Behave yourself!

225
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,280
My class is not over.

226
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,200
Stand up.

227
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,840
Goodbye.

228
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,840
So unruly.

229
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,480
Can you just listen to me?

230
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,720
We're listening.

231
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,280
Do you know what he said?

232
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:06,840
What?

233
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,720
He was like this.

234
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,240
Ms, I don't understand your question,

235
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,400
but I think I can't answer it.

236
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,280
So I'll stand in the back directly.

237
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,720
Then he went to the back right away.

238
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,560
He didn't say that much.

239
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,760
Then...

240
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,440
I'm...

241
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,840
I'm a good actor.

242
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,440
You know nothing of acting.

243
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,160
The English teacher turned white with anger.

244
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,080
That's the truth.

245
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,840
This is our basketball court.

246
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,520
This is our playground

247
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,400
where we have our PE class.

248
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,080
But we're seniors now,

249
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,360
so we don't have PE classes often.

250
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,480
The library is ahead.

251
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,000
You can study there.

252
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,080
Forget it. I always feel sleepy when reading.

253
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,800
The same as me.

254
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,560
If you have any questions,

255
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,680
you can ask me.

256
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,800
Is that Tan Xin?

257
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,440
Is that Ma?

258
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,160
What are they doing there?

259
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,000
I don't know.

260
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:18,920
Come up.

261
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,240
I have a question.

262
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,040
Well,

263
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,640
What were you

264
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,080
disciplined for?

265
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,840
Let bygone be bygone.

266
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,640
It's dishonorable.

267
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,040
It's not good for you to know it.

268
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,160
We're the same kind of people.

269
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,240
Do you have

270
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,160
anything to ask me about?

271
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,600
I'd better not. It's not good for me, either.

272
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,960
Am I that impressive?

273
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,280
What do they say about me?

274
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,800
They say you were expelled

275
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,280
by the previous school

276
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,320
because you fought with others.

277
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,800
I'm not a bully.

278
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,000
I was upholding justice.

279
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,160
I believe you.

280
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,720
You're a very chivalrous

281
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,040
guy in my eye.

282
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,960
What if

283
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,080
I'm not the kind of person you imagine.

284
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,600
What kind?

285
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,600
The person who has a gang

286
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,840
and can do anything he wants to do.

287
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,160
Aren't you the kind of person?

288
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,600
Ma, you're what you are.

289
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,280
We're neighbors and classmates.

290
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,480
Even if you're not an all-mighty person,

291
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,040
I'll protect you.

292
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:33,880
Okay.

293
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,760
You've become my best friend

294
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,680
in the school.

295
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,760
If you need anything, just ask me.

296
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,120
Help each other.

297
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,360
Right,

298
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,480
I have two movie tickets for tonight.

299
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,440
Do you want to go?

300
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,520
I need to clean the classroom.

301
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,520
I can't go.

302
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,080
You go ahead.

303
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,280
But...

304
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,040
Coming. Coming.

305
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,680
I smelt it from far away.

306
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:02,960
Grilled chicken.

307
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,400
Here. Give it to me.

308
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,680
The chicken is expensive.

309
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,200
Madam chicken brought it over herself.

310
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,360
Nonsense.

311
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,360
Where's Mr. Tan?

312
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,960
He won't come back

313
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,960
until he messes something up.

314
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,240
Forget him. Let's eat.

315
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:15,920
I'll go and get him.

316
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,640
No, no. Don't bother.

317
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,760
He's competitive since he was little.

318
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,480
He's also very stubborn.

319
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,520
Come. Come.

320
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,720
-Sit down.-Have a seat.

321
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,440
You know, he'll come later

322
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,720
without our calling him.

323
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,920
Just wait and see.

324
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,200
Qiang has been like this,

325
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,640
having a strong self-esteem.

326
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,040
In their childhood, when they played in the yard,

327
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,120
Qiang fell down suddenly

328
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,000
and began doing push-ups,

329
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,320
for fear that other kids would laugh at him.

330
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,760
He did more than 200 push-ups.

331
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,720
What happened next?

332
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,120
He couldn't even pick up chopsticks.

333
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,000
Too many funny stories.

334
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,300
♫She makes you so confused♫

335
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:00,100
♫She is lonely in her heart♫

336
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:03,140
♫Full of happy dreams♫

337
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,800
Ma, how much did they cost?

338
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,240
You're my boss now.

339
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,310
I want to eat drumsticks every day.

340
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,160
All right.

341
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,400
Come on.

342
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,480
Ma treats you to drumsticks.

343
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,200
Everyone of Class 8 has one.

344
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,200
Eat, eat.

345
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,280
Here you are.

346
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,040
We want one.

347
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,720
Okay. For the ones from Xiaoji Street.

348
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:26,680
Here you are.

349
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,590
Thank you.

350
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,800
You're welcome.

351
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,880
It's my pleasure. Just eat.

352
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,000
Ma, how much did they cost you?

353
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,800
Don't save money for me.

354
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,160
Money is the last thing I need.

355
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,520
Have you finished?

356
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,080
Guo Fucheng, have you finished?

357
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,120
Ma bought us drumsticks.

358
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,200
I need to finish it first.

359
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,080
Well, let me introduce myself.

360
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,120
I'm Ma Xiaoyi, living on Xiaoji Street.

361
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,200
Chen Cheng.

362
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,480
Wang Yong.

363
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,120
Gao Zhiyuan.

364
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,520
We're not only classmates but neighbors.

365
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,920
Let's play basketball together.

366
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,360
Sorry, I have an appointment.

367
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,400
Maybe next time.

368
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,040
Let's go.

369
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,880
Wait for me. I'll go with you.

370
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,160
Why are you going?

371
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,920
I don't want to help her clean the classroom.

372
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,520
Let's go. Let's go.

373
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,680
Come on.

374
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,560
Miss Tan, hello.

375
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:45,920
Do it.

376
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,080
-Okay. -Okay.

377
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:47,960
Hurry up.

378
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,600
I can do this. Give it to me.

379
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,240
This is our work.

380
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,560
But...

381
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,760
What does this mean?

382
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,000
They're all my friend.

383
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,280
Hurry up. Be quick.

384
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,600
You can't do this for me.

385
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,000
Miss Tan. Leave this to us.

386
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,320
This is our duty.

387
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,280
Don't worry.

388
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,640
I can't bully you.

389
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,560
You're not,

390
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,480
unless you don't let them do this.

391
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,280
Be quick.

392
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,720
Since someone is cleaning the classroom,

393
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,120
you can go to the movie with me

394
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,880
But...

395
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,240
That's it. Let's go.

396
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,480
I bought the tickets.

397
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,160
Hurry up, or we'll be late.

398
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,040
Go, go.

399
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,440
We can't just leave.

400
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,480
It's okay.

401
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,080
Come on.

402
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,040
Got it.

403
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,880
Make sure it's very clean.

404
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,880
It's done.

405
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,520
Hand me that one.

406
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,720
Stop, stop. Be slow, be slow.

407
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,400
This.

408
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,800
-Be careful. -Move aside.

409
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,280
Now you're proud.

410
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,440
Good job.

411
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,640
Come and push it.

412
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,440
I don't need to.

413
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,320
I'm 100 percent believe

414
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,400
your skill.

415
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:58,920
This is so great.

416
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,960
It's a new window again.

417
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,440
Yes, yes.

418
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,400
It's a piece of cake.

419
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,760
A piece of cake.

420
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,520
I'm so tired.

421
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,680
Where's Tan Xin?

422
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,200
I went to the movie with Ma.

423
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,960
Why are you still here?

424
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,400
Ma asked us to

425
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,960
do the cleaning for Miss Tan.

426
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,440
Work hard.

427
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,240
Okay.

428
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,200
Let's go.

429
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,720
Let's go.

430
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,000
Go.

431
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,400
Did you see how he walks?

432
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,040
He looks so cool.

433
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,240
I heard those from the next classroom

434
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,600
are so rebellious

435
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,080
that no one dares to offend them.

436
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,800
I can't believe Ma Xiaoyi

437
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,360
asked them to do the cleaning.

438
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,160
Kids from Xiaoji Street

439
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,240
are all simple and honest, such as us,

440
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,360
good teenagers.

441
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,520
I can't believe a greenwood hero

442
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,200
came to the street.

443
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,280
I feel greatly proud.

444
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,960
Greatly proud.

445
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,240
Stop, Guo Fucheng.

446
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,440
Your vocabulary

447
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,240
has impressed me today.

448
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,280
You don't understand.

449
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,960
It's difficult to meet a soulmate.

450
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,880
I have nothing to say to you.

451
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,400
Great.

452
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,880
Since Chen Chen has gone,

453
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,800
we have never seen

454
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,040
such a fighter in Xiaoji Street.

455
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,280
I feel Ma Xiaoyi

456
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,800
is quite strange.

457
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,480
He doesn't seem to be a hoody.

458
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,040
You know nothing.

459
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,120
In the movies, gang leaders

460
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,080
all have kind faces

461
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,480
and say their prayers.

462
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,720
People who look kind

463
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,240
tend to be...

464
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,600
Mom, I'm back.

465
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,440
Dinner is ready.

466
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,080
Okay.

467
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,800
Wenying.

468
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,160
I remember there's

469
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,640
a good old saying.

470
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,360
Afflictions are sometimes

471
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,320
blessings in disguise. Right?

472
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,680
This is not a big deal.

473
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,440
I'll set it up again.

474
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,360
I've told you.

475
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,320
Aunt, I'm back.

476
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:44,760
You...

477
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,360
Lizi is back.

478
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,360
You're back.

479
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,600
Lizi, I just made pancakes.

480
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,600
Wash your hands and eat.

481
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,240
Okay.

482
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,360
Maybe she has

483
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,480
made scorched pancakes again.

484
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,040
Where's Tan Xin?

485
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,240
Has she gone to the movie?

486
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,600
Didn't you go with her?

487
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,240
I'm not going.

488
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,160
Aunt, you know,

489
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,560
the new student is a hoodie.

490
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,800
I heard

491
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,960
he was expelled

492
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,960
from the previous school.

493
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,400
Nonsense.

494
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,160
That's truth, aunt.

495
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,440
I've seen him

496
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,280
act like a tyrant.

497
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,000
He even found someone to take his backpack,

498
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,480
and asked juniors to

499
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,720
help Tan Xin do the cleaning.

500
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,120
Listen to me,

501
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,560
maybe what Lizi said is true.

502
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,520
You Tan Xin should stay away from him.

503
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,480
I think he is a good boy.

504
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,800
You see, he called

505
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,160
to tell me

506
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,200
he went out with Tan Xin.

507
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,760
Tan Xin doesn't know these things.

508
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,400
What are you digging for?

509
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,960
I forgot my homework at school.

510
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,600
I have to go back, aunt.

511
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,800
It's getting dark.

512
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,520
You can let Tan Xin go with you

513
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,760
when she comes back.

514
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,760
It's okay. I'll go myself.

515
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,200
Be careful on the road.

516
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:56,920
Okay.

517
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,520
Ride slowly.

518
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,800
Bye, uncle.

519
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,360
Worrisome kids.

520
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:03,880
Wenying.

521
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,760
Do we have larger plastic bags?

522
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,840
What a pretty girl.

523
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,560
Hey, didn't you hear me?

524
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,400
Thank you.

525
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,960
If you want to thank me,

526
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,240
lend me 20 yuan.

527
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,480
I want to buy some cigarettes.

528
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,640
That's all I have.

529
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,000
Good. What a pretty and kind girl.

530
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,720
Stay away.

531
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,560
How dare you touch me?

532
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,480
Listen,

533
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,080
I don't get hit but do nothing.

534
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,920
Which school are you from?

535
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,760
Here.

536
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,800
Come on.

537
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,360
Don't hide it. Take your hand away.

538
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,640
What are you looking at?

539
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,240
That's the uniform of Experimental Middle School.

540
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,200
I've seen it.

541
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,560
Since you know it,

542
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,560
you'd better not

543
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,480
show up around our school.

544
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,880
Who are you, talking to like this?

545
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,600
I'm well-known here.

546
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,440
Ma Xiaoyi of Class 8, Senior 3.

547
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,520
You just ask around.

548
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,760
Ma Xiaoyi.

549
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,040
Did you hear of it?

550
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,440
Zhiyuan.

551
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,000
Ms. Tan.

552
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,120
Why are you here?

553
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,920
Are you going out at night?

554
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,280
She hasn't come back at this hour.

555
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,160
I'm going to wait for her.

556
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,120
Do you mean Tan Xin?

557
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:40,800
Aunt.

558
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,440
Ms. Tan.

559
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,200
I'm looking for you.

560
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,280
You're home.

561
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,200
I'll go.

562
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,240
Goodbye, Ms. Tan.

563
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,680
Come back. Come and eat pancakes.

564
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,520
I just cooked them.

565
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,800
My grandma is waiting for me.

566
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,800
Bye, Ms. Tan.

567
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,200
Come in, Zhiyuan.

568
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,520
Come and eat pancakes.

569
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,160
Okay.

570
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,160
Are you here for Tan Xin?

571
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,960
I...

572
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,480
I came to you

573
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,600
to take comic books.

574
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,560
Zhiyuan, eat pancakes.

575
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:15,600
Okay.

576
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,280
I just made them.

577
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,200
Ms. Tan, thank you.

578
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,160
Just eat.

579
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,160
Lizi.

580
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,560
I haven't read these. You read them first.

581
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,440
Not them.

582
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,880
I want episode 6.

583
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,280
Episode 6.

584
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,000
It's kept by Tan Xin.

585
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,280
You can ask her when she comes back.

586
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,600
Ms. Tan.

587
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,280
It's late at night.

588
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,360
Why hasn't Tan Xin come back?

589
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,680
She went to the movies with her classmate.

590
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,840
She should be back soon.

591
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,280
You've read episode 6, haven't you?

592
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,120
Why do you want it?

593
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,600
I want to have a review.

594
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,680
Ms. Tan.

595
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,200
The pancake is nice.

596
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,320
I'll go back.

597
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,360
I'll take one.

598
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,280
One more.

599
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,200
You're welcome. It's enough.

600
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:05,960
Take one more.

601
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,760
All right.

602
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,720
Thank you, Ms. Tan. I'll go back.

603
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,560
Goodbye, Ms. Tan.

604
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,480
Goodbye.

605
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,920
Look at him.

606
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,440
He read comic books more than once.

607
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,840
What a conscientious boy.

608
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,360
Gao Zhiyuan.

609
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,440
Did you come to me?

610
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,000
No.

611
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,080
I went to your house to eat pancakes.

612
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,120
Is it delicious?

613
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,720
Here you are.

614
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,640
I'll go home.

615
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,480
Slowly.

616
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,160
Gao Zhiyuan.

617
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,480
I think there seems to be

618
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,080
a little misunderstanding between us.

619
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,440
Have a talk.

620
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,360
This afternoon, my friends said

621
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,200
they liked my shoes and clothes,

622
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,080
so I gave them those

623
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,280
as they liked them so much.

624
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,200
I didn't expect you to see that.

625
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,160
Don't get me wrong.

626
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,320
That's it.

627
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,240
Don't go.

628
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,480
Why are you so rigid?

629
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,600
What are you trying to say?

630
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,040
I mean,

631
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,000
don't let it get out.

632
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,560
I'm not interested in your affairs.

633
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,200
But I warn you.

634
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,880
Stay away from

635
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,240
Tan Xin and other neighbors.

636
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,320
Class 8, Senior 3, right?

637
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,200
Yes, yes.

638
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,760
Thank you.

639
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,680
Go.

640
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,080
Self-esteem

641
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,360
is always accompanied by a sensitive and vulnerable heart,

642
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,680
and even lies.

643
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,320
Sometimes

644
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,680
we like to base our self-esteem

645
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,360
on the approval of others,

646
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,200
or even take others' opinions

647
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,440
as the whole support of our own life.

648
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:13,680
Mom,

649
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,680
how long will we live here?

650
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,720
Why do you ask about that?

651
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,360
Your only work is to study hard.

652
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,440
No. It decides

653
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,840
whether I should make friends with them.

654
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,080
I don't want to live like before.

655
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,520
Just as I made some friends,

656
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,800
we had to move.

657
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,880
But someone has seen us through.

658
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,080
Those who see through us

659
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,160
but guard us

660
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,320
are our treasures and more precious than our self-esteem.

661
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,320
The treasures

662
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,720
make our humble self-esteem

663
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,720
glitter brightly.

664
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,880
Ma, you're back.

665
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,160
Your lousy stupid idea.

666
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:15,840
Look at me.

667
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,960
I gave away my clothes and shoes.

668
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,280
I almost lost my pants.

669
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,720
Have they been fooled?

670
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,880
Almost.

671
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,840
Except Gao Zhiyuan.

672
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,080
I should play my trump card.

673
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,440
What's this?

674
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,280
There are

675
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,200
all the birthdays of the kids' in Xiaoji Street in it.

676
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,960
Where did you get it?

677
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,880
I asked Tan Xin about it when watching the movie.

678
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,840
What's the use of this?

679
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,480
Useless.

680
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,520
You don't understand.

681
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,520
Based on my years of wandering life,

682
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,040
as long as people celebrate a birthday together,

683
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,640
they'll be friends.

684
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,960
Guo Fucheng's birthday is this weekend.

685
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:11,900
[Tan Xin April 5, Lizi August, Guo Fucheng February 25, Gao Zhiyuan October 25, Chen Cheng April 5]

686
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:16,900
[beyond expression]

687
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,640
Follow me.

688
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,800
Act as if we're strangers.

689
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,320
Dr. Tan.

690
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,600
Okay, push it.

691
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:48,760
It's good.

692
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,480
Good skills.

693
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,320
It's not because of my skills.

694
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,000
The window was set up clumsily.

695
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,400
The frame had been knocked askew.

696
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,120
Drink some water. Thank you.

697
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,920
You're welcome.

698
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,080
I said he was so clumsy.

699
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:02,960
I didn't want him to do this,

700
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,880
but he insisted.

701
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,080
Not everyone can do this job.

702
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,560
Don't you have to hurry?

703
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,480
Drink some water.

704
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,480
I have a lot of work to do.

705
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,200
Yes.

706
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,320
Don't tell others you

707
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,480
worked for me.

708
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,280
Rest assured.

709
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,600
Especially people on the street.

710
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,320
Don't worry

711
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,280
Workers like us always keep our mouths shut.

712
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,680
See you. Good-bye.

713
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:00,380
♫Give you all♫

714
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:04,940
♫All my memory♫

715
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:11,620
♫I want to keep it breathing♫

716
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,980
♫Give you all♫

717
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,420
♫Nothing to do with my memory♫

718
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:26,460
♫I want to leave it to cry in a dream♫

719
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:30,140
♫Time flies by♫

720
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,740
♫Let bygones be bygones♫

721
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:38,300
♫Tightly hug the memory and kiss the memory♫

722
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,780
♫To feel cherished♫

723
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,740
♫I'll be right there waiting for you♫

724
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:48,660
♫I won't go anywhere♫

725
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,540
♫I hum the melody softly♫

726
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:56,620
♫Write to myself word by word♫

727
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:13,220
♫Give you all♫

728
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:17,420
♫Love is a secret♫

729
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:24,340
♫I want to keep it sweet in my heart♫

730
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,860
♫Give you all♫

731
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:32,260
♫The problem of time♫

732
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:39,860
♫I want to make it absent in love♫

733
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:43,380
♫Dreams are fragile and delicate♫

734
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:47,260
♫Just let it break♫

735
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:51,220
♫It's always easier to do a thing than to know the reason♫

736
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:54,380
♫Not willing to give up♫

737
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:57,900
♫Years are messed up♫

738
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,500
♫And full of imagination♫

739
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:05,820
♫Cherish every moment♫

740
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:09,180
♫And things would be easier♫
