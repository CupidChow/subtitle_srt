♫Having fun and hugging in the rain♫

00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,600
Mei, come here.

19
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,480
What's up?

20
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,800
Over there.

21
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,480
The house is always empty.

22
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,320
Why's there a roast chicken shop?

23
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,760
I heard two days ago that

24
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,920
a family from the south was

25
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,030
going to move here to do business.

26
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,880
But we've been around here these days,

27
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,000
and have never seen them.

28
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,000
Yeah.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,160
It's true.

30
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,720
We're neighbors.

31
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,400
They didn't come and say hello,

32
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,800
even show their faces.

33
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,560
They acted so mysterious.

34
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,480
It's not that serious.

35
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,880
So what? The whole neighborhood...

36
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,520
Hello.

37
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,320
Hello.

38
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,640
Do you live on this street?

39
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,480
Yeah.

40
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,400
Can I help you?

41
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,400
No.

42
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,400
I'm the owner of this roast chicken shop.

43
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,240
My name is Jin Zhi.

44
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,160
Nice to meet you.

45
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,240
Yeah, we live here.

46
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,880
I'm from this retail store.

47
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,880
They both live in that yard.

48
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,800
Here's the thing. I've been busy

49
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,800
with my shop these days,

50
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,440
and didn't say hello to you.

51
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,240
Why don't you come in

52
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,160
and have some tea?

53
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,160
No, thanks.

54
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,880
We are neighbors.

55
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,160
We'll see each other all the time.

56
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,160
Your shop was just opened.

57
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,080
Go ahead and do your things.

58
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,920
It's okay.

59
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,640
Not today to have tea. Some other time.

60
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,840
We have to go to school.

61
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,760
Yeah, we have to go to school.

62
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,240
It's too late.

63
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:04,920
Let's go.

64
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,640
Next time.

65
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,720
Yes, you must come.

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,280
Well, you see, we're neighbors now.

67
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,760
I might need help in future.

68
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,720
It's a pleasure to meet you.

69
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,960
Sure. Just talk if you need anything.

70
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,640
Well, then I'll go.

71
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,920
Okay.

72
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,520
Sir.

73
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,480
Tan Xin

74
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,200
is so naughty.

75
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,600
Sorry for the troubles.

76
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,160
I'll teach her a lesson back home.

77
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,880
In future,

78
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,280
it will never happen again that

79
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,800
Zhiyuan helps her to do the homework.

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,640
What?

81
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,320
Tan Xin

82
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,720
not only let Chen Cheng of Class One help with her homework,

83
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,040
but also Gao Zhiyuan?

84
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,200
Isn't that what you're talking about?

85
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,720
Why are you so close to me?

86
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,080
I'm eavesdropping.

87
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,920
What's up?

88
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,360
Considering our relationship,

89
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,240
you should be careful.

90
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,100
[Episode 5]

91
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,720
Aunt scolded you?

92
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,920
Or hit you?

93
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,320
Yeah.

94
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,440
This is not a bad thing.

95
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,400
No one expected

96
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,760
Gao Zhiyuan had such a poor taste.

97
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,320
Why does he have poor taste?

98
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,160
Nothing has happened yet.

99
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,160
You already defended for him.

100
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,760
If you blame him now, you are blaming me.

101
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,960
Yeah, I get it.

102
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,640
You two are together, all right?

103
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,400
You're bullying me for my poor math.

104
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,360
What does this have to do with poor math?

105
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,360
You have a poor brain.

106
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,320
Here.

107
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,440
Let's make some more today

108
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,680
and take it to the roast chicken shop.

109
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,840
I was in a hurry and forgot to call them over.

110
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,040
You know,

111
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,640
you two ran fast today

112
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,960
and left me there alone.

113
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,360
I felt so awkward.

114
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,320
You'll get used to it.

115
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,680
That's how we all do.

116
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,440
Yeah.

117
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,640
Wenying.

118
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,040
What were you two doing at school today?

119
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,480
I didn't hear from my son that

120
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,040
there's a parents' meeting at school.

121
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,000
What parents' meeting?

122
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,240
The teacher wanted to see us.

123
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,520
What do you mean?

124
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,240
Mei, what are you laughing at?

125
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,840
Zhiyuan sent chocolates to Tan Xin.

126
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,120
The teacher found out

127
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,640
and suspected that their relationship was abnormal.

128
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,080
Puppy love, right?

129
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,360
At such a young age...

130
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,560
The teacher was overthinking.

131
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,560
What did the teacher think?

132
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,200
Hello, uncle.

133
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,400
Dad.

134
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,200
You're home.

135
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:17,960
Where's my mom?

136
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,760
In the kitchen.

137
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,360
Dad, I'm definitely screwed this time.

138
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,840
What a big deal.

139
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,640
A clean hand wants no washing.

140
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,800
Dad, you believe me?

141
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,160
Of course.

142
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,120
Tan.

143
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,120
The dinner is ready. Come over.

144
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,720
Get that table all cleaned.

145
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,720
Don't look.

146
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,040
Jianguo.

147
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,720
Call our mom.

148
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,360
Almost ready. Let her come over.

149
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,440
About to finish.

150
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,560
Gao Meng.

151
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,200
Give a call to Minghui's store

152
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,200
and call home to

153
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,320
tell Zhiyuan to come here.

154
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,560
OK.

155
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,920
Why bother to make a phone call?

156
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,160
Tan Xin just came back.

157
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,040
Let Tan Xin get him.

158
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,120
Tan Xin, go and get Zhiyuan.

159
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,400
Go. Go.

160
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,440
What's up?

161
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,120
What bad luck.

162
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,000
If you break our TV,

163
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,240
you need to buy a new one.

164
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,320
Tan Xin.

165
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,280
What's up?

166
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,320
My mom asked you to go back to dinner.

167
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,400
Let's go.

168
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,640
Wait.

169
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,840
I'll go in first and you'll go in later.

170
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,240
Why?

171
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,880
Considering our relationship,

172
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,600
it's not good for parents to see us together.

173
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,790
What relationship?

174
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,200
Wait for me.

175
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,280
What do you mean?

176
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,960
What?

177
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,680
What happened? What's going on?

178
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,400
Help yourselves.

179
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,360
I'm confused.

180
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,320
Let's eat.

181
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,600
If you ask me,

182
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,560
the teacher was not wrong at all.

183
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,480
Why don't you two become in-laws?

184
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,080
It's good.

185
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,360
Don't.

186
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,000
Why are they in-laws?

187
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,840
Since childhood, Tan Xin

188
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,800
has been close to my eldest granddaughter Chen Chen,

189
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,360
like growing up in our house.

190
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,960
I have long kept it in mind

191
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
waiting for her to grow up to

192
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,080
marry my eldest grandson

193
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,880
and be my granddaughter-in-law.

194
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,920
Anyway, our family has nothing to lose.

195
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,520
Any of you can take her if you want.

196
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,520
She's here

197
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,880
pissing me off all the time.

198
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,360
What's that got to do with me?

199
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,800
A piece of chocolate. What a big deal?

200
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,080
Even talking about marriage.

201
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,560
Stop it.

202
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,320
It's good.

203
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,000
You two have too much nerve.

204
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,920
Came together and sat next to each other.

205
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,960
No, I didn't.

206
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,440
He's looking at you.

207
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,800
Don't be ridiculous.

208
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,120
You have a bad throat?

209
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,120
I see you have a bad brain.

210
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,400
Auntie, here you go.

211
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,720
Zhiyuan, just eat.

212
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,520
Uncle.

213
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,040
What about you?

214
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,560
Wanna have a beer? I'll get you some.

215
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,800
Forget it.

216
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,560
The drink is good.

217
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,160
That chicken is delicious.

218
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,440
Have some more.

219
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,200
OK.

220
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,160
What's wrong?

221
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,400
Dad, just leave me alone and go.

222
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,600
I saw you didn't eat much.

223
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,840
Are you shy?

224
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,600
No.

225
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,240
I'm waiting for the ribs.

226
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,440
Good.

227
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,960
Wenying.

228
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,040
Have a look at the ribs. It's almost done.

229
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,240
Yeah.

230
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,200
There are ribs.

231
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,880
A big pot of it.

232
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,760
That's enough.

233
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,800
Kids, braised spareribs are here.

234
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,640
Eat less.

235
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,960
You cut to the point.

236
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,480
Come on.

237
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,440
Come on.

238
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,000
Thank you.

239
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,000
Come on.

240
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,600
Yang Mei.

241
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,240
I left some ribs in the pot

242
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,480
for Minghui.

243
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,960
Take it with you when you go.

244
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,720
That's really thoughtful of you.

245
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,960
Mom, I'll take it.

246
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,440
Are you full?

247
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:24,920
I'm not hungry.

248
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,240
You're not hungry?

249
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,120
I'm not hungry. I'll take it.

250
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,800
You go.

251
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,520
I'll get it for you.

252
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,400
You take it now.

253
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:31,960
I'll send it.

254
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,760
Send it while it's hot.

255
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,400
-Here. -Okay.

256
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,640
-Here. -Okay.

257
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,240
Go.

258
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:35,960
Tan Xin.

259
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,960
Here, you take this to the roast chicken shop

260
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,040
around the corner.

261
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,160
Hurry and go.

262
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:44,720
I know, Mom.

263
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,520
Go ahead.

264
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,600
Come back early.

265
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,400
Go. Go.

266
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,080
Hurry up.

267
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,320
Go yourself.

268
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,600
Come with me.

269
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,560
Go, go.

270
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,400
Go ahead. Go.

271
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,400
Let's go.

272
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,640
Don't come back early.

273
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,000
Don't listen to them.

274
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,840
I'm not the kind of girl who would say yes

275
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,480
just because of a box of chocolates.

276
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,320
I didn't send you

277
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,640
that box of chocolates.

278
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,400
It's okay.

279
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,360
Why are you embarrassed to admit?

280
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,280
It was really not from me.

281
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,480
Fine.

282
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,960
It was not from you.

283
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,560
I bought it myself, okay?

284
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,360
You were just embarrassed to admit it.

285
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,080
What's wrong with her?

286
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,400
Finished?

287
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,320
I just finished too.

288
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,520
Let's go play games.

289
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,120
We were stuck here last time.

290
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,440
It's the only way. Look.

291
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,400
You can't get in.

292
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,560
If I come down like this, I'll be dead.

293
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,720
Guo Star.

294
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,680
Which did you choose for the first question in chemistry?

295
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,360
B.

296
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,480
Why?

297
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,680
I didn't know. I just guessed.

298
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,640
Tan Xin, you really asked a wise man.

299
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,320
Then I'll choose C.

300
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,600
In that case, either of us will be right.

301
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,000
What are you laughing at? It's probability. Understand?

302
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,200
Impressive.

303
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,040
Awesome.

304
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,720
Choose D.

305
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,440
Carbon monoxide is burned with oxygen

306
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,400
to produce carbon dioxide.

307
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,240
That's the most basic formula.

308
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,840
You have to remember that.

309
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,800
What are you doing

310
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,040
like a worm?

311
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,360
I may have grown up.

312
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,400
I have something on my mind

313
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,280
and can't sleep.

314
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,440
Even the thunder can't wake you up.

315
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,520
Why can't you sleep?

316
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,200
Let me guess.

317
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,400
I see.

318
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,560
Did Gao Zhiyuan say he likes you?

319
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:14,720
No.

320
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,720
Then he should be preparing.

321
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,560
What do you think I should do if he really says that?

322
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,920
It's simple.

323
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,600
If you like him, say yes.

324
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,920
If you don't like him, just say no.

325
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,360
You can do whatever you want.

326
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,120
I haven't think.

327
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,160
Then think about it now.

328
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,680
I think I might be in love.

329
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,520
There is no homework today.

330
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,640
Let's go to my house and play games.

331
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,880
I can't go.

332
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,760
My brother is going out. I have to watch the store.

333
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,520
Then we'll go with you

334
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,400
and watch a movie.

335
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,920
Yeah, watching movie.

336
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,440
We haven't seen a movie since school started.

337
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,120
Yeah.

338
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,040
Tan Xin.

339
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,640
Do you want to come?

340
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,240
On a romantic evening,

341
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,800
the boy asks the girl to see a movie

342
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,120
and express his feelings

343
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,760
in the dim light.

344
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,360
I'm not going.

345
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,840
I have things to do.

346
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,960
What thing?

347
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,160
What's wrong with you?

348
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,600
You usually organize this.

349
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,640
None of your business.

350
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,800
I don't want to

351
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,600
watch the recent movies.

352
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,000
My brother has a lot of good movies

353
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,240
and old movies to watch.

354
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,160
It's just a movie. What are you thinking?

355
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,600
What was I thinking?

356
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,840
Alright. You didn't think.

357
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,240
Why are you yelling?

358
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,840
Did I yell?

359
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,800
So emotional.

360
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,000
I'll go. What's the big deal?

361
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,440
-Darn it. -What's going on?

362
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,440
Chen Cheng.

363
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,400
What's wrong? You pissed her off?

364
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,070
Not me. Something's wrong with her.

365
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,440
Hurry up.

366
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,200
Hurry up.

367
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,520
I'm gonna go to the bathroom first.

368
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,080
Hello.

369
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,680
Uncle Guo.

370
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,440
What's up?

371
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,320
OK.

372
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,960
Fucheng.

373
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,440
Your dad asked you to come home for dinner.

374
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:10,960
OK.

375
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,920
You guys wait for me.

376
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,840
I'll come back and continue.

377
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,320
I'll go with you.

378
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,800
My mom will call me later.

379
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,840
It's about time to come home.

380
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,840
Then I'll go with you.

381
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,160
My grandma should call me later.

382
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,160
Come on, let's go.

383
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,320
Take care.

384
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,160
Bye.

385
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,560
Take care.

386
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,200
Tell Tan Xin to wait for me.

387
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,040
I'll be right back.

388
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,040
Where are they?

389
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,000
They went home.

390
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,920
Lizi asked you to wait for her here.

391
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,440
She'll be back soon.

392
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,520
Then I'll wait for her.

393
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,440
Well, we're too young

394
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,200
to watch this...

395
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,120
All right, stop.

396
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,800
I see.

397
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,720
Thank you for the chocolate.

398
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,720
I thought about it for a long time,

399
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,560
and I've figured it out.

400
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,760
I can't accept you.

401
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,720
We have been good friends growing up,

402
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,280
and I hope so in the future.

403
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,560
Tan...

404
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,140
[Receipt]

405
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,320
Tan Xin.

406
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,560
What happened to them?

407
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,880
My uncle was caught by my aunt secretly buying

408
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,040
chocolate for someone else.

409
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,160
Take a look.

410
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,960
I admit I bought it.

411
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,480
You admit?

412
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,440
No, I bought it for you.

413
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,760
Stop making it up.

414
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,840
I haven't even seen a chocolate chip.

415
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,800
For me?

416
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,840
I wanted to surprise you.

417
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,080
But I felt embarrassed.

418
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,880
Wenying.

419
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,360
Dad.

420
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,800
You're home.

421
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,640
Then I wanted to hide it.

422
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,720
I was in a hurry, and, and

423
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,880
hid it in the schoolbag.

424
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,120
And she carried it to school.

425
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,320
Why didn't you say so earlier?

426
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,200
Dad.

427
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,120
You bought that chocolate?

428
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,160
How dare I lie now?

429
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,920
The receipt is here, for real.

430
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,400
Tan Xin.

431
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,080
Listen to me.

432
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,360
I wanted to explain it to you.

433
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,520
I wanted to tell you the truth.

434
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,080
I don't want you to take the blame, you know?

435
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,240
I'll buy you two ice creams tomorrow.

436
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,640
Four.

437
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,480
See?

438
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,600
How could you take such expensive chocolates?

439
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,600
Just laugh at me.

440
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,640
Anyway, I've lost all my face.

441
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,040
You've done enough humiliated things.

442
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,920
It was your fault.

443
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,960
You said Gao Zhiyuan would confess his love to me.

444
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,880
I just turned him down brazenly.

445
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,360
What did I say to him?

446
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,240
He must think I'm out of my mind.

447
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,600
Who knew my uncle bought the chocolate?

448
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,240
This is the chocolate I received.

449
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,120
It's all yours, okay?

450
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,720
I remember

451
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,200
there is a sweet and bitter combination.

452
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,800
Litchi, rose and milk flavor.

453
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,400
For me?

454
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,720
Take it easy.

455
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,200
It's not much.

456
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,640
Delicious.

457
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,600
Of course it's delicious. It's expensive.

458
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,640
For you.

459
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:49,840
Tan Xin.

460
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,520
Morning.

461
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,000
I'm sorry to bother you to make sweet dumplings

462
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,360
for me every year.

463
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,680
Don't we take it for free every year?

464
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,560
Yeah.

465
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,280
After dinner tonight,

466
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,520
come and eat it together.

467
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,400
Okay.

468
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:12,840
Jiao.

469
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,400
Sure.

470
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,400
Jiao.

471
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,840
Jin Zhi, it's you.

472
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,520
Yeah. You're all here.

473
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,480
My shop is officially open for business

474
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,440
in time for the Lantern Festival.

475
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,320
I came to bring you a little present.

476
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,720
We're all neighbors.

477
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,920
You don't need to do that.

478
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,160
We should go to your shop often.

479
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,800
Sorry to let you send it in person.

480
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,280
Yeah, it's quite heavy.

481
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,440
Here, let me get it for you.

482
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,280
No, just a few pieces of paper.

483
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,920
You people are really good at business.

484
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,840
Even the gift has to be wrapped in paper.

485
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,280
You see, we don't...

486
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,560
It's coupons.

487
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,280
For each of you.

488
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,800
You can use it anytime.

489
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,640
Here, take it.

490
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,320
Okay, thank you.

491
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,000
I'm coming.

492
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,800
Here, take it.

493
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,320
Here I am.

494
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,320
Give me another one.

495
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,040
She is our neighbor, right?

496
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,520
Yeah, she's Yumei from the Chen's.

497
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,480
Just in time.

498
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,120
Hello.

499
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,080
This is for you.

500
00:25:59,080 --> 00:25:59,880
Take it.

501
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,440
I will go and send these to others.

502
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,280
OK.

503
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,400
Come over for sweet dumplings later.

504
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,240
Thank you.

505
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,440
Take it easy.

506
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,000
After school, the happiest time every day.

507
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,560
Waiting from the first class until the last one.

508
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,240
You too, right?

509
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,080
For sure.

510
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,280
Tan Xin, wait for us.

511
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,080
Tan...

512
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,320
Tan Xin, you run so fast.

513
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,520
Is there a mad dog chasing you?

514
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,720
You mean yourself,

515
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,400
not us.

516
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,400
Who, who's mad dog?

517
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,840
What's wrong with her?

518
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,760
Come on, let's go.

519
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,600
As usual,

520
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,160
let's take pictures together after dinner.

521
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,440
I have something to do, so I'm not going.

522
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,200
What thing do you have to do today?

523
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,240
I'm not going anyway.

524
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,320
Just leave me alone.

525
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,760
Why is Tan Xin acting weird these days?

526
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,680
Maybe she's in bad mood.

527
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,800
Great. Sweet dumplings.

528
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,680
Sit down and eat.

529
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,880
Dad, where's my camera?

530
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,240
I put it on the table.

531
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,680
One more.

532
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,520
Sit down.

533
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,360
It's okay.

534
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,440
Where are you going?

535
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,880
Eat some before you go.

536
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,720
It's okay, Dad.

537
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,960
Here. Here.

538
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,240
Look at you. What's in a hurry?

539
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,680
You haven't eat the dishes yet

540
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,880
and almost finished the rice.

541
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,600
Come on, have some more.

542
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,200
Dad, you eat more.

543
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,640
Guo Fucheng.

544
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,480
Dad, my classmate is here, I have to go.

545
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,960
Enjoy the meal.

546
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,800
If you want to eat, eat more.

547
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,800
Otherwise, I'll clean it up.

548
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,800
I have to go to the store to cook sweet dumplings.

549
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,360
Go, go, go ahead.

550
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:42,960
Hurry.

551
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,560
It's good for us to be at home, right?

552
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,000
Tan Xin, are you going?

553
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:01,960
I'm not going.

554
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,400
Why don't you go?

555
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,680
I don't want to go.

556
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,320
Tan Xin, let's go.

557
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,680
Chen Cheng.

558
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:14,760
Uncle Tan.

559
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,000
Guo Fucheng.

560
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,760
Hi.

561
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:17,920
Here are some chicken left.

562
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,640
Who wants to eat?

563
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,560
Eat it up.

564
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,280
Come on.

565
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,160
Then I'll eat.

566
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,960
Here, Guo Fucheng, eat it up.

567
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,520
Thank you, uncle.

568
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,800
Come on, Tan Xin.

569
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,040
Good boy.

570
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,640
Go.

571
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,320
Are you really not going?

572
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,960
No.

573
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:31,960
No.

574
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,200
Okay, then let's go.

575
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,800
Let's go.

576
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,200
You go and take more pictures.

577
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,120
Okay.

578
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Those kids

579
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,120
left the camera here.

580
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,520
Coming.

581
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:09,960
Yeah?

582
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,720
She's coming.

583
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,280
Coming.

584
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,160
Here she comes.

585
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,640
Why are you here?

586
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,880
We're

587
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,560
waiting for you.

588
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,120
I'm here to give you the camera.

589
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,600
I'm not going to guess lantern riddles.

590
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,120
Yeah

591
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,720
Why don't you return this camera?

592
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,160
We really can't take pictures.

593
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:32,880
Yeah.

594
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,520
I just came to give it back to you.

595
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,120
Thank you.

596
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,280
Then I'll go.

597
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,720
This is enough for you.

598
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,960
We've been waiting for you.

599
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,840
Yeah.

600
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,840
All right.

601
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,920
All right, let's go.

602
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,920
Let's go guess lantern riddles.

603
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,240
Boring.

604
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,280
Let's take pictures.

605
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,640
Tan Xin.

606
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,320
Sorry.

607
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,040
What is there to be sorry for?

608
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,160
I knew.

609
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,760
You didn't give me the chocolate.

610
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,560
I already told you.

611
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,200
You didn't believe me.

612
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,200
Then why did you say it was from you

613
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,200
in front of the director?

614
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,440
If I didn't say it,

615
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,120
you would be punished.

616
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,760
Because

617
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,440
you told me that

618
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,040
I was your best friend.

619
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,160
Yeah, you're my best friend.

620
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,520
Let's go.

621
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:56,500
♫Hello, youth♫

622
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:00,140
♫Warm eyes♫

623
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:03,620
♫Looking at the farthest place♫

624
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,660
♫We set out♫

625
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,140
♫To find the dream♫

626
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,960
A box of chocolates,

627
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,960
a casual move,

628
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,400
a moment of eye contact,

629
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,640
are all catalysts of emotion.

630
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,920
This change

631
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,840
is the chemical reaction that comes from the heart.

632
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,480
It's ready.

633
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,760
I can't wait.

634
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,400
Take it easy.

635
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,280
Here, be careful.

636
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:29,960
Here.

637
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,520
I'll help you with it.

638
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,480
How's it? Hurry. Here you are.

639
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,360
Be careful.

640
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:36,840
Okay.

641
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,920
You take these

642
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,120
and roast chicken

643
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,080
to Lizi and Tan Xin.

644
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,960
Tan Xin likes chicken.

645
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,480
There are some left.

646
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,520
Mei, you take it.

647
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,360
I bought it too.

648
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,120
I stood in long line at night to buy it.

649
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,160
Jiao.

650
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:53,760
Why?

651
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,600
Jiao.

652
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,520
We're all here.

653
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,520
Just in time.

654
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,240
You're all here.

655
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,160
Have some sweet dumplings.

656
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:58,880
No, thanks.

657
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,360
Here's the thing,

658
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,120
you quickly get dressed

659
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:01,920
and tidy up.

660
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,160
Let's go out and see fireworks.

661
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,080
I didn't hear there are fireworks.

662
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,800
I bought a case.

663
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,840
Let's shoot it off ourselves.

664
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,000
And the chemical reaction is not only changing.

665
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,320
There is also integration.

666
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,480
The integration of new neighbors

667
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,520
is like the collision of two strange substances.

668
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,920
These colliding sparks

669
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,920
are the process of getting to know each other.

670
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,040
Only through this process

671
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,440
can we eliminate strangeness and accept each other

672
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,760
to build more harmonious neighborhood.

673
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:30,720
Of course,

674
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,520
some chemical reactions can be very dangerous.

675
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:34,760
Qiang.

676
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,200
Did you put it upside down?

677
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,240
Of course not.

678
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,800
Uncle Tan.

679
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,000
Fire.

680
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,600
Five.

681
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,960
Four.

682
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,160
