00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,875
DALAH: DEATH AND THE FLOWERS

2
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:51,291
- Be careful, it's hot.
- Yes, of course.

3
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:53,208
- Go! Quickly.
- Yes, ma'am.

4
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:01,500
- Hey, Pete, how's the hangover?
- So dizzy.

5
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,208
We've got a family wedding today,

6
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:30,500
and instead of getting up early to help,
you slept in like always.

7
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:31,708
What kind of in-law are you?

8
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:36,000
Since you're such an early riser,
what have you helped with this morning?

9
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,583
Oh, wait,
you helped yourself to breakfast.

10
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:46,291
Eldest in-law,
let me give you a little lesson.

11
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,958
If your family's up so early,

12
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,625
finish breakfast quickly
and help with preparations

13
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,333
like a good in-law.

14
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:55,875
Thank you, Jib.
But actually, I did my part last night.

15
00:02:57,041 --> 00:03:00,250
Pa, I've already sorted out
the flower issues.

16
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:04,500
They're using only the big tulips,
and I removed some of the roses.

17
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,166
So the numbers match.

18
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:08,083
Mm, thank you.

19
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:15,250
Actually, I crumpled up
some of the roses too.

20
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,458
- What's so funny?
- Who does that?

21
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,500
I did that to make sure
our flowers stand out more.

22
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:23,666
Mm, what a simply amazing effort.

23
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,333
Definitely deserving
of the "Best In-Law Award," I'd say.

24
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:30,375
Jib, save that tone
for lecturing your son,

25
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:33,416
and then maybe
he'll be as good as our daughter,

26
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,625
so there'll be some hope for our family.

27
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,833
It's already late, and he's still not up.

28
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:42,250
- How did you raise him?
- But your sister isn't here either, Sak.

29
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,291
Now that we're going to have
a Chinese in-law,

30
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,291
we're eating porridge for breakfast.

31
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:53,666
More like Lamduan knows
it's good for a hangover.

32
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:58,291
Well, Mr. Pete and Mr. Sit
threw up a lot last night.

33
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:03,208
Where were you last night?
You two look like a mess.

34
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:07,291
Well, we went bar-hopping
around Thong Lor.

35
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:11,333
He dragged me to the first bar,
then we moved to another.

36
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:15,791
When I woke up,
I couldn't remember how many bars.

37
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:19,166
Listen, drinking is an art form.

38
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:25,541
So anyway, what do you prefer?
Beer, whiskey, brandy, bourbon, or gin?

39
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,916
You look like… a gin person.

40
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,291
You couldn't get enough of gin last night.

41
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,500
Stop trying to turn my son
into you, Uncle.

42
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,375
Father would be so damn proud.

43
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:36,625
Oh, big brother.

44
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,125
I'm not even half of what Ohm is.

45
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,666
Uh, Pam, what's wrong?

46
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,416
Pam, what happened to your face?

47
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:47,625
I fell over.

48
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,166
Where? At the floral studio?

49
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,208
You should be more careful.

50
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:56,458
Lamduan, can you come and treat this cut?

51
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,750
Lamduan? Oh!

52
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:01,625
I'll look after it.

53
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,416
Hey, has Ohm already gone to the hotel?

54
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,083
I haven't seen him.

55
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,041
Why isn't Risa here yet?

56
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,833
It's her wedding today.

57
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,708
Kris either.

58
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,708
Those two do everything together.

59
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,208
Aren't they unusually close?

60
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:29,125
Risa is Kris's aunt.
Of course they're close.

61
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,791
I think it's more than just close.

62
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:32,750
That's nonsense.

63
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:44,291
Great-grandson, it looks good on you.

64
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,416
No need to return it.

65
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,708
Great-Grandma, I thank you.

66
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:56,250
So, I heard my name.
What are you talking about?

67
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:03,041
We were all just wondering
where your aunt is.

68
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:07,833
Oh, she's gone to have her makeup done.
She'll be at the hotel.

69
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:10,666
Make sure the flash
doesn't wash out my grandson's face.

70
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,125
Excuse me.

71
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:20,916
Hello?

72
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,750
<i>Kris, why so quiet?</i>

73
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,416
I'm just curious, that's all.

74
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:31,125
No one in the family
seems to know where Risa is,

75
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,208
but you seem to know all her movements.

76
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,083
Something going on?

77
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,250
Something wrong, Pop?

78
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:43,541
Even Ohm doesn't seem to know
as much about Risa's story

79
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:44,791
as you do, Kris.

80
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,791
Isn't that strange?

81
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:49,500
Why are you acting weird?
Is something wrong?

82
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:51,833
Can anyone reach Ohm?

83
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,083
Dad, what happened?

84
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,333
Anybody know where Risa is?

85
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:01,041
I'm telling you to be cautious,
in case something happens.

86
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,583
I'm asking you what happened.

87
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,375
The police called.

88
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:09,333
I don't know any more about Aunt Risa
than anyone else here.

89
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,500
I just know
that if it is your wedding day,

90
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:15,166
you have to get your makeup done
in the morning.

91
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,416
Is there anything other than that?

92
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,916
They said…

93
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:28,875
- What the fuck?
- What did you say? Can't be true.

94
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,833
What the hell?

95
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:36,541
I was tired
and slept like a log last night.

96
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,333
Jae Som's call woke me.

97
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,166
She said Mr. Anusorn's body
was found in my studio.

98
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,041
What time did she call you?

99
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,416
Um, around 6:00 a.m.

100
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,166
Mm-hmm. Please continue.

101
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:51,166
Then I called Risa,
his bride-to-be,

102
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,291
but I haven't been able to reach her.

103
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,375
- Find her immediately.
- Yes, sir.

104
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,750
The family is on the way now
to see the body.

105
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,708
What's going on inside?

106
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,750
Mr. Ekapop,
care to make a statement?

107
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,208
- No press allowed beyond here.
- Mr. Ekapop!

108
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:29,541
Mr. Anusorn was shot in the abdomen.
That was the cause of death.

109
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,583
We didn't find any gun at the scene.

110
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:45,625
Wait in the car.

111
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:50,000
Ohm, my brother! My brother…

112
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:15,875
Who did this?

113
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:19,541
Forensics will need to examine
the scratches on the arm

114
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:23,333
and the cuts on the victim's face.
We're following protocols, sir.

115
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,416
I want a more capable detective.

116
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:29,958
But this is my jurisdiction, sir.

117
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,166
I don't care.

118
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,166
Montree.

119
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,166
<i>A shocking and tragic incident</i>
<i>this morning,</i>

120
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,416
<i>Dr. Anusorn Uathepa found dead.</i>

121
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,625
<i>A candidate for PM,</i>
<i>he was the only son of Mr. Ekapop Uathepa,</i>

122
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:14,458
<i>former chief of staff</i>
<i>at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</i>

123
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:17,000
<i>Our reporter is now updating</i>
<i>from the crime scene.</i>

124
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,583
- Turn up the volume.
- <i>Good morning, Miss Thapana.</i>

125
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:22,416
<i>What's the situation</i>
<i>there on the ground as it's unfolding?</i>

126
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,333
<i>The police are questioning individuals</i>
<i>involved with the floral studio.</i>

127
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:29,291
<i>- Does not appear to be any clear motive.</i>
- Here's your coffee.

128
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:32,583
- <i>The high-profile wedding…</i>
- Whoa! How was that?

129
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,500
What? Huh?

130
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:36,875
Check this out.

131
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,541
Mew, check the news.

132
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:41,125
<i>Is there any indication whether</i>
<i>the motive is personal…</i>

133
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,083
What?

134
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,500
Risa! Risa!

135
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,708
Open the door! Are you okay?

136
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:52,791
LEK

137
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,625
She's not picking up.

138
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,833
Pa. Ohm is dead.

139
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,125
WHO KILLED OHM?
IS THAI POLITICS THIS BRUTAL?

140
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:08,958
PITY. STILL YOUNG AND HOT

141
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,666
<i>The body is undergoing</i>
<i>an autopsy.</i>

142
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,041
<i>There is still no statement</i>
<i>from the For Thai Society Party,</i>

143
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:23,250
<i>but this is expected to have a huge impact</i>
<i>on their election campaign.</i>

144
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:29,625
<i>We must now wait</i>
<i>for the police to investigate.</i>

145
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:30,958
Party's next move?

146
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,250
- There's nothing decided yet.
- New candidate?

147
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:36,916
- We do not have any clear answers.
- Opinion on this incident?

148
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,875
As a representative of a competing party,

149
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:44,125
I extend our condolences
to the Uathepa family…

150
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,416
<i>…for the loss of Anusorn Uathepa</i>

151
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,166
<i>in this tragic homicide.</i>

152
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,375
The family has no comment.

153
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,750
<i>…a young man</i>
<i>who displayed immense potential.</i>

154
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:53,666
MORNING NEWS

155
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,291
<i>The whole nation is completely shocked.</i>

156
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:59,083
<i>Dr. Anusorn Uathepa was a beacon of hope</i>

157
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,166
<i>His campaign attracted immense interest.</i>

158

<i>The image of hope</i>

159
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,458
<i>but let's not forget that Dr. Anusorn</i>

<i>was also instrumental in planning</i>

161
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,958
Is our business affected by this?

162
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,208
Pong?

163
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,458
Uh… uh…

164
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,125
I don't think so, Pa.

165
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:28,333
We've already received their land
as part of the dowry.

166
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:32,458
It's even better for us now
that we don't have to care at all

167
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:33,750
about his politics.

168
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,333
We can now ignore the protest

169
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,541
and turn the Square into a mall
as planned.

170
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,416
Yes, you're right. Good.

171
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:45,875
Uh, I can help handle the donations
for Ohm's funeral expenses.

172
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:50,125
Only senior family members handle finance.

173
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,166
Yes, that's right.

174
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,958
I will talk to them myself.

175
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,916
Well, has anyone found out where Risa is?

176
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,958
Uh, Kris has gone to find her.

177
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,291
No need to worry, Pa.

178
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:04,833
All the more reason to worry.

179
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,416
She's still inside?

180
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,083
Yes, it's been hours. Her phone's off too.

181
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,583
Here.

182
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:30,375
Noomnim?

183
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:31,375
Risa?

184
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,125
Risa, it's me.

185
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:41,833
There's no need to worry.
Miss Risa just wants to be alone.

186
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,041
Still a little girl.

187
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,583
- Hello, sir.
- Do you have anything to say?

188
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,333
Can you give us a statement?

189
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,666
- Anything to say?
- Good morning. This way, sir.

190
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,166
- Can you answer questions?
- Updates?

191
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:13,916
Excuse us.

192
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,416
- Sir? Sir?
- Can you make a statement?

193
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,666
Can we at least get a photo?

194
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,833
This way, sir.
She's waiting inside for you.

195
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,458
Good morning, sir.

196
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,500
Miss Dalah Rose.

197
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:54,458
Did you hear anything
particularly unusual last night?

198
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:57,416
I heard an electrical transformer explode.

199
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,166
Then I went to bed.

200
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,833
So nobody heard a gunshot?

201
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,416
There were fireworks going all night.

202
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,750
I see.

203
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:13,916
Jae Som,
when did you call Dalah about the body?

204
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,583
Around six.

205
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:20,416
You were at the studio last night, yes?

206
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,125
That's right,
but I was the first to leave.

207
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:26,166
The bride and groom were still there
when I left,

208
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,125
and also a girl.

209
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,708
I think she was a cousin
or something like that.

210
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:31,625
Pam.

211
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:35,666
Are you familiar with Pam?

212
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,750
I'm the one asking questions here.

213
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:43,291
They came to check out the flowers,

214
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,625
because we had some problems
with the tulips.

215
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,083
Why was Pam there?

216
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,541
I was just tagging along.

217
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:56,458
I talked to Uncle Ohm about his campaign,
and I wanted to discuss it again.

218
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,041
How did you get that-- that scratch?

219
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:04,666
I tripped running to my girlfriend's car.
I didn't want to keep her waiting.

220
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:08,541
Why didn't you go home with your Uncle Ohm
or Risa, since you came with them?

221
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,500
I'd looked at the flowers,
and I'd spoken to Uncle Ohm.

222
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
- The adults were so boring.
- Still, you didn't need to call her.

223
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:22,000
Okay. I'll tell you the truth.

224
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:26,666
My girlfriend was itching for it.

225
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,000
Itching?

226
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:33,750
PAM'S FOOTPRINT

227
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:40,250
Pam left at around 10:30 p.m.

228
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:45,458
That's the time Mr. Ekapop and Mrs. Prapha
approved my floral design.

229
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:47,916
Then they left as well.

230
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,958
Why did Mrs. Prapha come,
and not Mr. Kitja?

231
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,833
You think Pa wanted to check himself?

232
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:57,250
That's why he has a dependable in-law
like me.

233
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,375
I'm the eldest.

234
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,666
It's natural
that I look after his interests.

235
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:03,791
How did you get there?

236
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:08,416
I drove my wife there,
and then I waited in the car.

237
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,833
- Any witnesses?
- I came out to see off Mrs. Prapha.

238
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,291
See you tomorrow.

239
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,291
See you.

240
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,458
<i>I didn't see anyone in the car.</i>

241
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:19,125
<i>I was napping</i>
<i>on the reclining seat.</i>

242
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,375
<i>That's why no one saw me.</i>

243
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,166
But I did see Kris.

244
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,666
Mr. Kris was also there.

245
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,250
He was talking to Risa.

246
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,208
They were in the garden outside.

247
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,291
It looked to me as if they were arguing.

248
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,875
My aunt and I had an argument
about my work.

249
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,416
- Aunt?
- Miss Narisa.

250
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
What work?

251
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,666
<i>About the music</i>
<i>for the feminist campaign.</i>

252
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:43,500
Creative differences.

253
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:46,500
You disagree
with the principles of feminism?

254
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:47,833
When did I say that?

255
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,333
And then after that?

256
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:52,583
I wasn't at the crime scene.
I was home with Pong.

257
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,250
I was at home with Jib.

258
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,416
I was using my iPad in my room.

259
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,333
Oh, thanks.

260
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,625
<i>Lek was with me.</i>

261
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:09,500
Last night,
I was in Thong Lor with Pete at a bar.

262
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:11,875
Hey, Grand-Uncle!

263
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,541
<i>We were plastered.</i>
<i>I don't remember anything.</i>

264
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:20,500
I was on the phone with my secretary
about my foundation.

265
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,458
<i>Grandma was with me. You can ask her.</i>

266
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,375
<i>I was at home with Mother.</i>

267
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,625
I mean Kris's great-grandmother.

268
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:32,291
<i>We watched a Korean TV show</i>
<i>and ate chestnuts together.</i>

269
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:36,083
Ekapop.

270
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,750
I already told you when I first called.

271
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:46,875
I went to check the flowers
and then settle the payment.

272
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,291
I didn't see him at the studio,

273
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,500
but Dalah said Ohm and Risa were there.

274
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:57,541
When was your last conversation
with Mr. Anusorn?

275
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:01,375
I can't remember.

276
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,083
No one was in the studio when I came back.

277
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,375
Then I saw Narisa and Kris
go their separate ways.

278
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,000
And Mr. Anusorn?

279
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,833
I saw Mr. Anusorn drive out
around 11:00 p.m.

280
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:19,958
I locked the studio
and came back in at about 11:30.

281
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:24,208
I have no idea
why he returned to the studio.

282
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:26,625
Or to meet whom or why.

283
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,541
You said you locked up?
How could Anusorn have got inside?

284
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,208
It's a digital lock.

285
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:35,041
I gave everyone the passcode
when we first arrived.

286
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:46,166
<i>Ohm, Risa, Dalah, and Pam</i>
<i>were first to arrive at the studio</i>

287
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,875
<i>at 9:30 p.m.</i>

288
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:50,000
They're beautiful.

289
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:54,000
<i>Then Pam went out to talk to Ohm</i>
<i>near the bathroom outside the studio.</i>

290
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,208
I want to ask you about your campaign.

291
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,208
Sure. Ask away.

292
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,166
<i>Risa stepped out</i>
<i>to the garden at the back,</i>

293
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,916
<i>where she had a fight with Kris.</i>

294
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,958
<i>- No idea when he arrived.</i>
- Feminism?

295
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:07,416
I can't write a song like that.
It's demeaning to women.

296
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,541
<i>Around the same time,</i>

297
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:12,291
<i>Mrs. Prapha, Mr. Kittisak, and Mr. Ekapop</i>
<i>arrived at the studio,</i>

298
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,583
<i>but left shortly after.</i>

299
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:15,583
<i>At 10:30 p.m.,</i>

300
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:18,583
<i>Pam's girlfriend Bee picked her up</i>
<i>from the backstreet entrance</i>

301
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:19,916
<i>on the garden side.</i>

302
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,791
<i>At 11:00 p.m.,</i>
<i>Ohm and Narisa left in his car.</i>

303
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,166
There's one person
who could tell us everything,

304
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,625
who is still unreachable.

305
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,875
I heard that her family has located her.

306
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:52,166
And apparently,
she is holed up at the hotel.

307
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:54,416
That's worrying.

308
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,041
Right, about her state of mind.

309
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:01,416
More like… her possible involvement.

310
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,958
<i>How was it? What have you got?</i>

311
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:13,000
We still can't conclude anything

312
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,541
until the forensic report determines
the exact time of Ohm's death.

313
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:23,250
For now, there are outstanding aspects
to the investigation

314
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,958
while the bullet found in his body
is under examination.

315
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,583
His phone was damaged.

316
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,916
We're attempting to fix it
and retrieve the data.

317
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:35,416
My investigators at the crime scene
haven't found any new evidence as yet.

318
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:40,125
Pop, while we wait for the autopsy report
and the other evidence,

319
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,416
I need your permission.

320
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,458
I need to send men to your house.

321
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,083
We'll search Ohm's room
and personal belongings

322
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:48,000
in case we find something useful.

323
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:50,625
I will need your cooperation on this.

324
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:52,750
It's standard procedure.

325
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,625
I'm sorry for your loss.

326
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,208
I've known Ohm since he was a little boy.

327
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:02,000
You can rest assured
that we will find justice for him.

328
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:05,708
I'll be heading to the hotel later
to see Narisa.

329
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,500
She doesn't want to see anyone.

330
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:13,458
Her boyfriend is dead!
Wouldn't she want to say goodbye?

331
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,375
People handle shock in different ways.

332
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:18,958
Being shocked is not an excuse.

333
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:25,583
Can't you even let her grieve?

334
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:31,708
He's dead. He didn't leave her.

335
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:37,083
I'll excuse myself.

336
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:06,125
Lamduan,
get Ohm's room ready for the police.

337
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:07,958
Understood?

338
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:17,666
Why are there reporters here too? Hey!

339
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:22,000
Sir! I'm sorry, come this way.
Didn't I tell you all to wait outside?!

340
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,791
What the hell? Why did you let them in?

341
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:27,041
My apologies, sir. This way.

342
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,333
This way, sir.

343
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:37,708
Apologies, sir.

344
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,583
Miss Dalah. Why are you here?

345
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:52,833
- Chief Montree is--
- We've already met.

346
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,500
I want to check in on Risa too.

347
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,500
- Something feels not right.
- I know.

348
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,083
Miss Narisa! This is the police!

349
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:25,500
Please open the door, Miss Narisa.

350
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:28,125
Miss Narisa?

351
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:30,833
May I try?

352
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:36,958
Risa.

353
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,250
It's Dalah.

354
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:46,708
Mr. Sarath, if you don't have a spare key,
we will have to break in.

355
00:24:49,416 --> 00:24:50,250
I do.

356
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:52,250
Allow me.

357
00:25:22,916 --> 00:25:23,958
Interesting.

358
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,041
Good afternoon, members of the press.

359
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:04,375
I'm here today to update you all
on the murder of Dr. Anusorn Uathepa,

360
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,625
and the ongoing investigation.

361
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:13,708
Even though the police
have yet to recover the murder weapon

362
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:15,916
or the bullet casing from the crime scene,

363
00:26:16,916 --> 00:26:20,000
we have, however,
successfully tested the single bullet

364
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:21,791
that killed Dr. Anusorn.

365
00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:24,541
The bullet came from a .38-caliber weapon.

366
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:28,750
Additionally, there was visible damage
to the tip of the bullet.

367
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:33,416
We have matched this information
with several guns in the police registry.

368
00:26:34,166 --> 00:26:36,916
A certain number of possible
or likely matches.

369
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:40,375
One of the registered gun owners
on the list

370
00:26:40,458 --> 00:26:43,375
is Ms. Narisa Tangsinsup, namely.

371
00:26:43,458 --> 00:26:45,291
- Miss Narisa?
- Really?

372
00:26:45,875 --> 00:26:46,875
Please let me finish.

373
00:26:47,458 --> 00:26:51,416
Miss Narisa has also disappeared,
and we've been unable to locate her.

374
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,375
This is sufficient grounds
for the investigation team

375
00:26:54,458 --> 00:26:55,625
to issue a warrant.

376
00:26:55,708 --> 00:26:59,375
She must report to police
to give her statement immediately.

377
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:01,375
She killed Mr. Anusorn
and ran away?

378
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:03,625
Uh, she's currently only a suspect.

379
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:06,500
Wait. Uh… um…

380
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,166
So she's the likely killer?

381
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:10,500
I didn't say that.
Please don't put words in my mouth.

382
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:12,041
Can you tell us more?

383
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:15,333
Do you have any information
regarding her whereabouts?

384
00:27:22,416 --> 00:27:24,375
<i>Here is a video simulation.</i>

385
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:26,375
<i>If Ms. Narisa was standing here,</i>

386
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:30,833
<i>the bullet's trajectory</i>
<i>would have pierced Mr. Anusorn's abdomen.</i>

387
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:32,666
<i>Mm. So cold-blooded!</i>

388
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,750
<i>Right. From such a close range,</i>

389
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:38,708
<i>the bullet would no doubt have caused</i>
<i>significant internal damage, like this,</i>

390
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:40,416
<i>to Mr. Anusorn.</i>

391
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,458
<i>- She's so ruthless.</i>
<i>- Right.</i>

392
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:45,375
Hey, a leaked photo
of Ohm's dead body.

393
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:47,833
I TOLD YOU THE WIFE IS THE KILLER

394
00:27:49,208 --> 00:27:51,083
QUEEN OF FAKENESS

395
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:53,916
<i>Can't believe</i>
<i>she'd kill her own boyfriend.</i>

396
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,708
<i>Craving attention. A real bitch.</i>

397
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:57,625
SHE MUST HAVE A LOVER

398
00:27:57,708 --> 00:27:59,541
WHO'LL BE OUR NEXT PM NOW? ASSHOLE!

399
00:28:00,375 --> 00:28:01,458
#RISATHEMURDERER

400
00:28:01,541 --> 00:28:02,666
Hey, look at this.

401
00:28:03,166 --> 00:28:05,375
UATHEPARASITE
HOW MANY BODIES WOULD BE ENOUGH?

402
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:13,416
THE CLOSEST TO YOU IS THE MOST DANGEROUS
#RISAKILLEDOHM

403
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,666
Jaa, what are you doing?

404
00:28:16,416 --> 00:28:19,166
The cops are coming.
We need to get the room ready.

405
00:28:20,458 --> 00:28:21,375
The cops?

406
00:28:21,458 --> 00:28:23,666
Yeah. Will you help me or not?

407
00:28:25,416 --> 00:28:27,583
<i>She's a woman,</i>
<i>and yet she's against the campaign.</i>

408
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:29,458
<i>Narisa is Thai Chinese.</i>

409
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,000
<i>Do you think marrying into money</i>
<i>means luxury life?</i>

410
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:35,750
She looks very shifty, doesn't she?
Yeah, she seems so insincere.

411
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:37,291
I told you she did it!

412
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:40,458
<i>The family already got the dowry,</i>
<i>so she fucking got him.</i>

413
00:28:40,541 --> 00:28:41,500
<i>A real bitch.</i>

414
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,375
<i>What a slut.</i>

415
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,666
- Hey.
- Daddy, you're so late.

416
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,958
I missed you!

417
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:52,958
That's my girl!

418
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:55,958
She wouldn't take it off
until Daddy saw it first.

419
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:58,250
Everyone says I look beautiful.

420
00:28:59,166 --> 00:29:01,750
Ah! Of course my daughter is beautiful.

421
00:29:03,166 --> 00:29:05,333
What's that?

422
00:29:05,416 --> 00:29:06,750
What's that funny smell?

423
00:29:06,833 --> 00:29:10,041
I think…
I think you had better go take a shower.

424
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:13,833
Okay. Do I really smell?

425
00:29:13,916 --> 00:29:15,291
All the way here, honey.

426
00:29:17,958 --> 00:29:19,375
Are you hungry?

427
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:21,416
Uh, not so much.

428
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,291
<i>Netizens blast</i>
<i>Chief Montree's hostile attitude</i>

429
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:27,083
<i>and his "non-statement" statement.</i>

430
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:30,416
<i>His inappropriate response</i>
<i>has sparked a new catchphrase.</i>

431
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,375
<i>"Don't put words into my mouth."</i>

432
00:29:41,708 --> 00:29:43,666
<i>Money is what she's after</i>
<i>in this marriage.</i>

433
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,833
<i>Fake bitch.</i>

434
00:29:45,916 --> 00:29:49,541
- <i>You think, ladies and gentlemen?</i>
- <i>Seems like they agree with us.</i>

435
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:53,958
How long are you going
to listen to this for?

436
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:56,291
I can't take it anymore.

437
00:29:56,375 --> 00:29:57,666
<i>Real bitch.</i>

438
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,125
- I'll turn it off.
- <i>Slut.</i>

439
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:02,083
I'm just monitoring it

440
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:04,833
to see if they say anything negative
about our family.

441
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:07,083
I don't mind if they mention Risa.

442
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:09,333
- Ouch!
- Prapha.

443
00:30:10,083 --> 00:30:11,250
Don't you get it?

444
00:30:12,541 --> 00:30:14,458
If they're talking about her,

445
00:30:14,541 --> 00:30:17,291
they're saying bad things
about our family too.

446
00:30:17,375 --> 00:30:19,708
She's engaged to Ohm now.

447
00:30:19,791 --> 00:30:21,916
She belongs to that family now.

448
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,166
You know what? I don't think Risa did it.

449
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:28,458
You know when she was a kid,
her goldfish died.

450
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:29,958
She was so upset,

451
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:32,541
and she didn't stop crying
for one whole week.

452
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:35,333
When people get older

453
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:38,250
and there are love affairs
that are also involved,

454
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:40,250
they can completely change.

455
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
What do you mean? What love affair?

456
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,833
Hm?

457
00:30:46,708 --> 00:30:49,083
You didn't hear this from me, okay?

458
00:30:49,791 --> 00:30:51,708
I didn't mention it to you, all right?

459
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:54,916
But when we gave our statements
to the police,

460
00:30:55,583 --> 00:30:57,250
<i>someone was lying.</i>

461
00:30:58,208 --> 00:30:59,458
I was home with Pong.

462
00:30:59,541 --> 00:31:03,500
Lek, you told me
that Jib wasn't home on that night.

463
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:05,166
Was that the truth?

464
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:07,083
Yes, Mrs. Pha.

465
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:11,250
On that day,
Mrs. Jib came home really late.

466
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:15,208
Koon said she was looking for Mr. Kris,
so she asked for the key.

467
00:31:19,666 --> 00:31:21,833
- How do you know this?
- We have a group chat.

468
00:31:21,916 --> 00:31:23,541
- BRING THE CAR AROUND
- JIB TOOK THE KEYS

469
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:28,958
But what does Jib have to do
with Risa killing Ohm?

470
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:34,791
Grandma, I didn't really want to say this,

471
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:40,166
but Jib has known all along
that Kris and Risa are in love.

472
00:31:41,958 --> 00:31:45,875
<i>It seems these two have had</i>
<i>an unusually close relationship</i>

473
00:31:45,958 --> 00:31:47,000
<i>for a while now.</i>

474
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,541
<i>Jib knows everything.</i>

475
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:50,958
<i>That's why she came home,</i>

476
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:53,000
<i>then drove out again to look for Kris.</i>

477
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,500
Grandma, I thought I might
have been overthinking things.

478
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:06,500
<i>So I had Lek investigate further,</i>
<i>and it's true.</i>

479
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:19,875
<i>When Risa was getting married,</i>

480
00:32:19,958 --> 00:32:23,000
<i>Kris was upset,</i>
<i>and he went there to confront her.</i>

481
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:25,750
My aunt and I had an argument
about my work.

482
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:28,250
Miss Narisa.

483
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:31,500
I believe Jib knew,
and she tried to stop them.

484
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:34,208
It was probably too late.

485
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,458
What is it that you're saying?

486
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:40,708
Grandma…

487
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:44,625
I'm sorry
for having to tell you the truth.

488
00:32:45,291 --> 00:32:48,583
I alerted you before about taking Jib in.

489
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:52,125
She doesn't raise her kids well.
She's all Thai.

490
00:32:52,208 --> 00:32:55,541
What's wrong with that?
What's so fucking wrong with it?

491
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:59,083
I can't believe
you agree with her, Grandma.

492
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:03,875
I'm going to bed.

493
00:33:05,666 --> 00:33:07,375
What did you say to Grandma?

494
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:09,416
I just told her the truth.

495
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,458
What truth?

496
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,083
If you don't want the police
to know about this scandal,

497
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:17,916
you better tell your father what it is
that his favorite grandson has done.

498
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,291
What?

499
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:22,833
You know what I'm talking about!

500
00:33:22,916 --> 00:33:24,916
And I'm telling you,
I won't let you have everything

501
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,416
just because you have a son.

502
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,500
You think you're entitled
with a lousy son like that

503
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:32,666
when it's your brother Sak
who's the only one who has worked hard?

504
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,375
You shut the fuck up!

505
00:33:34,458 --> 00:33:35,666
I won't shut up!

506
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,625
Tell me which part isn't true?

507
00:33:37,708 --> 00:33:40,041
The fact that Sak
is the only one working hard,

508
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:42,583
or that Kris and Narisa
are having an affair!?

509
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:46,291
You're fucking crazy!
Come, Grandma. I'll take you to bed.

510
00:33:46,375 --> 00:33:49,333
If you don't get real,
I'll tell the police.

511
00:33:50,958 --> 00:33:52,041
Go ahead!

512
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,750
And you think Pa will thank you

513
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:57,791
for dragging his favorite grandson
into trouble?

514
00:33:57,875 --> 00:33:59,875
Sure. Come on, Ma.

515
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:03,958
Such a pain in the ass.

516
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:27,333
WHAT ARE THE POLICE SO SCARED OFF?

517
00:34:29,291 --> 00:34:32,083
You're about to retire.
Why bother with this case?

518
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,541
Look. So many people
making their own judgment.

519
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:37,625
They're all crazy.

520
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:11,250
LAWSUIT

521
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:14,708
AUTOPSY REPORT

522
00:35:14,791 --> 00:35:18,291
EMMA LARSEN
DATE AND TIME OF DEATH: 8 SEPT 1992

523
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:45,875
- She's not moving!
- It's a hit-and-run.

524
00:35:45,958 --> 00:35:47,666
A Westerner. Is she dead?

525
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:50,250
- Someone call the police.
- Did you see the car?

526
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:52,333
Hey. Is she dead?

527
00:37:36,416 --> 00:37:38,416
I didn't know your acting was so good.

528
00:37:41,541 --> 00:37:43,791
<i>You're lucky</i>
<i>I'm a TV series addict.</i>

529
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:45,291
- Hey!
- Yes?

530
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:46,750
Go home and rest now.

531
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:50,125
Big day tomorrow, and the press.

532
00:37:50,916 --> 00:37:51,750
Okay.

533
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:57,041
Finally, you called me.

534
00:37:57,125 --> 00:37:59,416
<i>Dr. Anusorn Uathepa found dead.</i>

535
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:03,333
<i>A candidate for PM, he was the only son</i>
<i>of Mr. Ekapop Uathepa…</i>

536
00:38:03,416 --> 00:38:05,333
<i>What about Noomnim and Kris?</i>

537
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,958
<i>No worries.</i>
<i>They were very convincing.</i>

538
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,291
<i>Not just me.</i>

539
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:18,500
<i>When you came with the police,</i>
<i>your acting was pretty good too.</i>

540
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:19,583
<i>No.</i>

541
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,000
I wasn't acting.

542
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:31,791
- You're naturally deadpan, right?
- Here you go.

543
00:38:36,708 --> 00:38:37,541
Let me help.

544
00:39:26,833 --> 00:39:29,666
<i>When blossoms</i>
<i>reach their peak in bloom,</i>

545
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:34,541
<i>some exude a pungent fume.</i>

546
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:38,083
<i>Yet we tend to value them by their looks.</i>

547
00:39:39,791 --> 00:39:42,625
<i>When flowers start to droop and wither…</i>

548
00:39:44,625 --> 00:39:48,125
<i>unleashing a scent that chokes us bitter.</i>

549
00:39:48,208 --> 00:39:51,208
<i>As if they sought their silent vengeance…</i>

550
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,708
<i>on those who overlooked their scents.</i>
