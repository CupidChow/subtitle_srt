1
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:13,875
We've got the evidence.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,083
Why bother planning any further?

3
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:20,000
Let's just go straight to the police.

4
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:28,083
Well…
this involves the Uathepa family.

5
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:34,416
If we go to the police,
we could get into trouble.

6
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,083
Your family is influential.

7
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:41,916
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:44,708
You have nothing to apologize for.

9
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:48,166
But he's your boyfriend.

10
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:54,875
Can we really make a difference?

11
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:04,666
Well, the evidence from Pam
leaves no room for doubt,

12
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:07,875
and we owe Bee our thanks
for her sacrifice.

13
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:11,208
We must do whatever it takes

14
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,875
to condemn the Uathepas.

15
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:15,833
- But…
- Bee, don't be afraid.

16
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:20,875
I'll protect you.

17
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:32,916
DALAH: DEATH AND THE FLOWERS

18
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,541
We're moving forward
with the investigation

19
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,291
based on all of the available evidence
to hand,

20
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,958
and we're very close
to finding the perpetrator.

21
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:58,375
At this opportunity,
I'd like to urge Dr. Narisa Tangsinsup

22
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:02,166
to turn yourself into the authorities.

23
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,583
In this way, you can prove your innocence.

24
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:08,625
If anyone is harboring her
or detaining her against her will,

25
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:12,125
then I am advising that person
that you are breaking the law.

26
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:16,500
So if you are watching,
you must release her immediately.

27
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,541
- Sir?
- Go ahead.

28
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:21,083
You're saying Dr. Narisa
is another victim?

29
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:23,250
That she's been kidnapped?

30
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,625
We're unable to confirm that just yet.

31
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,000
Pardon me, sir.

32
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,875
Sir, someone wants
to identify the offender.

33
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,125
This way, sir.

34
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:38,375
Take it from here.

35
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:41,083
Sir, wait!

36
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,958
Excuse me, sir,
can you tell us what's happening?

37
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,666
I've known from the start.

38
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,083
That woman hates Uncle Ohm.

39
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,958
They had a big fight once,
and she almost called off the wedding,

40
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:26,291
but he wouldn't let her.

41
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,125
What fight?

42
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,875
Uncle Ohm was using Narisa.

43
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:34,708
I can tell you, truthfully, he's a fake.

44
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,916
Our family propped him up
as some sort of respectable figure,

45
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,291
but he's actually a cad.

46
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:45,375
He did shitty things to countless women,
and Narisa found out.

47
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,958
- Off the record.
- What?

48
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,250
You said you wanted the truth.

49
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,083
This is the truth.

50
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,166
Keep typing.

51
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,416
So you think Ohm died
because of a jealous act?

52
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,583
I'm sure of it.

53
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,666
And revenge, very likely.

54
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:03,250
He just used Narisa
to polish up his image.

55
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,208
To polish his image?

56
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:08,875
Yes, to seem respectable and so cool.

57
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:13,166
His feminist campaign,
all the punchlines and so on.

58
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,208
There's one last thing
I'd like you all to think about.

59
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:22,208
If you want something said, ask a man.

60
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,416
If you want something done, ask a woman.

61
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:32,750
His fans screamed for him without knowing
he didn't invent any of that.

62
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,916
<i>It was Narisa.</i>

63
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:40,250
<i>She was his brain and his wallet.</i>

64
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:43,458
<i>But in reality, she did it for herself.</i>

65
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,833
<i>She backed Ohm to push through a law</i>

66
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:49,000
<i>so he could build a shopping mall</i>
<i>over Uathepa Square,</i>

67
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:53,000
<i>raking in billions</i>
<i>without anyone daring to stop her.</i>

68
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:57,458
All because she wanted
to prove herself to her father.

69
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:00,291
She thought helping him
would put her in the limelight.

70
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:01,833
<i>But that didn't happen.</i>

71
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,125
We've talked about this!

72
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:06,125
You can't run this campaign
unless the party accepts me,

73
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,500
and I want credit for my contribution.

74
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,000
You can't claim it as your own!

75
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,375
And what's this?

76
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:14,958
You said it once on stage,
then again in an interview.

77
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,000
You know what?
I didn't even come up with that quote.

78
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,916
I took it from Margaret Thatcher.

79
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,500
Risa, when a man
speaks the word feminism,

80
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:27,750
it's seen as cool.

81
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:30,791
But when a woman says it…

82
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,416
it's hysterical.

83
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:48,166
Shit.

84
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,541
<i>Lately,</i>
<i>she's been living with him in hatred.</i>

85
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:55,666
She stuck through with the engagement
because she wanted Uathepa Square.

86
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,583
Guess she couldn't take it anymore.

87
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:00,250
That night…

88
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,333
<i>it must have been her last straw.</i>

89
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,458
<i>Uncle Ohm started insulting Narisa,</i>

90
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,791
accusing her of trying her best
to ruin his political career

91
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,750
and the reputation of his family.

92
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,500
What?

93
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,208
He pushed her around.

94
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:22,708
What the hell, Pam?! Hey!

95
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:26,541
Why did you mess with my girlfriend?
Fuck your fake feminism!

96
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:31,750
I did respect her.
I let her ride me because she was weak.

97
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,291
Fuck you!

98
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,791
Ow!

99
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:44,458
Why don't you ask her
if she prefers your cold finger

100
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,125
or my warm rod?

101
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:49,791
I tried to stop them.
That's how I got these cuts.

102
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,875
Narisa did it.

103
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,125
Kris told me a different story.

104
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,833
And you believed what he said?

105
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,750
Kris might have something going on
with Narisa.

106
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:05,958
Something?

107
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:12,458
Pam, do you know where Narisa is hiding?

108
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,541
Useful information.

109
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:28,708
Pam.

110
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,125
Pam!

111
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:34,500
Well?

112
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,708
She said Risa did it.

113
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,958
So if we find her, Pam could be a witness.

114
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:46,416
Maybe, but I'm not convinced.
Pam seems suspicious.

115
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:48,208
Why would she lie?

116
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,875
Beats me.

117
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,916
But I'm confident
we'll find Risa pretty soon.

118
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:56,750
Hey, Pop.

119
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:04,375
From the clip I got from the hotel,
and from what Pam told me,

120
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,500
there may be other suspects.

121
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,291
This could be especially so

122
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:13,208
if Pam's claim about Ohm's history
with various women turn out to be true.

123
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,541
You shouldn't listen to that girl.

124
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,125
She's a troublemaker.
The family's black sheep.

125
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:27,291
Just before,
you said Pam had no reason to lie.

126
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:36,750
Damn it, Montree.

127
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,791
You're a man of the world.
You know how men are.

128
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,750
Ohm wasn't any worse
than the rest of them.

129
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:49,708
You better focus on finding Risa.
Have you got that?

130
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,208
Okay?

131
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:08,083
<i>Back to the murder now</i>
<i>of Mr. Anusorn "Ohm" Uathepa.</i>

132
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,708
<i>It looks like "Big Montree"</i>
<i>is trying his best</i>

133
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:12,541
<i>to track down the perpetrator.</i>

134
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:13,750
<i>From a political standpoint…</i>

135
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:17,666
Hey, have you been following
the Anusorn murder story?

136
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,666
- <i>…likely to deprive society…</i>
- Hey!

137
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,208
<i>…of new generation choices.</i>

138
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,125
Yes?

139
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,500
Anusorn was still so young,
don't you think?

140
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,125
Here.

141
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:28,291
It's all here.

142
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,916
FLORAL DESIGNER CONFESSES
TO BEING AT CRIME SCENE

143
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,375
Believe me,
now that Montree's in charge,

144
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:37,000
he'll catch the killer real quick smart.

145
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:39,750
You know Chief Montree?

146
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,625
Of course. He's handled
all kinds of high-profile cases.

147
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,500
Like that Madam X case.

148
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,625
Have you heard of it?

149
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,375
That was almost 30 years ago.

150
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:55,208
A Western woman died, and there was
an X-shaped cut on her face.

151
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,458
Once Montree got involved,
he found the killer right away.

152
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:01,416
MADAM X

153
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,041
Madam X.

154
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,208
Uathepa Street.

155
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:21,625
"Ikebana" derives
from the Japanese <i>"ike" </i>or <i>"ikeru,"</i>

156
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,333
meaning "to keep alive" or "arrange."

157
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,416
And <i>"hana" </i>meaning flowers.

158
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,208
Together, it means arranging flowers
or giving life to them.

159
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,166
- Originally…
- Psst!

160
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,583
Hey.

161
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:45,208
Japanese monks arranged flowers
for religious purposes.

162
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,708
- And then later--
- Come quick! Now!

163
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,625
And then later…

164
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,916
Miss, you shouldn't let
your boyfriend interrupt.

165
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,458
Otherwise, we won't get anywhere
with the lesson.

166
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:01,125
Delivery boy, not boyfriend.

167
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,125
Please excuse me.

168
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,625
Please start your arrangements.

169
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,125
Delivery boy?

170
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,583
Hasn't your six-star hotel
taught you any manners?

171
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:15,833
But this is important.

172
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:18,416
Nothing is important
when you're arranging flowers.

173
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,083
- But… What?
- Come.

174
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:24,541
What? No, I'd rather not sit.

175
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:30,625
Hi.

176
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,541
And centuries later,

177
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:44,916
flowers took on a more significant role
in various rituals,

178
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:48,208
and to many individuals,
became a symbol of faith.

179
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:51,125
- Miss Dalah, excuse me.
- They became a part of people's lives

180
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:54,041
in ceremonies and traditional practices.

181
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,000
I told you this is very important.

182
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,666
You have a death wish?

183
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:10,125
It is the mere essence of Ikebana's way,

184
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:16,958
which reflects the profound interplay
between mighty nature and humans,

185
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,916
mere cogs in its expansive machinery.

186
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:28,500
You might well wonder how such a concept
is conveyed through flower-arranging.

187
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,833
We do this by creating a dialogue
between various elements in the vase.

188
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:47,500
Try to angle them towards one another,
or set them apart.

189
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:58,958
Hm.

190
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,541
Explore different heights.

191
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,375
Leave some spaces empty.

192
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,208
You're not just arranging flowers,

193
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,375
you're imitating nature itself.

194
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,166
Try to remember
the things that I told you.

195
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:26,500
The essence of flower-arranging
is to give life to flowers.

196
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:30,666
It's a very noble pursuit,
but what does that mean?

197
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:39,875
It means we're giving life
to what is dying or already dead

198
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,583
through our various arrangements.

199
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:44,583
In other words,

200
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,250
we're prolonging the beauty
of what has passed

201
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,291
for as long as we can.

202
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:03,375
For you, miss.

203
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,625
This Sarath guy is cute.
He kind of suits you.

204
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,791
You think "cute" suits me?

205
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:23,750
Well, he is useful.

206
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:28,125
- <i>At this opportunity…</i>
- Useful for your work or for your heart?

207
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,916
<i>…to turn yourself into the authorities.</i>

208
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:34,583
<i>If anyone is harboring her</i>
<i>or detaining her against her will,</i>

209
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:37,750
<i>then I am advising that person</i>
<i>that you are breaking the law.</i>

210
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:41,375
<i>So if you are watching,</i>
<i>you must release her imme--</i>

211
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,500
Your friend is really good at hiding.

212
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:49,583
My neighbors are excellent busybodies,

213
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,666
but no one's caught wind of anything.

214
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,041
Narisa's trying to figure out what to do.

215
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,041
She won't need your room much longer.

216
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,625
Oh, it's not really any bother.

217
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:05,083
It's hard to find
high-quality tenants anyway.

218
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:11,291
Well, for now, I'll just continue
keeping an eye out for her.

219
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:12,583
An eye out?

220
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,333
Ta-da!

221
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,708
My dear Jerd proudly presents…

222
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,833
There's still so much
I don't know about you and Jerd.

223
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:33,916
Well, Jerd's a bit of a tech geek,
to put it mildly.

224
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,375
Ah, here comes our protagonist.

225
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,083
Sooner than I expected.

226
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,083
Miss Risa.

227
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,208
It's me.

228
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,625
MISS DALAH

229
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,208
Noomnim, what's wrong?

230
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,208
Well, Miss Risa is--

231
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,166
Is what?

232
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,666
Hang up.
There's no need to make them worry.

233
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:54,125
Misunderstanding, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

234
00:17:56,791 --> 00:18:00,291
Miss Risa,
you almost gave me a heart attack!

235
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,541
Why did you go out?

236
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,208
Nobody saw me.

237
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,625
Where did you
get that cigarette from?

238
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:09,833
What are you now, my prison warden? Hm?

239
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:14,500
I'm sorry. I'm just worried.

240
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,375
I found it in this room.

241
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,125
Miss Risa, you must take care of yourself.

242
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,166
Everyone's worried about you.

243
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,875
Not everyone.

244
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,041
Believe me.

245
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,583
That bitch used us.

246
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:49,750
When will you get it, Xinxin?

247
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:52,916
But Pam, it's you who started all this.

248
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,333
<i>I was just angry, okay?</i>

249
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:58,250
She used our trauma
as leverage against Uncle Ohm.

250
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:02,500
She didn't even care
about who'd get hurt the most.

251
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:16,666
That bitch
might have actually killed Uncle Ohm.

252
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:21,208
But Kris told me Aunt Risa's hiding
because she thinks you did it

253
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,083
<i>and wants to talk to us first.</i>

254
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,041
What nerve!

255
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,083
Dumping the blame on me.

256
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,166
<i>Can't you see it?</i>

257
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,625
<i>This all happened</i>
<i>because of her selfishness.</i>

258
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,333
Lek!

259
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:34,750
Lek?

260
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,333
Where the hell are you?
I had to carry these all myself.

261
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:45,666
So, you don't want
to expose Uncle Ohm anymore?

262
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,958
<i>For what, Xinxin?</i>

263
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:51,666
We thought speaking out could help,
and look what's happened.

264
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,375
Is it supposed to be like this?

265
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,875
Do we all need to implode to save her?

266
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:08,416
If we don't speak out,
then what about the other women--

267
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,833
He's fucking dead now.

268
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,333
<i>He can't hurt anyone anymore.</i>

269
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,291
So… you're going to pin it all
on Aunt Risa?

270
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:17,208
<i>Yes!</i>

271
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,250
Ask Kris where she is, and corner her

272
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:23,125
until she confesses
that she's the murderer.

273
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,916
What if she didn't do it?

274
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,083
<i>Your mother's right about you.</i>

275
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,833
<i>Stop being so dumb, Xinxin!</i>

276
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:38,791
We have to do something.

277
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:43,416
Dalah…

278
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:48,166
…you know what to do.

279
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:52,416
When a design doesn't click,
you know what's the best thing to do then.

280
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:57,500
Keep the best part, and discard the rest.

281
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,583
Even when you're arranging
just one flower…

282
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,583
It's still an arrangement.

283
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:20,875
This time…

284
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,083
I'm not leaving anything behind.

285
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:28,875
That's good, if you're sure of that.

286
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,916
Miss Dalah.

287
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,166
Oh!

288
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,333
- Is it beautiful?
- Mmm.

289
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:38,916
Not bad at all for a rookie, hey!

290
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,125
Thank you.

291
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,250
Do you like it?

292
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,583
Let's register you for the workshop, hey!

293
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:46,458
I enjoyed it.

294
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:49,041
I got lost in it, and I forgot why I came.

295
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,125
Ah!

296
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,708
All right, call me when you remember.

297
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:03,125
<i>Welcome to the voicemail service.</i>

298
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:04,875
<i>Please leave your message--</i>

299
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,166
Risa can't stay there anymore.

300
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:09,166
She'll give herself up?

301
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:13,208
I won't bother you anymore.
Thank you very much for the clip.

302
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,583
Do you think it was Kris who did it?

303
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,083
I know Mr. Anusorn
had more enemies than friends.

304
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:23,208
It's my job
to give condolences to Mr. Ekapop,

305
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,708
but after seeing the clip,
it's hard for me.

306
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,708
I'll go with you.

307
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:47,875
Good evening.

308
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:50,875
On behalf of the hotel,

309
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:54,250
I would like to express our condolences
for your loss, sir.

310
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:58,875
More likely you're here
to bill us for the cancellation.

311
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:00,375
No, sir.

312
00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:03,166
Apart from the fees
of the wedding planner,

313
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:05,291
there are no charges.

314
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:07,833
Hm. I thank you.

315
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,416
You don't have to pay me
the design fees either.

316
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,416
Since the wedding didn't happen,

317
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:18,416
and since Mr. Ohm was found dead
on my property,

318
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,500
it's only right
that I refund my fees to you, Mr. Ekapop.

319
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:26,291
I didn't ask her for that.

320
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:28,000
You can be my witness.

321
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:30,250
Yes, sir.

322
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:35,000
Oh, we ordered these flowers
from Miss Dalah's studio for you as well.

323
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:37,416
Thank you.

324
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:40,541
You didn't have to come all this way.

325
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:43,708
Not at all, sir.

326
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:47,916
Our hotel is privileged to have served
the Uathepa family for a long time.

327
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,041
- Sweep up. What are you doing here?
- These flowers are nothing, sir.

328
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:53,666
- I'll give you instructions…
- Regardless, very thoughtful.

329
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,333
It's our pleasure, sir.
It's the least we could do for you.

330
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:04,166
If you'll excuse me,
I have an urgent matter to attend to.

331
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,958
Sorry for any rudeness.

332
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:47,166
Oh, Miss Florist.

333
00:24:49,375 --> 00:24:53,458
You seem deeply saddened
by the passing of Mr. Anusorn.

334
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:57,291
He must have been very good to you.

335
00:24:58,541 --> 00:25:00,416
Um… yes.

336
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,166
You'd have known him well.

337
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,125
Been here a long time?

338
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:09,833
Since I was in college.
My grandma brought me here.

339
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:13,916
Even though
I only met Mr. Anusorn recently,

340
00:25:14,666 --> 00:25:17,125
I could tell
that he was a really good person.

341
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:21,541
It's unbelievable that somebody
could do that to such a nice guy.

342
00:25:26,666 --> 00:25:30,625
You know,
some people think that it's Narisa.

343
00:25:31,708 --> 00:25:34,458
Don't you think that's impossible?

344
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:36,458
They were deeply in love.

345
00:25:36,541 --> 00:25:37,708
You can't be sure.

346
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:39,541
What makes you think so?

347
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:43,791
You're not family.

348
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:46,333
That's why you think that.

349
00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:49,833
It's the family
that benefits from Risa's money.

350
00:25:50,666 --> 00:25:52,333
Mr. Ohm wasn't in love with her.

351
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:53,666
What do you mean?

352
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:56,833
She wasn't his type.

353
00:25:56,916 --> 00:25:58,166
And what's his type?

354
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,250
Very young.

355
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,875
Young? Like you, maybe?

356
00:26:21,416 --> 00:26:23,958
Equity and equality.

357
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:27,500
These two words sound similar,
but there's a big difference between them.

358
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:30,958
In politics,
when we talk about equal distribution,

359
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,958
we're talking about equity.

360
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:36,750
Equity is when you give Mr. B more
than you give Mr. A

361
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:40,416
because Mr. A has a more solid…

362
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,208
I'm trying to listen. Focus.

363
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:48,708
Xinxin.

364
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:52,791
How was it?
Do you think I'm a decent teacher?

365
00:26:56,833 --> 00:26:57,666
Yeah.

366
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:01,708
I'll let you get back to it.
We can talk more at home.

367
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,416
At home?

368
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,958
- Ooh, Xinxin!
- Xinxin, at home!

369
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:18,958
READY FOR THE EXAM?
DID YOU ENJOY MY CLASS?

370
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,291
LOVED IT. I'M REVISING NOW.

371
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:41,416
OH. JUST ASK IF YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND ANYTHING.

372
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,541
SO MANY QUESTIONS.

373
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,750
COME TO MY OFFICE THEN.
I'LL SEND THE LOCATION.

374
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:55,291
NOT FAR FROM YOUR HOUSE.

375
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:30,875
UNCLE OHM

376
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:33,583
I'M HERE
BUT NOT SURE IT'S THE RIGHT PLACE.

377
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:40,416
IT IS. IT'S MY PARTY'S SAFE HOUSE.

378
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:05,458
Hi. Come in.

379
00:29:08,291 --> 00:29:09,875
Make yourself at home.

380
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:11,958
My secretary just stepped out for a bit.

381
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,750
Something to drink?

382
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,291
Uncle Ohm, are you really free?

383
00:29:23,166 --> 00:29:24,000
Of course.

384
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,583
Have a seat.

385
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:38,958
Here, drink something.

386
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:53,666
So, what do you
want to ask me about, Xinxin?

387
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:02,291
Well, I'm a little confused
about this here.

388
00:30:03,125 --> 00:30:03,958
Let's see.

389
00:30:06,541 --> 00:30:07,583
Right here.

390
00:30:07,666 --> 00:30:08,500
Right here?

391
00:30:13,791 --> 00:30:15,208
Ah, okay, I see now.

392
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:18,500
This passage is a little confusing.

393
00:30:20,583 --> 00:30:21,750
Pay attention now.

394
00:30:23,166 --> 00:30:25,750
The vocabulary here is rather vague,

395
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:27,500
so you need to look at structure.

396
00:30:30,291 --> 00:30:31,125
When you…

397
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:35,375
pay attention to someone,

398
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:39,666
it's important to look them in the eye.

399
00:30:48,958 --> 00:30:50,458
- You smell nice.
- Uh…

400
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:54,500
I think I'm going to go home now.

401
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,791
Xinxin! Xinxin!

402
00:31:39,875 --> 00:31:40,791
Xinxin!

403
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,958
What's this?

404
00:31:47,666 --> 00:31:48,958
You have a boyfriend?

405
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:51,500
Speak! Tell me!

406
00:31:53,958 --> 00:31:56,041
I don't even know what happened.

407
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:59,125
- Who is it?
- What's going on, Prapha?

408
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,583
Ask your daughter
who it is she slept with!

409
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:03,000
Xinxin, what happened?

410
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,750
Pa, I was raped.

411
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,333
Raped?!

412
00:32:07,416 --> 00:32:09,250
Who raped you, Xinxin?
Who was it?

413
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:10,833
Who the fuck was it?!

414
00:32:10,916 --> 00:32:13,416
<i>If this becomes public,</i>
<i>how could I ever face anyone again?</i>

415
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,625
<i>Tell me now!</i>
<i>I'll kill that bastard!</i>

416
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:20,333
<i>What happened already happened.</i>

417
00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:25,500
<i>We can't go back and fix it,</i>
<i>but it's not your fault, Xinxin.</i>

418
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:29,333
You're not the first,
and you're not the only victim.

419
00:32:29,833 --> 00:32:32,416
Don't be afraid
of what people will think of you.

420
00:32:33,166 --> 00:32:36,291
Other women chose to stay silent,

421
00:32:36,916 --> 00:32:39,083
but I think you should speak out.

422
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,833
Risa!
What are you planning with my daughter?

423
00:32:44,416 --> 00:32:46,541
Hasn't she suffered enough already?

424
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:49,750
Xinxin, you're not doing this
for yourself, okay?

425
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:52,750
Xinxin, remember…

426
00:32:52,833 --> 00:32:56,166
no mothers want people to know
their daughters have been raped.

427
00:33:40,166 --> 00:33:43,208
If your dad finds Risa first,
what do you think he'll do?

428
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:46,708
How would I know?
No one even knows what he's up to.

429
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:48,583
Hm.

430
00:33:52,708 --> 00:33:55,958
But he'll protect his sons
more than his daughter, right?

431
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:59,250
I guess so.

432
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:03,333
Then we must find her soon
so your father can turn her in.

433
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,041
What makes you think that?

434
00:34:11,375 --> 00:34:12,625
I have to say it?

435
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:15,208
Say what?

436
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:19,166
You killed Ohm, didn't you?

437
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,250
I let her ride me,
because she was weak.

438
00:34:25,916 --> 00:34:26,958
Fuck you!

439
00:34:27,041 --> 00:34:29,666
<i>That night, I had had enough.</i>

440
00:34:31,916 --> 00:34:33,583
<i>I could no longer pretend</i>

441
00:34:33,666 --> 00:34:36,500
<i>that I didn't know</i>
<i>what he did to our daughter.</i>

442
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:40,208
<i>I wanted revenge.</i>

443
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:42,333
<i>I wanted to kill him.</i>

444
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:45,958
<i>I wanted to bash his head in.</i>

445
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,250
<i>But in reality…</i>

446
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:54,166
<i>I couldn't do it.</i>

447
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:56,541
<i>I was too weak.</i>

448
00:35:01,583 --> 00:35:03,166
<i>Pa won't have to protect us.</i>

449
00:35:03,958 --> 00:35:05,375
We didn't do anything wrong.

450
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:10,166
But we have to find Risa anyway.

451
00:35:10,833 --> 00:35:13,958
Our daughter must not get mixed up
in their scandal.

452
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,083
Bee.

453
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:40,458
What's wrong?

454
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:46,791
Pam, please don't blame Risa.

455
00:35:54,416 --> 00:35:55,916
Why are you protecting her?

456
00:35:57,833 --> 00:36:00,041
She's the one
that put you through all this.

457
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:01,208
It was you, Pam.

458
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:05,375
You're the one who actually
sent the clip to people

459
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:07,000
when I begged you not to.

460
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:08,708
But you never listen to me.

461
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:24,166
Bee.

462
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:29,750
It's the only evidence
that would incriminate him.

463
00:36:31,666 --> 00:36:34,083
You care more about revenge than me.

464
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,166
Not true.

465
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:44,083
Pam…

466
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,916
because of you, I took the pills.

467
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:53,041
Not because of that asshole or Risa.

468
00:36:58,166 --> 00:36:59,000
Bee…

469
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:01,708
Please, Pam.

470
00:37:02,791 --> 00:37:04,125
Let's help Risa.

471
00:37:17,166 --> 00:37:18,291
Bee is right.

472
00:37:40,375 --> 00:37:42,333
I told the police your aunt did it.

473
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,583
Pam, why did you do that?

474
00:37:47,875 --> 00:37:50,791
I just wanted to end
all of this crazy shit.

475
00:37:50,875 --> 00:37:53,375
The clip, Bee's humiliation…

476
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,750
But you were right.

477
00:38:06,541 --> 00:38:08,833
What happened to Bee was my fault.

478
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:16,750
It's still not too late to tell the truth.

479
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:26,583
It's Kris.

480
00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:36,625
Okay.

481
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:39,375
What? Why didn't you say anything?

482
00:38:39,458 --> 00:38:41,291
Kris told me to take you to Dalah.

483
00:38:41,916 --> 00:38:42,833
What for?

484
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,708
There'll be more dead bodies.

485
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:48,541
Kris also wanted you
to bring someone along.

486
00:39:08,541 --> 00:39:11,083
THIS IS WHAT I MEANT TO TELL YOU EARLIER

487
00:39:11,166 --> 00:39:13,625
MADAM X CASE CLOSED

488
00:39:41,416 --> 00:39:42,750
What's going on here?

489
00:39:48,208 --> 00:39:49,291
Mr. Vibul,

490
00:39:50,541 --> 00:39:54,083
your party is presently involved
in a tight political race.

491
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:57,250
I believe the party's image is important,

492
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:01,250
so I trust you'll tell me
everything that might be useful

493
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:03,083
in Mr. Anusorn's case.

494
00:40:04,416 --> 00:40:08,583
Otherwise, if the shit
happens to hit the fan later…

495
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:14,000
Sorry for wasting your time,
and thank you for coming.

496
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:23,041
You told me before…

497
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:26,875
you knew Mr. Anusorn well.

498
00:40:29,041 --> 00:40:30,125
Of course I do.

499
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,875
I've been living and working there.

500
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:36,041
Since you graduated college?

501
00:40:42,625 --> 00:40:43,541
Yes.

502
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:47,000
I don't know anything at all
about Ohm's issues.

503
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,750
But before the wedding,
there was an attempt to blackmail him

504
00:40:53,833 --> 00:40:55,291
by our rival party.

505
00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:59,041
Mr. Ekapop was informed about it,

506
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:03,500
and he told me that
he would handle the matter himself.

507
00:41:03,583 --> 00:41:04,958
Blackmailed how?

508
00:41:06,958 --> 00:41:08,125
Sex clips?

509
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:14,291
Mr. Anusorn had a thing
for college students.

510
00:41:15,583 --> 00:41:16,583
Right?

511
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:19,083
As in not just you?

512
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:29,000
You knew because you saw him
with many other college students…

513
00:41:31,083 --> 00:41:34,041
who were in the same videos that Pam saw.

514
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,125
You're in one of them, right?

515
00:41:46,041 --> 00:41:48,291
I'm unable to confirm that it's Ohm.

516
00:41:49,708 --> 00:41:51,083
Where are those clips now?

517
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,875
You know where those clips are.

518
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:01,291
- Spit it out.
- Please relax, Pam.

519
00:42:02,958 --> 00:42:04,583
Jaa is on your side.

520
00:42:05,083 --> 00:42:05,916
Are you, Jaa?

521
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:17,791
Please tell us… where those videos are.

522
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:25,833
We've got something, sir.

523
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,833
Here.

524
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:34,333
Huh. Send a team.

525
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:35,875
Yes, sir.

526
00:42:51,416 --> 00:42:53,375
- Hello? Anyone there?
- Miss Dalah?

527
00:42:53,458 --> 00:42:55,083
- Open the door!
- Miss Dalah!

528
00:42:55,166 --> 00:42:56,083
Miss Dalah!

529
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,708
- Break it down. Go!
- Yes, sir.

530
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:06,000
Give it to me.

531
00:43:09,875 --> 00:43:10,708
Go!

532
00:44:12,541 --> 00:44:14,125
<i>Arranging flowers…</i>

533
00:44:16,166 --> 00:44:18,500
<i>is like extending beauty.</i>

534
00:44:21,166 --> 00:44:25,875
<i>Prolonging the life of flowers</i>
<i>that might have wilted sooner,</i>

535
00:44:26,625 --> 00:44:28,500
<i>if left on the plant.</i>

536
00:44:30,416 --> 00:44:31,666
Lamduan!

537
00:44:32,875 --> 00:44:34,208
Throw this away.

538
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:45,166
<i>Humans are selfish.</i>

539
00:44:45,666 --> 00:44:47,541
<i>We want to preserve beauty</i>

540
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:51,125
<i>for as long as possible.</i>

541
00:44:54,333 --> 00:44:56,375
<i>Seeking different methods</i>

542
00:44:57,583 --> 00:45:01,916
<i>to prolong the life of what we love.</i>

543
00:45:16,666 --> 00:45:17,708
You have secrets.

544
00:45:22,458 --> 00:45:23,625
And you don't?

545
00:46:29,291 --> 00:46:34,958
<i>Sometimes, we could even</i>
<i>revive something that's already dead,</i>

546
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:40,416
<i>or someone who's already passed,</i>

547
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:43,958
<i>through methods that defy nature,</i>

548
00:46:44,041 --> 00:46:46,125
<i>but bring us satisfaction.</i>

549
00:46:47,958 --> 00:46:51,250
<i>All in pursuit of our own happiness.</i>

550
00:47:02,416 --> 00:47:03,500
Hello, Mother.

551
00:47:07,875 --> 00:47:08,875
Hello, Dalah.
