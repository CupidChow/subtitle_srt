1
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:37,791
Hello, Mother.

2
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:39,916
Hello, Dalah.

3
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:46,291
<i>My dearest mother…</i>

4
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:52,541
<i>in the quiet sanctuary of our garden,</i>

5
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:55,666
<i>where your spirit lingers…</i>

6
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:02,291
<i>I found the secret art</i>
<i>of flower arrangement.</i>

7
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:09,375
<i>Where each bloom I place</i>
<i>becomes a focal point…</i>

8
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:16,041
<i>whispering a tale of beauty…</i>

9
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:20,416
…<i>born from pain.</i>

10
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,875
I'll be the first
to fuck with your family.

11
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:34,041
<i>In this delicate balance</i>
<i>of nature and intention…</i>

12
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:41,333
<i>…revenge finds its voice…</i>

13
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:55,166
<i>…echoing resilience</i>
<i>in the softest language of the earth.</i>

14
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:02,000
DALAH: DEATH AND THE FLOWERS

15
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:04,208
<i>But don't worry, Mother.</i>

16
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:11,291
<i>These flowers… are my noiseless rebellion</i>

17
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:15,791
<i>against the shadow</i>
<i>that took you away from me.</i>

18
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,125
- Sir, any updates?
- Okay.

19
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,875
- Fill us in on developments?
- Order, please. Thank you.

20
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,750
In the light of forensic evidence,

21
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:20,708
we have found discrepancies
in one of the witnesses' statements.

22
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,791
Hence, the investigation team
has issued a warrant

23
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:27,125
to Miss Dalah Rose
for additional questioning

24
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,750
regarding the murder
of Dr. Anusorn Uathepa.

25
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,625
What's the new development?

26
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:32,750
I can't reveal that.

27
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,708
According to the forensic report,

28
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,875
Ohm's time of death
is estimated to be after 11:00 p.m.

29
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:43,083
At that time,
there was no one else in attendance

30
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,583
except the owner of the studio,

31
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,083
Dalah Rose.

32
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,875
She lied to us about Ohm.

33
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:54,458
I saw Dr. Anusorn
drive out around 11:00 p.m.

34
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,541
<i>After I heard</i>
<i>the electrical transformer explode,</i>

35
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:01,125
<i>I went to bed</i>
<i>and didn't hear anything unusual.</i>

36
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,125
The autopsy results
show that Ohm died after 11:00 p.m.

37
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:11,333
So it's impossible for him
to have driven away from the studio

38
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,333
at the time Dalah said.

39
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:17,625
I found this detail rather suspicious,
so I went back to the hotel.

40
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,333
Do you know how far it is
from here to the studio?

41
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,583
20 kilometers, sir.

42
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,875
<i>When you factor in</i>
<i>the mileage recorded at the hotel…</i>

43
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:31,041
<i>…it reveals that after Ohm's car</i>
<i>arrived at the flower studio,</i>

44
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,000
<i>it never left again.</i>

45
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,375
The car didn't move.

46
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:42,625
Dalah altered the timeline
in order to cover up her own actions.

47
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:43,708
<i>What about Risa?</i>

48
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:46,291
<i>Why did she have to run, and Dalah didn't?</i>

49
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:50,541
Because it seems Dalah set Risa up
to look like the killer from the start.

50
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:55,333
<i>As of now, we're still unable</i>
<i>to contact or locate Miss Dalah Rose.</i>

51
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:58,958
Additionally, the police
have also uncovered

52
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:02,291
that Miss Dalah's actual family name
is not Rose.

53
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:06,416
In fact, Dalah Rose… is Dalah Larsen.

54
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:09,875
Ring a bell?

55
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,708
The data from Dr. Anusorn's mobile phone

56
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,750
shows quite an interesting
text exchange that night.

57
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,166
Ohm may have grown suspicious of Dalah,

58
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,000
or it's possible
that he may have recognized her,

59
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:31,916
so he texted her
in an attempt to question her further.

60
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,166
Why do you find me so suspicious?

61
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,791
I've been noticing your curiosity.

62
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,500
Who are you?

63
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:42,083
Why did you fake your profile
to get this job?

64
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,166
Dalah shot Ohm with Risa's gun?

65
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,625
Or maybe Ohm firstly tried
to defend himself with the gun.

66
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,291
She deliberately
put herself on your radar.

67
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:21,791
Miss Dalah's actual last name is Larsen.

68
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,375
<i>Rose is just a name she made up.</i>

69
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:28,083
<i>I expect that we will be able</i>
<i>to solve this case soon.</i>

70
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:32,208
<i>The police are urgently asking</i>
<i>anyone who may be involved in this set-up…</i>

71
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,125
POLICE ADDRESSES CASE

72
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:36,375
…to make themselves known to the police
and to come in for questioning.

73
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,541
Normally the staff
are all here by now.

74
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,416
Sarath is on duty today as well.

75
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,958
- Where's Sarath?
- He's on leave, sir.

76
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,083
Where does he live?

77
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,291
<i>We're also ramping up</i>
<i>our security measures</i>

78
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:54,041
<i>to prevent unauthorized individuals</i>
<i>from tampering with the evidence</i>

79
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:58,250
<i>and compromising</i>
<i>our investigative process.</i>

80
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:01,166
<i>I want to take this opportunity</i>
<i>to urge anyone</i>

81
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,083
<i>who might have information</i>
<i>on Miss Dalah's whereabouts</i>

82
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:07,583
<i>to contact the authorities</i>
<i>and provide the necessary details</i>

83
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:10,500
<i>to prove your innocence</i>
<i>regarding any involvement with her.</i>

84
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:14,333
<i>Otherwise, once the truth emerges</i>
<i>that Miss Dalah is involved</i>

85
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:15,583
<i>in Mr. Anusorn's death,</i>

86
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:19,583
<i>you may be charged as an accomplice,</i>
<i>which is punishable by law.</i>

87
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,416
<i>Should you encounter Miss Dalah,</i>

88
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:26,375
<i>it's very important</i>
<i>that you notify police immediately.</i>

89
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:28,250
<i>And Miss Naris--</i>

90
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,958
<i>Welcome to the voicemail</i>
<i>messaging service.</i>

91
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,916
<i>Please leave your message after the tone.</i>

92
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:47,583
<i>And Miss Narisa,</i>
<i>if you're watching this,</i>

93
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:52,375
<i>I urge you</i>
<i>to leave Miss Dalah's company immediately.</i>

94
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,166
POLICE INTENSIFY INVESTIGATION

95
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,916
<i>Do not trust her at all.</i>

96
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,500
Miss Risa. Mr. Kris just called.

97
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,166
He said he's on his way here.

98
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:27,958
It's okay.

99
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,125
Gardenia jasmine.

100
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,333
A symbol of innocence.

101
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,958
You've seen the news?

102
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,083
I can't take it anymore.

103
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,500
All of this.

104
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:12,125
Now I…

105
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,791
I can't trust anybody at all.

106
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,833
And I'm starting to wonder…

107
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,083
who you really are.

108
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,000
Even if you don't tell me…

109
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:49,291
I've decided to give myself up
to the police.

110
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,875
Tonight, I am going to reveal

111
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,791
who the killer is, to everyone.

112
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,625
Then you can go back to your normal life

113
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,416
as an innocent woman.

114
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,458
Give me this chance to prove myself,

115
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,333
and I promise everything will be okay.

116
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,166
Thank you.

117
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,875
We dug up her profile

118
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,583
and discovered
that her current Instagram account

119
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,708
was created not long after

120
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:28,000
the announcement
of Ohm and Risa's wedding.

121
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,208
I need you to tell me
how she became employed

122
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,583
as Ohm and Narisa's floral designer.

123
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:40,208
<i>I thought I already explained</i>
<i>what I wanted.</i>

124
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,625
Excuse me. May I?

125
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:47,041
Uh-oh! This is Miss Somsamai, or Jae Som.

126
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,791
Most of the flowers in the wedding
came from her shop.

127
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:53,208
I accidentally
overheard your problem.

128
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:54,666
Here.

129
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:01,125
I can introduce you to an up-and-coming
super stylish floral designer.

130
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:07,375
Way to go!

131
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,666
I love confident young people.

132
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:14,375
Mr. Ekapop, it's a privilege
that you've entrusted me with this job.

133
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,625
It must be destiny.

134
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:19,875
Exactly. This is not a coincidence at all.

135
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,458
Agreed.

136
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,958
Neither luck nor coincidence.

137
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:36,625
Ekapop,

138
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:41,791
if there is another reason behind it
that you're keeping from me,

139
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:45,166
or if you're still
withholding information from me,

140
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,750
I suggest you tell me.

141
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,708
What kind of person
do you think I am?

142
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:50,916
How dare you doubt me?

143
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:54,750
Ah, please don't be offended or upset.

144
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:59,416
Look, the other day,
I had a talk with Mr. Vibul.

145
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:05,750
It seems that besides the clip
that was to be shown on the wedding day,

146
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:09,875
someone had also sent a photo
to the For Thai Society Party,

147
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,458
of which you were aware,

148
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,208
because Mr. Vibul told me
you took possession of it.

149
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:19,375
It's not the first time we've had
to deal with political smear campaigns.

150
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,500
Ohm was a rising star.

151
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,500
He was destined to become the next PM.

152
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:27,708
It's not unusual that the old guard
would do anything to stop him.

153
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,125
- But you didn't tell me!
- Why the fuck did I have to?

154
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,041
Because we'd have
identified the killer by now!

155
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,166
Fuck it, Montree!

156
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,958
You have no right to talk to me like this.

157
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,958
Have you forgotten
why you have what you have,

158
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,250
instead of rotting away in prison?

159
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,333
Because of who?

160
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:57,083
Who saved you way back then
from that extrajudicial killing case?

161
00:13:57,166 --> 00:14:00,625
And how is it you're still able
to prance around as Chief Montree?

162
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:01,583
Because of whom?

163
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:02,708
Because of you.

164
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,083
Good that you remember.

165
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:13,416
So it's your job right now
to find the bastard who killed my son.

166
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:17,083
Stop fucking around with other things.
Got it?

167
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,041
Yeah.

168
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,333

Somebody please find that bitch, Dalah…

174
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,708
I hope we didn't make the wrong choice
in trusting her.

175
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,333
Do you think her intentions are genuine?

176
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:14,750
Don't worry.

177
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,583
This time, I'm going to be right there.

178
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:29,333
Direct all units
to track the location in the photo.

179
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:30,708
Yes, Chief Montree.

180
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,375
Yes, sir. Find it immediately.

181
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,375
No luck, sir. Try that one.

182
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,708
- How's it going?
- Found it. It's a love motel.

183
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:43,041
Send out the location.
Have the team break in.

184
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,291
Hey! Whoa, whoa! Wait up!

185
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,375
What's going on?
What the hell? Hey, what's going on?

186
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:53,708
Hey, wait! What are you doing?

187
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,083
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

188
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,875
- Stop that! Police business.
- But you can't just…

189
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,333
Let's go! Move in!

190
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,416
Go, go! Jacuzzi Room 3.

191
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:11,500
<i>We're at the motel now, sir.</i>
<i>No sign of them.</i>

192
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,541
All right, I'll be there soon.

193
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:22,791
I'm gonna have to go out again.
You both go ahead. Don't wait for me.

194
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:24,916
You're going out again?

195
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,083
This case is a real mess.

196
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:31,125
Oh, I almost forgot,
there's an envelope for you on the table.

197
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,958
A messenger dropped it off
when I was going out earlier.

198
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:49,583
TO MR. MONTREE

199
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,208
JENNY, PAM, BRANDA, LOLA

200
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,750

201
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:34,250
NAT

202
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,083
PLOY

203
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,125
XINXIN

204
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:59,083
BEE

205
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,583
BEE

206
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,708
<i>Don't be scared. Sleep tight.</i>

207
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,833
- Daddy, what are you watching?
- Gorya! Get out!

208
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:49,333
SEE YOU, DALAH LARSEN.

209
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,125
Miss Dalah.

210
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:04,916
Why are you here?

211
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,583
Aren't you going to tell me anything?

212
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,666
You'll find out soon enough.

213
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:17,916
Everyone will.

214
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:20,666
Hey!

215
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:26,500
Sorry.

216
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:31,833
You see me as a person of no significance.
Am I right?

217
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,166
Mr. Sarath…

218
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,125
Tell me honestly.

219
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,333
Am I still important to you?

220
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,416
Important?

221
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:57,416
I haven't asked myself
whether you are or not.

222
00:19:58,541 --> 00:19:59,458
What do you think?

223
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,083
I remember what you taught me.

224
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,958
While the little flowers may not occupy
prominent spots in the design,

225
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,333
but without them…

226
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,833
the principal blooms
will fail to stand out as they should.

227
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:31,208
To be honest, your flower arranging
isn't all that special for me.

228
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:38,625
Mr. Sarath…
we don't know each other that well.

229
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:39,583
I know.

230
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,125
Because you don't want to know me.

231
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,000
I'm sorry.

232
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,250
What do you mean?

233
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,791
When I was practicing flower arranging

234
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:03,916
on my own at my home…

235
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:07,291
Yes, I did practice,
and that's when I realized

236
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:12,458
that I felt happier when I knew
that I was doing it for someone.

237
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,291
Not just for myself.

238
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:28,750
And you need me.

239
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,916
Because I might be the only one

240
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,041
who believes you're not doing all this
just for yourself.

241
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:57,791
Ekapop. Come talk to me in my room.

242
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:15,750
- Have you taken your medicine?
- Enough with the medicine!

243
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,875
If I die, I want to die peacefully.

244
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:26,458
I want to know about that girl. Dalah.

245
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:31,791
- Montree said the time of death…
- I don't care at all about that.

246
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:35,958
On the news, it said
that girl's real last name is Larsen.

247
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:38,833
That's what they said.

248
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:43,125
I may be old,

249
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,708
but I can still remember
what happened 30 years ago.

250
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:52,875
Lots of Westerners
share the same last name.

251
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:53,958
Don't overthink it.

252
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:59,833
I'm more surprised
you never thought about it.

253
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:04,833
How can you be so sure
it has nothing to do with that?

254
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:10,458
Let's not jump to conclusions.
Maybe there's no connection at all.

255
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:14,000
What if there is?
What if she is that woman's daughter?

256
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:19,333
Pop.

257
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:22,916
You know what you have to do, all right?

258
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,666
Yes, I'll take care of it.

259
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:48,458
<i>Yes?</i>

260
00:23:48,541 --> 00:23:51,125
Montree,
what sort of cop are you?

261
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:54,125
She's just a girl,
and you can't even catch her.

262
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:56,958
That photo was taken
at some love motel, right?

263
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:58,000
What's going on?

264
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:01,125
<i>Yes. My men went there,</i>
<i>but they couldn't find her.</i>

265
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:03,833
<i>By the time they arrived, she had gone.</i>

266
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:06,625
I don't care
what kind of scheme she's up to.

267
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:09,083
You better drag her ass to jail tonight.

268
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,916
I want her arrested.

269
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:06,041
- Kittisak.
- Oh! Hello, there.

270
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:07,375
Your father home?

271
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:12,041
Um, he went out just now
to the mall to get medicines.

272
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:13,250
Did he go by car?

273
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:16,458
Um… mm.

274
00:25:16,541 --> 00:25:19,083
I'm asking, did he go by car?

275
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:21,458
Well, usually, he wouldn't walk.

276
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:53,791
Koon! Where's your driver?

277
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:55,583
What's wrong, Mr. Ekapop?

278
00:25:55,666 --> 00:25:57,541
Where the hell is your driver?

279
00:25:57,625 --> 00:25:59,166
Koon quit yesterday.

280
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:04,041
<i>Passengers traveling</i>
<i>to Loei Province, Chiang Khan District,</i>

281
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:06,750
<i>the train has now arrived at platform 12.</i>

282
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:13,041
And you just let him leave?!
Why'd you let him go?

283
00:26:14,791 --> 00:26:16,250
What difference does it make?

284
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:19,291
- Calm down. Please, gentlemen!
- Why'd you let him go?

285
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:27,750
TO THE UATHEPA FAMILY

286
00:26:30,791 --> 00:26:33,375
TO THE TANGSINSUP FAMILY

287
00:26:52,625 --> 00:26:55,750
TO THE TANGSINSUP FAMILY

288
00:26:55,833 --> 00:26:58,583
TO THE UATHEPA FAMILY

289
00:27:23,916 --> 00:27:25,291
What is it about, Pa?

290
00:27:27,916 --> 00:27:29,083
Don't set up dinner.

291
00:27:29,166 --> 00:27:31,083
We're going to see Dalah tonight.

292
00:27:31,166 --> 00:27:32,041
Huh?

293
00:27:32,541 --> 00:27:33,375
What?

294
00:27:35,791 --> 00:27:37,166
- What?
- I don't know.

295
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:51,750
<i>Hello.</i>

296
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:55,583
<i>To my honorable guests</i>
<i>who have received this letter,</i>

297
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:59,833
<i>I apologize for not inviting you in person</i>

298
00:27:59,916 --> 00:28:03,041
<i>and for using</i>
<i>an old-fashioned means of invitation.</i>

299
00:28:03,125 --> 00:28:04,375
<i>But for the time being,</i>

300
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,125
<i>I need to suspend</i>
<i>all communication devices.</i>

301
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:09,500
<i>Tonight at 8:00 p.m.,</i>

302
00:28:10,041 --> 00:28:14,583
<i>I'd like to invite all members</i>
<i>of the Uathepa and Tangsinsup families</i>

303
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:17,750
<i>to meet me at my flower studio,</i>

304
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,000
<i>the very site where</i>
<i>Mr. Anusorn Uathepa was murdered.</i>

305
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:25,083
It's time.

306
00:28:28,125 --> 00:28:29,833
<i>Narisa is with me.</i>

307
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,916
<i>Should the Tangsinsup family</i>
<i>fail to attend,</i>

308
00:28:35,208 --> 00:28:37,208
<i>I cannot guarantee her safety.</i>

309
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,208
<i>As for the Uathepa family,</i>

310
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:51,000
<i>you are well aware of the skeletons</i>
<i>hidden in your own closet.</i>

311
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,000
<i>If you don't come,</i>
<i>I'll go live on social media</i>

312
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:57,083
<i>to expose your story to the whole country,</i>

313
00:28:57,166 --> 00:28:59,083
<i>down to the last detail.</i>

314
00:28:59,166 --> 00:29:00,375
It's time, Pam.

315
00:29:07,791 --> 00:29:11,375
<i>If all of you are present</i>

316
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:15,166

318
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:22,666
<i>See you soon, Dalah Larsen.</i>

319
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:36,625
Here, Mom.

320
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:48,000
Where are you?

321
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:51,041
I don't see any
of your stakeout team here.

322
00:30:10,916 --> 00:30:13,625
Hi, everyone. Hello.

323
00:30:13,708 --> 00:30:14,666
This way, please.

324
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,250
Our honorable guests.

325
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:18,000
This way.

326
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:19,583
- This is spooky.
- Yeah, I know.

327
00:30:19,666 --> 00:30:21,083
Please park your shoes here.

328
00:30:22,166 --> 00:30:23,250
Do I have to?

329
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:24,166
Yes, sir.

330
00:30:25,375 --> 00:30:27,833
Why all this hassle?
Why are we being asked to do this?

331
00:30:27,916 --> 00:30:30,000
- Stop your complaints.
- This is crazy.

332
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:31,500
Move!

333
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:42,291
Thank you, everyone, for your cooperation

334
00:31:42,958 --> 00:31:45,041
and for accepting my invitation.

335
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:50,166
Risa.

336
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,875
Are you all right?

337
00:31:56,541 --> 00:31:57,541
I'm fine.

338
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:02,458
And I am…

339
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:04,958
safe and sound.

340
00:32:11,041 --> 00:32:13,500
The selfie that I posted online

341
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:17,666
was intended to buy some time
for tonight's preparations.

342
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:29,000
Listen!
Hurry up and say what you want.

343
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:31,083
This nonsense is a waste of our time.

344
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:33,083
Please calm down.

345
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,958
The night is still young.

346
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:42,208
The truth is about to reveal itself,
and I promise you…

347
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:49,125
it concerns every one of you.

348
00:32:57,666 --> 00:33:00,791
Now let's have some Dalah tea.

349
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:06,666
I'm sure many of you
may not have tasted it before.

350
00:33:07,375 --> 00:33:09,166
Jae Som got it this afternoon.

351
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:12,458
It's really good.

352
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,583
Enough of this nonsense.

353
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:03,125
If you have nothing to say,

354
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,916
just wait for the police.

355
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,916
I'm going.

356
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,208
I understand
that you and the Uathepa family

357
00:34:11,291 --> 00:34:13,750
are eager to find out
what happened to Mr. Anusorn.

358
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:16,291
But first,
let me introduce someone important.

359
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:23,291
Someone the Uathepa family
knows very well.

360
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,833
Someone crucial to our event tonight.

361
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,083
Good evening, sir.

362
00:34:59,625 --> 00:35:01,583
Thank you very much, Mr. Koon,

363
00:35:02,541 --> 00:35:04,833
for joining our special event tonight.

364
00:35:07,833 --> 00:35:08,666
I'm…

365
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:11,250
I'm sorry.

366
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:18,500
You're not the one
who should be apologizing to me.

367
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:30,416
Hey, stop dilly-dallying.
What's Koon got to do with this?

368
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,208
Have a drink and cool yourself down.

369
00:35:32,291 --> 00:35:33,666
Forget the damn tea!

370
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:36,208
Tonight, I've gathered you here

371
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:39,500
to reveal to you…

372
00:35:41,875 --> 00:35:47,958
who the killer is,
and how all these threads intertwine

373
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:50,500
and connect with each other.

374
00:35:52,541 --> 00:35:53,625
How we all,

375
00:35:54,666 --> 00:35:56,250
Mr. Koon included,

376
00:35:57,708 --> 00:36:00,583
are tangled up in one big story.

377
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:09,625
That night was a lot livelier
than we thought.
