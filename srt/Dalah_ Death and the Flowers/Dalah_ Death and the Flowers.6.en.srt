00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:46,125
DALAH: DEATH AND THE FLOWERS

2
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:00,833
Risa is safe and unharmed.

3
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:05,333
I see no reason why we have to listen
to this other family's crazy stories.

4
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:06,458
You'd better stay.

5
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:10,666
There's a lot of crazy stories
that happened in the two families.

6
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,833
- Really.
- Let's rewind now.

7
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:14,875
Mr. Sarath?

8
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:15,833
Let's go.

9
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:20,458
Dalah, just say what you have to say!

10
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:22,625
I never wanted anything from the Uathepa.

11
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:23,875
Then why kill Ohm?

12
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:24,916
Exactly.

13
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,958
Why would I kill Mr. Anusorn?

14
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:31,583
Mr. Ekapop,

15
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:34,583
what do you think?

16
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:41,583
Ohm suspected that it was you
trying to blackmail him.

17
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:44,416
- Blackmail?
- You probably couldn't agree on the terms.

18
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,875
Sit, shut up.

19
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,916
The family's golden boy.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,333
Prime Minister-to-be.

21
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:53,375
An ideal gentleman.

22
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:56,083
A staunch advocate of women's rights.

23
00:01:57,125 --> 00:02:00,791
Why would such a guy have to worry
about paying people to shut up?

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,541
Unless he's really not at all
like the person society thinks he is.

25
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:12,791
Many of you in this room knew very well

26
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:17,458
what kind of person
Mr. Anusorn actually really was.

27
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:18,541
Fucking monster.

28
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:21,125
- Have some respect.
- Kris!

29
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,541
Ohm is deceased.

30
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:23,708
Respect?

31
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:27,000
Did he have any respect
for girls he raped?

32
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:28,458
- Hey!
- Hey!

33
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:29,833
Don't talk rubbish.

34
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,333
And don't you play innocent.

35
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:33,916
- You…
- Mom, if you don't know, I'll tell you.

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,791
Hold on, the reason we're gathered here
is to hear the killer's admission,

37
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,958
not to heap dirt on a dead person.

38
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:42,708
Ohm raped women. It's true.

39
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,666
- Uh--
- I found out when Pam told me.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,958
Uncle Ohm raped my girlfriend Bee
and made a video.

41
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,708
<i>Bee didn't want it to blow up,</i>

42
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:58,541
<i>but I couldn't let him keep that clip.</i>

43
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,125
<i>So I tried to delete it.</i>

44
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:08,291
SOM, NHOI, NING, MAI

45
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,333
<i>But what I saw</i>

46
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,958
made me want to do more
than just delete Bee's clip.

47
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,708
BEEBEE

48
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,958
<i>I wanted to destroy his life.</i>

49
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,875
<i>I wanted to sabotage everything.</i>

50
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,041
<i>Both the engagement and the wedding.</i>

51
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,041
<i>So I told Aunt Risa about it.</i>

52
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,250
But when Risa realized

53
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:40,000
that there were so many other victims,

54
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,083
including…

55
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,500
someone in this room.

56
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:51,708
Xinxin.

57
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:53,958
Yes.

58
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:56,250
What?

59
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:58,291
Xinxin!

60
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,041
What did you say?

61
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,583
What Aunt Risa said is true.

62
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:07,875
- Xinxin, no!
- No, I won't stop.

63
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,791
Pa, Ma, I know you want to protect me,

64
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,291
but I don't want the world
to remember him as a saint,

65
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:17,583
and we shouldn't have to stay silent
all our lives, because it's the truth.

66
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:25,166
That was why Risa decided
to serve a cause greater than herself.

67
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:30,083
She practiced the feminist ideals
that Mr. Anusorn preached in his campaign,

68
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,166
standing up for women.

69
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:40,458
To tell the truth,

70
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:43,625
I wasn't happy…

71
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,041
that Ohm used that campaign.

72
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,958
I talked to Xinxin,

73
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,333
and asked Pam to bring Bee along.

74
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:57,916
I'm scared.

75
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:00,416
Don't be.

76
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,500
We women are in this together.

77
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:07,625
All of us must speak up so they realize

78
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,458
that we are not weak.

79
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,875
We intended to expose Ohm, but there was--

80
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,500
You still wanted our property!

81
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:31,416
Yes.

82
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,291
I let you both down.

83
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,583
I was selfish when I asked you to wait…

84
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,083
until after the engagement,

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,083
and then again,

86
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:46,750
until after the wedding.

87
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:51,416
I did that because
I wanted my father to be…

88
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,333
proud of me for once.

89
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:59,250
I'm so very sorry I let you down.

90
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,333
I'm so sorry.

91
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:05,416
Risa.

92
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,333
But then, Ohm died.

93
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:17,500
Liar!

94
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,208
You tried to blackmail Ohm
before the wedding.

95
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:25,333
It was you who sent the screenshot
from the clip to Ohm's rival party.

96
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:28,791
You wanted to destroy
his political career,

97
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:32,458
but when nothing happened,
you tried another way.

98
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,125
No, it wasn't Aunt Risa.

99
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,500
I sent the screenshot.

100
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,958
I was just angry
that she didn't stick to the plan,

101
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:44,708
so I sent the photo.

102
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:45,833
You, Pam!

103
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,125
Papa! Papa!

104
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,208
And the clip to be shown at the wedding?

105
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:52,916
You did that?

106
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,041
Huh?

107
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,208
That was me.

108
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,666
Too bad that fucking monster died first.

109
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,708
Kris!

110
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:08,125
Aunt Risa told me
about the plan to expose Ohm,

111
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,416
then showed me the clip.

112
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,041
But when she decided
to go on with the wedding,

113
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,583
I was so pissed off,

114
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,458
because that scumbag

115
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:22,083
didn't deserve to live, even for a second.

116
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:27,666
So I gave the clip to the hotel staff,
intending to humiliate him at his wedding.

117
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:32,833
What about you?

118
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,500
What did Ohm do
that you had to kill him?

119
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:38,791
Oh…

120
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,000
I apologize…

121
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,125
for not being clear earlier.

122
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,500
I'm not the one who killed Mr. Anusorn.

123
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,416
Enough with your wisecracks.

124
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,875
You can't escape this.

125
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:06,625
It's clear on the forensic report
that you're the killer.

126
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,083
Please.

127
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,541
Would you care to elaborate?

128
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:22,791
In the report,
the transformer exploded at 11:35 p.m.

129
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:27,250
The autopsy result shows
that Ohm died after 11:00 p.m.

130
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,166
<i>You lied about the time.</i>

131
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:35,166
The forensic report clearly shows
that Ohm died at 11:00 p.m.,

132
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,583
but you said he drove out at 11:00 p.m.

133
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:41,083
In reality, Ohm never left here.

134
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,375
I disagree with the timing

135
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:48,166
because temperature plays a role
in the calculation.

136
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,375
Pam, Risa,

137
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,375
you remember the Temple Fair that night?

138
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:03,458
Temple Fair. A trial of patience
for those who hate entertainment, like me.

139
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,875
What's that got to do with forensics?

140
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:09,041
It was the reason
behind the change in room temperature.

141
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:12,916
<i>This led</i>
<i>to the transformer exploding</i>

142
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,916
<i>and causing a power outage.</i>

143
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,625
<i>The next morning, when the body was found,</i>

144
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,916
<i>they thought the room</i>
<i>was at its normal temperature,</i>

145
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,875
<i>but it wasn't.</i>

146
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:23,333
Mrs. Prapha,

147
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:25,833
you can confirm that, can't you?

148
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,125
The cold reminds me of Europe.

149
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:34,125
Therefore,
at the time of Mr. Anusorn's death,

150
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:38,208
the accurate room temperature
was the same as it is now.

151
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,708
The temperature delayed
the decomposition process,

152
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,083
which leads me to believe

153
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:47,208
that the actual time
of Mr. Anusorn's death

154
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,750
was earlier than 11:00.

155
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,958
Anyone could invent that.

156
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:56,208
Nobody can confirm
Ohm was killed before then.

157
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,541
Yes, but I have eyewitnesses.

158
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,458
- What is it?
- I don't know.

159
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,708
The flowers at the crime scene.

160
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:21,291
<i>When the tank toppled over,</i>
<i>the flowers became our eyewitnesses</i>

161
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:24,791
<i>that can confirm the time</i>
<i>of Mr. Anusorn's death.</i>

162
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:35,250
You see, we create blue roses
using a color absorption technique.

163
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:38,666
The duration of the process
depends on the rose variety,

164
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:42,208
the length of the stem,
and the volume of the color.

165
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:47,916
It takes 45 minutes
to absorb the full color

166
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
from stem to petal.

167
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,916
For the sake of clarity,

168
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,916
I've prepared this little exhibit.

169
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,833
These roses have absorbed color
for 15 minutes,

170
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:01,541
these for 30 minutes,

171
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:07,250
and these ones here, the full 45 minutes.

172
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,000
That night, before Jae Som and Jerd left,

173
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,250
she instructed me on the timing.

174
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,958
By 10:00 p.m.,
the color will be fully absorbed,

175
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:18,375
then you should switch them
with a new batch, okay?

176
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:23,458
The forensic officers must have
already taken photos of the tank.

177
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:31,541
The number 22 indicates 10:00 p.m.

178
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,833
These didn't fully absorb the color.

179
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:39,291
I calculated the time at which
Mr. Anusorn and the killer fought

180
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:44,208
and knocked down the tank at 10:30 p.m.

181
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:46,958
Wow, science!

182
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,916
The fact that I was here
at the time of death

183
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,666
doesn't mean I'm the killer.

184
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:59,125
Similarly,
proving that he died before 11:00 p.m.

185
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,458
doesn't help
to identify the killer either.

186
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,208
So now, let's examine

187
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:09,458
exactly who was here that night.

188
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,250
Kris,

189
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,041
Risa,

190
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:20,375
Pam,

191
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,333
Mrs. Prapha…

192
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,458
…and Mr. Ekapop.

193
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:45,750
Any of these people
could potentially be the killer.

194
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:50,166
But wait, I'm not saying

195
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,666
those were all the guests
present that night.

196
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,333
Indeed, it was a night…

197
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,708
that was livelier than we thought.

198
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:04,333
<i>When we arrived,</i>
<i>we were talking for a while,</i>

199
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:07,666
<i>and then Pam insisted</i>
<i>that Mr. Anusorn take her to the bathroom.</i>

200
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,833
Uncle Ohm,
can you escort me to the bathroom?

201
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:13,125
<i>Risa went out to the garden</i>
<i>at the back of the studio.</i>

202
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,000
How mysterious.

203
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,791
<i>When Mr. Ekapop</i>
<i>and Mrs. Prapha arrived,</i>

204
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,750
<i>they didn't see anyone.</i>

205
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:24,250
<i>At that time,</i>
<i>the killer may have already arrived.</i>

206
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,291
You've got everything…

207
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:31,291
<i>And possibly witnessed</i>
<i>Risa and Kris having a fight.</i>

208
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,291
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

209
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:37,000
<i>After you guys left,</i>
<i>no one was inside my studio.</i>

210
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,750
<i>Mr. Anusorn seemed</i>
<i>suspicious of me,</i>

211
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,958
<i>but he was just feeling things out.</i>

212
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:43,916
<i>I wasn't worried.</i>

213
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,958
He's a fucking asshole,
and you're still going to marry him?

214
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:50,458
<i>Before she left,</i>
<i>I saw Pam arguing with Risa and Kris.</i>

215
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:56,958
<i>Just then, my father called,</i>
<i>and I took the phone upstairs.</i>

216
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,250
<i>After that,</i>

217
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:04,833
<i>Mr. Anusorn might have returned</i>
<i>to the studio.</i>

218
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,000
<i>When I looked down from my room…</i>

219
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,541
<i>…I saw him,</i>

220
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,333
<i>but…</i>

221
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,625
<i>he was already dead.</i>

222
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,375
<i>The timeframe</i>
<i>for Mr. Anusorn's murder</i>

223
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:26,583
was between 10:20 and 10:35 p.m.,

224
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:30,916
when there was no one else in the studio
except himself and the killer.

225
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,833
So then,

226
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,541
at least three of you here are definitely…

227
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,166
not the killer.

228
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:45,625
Namely, Risa, Kris, and Pam.

229
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:49,625
But you lied to the police,
that you found the body in the morning.

230
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,333
Brother, when will the police arrive?

231
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:55,875
Don't worry.

232
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,375
The police will make an arrest.

233
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:03,083
But, as I said, it won't be me.

234
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:05,666
Whoever the killer is

235
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:09,500
wanted us to believe
they never set foot here.

236
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,291
I'm giving you a chance to confess.

237
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,750
I… I just…

238
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,375
I came to spy on my son Kris.

239
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,083
You made me worried.

240
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:32,791
Anyone else?

241
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,583
I was at home by myself.

242
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,833
This nonsense
is getting out of hand!

243
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:41,000
Why are we being questioned
as if we're suspects?

244
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,666
What gives you the right to do this?

245
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,125
Our family loves one another.

246
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:52,416
Let's set aside family love for now,
shall we?

247
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:56,541
And concentrate
on the available forensic evidence.

248
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:57,791
That night,

249
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:03,375
several of my honorable guests
left their shoe prints here.

250
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,333
<i>Mr. Anusorn,</i>

251
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:07,541
<i>Risa,</i>

252
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,708
<i>Kris, Pam,</i>

253
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:13,958
<i>Mrs. Prapha, Mr. Ekapop,</i>

254
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:14,875
and…

255
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:17,583
Mr. Kittisak.

256
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:18,500
Hm?

257
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,916
I can eliminate you and Mrs. Prapha

258
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,750
because you left before the murder time.

259
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:29,541
Though I know you wish
you had killed him yourself.

260
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,833
What had caught my attention

261
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,625
were the shoe prints of Mr. Ekapop.

262
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:39,291
They appeared not only in this room…

263
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,916
<i>but also around the garden</i>
<i>in the back of the studio.</i>

264
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,083
Now I get it.

265
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,750
The point of your lecture

266
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:57,458
is to accuse me of killing my own son!

267
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:01,750
The son who I loved
more than anything in this world!

268
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,583
Quite the opposite.

269
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:08,750
I'm saying your shoe prints
are prime evidence that excludes you

270
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,500
from the list of possible killers.

271
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,875
- Mr. Sarath.
- Yes.

272
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:23,000
Mr. Sarath and I
attended the funeral together.

273
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:27,916
<i>Remember when Mr. Ekapop</i>
<i>took off his shoes?</i>

274
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:32,416
<i>Yes. Mr. Ekasit mistakenly took</i>
<i>Mr. Ekapop's shoes.</i>

275
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:36,375
<i>Yes, both gentlemen</i>
<i>have the same shoe size.</i>

276
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:40,666
I wouldn't be surprised
if they're the same brand too.

277
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,208
So what?

278
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,208
Huh?

279
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:55,875
That night, I went drinking with Pete,
then we went home together.

280
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:00,958
Which bar did you go to?

281
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:05,625
We were in Thong Lor, barhopping.

282
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:06,708
Barhopping?

283
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:08,833
Together, yes?

284
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:10,875
Well…

285
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,333
What?

286
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,375
How many bars exactly?

287
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:22,833
Three or four, I guess.

288
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,375
Three to four bars.

289
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:25,958
Together the whole time?

290
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,750
RUNNING LATE
MEET ME AT ANOTHER BAR

291
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:40,750
NEW LOCATION

292
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:41,666
AGAIN?

293
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,583
HERE! YOUNG BAR, YOUNG GIRLS

294
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:03,083
Hey, Pete! Why do you look like
a kid in a candy store?

295
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,041
What took you so long, hey?

296
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,666
Stuff to clear up at the Square.

297
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,625
He met me at the last bar.

298
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,500
So, you mean

299
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,458
Mr. Ekasit wasn't actually
with you before?

300
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,166
I had things to sort out
with tenants at the Square.

301
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,458
Or with someone here?

302
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,125
Wait.

303
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:29,791
You…

304
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:34,000
Didn't you just accuse Ohm's father
of killing his son,

305
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:38,833
and now you're accusing me, Ohm's uncle,
based on your random assumptions?

306
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,458
I wasn't at the scene of the crime.

307
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:44,125
It's all just speculation.

308
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,250
Now I get it.

309
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,416
Huh?

310
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,208
You and Narisa killed Ohm.

311
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,916
All of you were here at the studio.

312
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,875
You made up the details
about when you left

313
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:00,541
in order to cover each other's tracks.

314
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,958
The motivation is blindingly obvious.

315
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,875
Otherwise, why would Narisa have run away?

316
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,500
You should really stop accusing people.

317
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,000
Risa ran away to buy time.

318
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:22,041
She suspected
that Pam might be the killer,

319
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,458
so she wanted to speak to her.

320
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:31,833
Because she needed time
to think about what to do with her baby.

321
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,791
Huh? Narisa is pregnant?

322
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,291
Huh?

323
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:40,666
Risa is having a child
with someone she despises.

324
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,875
Despite that, she loves her baby.

325
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,041
I'm still going to keep the baby.

326
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:50,208
Don't worry.

327
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,083
I guess the Uathepa men don't understand

328
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:01,000
the misery and confusion
of a pregnant woman.

329
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,125
There you go!

330
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,291
Miserable, confused, angry.

331
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,250
Those could be reasons to kill.

332
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:10,666
A despicable man she didn't love
got her pregnant.

333
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,458
Do you think that makes any sense at all?

334
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:17,083
Women have countless irrational reasons
for their actions.

335
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,208
Interesting.

336
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,000
But please hear me out.

337
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:31,291
In this bag is a foreign object
I found next to Mr. Anusorn's body.

338
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:37,083
<i>The forensic team</i>
<i>collected something similar,</i>

339
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,958
<i>thinking it was a piece</i>
<i>of wild sugarcane flower</i>

340
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,250
<i>from my arrangement.</i>

341
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:47,166
Please. You hold it.

342
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,833
<i>Mr. Sarath helped me</i>
<i>figure out what it was.</i>

343
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,625
You're allergic to animals, aren't you?

344
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:57,958
How do you know?

345
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,875
Sorry, my dog needs to puke.

346
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,958
Nosy.

347
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,625
<i>At that dinner,</i>
<i>when I saw you flinch…</i>

348
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:16,083
<i>…I thought it was just your personality.</i>

349
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:22,791
<i>But when you came to the studio</i>
<i>and acted strangely again…</i>

350
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:23,708
Sorry.

351
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:27,958
<i>…I began to wonder</i>
<i>if it was an allergic reaction.</i>

352
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:30,500
<i>That made me realize</i>

353
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:34,041
<i>that this might not be wild sugarcane</i>

354
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:36,125
<i>or one of my decorative pieces.</i>

355
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:44,750
It is animal hair.

356
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:49,458
Or, to be specific,
it's Mr. Ekasit's Chihuahua's hair.

357
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:51,333
- What?
- Huh?

358
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:53,041
That night,

359
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,416
you split from the group
outside the hotel,

360
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,458
claiming you'd go drinking with Pete.

361
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:00,958
But you didn't go as you said.

362
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:02,958
Are you out of your mind?

363
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:04,666
You can't invent stories

364
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,166
without sufficient logic
backing it all up.

365
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,875
What if it can be proven

366
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:13,666
using forensic science?

367
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:23,791
Montree?

368
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:27,000
What is this?

369
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:28,583
I'm very sorry, brother.

370
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,666
It's been a long time,
and we've always helped each other.

371
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,791
But what Ohm did was beyond my tolerance.

372
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,125
This time, I have to be on the right side.

373
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:41,291
What have you seen?

374
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:44,375
Hundreds of clips of Ohm
sexually abusing students.

375
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:47,708
Those damn clips
are most likely fabricated

376
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:50,375
to discredit Ohm and the Uathepa family!

377
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:51,458
I've seen so many,

378
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:53,791
that I'm absolutely certain
that they are real.

379
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:59,458
Mr. Ekapop, if you doubt the authenticity
of those clips,

380
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:02,083
ask someone in your household.

381
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:06,416
Jaa, your maid, she knows
where Mr. Anusorn kept the clips,

382
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,750
and she brought them to us,

383
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:10,583
because she is another one of his victims.

384
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:16,583
More twisted than I thought.

385
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,541
The shoe prints found that night

386
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,875
may not alone
lead to any conclusive findings.

387
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:26,875
Except when you corroborate them
with the dog hair found near the body,

388
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:29,458
and Mr. Ekasit's shoe prints tonight.

389
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:38,666
Uh, please park your shoes here.

390
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:42,500
<i>Although they are the same size,</i>

391
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,416
<i>Ekapop's shoes and Mr. Ekasit's shoes</i>

392
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:48,333
<i>have distinct wear patterns and imprints</i>

393
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:50,416
<i>due to the different pressure</i>
<i>applied to them.</i>

394
00:24:52,416 --> 00:24:56,583
Ekapop's past leg injury causes him
to walk with a distinctive gait.

395
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:04,875
<i>And Ekapop's shoe prints were only found</i>
<i>in the car park leading to the studio.</i>

396
00:25:07,416 --> 00:25:11,458
But the prints around the garden
definitely belong to Mr. Ekasit.

397
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:15,208
Therefore,
Miss Dalah's assumption is correct.

398
00:25:17,041 --> 00:25:18,958
Mr. Ekasit was here that night,

399
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:22,500
and he was still present
at the time of Ohm's murder.

400
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:33,250
Like I said, the police will come
and arrest the killer.

401
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:36,125
But it won't be me.

402
00:25:37,875 --> 00:25:38,708
Sit,

403
00:25:39,916 --> 00:25:40,958
were you with Ohm?

404
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,958
Were you with him when he died?

405
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:49,833
Brother.

406
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:52,125
Answer me!

407
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:54,666
Why did you come here?

408
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,625
- Brother…
- Who killed Ohm?

409
00:25:57,916 --> 00:26:00,083
Sit! Who killed Ohm?!

410
00:26:00,666 --> 00:26:03,541
Answer me now! Did you kill my son? Huh?

411
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:04,458
Your nephew?

412
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:06,083
Did you do that? Did you kill him?

413
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:08,166
My son! Did you kill my boy?

414
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,916
He deserved to fucking die!

415
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:12,958
- Papa, no! Stop!
- Shit!

416
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:14,541
- Sir!
- Great-Uncle!

417
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:16,083
Calm down! Sir! Sir!

418
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:17,000
Great-Uncle!

419
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:18,750
- Ekapop!
- Calm down, sir!

420
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:21,125
Enough!

421
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:24,500
Stop this.

422
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:41,000
Mother!

423
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:43,166
Sit.

424
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,833
Apologize to your brother.

425
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:50,791
What? You're always like this!

426
00:26:51,791 --> 00:26:53,625
I always have to say sorry to him!

427
00:26:54,916 --> 00:26:56,291
You know what?

428
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,916
I'm not sorry for what I did,

429
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:03,083
because I truly believe

430
00:27:03,166 --> 00:27:05,625
I shouldn't have been born
into this family!

431
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:08,666
My mother never loved me,
nor did my brother!

432
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,958
You've only ever used me
to serve the family's interests,

433
00:27:12,041 --> 00:27:13,500
so fuck it!

434
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:17,708
Yeah.

435
00:27:19,416 --> 00:27:20,666
I killed Ohm.

436
00:27:21,666 --> 00:27:23,250
I killed him right fucking here!

437
00:27:29,708 --> 00:27:30,541
Why?

438
00:27:31,125 --> 00:27:32,875
Why did you kill my son?

439
00:27:32,958 --> 00:27:34,041
- Why, Sit?!
- Sir!

440
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,041
Why did you kill my son?!

441
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:48,375
You still have no idea, huh?

442
00:27:52,541 --> 00:27:53,958
Please sign here.

443
00:27:54,041 --> 00:27:55,541
<i>Ever since Dad died…</i>

444
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:57,083
I hope this is the last time.

445
00:27:57,166 --> 00:27:59,166
<i>…you were like a brother</i>
<i>and a father to me.</i>

446
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,916
- I told you focus on your studies!
- Mom!

447
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,333
- Why didn't you pay attention?
- Don't!

448
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:05,625
- Ekapop!
- It's my fault.

449
00:28:05,708 --> 00:28:08,666
I didn't… I didn't take good care of him.
Come here.

450
00:28:14,958 --> 00:28:16,875
Hot girls at the new bar. Let's roll!

451
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:20,125
My wife had an ultrasound.

452
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:21,458
It's a boy!

453
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:24,541
We're going to have another Uathepa!

454
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:28,750
You're going to be an uncle.

455
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:32,250
You said that I was the hope of the family

456
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:34,916
before your scumbag of a son came along.

457
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:38,541
Stop making trouble already.

458
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:41,458
It's all because of you
and your itch for college girls.

459
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:43,375
I told you to see a therapist.

460
00:28:43,458 --> 00:28:44,750
You're going to ruin everything,

461
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:47,333
and now we need to rely
on the Tangsinsup family.

462
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,291
This envelope was sent to a rival party,

463
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:53,875
and someone sent it to blackmail Vibul,
your party chief.

464
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:56,250
If this gets out,
will she still marry you?

465
00:28:56,916 --> 00:28:59,541
See that? Your ring is in the photo.

466
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,416
Dad, the ring
can easily be explained.

467
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:07,250
A person who wears the same ring,
and who's well known as a womanizer,

468
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:09,750
an in-house scapegoat.

469
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:11,791
Who the fuck are you talking about?

470
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:16,083
How many times
do I have to be your scapegoat? Huh?

471
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:25,041
Dad, who does our family need to protect?

472
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:27,333
Is it me?

473
00:29:27,416 --> 00:29:30,541
Or the useless old coot who carries
his dog around all day long?

474
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:32,000
Fuck you, Ohm!

475
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:33,541
You came at a good time.

476
00:29:34,916 --> 00:29:36,750
Go and deal with the protesters.

477
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,250
<i>You changed after Ohm</i>
<i>started bringing his women problems</i>

478
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:46,500
<i>into our family.</i>

479
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:56,666
Don't work your grandson too hard,
all right?

480
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,458
No hard feelings, okay?

481
00:30:02,541 --> 00:30:04,833
The whole is more important
than the parts.

482
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:08,958
To uphold our good image,

483
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:11,875
Ekasit must unfortunately
play the scapegoat.

484
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:17,625
After I'm married,
you can have whatever you want.

485
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:19,791
Just name the price.

486
00:30:29,791 --> 00:30:31,833
<i>I may bring a lot of trouble…</i>

487
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,625
<i>but that's nothing</i>
<i>compared to the vile things</i>

488
00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:38,375
<i>done by the family's heir.</i>

489
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:57,958
I did it all
for the Uathepa family, you know?

490
00:30:58,666 --> 00:31:00,416
You fucking bastard!

491
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:04,041
What the fuck, Uncle?

492
00:31:04,125 --> 00:31:05,750
Why're you
always fucking with me?

493
00:31:05,833 --> 00:31:07,291
What the fuck's wrong with you?

494
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:13,541
Why do you keep fucking with me?!

495
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:33,500
You're nothing but a useless prick.

496
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:37,416
All you can ever be is a scapegoat.

497
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,041
Bray. Go on.
Let me hear you bray like a goat.

498
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:42,000
Go on, bray. My uncle's a goat.

499
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:46,666
With all the problems
our family has,

500
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:49,625
if we didn't eliminate Ohm,
the family would be doomed.

501
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:52,208
What the fuck are you saying?! Huh?

502
00:31:52,291 --> 00:31:53,583
Is that what you want?

503
00:31:54,916 --> 00:31:55,750
Shit!

504
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:08,208
Ohm was a disgrace to our family, not me.

505
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:17,000
Uncle.

506
00:32:50,041 --> 00:32:51,458
You once warned Ohm,

507
00:32:52,208 --> 00:32:55,083
"Be careful not to take after your uncle."

508
00:32:55,166 --> 00:32:58,000
Is that how you saw me?
As the family's bad seed?

509
00:32:58,958 --> 00:33:00,958
Whenever Ohm caused trouble,

510
00:33:02,916 --> 00:33:07,166
you always sent me
to quiet those women with money.

511
00:33:08,166 --> 00:33:10,375
You said I had nothing to lose,

512
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:15,125
while Ohm had a bright fucking future,
and he'd bring us fame and glory.

513
00:33:15,208 --> 00:33:16,500
A fuck like that?!

514
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:18,041
That's enough, Sit.

515
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:20,125
You're bringing shame to our family.

516
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:21,125
Oh!

517
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:25,875
Who is really destroying our family?

518
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:30,291
That goddamn motto
is all you ever talk about!

519
00:33:32,458 --> 00:33:36,583
Do you really think that
you hold more value to this family

520
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:38,666
than what Ohm does?

521
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,083
How many women have you paid to shut up?

522
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:50,458
But Mr. Ekapop,
didn't you also pay a woman to keep quiet?

523
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:02,000
Chief Montree was absolutely right

524
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,500
when he told the press that
I intentionally approached

525
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:08,416
the Uathepa family.

526
00:34:09,041 --> 00:34:11,333
But let me make it perfectly clear.

527
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:12,958
The reason behind this

528
00:34:14,166 --> 00:34:16,416
had nothing at all to do with Mr. Anusorn.

529
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:20,791
It was just a coincidence

530
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:23,583
that I happen to know Risa.

531
00:34:26,583 --> 00:34:29,083
Then an unexpected event happened here.

532
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:36,291
What was supposed to be
a simple flower arrangement…

533
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:41,083
turned out to be much more complicated.

534
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,250
Thanks largely to these complications…

535
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:57,666
I finally found the answer to the question

536
00:34:58,875 --> 00:35:01,208
that has haunted me for so long.

537
00:35:03,458 --> 00:35:04,791
Which is…

538
00:35:06,166 --> 00:35:08,083
what is it that happened to my mother?

539
00:35:11,166 --> 00:35:13,208
Mr. Ekapop must remember her.

540
00:35:20,208 --> 00:35:21,208
Her name was Emma.

541
00:35:22,541 --> 00:35:23,583
Em…

542
00:35:32,791 --> 00:35:33,791
Mr. Koon.

543
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:45,500
When I was only a young woman…

544
00:35:48,166 --> 00:35:54,083
everyone told me
that my mother died in a car accident.

545
00:35:56,833 --> 00:35:58,958
<i>It was only when</i>
<i>my adoptive father</i>

546
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:01,833
<i>disclosed her ties to the Uathepa family…</i>

547
00:36:01,916 --> 00:36:02,791
MADAM X CASE

548
00:36:02,875 --> 00:36:04,958
<i>…that my curiosity was piqued</i>

549
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:10,291
<i>because of the X-shaped cut on her face.</i>

550
00:36:11,958 --> 00:36:15,791
<i>Yet when the authorities</i>
<i>concluded it was an accident,</i>

551
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:17,916
<i>with the driver taking responsibility…</i>

552
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,958
ACCIDENT?

553
00:36:19,041 --> 00:36:20,666
<i>…people then forgot about her.</i>

554
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:25,250
<i>I couldn't find any information</i>
<i>connecting her to the Uathepa,</i>

555
00:36:26,208 --> 00:36:30,416
<i>other than what my father told me,</i>
<i>and some enigmatic entries in her diary.</i>

556
00:36:32,916 --> 00:36:37,000
<i>However, the photo of the cop in the news</i>

557
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:39,958
<i>has stuck in my mind ever since,</i>

558
00:36:41,041 --> 00:36:44,083
<i>until the day Mr. Anusorn died.</i>

559
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:47,833
You're the owner of the studio,
is that correct?

560
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,541
Yes.

561
00:36:55,583 --> 00:37:00,333
Mr. Ekapop got Chief Montree
to take over the investigation.

562
00:37:00,833 --> 00:37:04,791
He was so sure that Montree
would help him cover up any scandal

563
00:37:04,875 --> 00:37:08,041
that could be exposed
during the investigation,

564
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,375
like he did before.

565
00:37:11,916 --> 00:37:13,791
Are you going to let this girl insult you?

566
00:37:13,875 --> 00:37:15,458
Everything she's saying,

567
00:37:16,583 --> 00:37:18,208
isn't it the absolute truth?

568
00:37:25,166 --> 00:37:26,000
I'm…

569
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:29,291
I'm sorry.

570
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:34,208
Thank you.

571
00:37:43,625 --> 00:37:46,166
Mr. Koon is the one who killed my mother.

572
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:49,166
But that's no mystery,

573
00:37:49,791 --> 00:37:54,666
because he turned himself in,
and he faced the legal consequences.

574
00:37:57,958 --> 00:38:00,041
But I never expected

575
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:02,666
to meet him in person.

576
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:05,958
Especially since I didn't even know
what he looked like.

577
00:38:08,375 --> 00:38:11,666
<i>But when Mr. Ekapop saw him at the hotel,</i>

578
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:15,875
<i>Mr. Ekapop's reaction,</i>
<i>it really bugged me.</i>

579
00:38:15,958 --> 00:38:17,583
- Koon.
- Hello, sir.

580
00:38:17,666 --> 00:38:20,583
When did you leave the monkhood?
Why didn't you see me first?

581
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:22,833
Koon? Hey, Koon!

582
00:38:22,916 --> 00:38:25,541
Oh, Mr. Ekapop. I'm leaving.

583
00:38:32,208 --> 00:38:34,916
<i>My presumption</i>
<i>was proven right again</i>

584
00:38:35,625 --> 00:38:39,958
<i>when I saw how much importance</i>
<i>Mr. Ekapop gave to Mr. Koon.</i>

585
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:44,708
- Why did you let him go?
- Mr. Ekapop.

586
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:49,333
<i>Mr. Koon,</i>
<i>can you please tell everyone here…</i>

587
00:38:51,666 --> 00:38:53,541
why my mother had to die?

588
00:39:07,791 --> 00:39:08,958
Mr. Ekapop,

589
00:39:10,208 --> 00:39:11,375
he hired me

590
00:39:13,291 --> 00:39:14,458
to run her over.

591
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:19,583
Please forgive me.

592
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,791
Ekapop… asked me to cover up the fact
that Koon was his driver.

593
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:02,916
<i>Even after I became a monk,</i>

594
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:10,041
<i>the sin I committed against Miss Emma</i>
<i>has haunted me ever since.</i>

595
00:40:23,625 --> 00:40:26,166
Seems we're not so different, brother.

596
00:40:33,625 --> 00:40:34,458
Hm.

597
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:40,583
You don't know shit!

598
00:40:42,291 --> 00:40:46,250
I never did a single one of those things
for myself.

599
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,333
Ungrateful idiot!

600
00:40:48,416 --> 00:40:51,416
Yes, I hired Koon to do it.

601
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:53,833
To save your ass!

602
00:40:55,416 --> 00:40:56,375
Huh?

603
00:41:03,291 --> 00:41:05,083
Miss, wine over here, please.

604
00:41:05,916 --> 00:41:09,708
<i>Remember the reception</i>
<i>at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</i>

605
00:41:09,791 --> 00:41:10,875
<i>thirty years ago…</i>

606
00:41:10,958 --> 00:41:12,500
…needs more men like you…

607
00:41:12,583 --> 00:41:13,875
Politics is not my thing.

608
00:41:15,083 --> 00:41:16,791
<i>…when you first met Emma?</i>

609
00:41:29,416 --> 00:41:31,625
- Oh, look at this.
- Hey!

610
00:41:31,708 --> 00:41:33,333
- What?
- What are you doing?

611
00:41:33,416 --> 00:41:35,875
Come on, it's just fun.

612
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:37,041
Stop it!

613
00:41:39,375 --> 00:41:40,625
She doesn't mind.

614
00:41:40,708 --> 00:41:41,583
I do mind!

615
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:45,041
What-- Leave me alone!

616
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:22,875
Call me.

617
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,041
Yeah, sure.

618
00:42:37,958 --> 00:42:39,208
Psycho bitch.

619
00:42:41,583 --> 00:42:44,125
- I won't let you down…
- <i>Back then,</i>

620
00:42:44,208 --> 00:42:47,458
<i>you were on the path to become an MP.</i>
<i>We all supported you.</i>

621
00:42:47,541 --> 00:42:50,333
Mr. Ekapop,
someone's here to see you.

622
00:42:50,416 --> 00:42:51,416
Mm-hmm. Who is it?

623
00:42:52,416 --> 00:42:53,500
A white girl.

624
00:42:54,083 --> 00:42:55,875
<i>Emma tried to contact me.</i>

625
00:42:56,833 --> 00:42:57,666
I'll handle it.

626
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:01,958
<i>Said she was pregnant.</i>
<i>I didn't believe her.</i>

627
00:43:02,041 --> 00:43:03,291
<i>I hid this from you.</i>

628
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,458
<i>Many years later,</i>
<i>I thought it was all over.</i>

629
00:43:08,541 --> 00:43:11,291
Hey!
You know why I'm here, don't you?

630
00:43:13,166 --> 00:43:14,375
Excuse me?

631
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:16,041
You like to play dumb, don't you?

632
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:17,083
Please.

633
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:18,583
Not here.

634
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:23,500
<i>Until she came back</i>
<i>to demand that we accept her child.</i>

635
00:43:24,708 --> 00:43:25,666
What do you want?

636
00:43:27,041 --> 00:43:29,916
You can't just buy me off like
what you've done with the other women.

637
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
<i>Threatened to expose</i>
<i>we'd been paying women to silence them.</i>

638
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:34,083
Just take the money.

639
00:43:34,166 --> 00:43:35,625
I'm not here for myself.

640
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:40,166
You either accept the child,
or I'll take you and your family to court.

641
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,666
No one fucks with me and my family.

642
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:46,125
I'll be the first
to fuck with your family.

643
00:43:50,791 --> 00:43:52,708
<i>Back then, Mom was happy,</i>

644
00:43:53,541 --> 00:43:56,000
<i>because you were about</i>
<i>to find your footing.</i>

645
00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:00,041
<i>We believed you would complete</i>
<i>the Uathepas' rise to glory.</i>

646
00:44:00,125 --> 00:44:04,750
I will tell you when to come by the house,
but don't bring the child.

647
00:44:13,625 --> 00:44:16,083
Mother, she won't take the deal…

648
00:44:16,166 --> 00:44:19,083
<i>The Uathepa family</i>
<i>must shine with glory.</i>

649
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:23,875
<i>I'd never let anything</i>
<i>jeopardize our family's path to success.</i>

650
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,375
So, in the end…

651
00:44:35,125 --> 00:44:37,958
you let everyone down,
despite our support.

652
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:42,041
Everything I did, I did for the Uathepa.

653
00:44:43,708 --> 00:44:44,625
For you.

654
00:44:48,166 --> 00:44:53,208
But you repaid me
by destroying everything.

655
00:44:56,375 --> 00:44:58,375
By killing my son.

656
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:24,041
You must have thought I was your father.

657
00:45:26,291 --> 00:45:27,333
I'm sorry.

658
00:45:29,541 --> 00:45:30,583
Your father…

659
00:45:33,041 --> 00:45:36,125
is the man who killed his own nephew.

660
00:45:37,083 --> 00:45:38,833
His mother's grandson.

661
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:40,875
His own blood!

662
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:42,875
That bastard…

663
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:46,291
that's your father.

664
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:25,666
I already have a father.

665
00:46:29,625 --> 00:46:30,541
As I said…

666
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:36,000
I never wanted anything from the Uathepa…

667
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,958
except the truth.

668
00:47:08,083 --> 00:47:08,958
Mother…

669
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:18,125
Close the door.

670
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:25,875
Come. Get in.

671
00:47:42,416 --> 00:47:43,291
Thank you…

672
00:47:45,375 --> 00:47:47,166
for giving me a chance,

673
00:47:48,083 --> 00:47:49,958
or it could have been a real mess.

674
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:57,291
I should be thanking you
for giving me a chance.

675
00:48:00,791 --> 00:48:01,625
Uh…

676
00:48:05,166 --> 00:48:06,000
Yes?

677
00:48:07,458 --> 00:48:12,416
The X mark on Ohm's face,
it wasn't an accident.

678
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:19,583
We found that the depth of the cut
had been caused by a stray fingernail.

679
00:48:29,458 --> 00:48:30,875
Testing the waters?

680
00:48:35,291 --> 00:48:36,541
Perhaps magic.

681
00:48:37,958 --> 00:48:39,208
Well, it worked.

682
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:47,500
Let me tell you something.

683
00:48:51,791 --> 00:48:54,458
I'm not even sure if I'm your father.

684
00:48:55,250 --> 00:49:01,833
What I do know for certain is that
I wasn't the only one your mother fucked.

685
00:49:07,083 --> 00:49:08,291
It doesn't matter.

686
00:49:16,291 --> 00:49:17,625
I was lucky

687
00:49:19,333 --> 00:49:21,416
not to have been raised by you.

688
00:49:25,041 --> 00:49:27,166
- Get him in the car.
- Come on, then.

689
00:50:09,708 --> 00:50:12,375
I'll register for your workshop.

690
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:20,833
See you.

691
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:37,916
That family are unbelievable.

692
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:46,833
Hm?

693
00:50:56,125 --> 00:50:59,750
The angle bugs you, right?

694
00:51:31,625 --> 00:51:33,458
Don't do that.

695
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:36,250
Now, remember, Dalah,

696
00:51:36,875 --> 00:51:41,125
you always have to respect what you love.

697
00:52:00,166 --> 00:52:01,375
I wish I'd known you.
