00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:30,041
<i>Floral design can be slow</i>
<i>during the planning stage,</i>

2
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:32,708
<i>often involving debates with yourself.</i>

3
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,333
<i>However, execution is swift.</i>

4
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:38,708
<i>Personally,</i>
<i>I plan and execute simultaneously,</i>

5
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:40,500
<i>which takes time.</i>

6
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:44,625
<i>When you focus,</i>
<i>you can solve problems more effectively.</i>

7
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,041
This is for you.

8
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:53,500
Nothing like my wedding flowers.

9
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:01,666
I bought you a new phone.
Your contact list is already in there.

10
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:07,875
I never thought
it would come to this.

11
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:10,791
And now…

12
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:18,958
this might… implicate you
as an accomplice of mine.

13
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:20,458
Don't worry about that.

14
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:26,500
When the real killer is found,
everyone will know the truth.

00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:20,083
DALAH: DEATH AND THE FLOWERS

16
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,583
<i>You lose!</i>

17
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:47,000
<i>Too bad. Try again next time.</i>

18
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:49,791
<i>Next time.</i>

19
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,500
We should be able to sneak in.

20
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:01,500
After you.

21
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:44,125
Besides the two families,
I think we have other witnesses.

22
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,250
You mean these ants?

23
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,916
I mean the plants and flowers.

24
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,250
I need some time to talk to them.

25
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:02,125
I think you might have
distanced yourself from people too much.

26
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,625
You don't understand.

27
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,541
Are you saying flowers can talk?

28
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:15,125
Yes.

29
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,791
The angle bugs me.

30
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:27,625
The angle?

31
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:29,791
What angle?

32
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,375
Come close and see.

33
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,083
Please hold it.

34
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:08,291
Wouldn't this be called
tampering with a crime scene?

35
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,333
I'm just taking witness statements.

36
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,375
Scared of ghosts?

37
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,708
Why did you say that word?

38
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,041
I'm not scared, not at all.

39
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,500
He died right there.

40
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,583
You need to eat something, Mom.
So you can take your pills.

41
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,125
<i>It has been two days</i>
<i>since the murder that shocked the nation,</i>

42
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,333
<i>and the police have been unable to find…</i>

43
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:11,041
You're too damn slow.
What if the killer flees abroad?

44
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,166
No way, sir.

45
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,458
Without connections,
no one can sneak across borders.

46
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,250
You're too relaxed.

47
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:19,750
No, I'm not, brother.

48
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm just thinking that
Narisa didn't do it alone.

49
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,208
Who else could it be?

50
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:53,291
Ah! Good that you're here, darling.

51
00:06:58,416 --> 00:06:59,833
Taste this for me.

52
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,791
Wild rose tonic.

53
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,125
Shall I decode it too?

54
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:19,041
This Damask rose, where did it come from?

55
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,083
What species is this lily?

56
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,458
Don't bother.

57
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,083
Don't you already have a lot to decode?

58
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,791
<i>Protesters from</i>

59
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,833

60

<i>They're calling</i>

61
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,250

Good afternoon, sir.

64
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,208
Where are the flowers for the funeral?

65
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,625
Ah, right this way, sir.

66
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,291
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Oh, hello.

67
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:11,916
Sir, I… we would all like
to express to you our deepest condolences

68
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,291
for what happened.

69
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:18,166
Our apologies as well
for the inconvenience.

70
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,291
Not at all, sir.

71
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:20,958
All right, then.

72
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,666
I'll be waiting at the bar.

73
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,791
Let me know when it's done,
and I'll come back again.

74
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,041
Yes, sir.

75
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,291
If you need anything else,
just tell Sarath.

76
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,791
Okay, thank you. Yeah.

77
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,500
Um, pardon me, sir.

78
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,666
Hm?

79
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,583
I have some information,

80
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:43,666
but I'm not certain
whether it will be useful.

81
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:47,750
What is it?

82
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,375
Our doorman mentioned

83
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:53,083
<i>there was a suspicious car</i>
<i>waiting outside the hotel…</i>

84
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,166
You can't park here, sir.

85
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,458
…on the night of the dinner.

86
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,083
I can't confirm this,

87
00:08:57,166 --> 00:09:03,083
but the doorman said
the driver resembled the mob leader

88
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,750
<i>from the Uathepa Square.</i>

89
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,416
You can't park here, sir.

00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,125
Sanchai.

91
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,333
Yes?

92
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:30,125
<i>Miss Dalah, I've just learned</i>
<i>that the mob leader, Sanchai,</i>

93
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,083
<i>was staking out the hotel that night.</i>

94
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:33,500
Interesting.

95
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,125
<i>I think there might be something in it.</i>
<i>Why don't we go talk to him now--</i>

96
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,458
What is it?

97
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:44,166
Darling, you just arrived!
Leaving already?

98
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,625
I'm concerned about Risa.

99
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:51,583
The police still don't know anything.
Perhaps I'll dig something up.

100
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:52,875
Wait, wait!

101
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:56,000
You're a floral designer.
You're not a detective.

102
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,666

any comment at all? Anything at all?

Interesting.

143
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,166
He was tailing both families
on the night of the dinner.

144
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,791
Didn't expect him to miss the funeral.

145

She's the floral designer your father
recommended for the wedding.

Mr. Anusorn, nice to meet you.

156

Very nice to meet you.
You can call me Ohm.

157
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,833
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Anusorn.

158
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,250
Okay.

159
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,041
All right, let's eat.

160
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,583
Sorry to interrupt.

161
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,541
Someone left this envelope for you
at the front desk.

162
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:26,833
It was marked urgent.

163
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,333
Sir.

164
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,375
Is everything all right?

165
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,250
It's about the Square.

166
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:48,875
That Sanchai… seems like a hothead.

167
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,208
This is a problem
for both families.

168
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:55,750
I heard at the dinner table
that he came to this house armed.

169
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:59,875
Hm. That's it.
He's definitely the murderer.

170
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,583
When choosing flowers,

171
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:07,000
don't rush to pick the obvious choice.

172
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,791
Take your time
to analyze the strengths of each one.

173
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:17,750
Mm.

174
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,208
Hey.

175
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:36,833
Sir, please!

176
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:40,416
What's wrong with you people?
You know that you're all trespassing here.

177
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,458
Take them out now!

178
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,791
That's enough. This way.

179
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,166
- Get out of here.
- Out, please.

180
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,750
- Can we have an interview?
- Sir, please.

181
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,125
Hey! What?

182
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,375
Let's go. Come on.

183
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:14,541
Excuse me, sir.

184
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:18,583
Mr. Ekapop, please.
Please answer the question.

185
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,375
Koon! Hey, Koon!

186
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:25,625
Oh, Mr. Ekapop.

187
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:27,166
I'm leaving.

188
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:28,541
Yes.

189
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,375
Hello, sir.

190
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,708
- Sir, we have him.
- Take a seat.

191
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:50,625
Yes, sir.

192
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:57,500
Mr. Sanchai, I hope you understand
why we invited you here.

193
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,125
Oh, sure! "Invite," my ass!

194
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,000
You understand you have a motive.

195
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,583
- Be seated.
- Damn you!

196
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,708
- Sit down.
- Sit down, please.

197
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:07,708
Hey!

198
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,708
Now, please take a look at this video.

199
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,083
So what?

200
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,666
I know you carried a gun.

201
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:27,166
Very likely a .38-caliber.

202
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:31,375
And I also happen to know that
you threatened the Uathepa family with it.

203
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,291
My gun is legally registered.

204
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,875
What's wrong with that?

205
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,250
I didn't follow him all the way,

206
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,625
so how could I have been
the one that shot him?

207
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:40,875
Do you have an alibi?

208
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:43,333
Or perhaps you can account
for your movements?

209
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:47,083
There, check my phone.
I was on the phone with my wife.

210
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,333
She will confirm it.

211
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,291
Alibis can be fabricated.

212
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,541
Didn't you send a threatening letter
to Mr. Anusorn?

213
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:56,791
Me threaten him?

214
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
The mighty Uathepa family?

215
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,541
You know, my friend killed himself,

216
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:06,541
and it was them who made him do it!

217
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:08,708
I wrote to them.

218
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:13,625
I wrote a heartfelt letter
on behalf of the community.

219
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:18,083
I included my friend's suicide note
to the PM-to-be.

220
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,875
Those people are the real murderers.

221
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,958
They're slowly killing us.

222
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,083
- Move.
- Fucking cold-blooded.

223
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:38,666
I'm not sure it's him.

224
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,166
What about his gun?

225
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,000
Don't you have his gun?

226
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,083
His gun is not on the police registry
of suspicious firearms.

227
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,250
You sure it's him?

228
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:59,791
But, brother,
you should have seen him threatening me.

229
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,666
Excuse me, sir.

230
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,000
We've checked with Sanchai's neighbors.

231
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,583
Their dash cam shows
Sanchai returning home around 9:00-ish.

232
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:11,500
Huh?

233
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,041
You see, they're all involved.

234
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,458
Since you're all here,

235
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:27,500
why not use this opportunity
to go and talk to him about the Square?

236
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,250
Ohm's not here to handle it anymore.

237
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,250
Take care of it.

238
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,791
Tell them we'll wait for things to settle.

239
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,958
There's something that still nags me.

240
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:58,791
Are there other cameras?

241
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,708
Try the back one.

242
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:06,833
Pause it there.

243
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:20,291
Even if there are
different motives involved,

244
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,875
two people could still work together,
if their goals align.

245
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,500
Kris and Sanchai?

246
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:32,875
Kris probably knew the layout of the CCTV.

247
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:37,541
He got there on his bike,
so he would have arrived first.

248
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:42,041
That means he would have had time
to figure out where the blind spots were.

249
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:46,250
Sanchai might have changed plans,
not gone to the studio.

250
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:49,416
Kris lied about
why he was fighting with Narisa.

251
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,500
Wasn't about a song.

252
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:53,500
He was really upset about the wedding.

253
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,291
So he acted alone?

254
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:00,916
He must know where Narisa is.

255
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:10,208
Sorry about the phone.
I think I dropped it in my rush.

256
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,041
Mm, it's fine.

257
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:19,541
I make sure to not store
anything sensitive in there anyway.

258
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:22,416
<i>So, is everything okay?</i>

259
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,125
<i>Did you pull it off?</i>

260
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:26,958
Well, I'm not sure,

261
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:31,875
but I think my mom
might have seen us that night.

262
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:33,208
She did?

263
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:35,458
Don't worry. She'll help us anyway.

264
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:42,291
Have you listened to the demo?

265
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:44,541
<i>I have.</i>

266
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:47,833
I've had the chorus on repeat.

267
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:49,958
I love it.

268
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:52,541
Want to hear it live.

269
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:55,750
I'm glad.

270
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:00,291
<i>I've got another call coming in.</i>

271
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:01,833
I'll talk to you later.

272
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:04,375
Good night. Take care.

273
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:05,291
<i>Good night.</i>

274
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:21,291
HOW TO TAKE CARE OF A NEWBORN

275
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:27,666
Good night, baby.

276
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:36,250
Your tea, sir.

277
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,000
Is everything ready?

278
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:43,000
Yes, Jaa and I took care of it.

279
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:46,416
Very good. I'll check later.

280
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:54,458
And as for you, just stay quiet
if anyone asks questions.

281
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:56,541
Yes, sir.

282
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:54,375
For hope, and a new beginning.

283
00:25:54,958 --> 00:25:55,833
Nice flowers.

284
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:00,750
They have names too.

285
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:02,833
These are called <i>Gladiolus.</i>

286
00:26:07,458 --> 00:26:09,750
Are you going to bring me flowers
every day?

287
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:22,416
Risa, you can't stay hidden forever.

288
00:26:37,833 --> 00:26:40,250
I got a phone call from Montree.

289
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:43,916
He wants to question us again.

290
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,125
You know what to say
and what not to, right?

291
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:49,166
Do you all understand?

292
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,291
- Yes.
- Yes.

293
00:26:52,625 --> 00:26:53,500
What's wrong, Kris?

294
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:56,333
Why don't you care
about what your grandpa's saying?

295
00:26:56,416 --> 00:26:58,833
Hey! Quit nitpicking him.

296
00:26:58,916 --> 00:27:01,500
I asked because I'm concerned.

297
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:03,791
He might say something
quite inappropriate.

298
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,041
Come on, Prapha.

299
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,000
Kris is a good boy.

300
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:10,083
He knows what's appropriate.

301
00:27:10,916 --> 00:27:12,041
Wasn't he raised well?

302
00:27:19,291 --> 00:27:21,458
Is there something I'm missing here?

303
00:27:26,958 --> 00:27:28,208
You want to know, Pa?

304
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:29,375
You shut up.

305
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:31,333
Say it now.

306
00:27:33,791 --> 00:27:35,791
Chief Montree suspects Kris.

307
00:27:35,875 --> 00:27:37,625
What's Kris got to do with it?

308
00:27:37,708 --> 00:27:40,250
I hope he has
nothing to do with it, Pa.

309
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:43,583
I'm well aware
of his importance to this house.

310
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,916
- But this crazy thing already happened!
- Crazy thing?

311
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:54,500
Who'd you write that song for?
Your love song?

312
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:57,416
- You're in love with your aunt.
- Fuck off.

313
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,083
Kris!

314
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:00,666
What's happening here?

315
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,958
All this in-fighting and slandering.

316
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:05,458
Why are you doing this?

317
00:28:05,541 --> 00:28:07,041
It's because of you.

318
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:09,791
Seriously.

319
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:12,083
Your daughter was getting married,

320
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:14,750
and you didn't even know
what the groom was like.

321
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:17,541
What sort of person that prick really is.

322
00:28:17,625 --> 00:28:20,250
Kris, that's enough out of you.

323
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:21,791
You! You're an ingrate.

324
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,916
I wrote that song

325
00:28:24,416 --> 00:28:27,875
to let her know that even if nobody
in this family cares about her,

326
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:29,833
that at least I still do.

327
00:28:31,833 --> 00:28:34,958
Kris? Kris, darling. Kris.

328
00:28:39,416 --> 00:28:44,458
Great-grandson,
is there something you know about Ohm?

329
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,875
I know more than they do.

330
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:53,416
But you didn't do it, did you?

331
00:29:01,583 --> 00:29:02,500
Jib…

332
00:29:03,291 --> 00:29:04,750
Don't worry.

333
00:29:18,916 --> 00:29:20,583
Here are your clothes,
Miss Risa.

334
00:29:22,208 --> 00:29:24,416
Chief Montree wants to speak to Kris.

335
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,666
He's coming to the house today.

336
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:26,541
Shall we begin?

337
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:36,916
That night, what exactly
did the two of you argue about?

338
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,541
I already told you.

339
00:30:39,375 --> 00:30:40,500
It was a song.

340
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:43,875
- It made you that angry?
- It's your problem to believe it or not.

341
00:30:43,958 --> 00:30:47,083
- Where did you go after that?
- Home. My mother can confirm it.

342
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:48,250
Go ask her.

343
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:50,791
- So you haven't seen Narisa since?
- No.

344
00:30:50,875 --> 00:30:52,333
- Have you talked?
- No!

345
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,458
All right, may I see your phone?

346
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:03,833
You must let me see your phone.

347
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,750
Please unlock the phone for me.

348
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,791
N stands for?

349
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:52,666
It's Mr. Kris.

350
00:31:53,541 --> 00:31:56,208
Will you answer it yourself, Miss Risa?

351
00:32:04,166 --> 00:32:05,500
The timing bugs me.

352
00:32:13,416 --> 00:32:18,083
Uh, I'm very sorry to bother you, miss.

353
00:32:18,166 --> 00:32:20,375
Noomnim speaking. Is everything okay?

354
00:32:21,291 --> 00:32:22,250
Thank you.

355
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:28,250
That's how you named your maid's number?

356
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,291
Is that weird?

357
00:32:32,375 --> 00:32:34,125
She goes out and buys stuff for me.

358
00:32:34,208 --> 00:32:36,041
I can call her when I need anything.

359
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:41,291
It's hard for me to go out in public.
I hope you get that.

360
00:32:43,916 --> 00:32:46,125
What did you and Mr. Sanchai talk about?

361
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:47,333
Sanchai who?

362
00:32:47,916 --> 00:32:50,041
I think you know. He's the protest leader.

363
00:32:50,708 --> 00:32:52,958
CCTV shows you and he talking together.

364
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:55,958
Seems like you were planning something.

365
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:58,250
Yes, we were planning something.
You're right.

366
00:32:58,333 --> 00:32:59,708
What was it?

367
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:01,583
His shop is fixing my guitar.

368
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:05,875
If you don't believe me, check it out.
My guitar's there.

369
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:22,083
I went to Uathepa Square yesterday.

370
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:26,833
Some people think Sanchai is a suspect.

371
00:33:27,666 --> 00:33:28,833
I'm not surprised.

372
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,833
He's a radical person.

373
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,208
But I don't think it's him.

374
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:38,791
Neither do I, though…

375
00:33:40,416 --> 00:33:43,375
what about… Kris?

376
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,666
You know it's not Kris.

377
00:33:54,875 --> 00:33:57,666
- We're not talking about this anymore.
- You've got everything!

378
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:00,375
You've got the land.
You've got everything you want!

379
00:34:00,458 --> 00:34:01,833
So what's this about?

380
00:34:01,916 --> 00:34:04,458
You said you could handle everything
without marriage!

381
00:34:04,541 --> 00:34:06,250
So what the hell are you doing?!

382
00:34:10,125 --> 00:34:11,458
Okay, yes.

383
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:15,541
Yes, you're right.

384
00:34:17,791 --> 00:34:21,250
I told you I could handle it.
I told you I wouldn't marry him.

385
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:23,041
- But you fell for that asshole!
- I didn't!

386
00:34:23,125 --> 00:34:25,250
- Then what?
- It had nothing to do with Ohm.

387
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,333
Then what?

388
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:34,458
What?

389
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:41,125
It was… your grandfather.

390
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,125
It was the way he looked at me,

391
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,083
<i>on the engagement day.</i>

392
00:34:51,625 --> 00:34:53,000
I'm so happy for you.

393
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,083
Are you tired?

394
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,875
Not at all.

395
00:35:03,166 --> 00:35:05,583
It was the first time
he looked at me like that.

396
00:35:14,041 --> 00:35:16,250
<i>It didn't matter if I was a top student,</i>

397
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:19,500
<i>graduated with honors, or had a PhD.</i>

398
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,958
It didn't matter if I was good at my job
or made a lot of money.

399
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:28,125
He'd never been so proud of me
as he was on that day.

400
00:35:28,208 --> 00:35:30,666
You've finally done your duty
as a daughter.

401
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:42,500
I know that I'm being selfish,
but I beg you.

402
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:52,833
I want so much
to experience that feeling again

403
00:35:52,916 --> 00:35:53,916
just one last time.

404
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,625
There must be some other way!

405
00:35:56,708 --> 00:35:58,416
- There must be some other way!
- There isn't!

406
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,666
Fuck!

407
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:08,333
Kris. I know, you know…

408
00:36:13,291 --> 00:36:15,333
that after all that is going to happen…

409
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:19,000
I will have nothing left.

410
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:31,458
I'm going to marry him.

411
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,083
Fine.

412
00:36:38,083 --> 00:36:39,166
But I…

413
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:42,916
This plan is all fucked!
This is all your fucking fault.

414
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,000
He's a fucking asshole.

415
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:49,083
He's a fucking asshole,
and you're still going to marry him?

416
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:51,208
- Pam, what's going on?
- Are you still gonna marry him?

417
00:36:51,291 --> 00:36:53,250
- Pam. Pam, stop it. Pam.
- Go to hell! All of you!

418
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:55,041
Especially that asshole!

419
00:37:06,416 --> 00:37:07,625
Ah, Xinxin.

420
00:37:13,125 --> 00:37:14,208
Pardon me, sir.

421
00:37:19,666 --> 00:37:21,250
Tell me, what's troubling you?

422
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,583
Um, Kris…

423
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:28,791
Kris didn't kill Uncle Ohm.

424
00:37:28,875 --> 00:37:30,958
Xinxin, I never said that he did.

425
00:37:34,875 --> 00:37:36,000
You know who did it?

426
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:43,000
I don't. I'm sorry.

427
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:49,833
- Is it him?
- Yes, it's him.

428
00:37:49,916 --> 00:37:51,708
- It is.
- It must be.

429
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:52,625
Oh my God.

430
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:54,583
What are you doing?

431
00:37:55,958 --> 00:37:57,125
Let him see it.

432
00:37:58,416 --> 00:37:59,250
Mm.

433
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,416
SURPRISE FOR THE GROOM

434
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:11,583
Who's seen this?

435
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:12,625
Um…

436
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,291
I'll handle it.

437
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:17,458
Don't say a word about this,
especially about who gave you the file.

438
00:38:17,541 --> 00:38:20,500
Otherwise, we'll all be in trouble.
Got it?

439
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:21,708
Yes.

440
00:38:27,458 --> 00:38:28,333
What's happening?

441
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:33,000
Mr. Panot, explain. How is it
you don't know where this file came from?

442
00:38:33,083 --> 00:38:37,125
Mr. Sarath said this clip
was supposed to be shown at your wedding.

443
00:38:37,208 --> 00:38:39,375
<i>Know anything about it?</i>

444
00:38:39,458 --> 00:38:41,000
No, nothing at all.

445
00:38:41,083 --> 00:38:44,125
Did the staff tell you
who gave them the drive?

446
00:38:45,208 --> 00:38:47,166
And you've seen it before?

447
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:52,000
If this is what we think it is,

448
00:38:52,083 --> 00:38:54,625
then this file
could turn out to be strong evidence

449
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:56,208
in Dr. Anusorn's murder case.

450
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,833
That's why you think Mr. Anusorn's killer…

451
00:39:02,916 --> 00:39:03,750
is Pam.

452
00:39:40,666 --> 00:39:44,500
<i>The challenge of deconstructing</i>
<i>a floral arrangement</i>

453
00:39:45,625 --> 00:39:48,083
<i>often arises from impatience</i>

454
00:39:49,958 --> 00:39:51,666
<i>and carelessness.</i>

455
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,375
<i>Sometimes, we may leave some flowers</i>
<i>with bruises.</i>

456
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:12,541
<i>And the most fragile flowers</i>

457
00:40:14,291 --> 00:40:17,500
<i>may become too damaged to salvage.</i>

458
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:25,458
<i>Leaving us with the only choice…</i>

459
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,416
<i>to discard them.</i>

460
00:40:32,875 --> 00:40:34,416
You're gonna be okay!

461
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,541
Bee!

462
00:40:35,625 --> 00:40:36,791
Please make her okay!

463
00:40:36,875 --> 00:40:38,166
You have to wait outside.

464
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:48,333
<i>I don't exist… I don't exist…</i>
<i>I don't exist… I don't exist…</i>

465
00:40:49,083 --> 00:40:50,166
<i>I don't exist…</i>

466
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:52,958
<i>I don't exist!</i>

467
00:40:53,625 --> 00:40:55,041
<i>I don't exist!</i>

468
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:57,375
<i>I don't exist!</i>

469
00:40:57,458 --> 00:40:58,416
<i>Hello?</i>

470
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:03,250
If something happens to Bee,
you'll all be responsible.
