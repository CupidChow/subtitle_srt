1
00:00:52,689 --> 00:00:53,689
Are you insane?

2
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:57,630
You're getting my money
and pigging out, fucking bastard?

3
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,829
Don’t mess around.

4
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,369
You're fucking nuts.

5
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:03,640
Head down, asshole.

6
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,269
Who are you to tell me what to do?

7
00:01:08,739 --> 00:01:09,739
Are you insane?

8
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,040
What the fuck is that?

9
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,750
What?

10
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,290
Jesus...

11
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:28,030
God, I was almost fucked up.

12
00:02:01,629 --> 00:02:05,359
A CHILD WHO BECAME THE DAGGER

13
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:23,080
I've done it.

14
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:25,479
I see.

15
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,689
Well done, my son.

16
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,620
You're not injured, right?

17
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,490
Yes.

18
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:34,289
I'm fine.

19
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:36,809
It’s not like
I’m doing this once or twice.

20
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,900
I know.

21
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:41,330
I trust you.

22
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:43,129
You know that, right?

23
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,439
Yes.

24
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,469
You're fucking sissy.

25
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,310
If you don't get us money,

26
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,439
we will kill you.

27
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,310
Everybody knows that you’re gay
from the orphanage.

28
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:32,120
If I were you, I’d definitely kill myself.

29
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,120
Put your eyes down.

30
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,250
I told you, eyes down, son of the bitch.

31
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:38,689
Don’t fucking stare at me.

32
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:40,889
Down!

33
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:42,229
Down!

34
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,060
Fucking bitch.

35
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:49,300
Bow down. Bow, bitch.

36
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,669
Hey! This fucking piece of shit.

37
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,310
Oh look, who’s trembling. Fucking retard.

38
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,730
Lift your head up.
Hey, I said lift your head up.

39
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,620
Stop it. Please stop.

40
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,580
Stop.

41
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:10,490
What are you guys doing?

42
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,930
What now?

43
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:18,259
Hey, it's not your business. Get out.

44
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,600
Oh shit.

45
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,339
- Go away!
- Oh shit.

46
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,519
SECRET SPECTACLES

47
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,839
It always ends up right at
the most important moment.

48
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,939
Can’t wait till the third episode.

49
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,410
Awesome.

50
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,689
Black Rose Author. Black Rose Brother.

51
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,136
When will the novel
Lonely Killer episode 3 be uploaded?

52
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,235
FROM: BLACK ROSE
Nice to meet you, Wild Dog haha.

53
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:28,189
I'm sorry.
I've been getting busier lately.

54
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,259
You won't let your fans know
who you are, right?

55
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:32,730
FROM: BLACK ROSE
If that's Wild Dog, I'll show you my face.

56
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:35,970
Wow! I look forward to seeing you
in the first meeting.

57
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,740
I don't know.

58
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:34,329
You can not enter at the moment.

59
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,290
Chill.

60
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,759
Welcome, Chisoo, my dear nephew.

61
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:45,769
Come here.

62
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:55,910
I'm upset...

63
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,620
that your father left our gang
and made his own mob.

64
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,120
What is it called? Black Rose? Black Bush?

65
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,360
He came up with this ridiculous name,

66
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:09,029
and took away
such a talented man like you.

67
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,959
Motherfucker.

68
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,170
Sure, fine!

69
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,399
He's trying to make a living. Who cares.

70
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,420
However, there’re always
rules in this business.

71
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:25,379
Is it humanly possible for a man
to covet his brother's food?

72
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,810
I’m also talking to you.

73
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:33,720
You have never came to see me
since you left with your father.

74
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,620
Am I still your big uncle?

75
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,029
Do you even remember the time
when we were on the same boat?

76
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,070
Let's change the subject.

77
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:49,809
Go tell your father
not to even dream about

78
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,910
having the business rights
for Riverside Night Club.

79
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,039
Gotta covet what you gotta covet.

80
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,779
That... Black Rose... your dad.

81
00:08:57,409 --> 00:09:00,850
I told him to come see me in person
but look who’s here instead of him!

82
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,580
Rude motherfucker.

83
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:05,950
Uncle.

84
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:18,100
That fucking bastard!

85
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,470
We should not return
empty-handed next time.

86
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:28,769
What?

87
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,610
Hey!

88
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:38,019
What...

89
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,820
What the...

90
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:45,059
Hey! You, Flying Dagger!

91
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,929
- Do you mind if I eat this?
- No, go ahead.

92
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,129
- I can't open it. Open it for me!
- Let me help.

93
00:09:56,769 --> 00:09:57,769
Thanks.

94
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,740
Can I have it now?

95
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:09,309
Oh, is this buy one get one free?

96
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,889
There aren't any discounts
for those condoms.

97
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,330
Where's the banana milk?

98
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,820
He told me just went out for a little
while. Why isn’t he coming yet?

99
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,960
It’s way too busy now.

100
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:34,730
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?

101
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,899
Oh yes, I had a meal here once before.

102
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:40,000
It was so good
that I decided to come back again.

103
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,110
Really?

104
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:44,210
Well, thank you for coming back.

105
00:11:45,909 --> 00:11:47,679
I remember your face quite well.

106
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,500
Maybe it's because you’re so handsome.

107
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,450
Hey! You!

108
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,919
Gotta be on time for the dinner rush.

109
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,820
Why were you so late?

110
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,190
Just come help me quickly.

111
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:01,259
Yes.

112
00:12:17,909 --> 00:12:19,279
The food was great.

113
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:21,750
Well, I'm very glad you liked it.

114
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:23,186
- Yes.
- Feel free to come back again.

115
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,080
Sure.

116
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:25,019
Can I have a bill?

117
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,120
- Oh right.
- Yeah.

118
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:30,289
Oh, yes.

119
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:41,269

121
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,289
I'm planning...

122
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:11,799
to meet the author as
a represent of the Black Rose fans,

123
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,230
and introduce myself properly,

124
00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:16,970
then make a schedule one-by-one
in the future.

125
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:24,679
I hope everyone looks forward for that.
Please pump me full of endless support.

126
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:27,879
"Pump."

127
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:35,889
That was cute.

128
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,830
Hurry up.

129
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,769
It dropped only once. Why it’s so slow.

130
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,100
Christ's sake...

131
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,269
FROM: BLACK ROSE
Wild Dog, you worked very hard!

132
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,509
Oh, Black Rose!

133
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,080
FROM: WILD DOG

134
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:03,796
Did you upload the novel Lonely Killer
Episode 3? I just wanted to read.

135
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,820
It's uploaded.

136
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,120
Sorry for late upload.

137
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,220
I'm looking forward to it!

138
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:13,220
FROM: BLACK ROSE
Tomorrow. The day we promised to meet.

139
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:15,659
Oh! That's right. Tomorrow?

140
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,299
Did you forget the appointment?

141
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:18,899
No!

142
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,070
I never forgot.

143
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:23,639
Oh, I'm nervous.

144
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,269
I'm excited to see you, Black Rose... Haha

145
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,920
Me too. Looking forward to seeing you
in the first meeting.

146
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:38,279
- Excuse me?
- Yeah.

147
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:39,620
Oh, hello.

148
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,889
I’m looking for some onions...

149
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,490
Onions? Sure, these onions are fresh.

150
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:45,259
- Sounds good.
- These purple onions are fresh and firm.

151
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:49,059
- Touch them and you’ll know.
- Then I'd like to have each.

152
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:51,730
- Can you put them in a plastic bag?
- Want me to wrap it up?

153
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:01,509
- One more.
- It’s heavy. Take one more.

154
00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:05,940
I bet people will love this
since it's sweet.

155
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:07,610
Well, look who is so handsome here.

156
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,580
You're willing to be a bodyguard
to protect your sister.

157
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,549
You’re handsome and also kind.

158
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:20,135
- Kind? Not sure about that.
- Well, he’s kind enough, I'd say.

159
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:22,559
He wouldn't even do this
when he’s busy doing his own things.

160
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,000
Be nice to your sister.

161
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,399
Everyone around here knows that
she has raised you since you were a baby.

162
00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:30,299
- Oh, yes, I know.
- She is like your mother.

163
00:15:30,669 --> 00:15:32,399
- How much is it?
- 9000 won. For 3 bags.

164
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,240
Here you go.

165
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:42,710
- He is pretty handsome, isn’t he?
- Yes, he is.

166
00:15:43,049 --> 00:15:44,149
Please.

167
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,850
My cute little puppy.

168
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,220
- I'll leave then.
- Yes.

169
00:15:48,289 --> 00:15:49,620
Bye. See you next time.

170
00:15:56,259 --> 00:16:00,129
I have an important appointment today.
I'll come back a bit later.

171
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:05,609
I was wondering why you had been working so
hard at the restaurant these past few days.

172
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:08,710
I'll be back by the dinner rush.
Can I go? Please?

173
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,730
Since when have you gotten my permission
for going out?

174
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:14,909
I'm sorry.

175
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,820
Do you have enough money to go out?

176
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:22,649
You...

177
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,659
You're not doing something dangerous,
are you?

178
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,059
Don't worry.

179
00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:30,049
Go get a date
if you have time to worry about me.

180
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:33,779
Hey, you should first get me a guy
before saying that.

181
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,269
My friends are too young for you.

182
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:37,899
You sure? Don’t underestimate me.

183
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:38,970
Whatever.

184
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:40,870
Focus on your job.

185
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:42,740
Are you seeing someone?

186
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:44,779
Me? I don’t know.

187
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,679
Tell me first
when you start dating someone?

188
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:06,799
FROM: WILD DOG
I'm almost there.

189
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,720
Yes?

190
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:38,700
Got it. I’m on my way.

191
00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:18,940
It’s the same smell from last time.

192
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:20,799
Nice.

193
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,710
Wild Dog, I'm really sorry.

194
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,920
Something urgent has happened
so I can’t make it today.

195
00:18:33,819 --> 00:18:34,819
Next time...

196
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,920
See you next time. I promise. I’m Sorry.

197
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:39,759
Oh, okay. Bye then.

198
00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:51,869
Brother.

199
00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:54,209
Is this indeed how it's going to be?

200
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,210
Are you wiling to have a war between us?

201
00:18:57,809 --> 00:19:00,750
Even without any notice?
What kind of scheming are you doing here?

202
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,849
Have you gone senile?

203
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,250
Senile?

204
00:19:06,349 --> 00:19:09,349
So have you been trying to bury me
because I’ve gone senile?

205
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,490
Arrogant fuckers.

206
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:16,430
Who was the one took
all the hopeless trashes in and fed them?

207
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:23,170
Even street dogs don’t pay
kindness to evil.

208
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,440
Me too...

209
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,400
Oh, no...

210
00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:29,839
I did everything
I could under you, old man.

211
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:34,669
Who was the one doubting me and casting
me aside? I've dedicated my entire life.

212
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:37,220
Riverside Night Club.

213
00:19:38,619 --> 00:19:40,420
I cultivated it with my bare hands.

214
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:44,759
Making that much money off my back,
I think it's human duty to pass some back.

215
00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:47,829
Human duty?

216
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,559
All right.

217
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:53,059
So the one who knows so well...

218
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:56,670
about human duty sends his foster son
to threat me.

219
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,900
Black Bush...

220
00:19:59,769 --> 00:20:01,309
Don't make a misjudgment.

221
00:20:02,509 --> 00:20:04,839
This Black Leopard isn't old yet.

222
00:20:05,779 --> 00:20:08,380
If you disgrace me one more time,

223
00:20:08,779 --> 00:20:11,220
demolishing one office
will not be the end of it.

224
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,390
Then there will be real war!

225
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,930
Such an Old Black Cat.

226
00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:28,869
It's time to hunt.

227
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,309
Oh. You are finishing up this early?

228
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,720
Yeah, my sister is tired
so we are closing a bit early.

229
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:47,720
Is she sick?

230
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,019
No, she’s okay.

231
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:50,970
Then I should stop by next time.

232
00:20:51,019 --> 00:20:52,859
- Great. Stop by anytime.
- Yeah.

233
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,430
I saw you at the cafe...
What were you up to?

234
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:06,910
Oh, I just had an appointment a bit ago,
but it fell through.

235
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,509
Oh... well, same for me.

236
00:21:17,349 --> 00:21:18,420
See you.

237
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:26,559
Wild Dog, hello?

238
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:27,589
Yes, hello there.

239
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,660
Wild...

240
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:33,329
Wild Dog.

241
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,200
You are?

242
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,940
Black Rose?

243
00:21:43,579 --> 00:21:47,509
Oh then, this restaurant is your house?

244
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,509
Whoa! Hey!

245
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,750
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

246
00:21:53,849 --> 00:21:56,289
No.
I just got banged up a bit while working.

247
00:21:59,859 --> 00:22:01,660
Are you okay? You seem really hurt.

248
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:03,529
Where do you live? I'll take you home.

249
00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:06,329
What?
Are you treating me like a patient now?

250
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
Yes, you are my patient. This is serious.

251
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,369
Quickly, let me take you home.

252
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,140
No. I'm really fine.

253
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:16,809
This house is really awesome.

254
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:20,020
Living in a place like this must turn
the faucet on for words like that.

255
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:21,410
Really cool.

256
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,319
Come up here quick.
I'll put a patch on you.

257
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:29,319
Oh god, sorry.
I put it on too hard, didn't I?

258
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,660
It's okay. Can you put one more here?

259
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,660
One second.

260
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:39,059
Wow. Look at your abs!

261
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,170
- Six pack right there.
- Uh, stop.

262
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,539
Your abs...

263
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:44,869
are very aggressive.

264
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,140
Don't touch. I’m ticklish. Wait.

265
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,410
- What's wrong?
- You are really tickling me.

266
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,380
- It really tickled me.
- Who cares!

267
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,480
I’ve done nothing.

268
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,250
Wait.

269
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:58,279
One second.

270
00:23:52,069 --> 00:23:53,170
I'm sorry.

271
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:03,380
Hey, this doesn't come off.

272
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:10,890
THE DAGGER THAT CUTS ITSELF
ON THE BLACK ROSE

273
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:43,319
What are you doing?

274
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:48,559
Oh, hey! How can you just bring
the blanket outside? Look at the dust.

275
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:49,890
I'm sorry.

276
00:24:50,099 --> 00:24:52,859
No, nevermind. Sorry, it's fine. Really.

277
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,069
I'm a bit of a neat freak.

278
00:24:58,369 --> 00:24:59,369
A neat freak...

279
00:25:00,769 --> 00:25:02,449
Do they call that mysophobia or something?

280
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:05,180
That's not mysophobia.

281
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:09,380
Come on, look at this.
Everything is perfectly straight and tidy.

282
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:11,720
I told you, it's not mysophobia.

283
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,600
Is there something wrong with being clean?

284
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:20,730
Eat your breakfast.

285
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:24,059
And do you drink milk?

286
00:25:37,109 --> 00:25:38,109
What?

287
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:40,210
Again?

288
00:25:40,349 --> 00:25:41,349
Chisoo!

289
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:10,230
Life is like this little golf ball,

290
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,529
especially for people like us
who have a lot of physical tasks.

291
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,440
If you get a hole-in-one with one shot,

292
00:28:17,869 --> 00:28:19,700
it’s not only good for you,

293
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:23,330
but also good for the ball itself since
it shows its worth with only one trial.

294
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,950
So it’s like killing two birds
with one stone.

295
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,750
But, if the ball sticks out

296
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:33,119
and doesn't go into the hole...

297
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:36,289
Pow! Pow! It gets beaten again.

298
00:28:36,819 --> 00:28:40,990
It gets dunked in water
or stuck into a sand trap.

299
00:28:42,859 --> 00:28:44,700
So it's pretty rough time for both,
isn't it?

300
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,170
But have you ever seen a game...

301
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:51,039
that gets finished
before the ball gets into the hole?

302
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:54,470
The Golf ball...

303
00:28:56,210 --> 00:29:00,849
has to get into the hole no matter how.

304
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,950
That is its fate.

305
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:09,650
Chisoo.

306
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:19,000
Haven't we spent enough time
living as the Golf ball and the Golf club?

307
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,000
We should become a fucking golf player
this time. Don’t you think so?

308
00:29:29,609 --> 00:29:30,640
Let's get rid of...

309
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,880
Black Leopard.

310
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:36,480
How can I...

311
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,680
You...

312
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,450
can do it, right?

313
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:44,060
I understand that you are upset
because of the thing with the nightclub,

314
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:45,160
but still... uncle...

315
00:29:45,589 --> 00:29:46,589
"Uncle?"

316
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,730
You only have a dad as your family.

317
00:30:05,109 --> 00:30:06,210
You know this, right?

318
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,950
This handkerchief
that clearly shows “Black Rose”...

319
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:19,519
Since the moment
when we shared this same handkerchiefs,

320
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:22,960
only us, you and I, have become kindred.

321
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,700
I...

322
00:30:34,369 --> 00:30:38,609
didn’t raise my son solely
because I wanted the club.

323
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,210
Am I right?

324
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:53,420
Hello.

325
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:54,619
Oh, hi!

326
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:55,950
Come in.

327
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:02,160
Aren't you tired going to your work?

328
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:05,500
No, I went to work late in the afternoon.

329
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:06,930
And...

330
00:32:07,529 --> 00:32:10,369
I could handle that, anyway.
Why would I be tired?

331
00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:16,140
Hey, I knew it... the power.

332
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,980
Power coming from right there.

333
00:32:20,109 --> 00:32:22,980
- Power...
- Stop. We're at home. At home...

334
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:26,720
I mean come eat some fruit.

335
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:30,890
Thanks.

336
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:32,420
Oh, I forgot forks.

337
00:32:33,259 --> 00:32:35,490
Gitae, go get forks for me.

338
00:32:37,329 --> 00:32:38,329
Sure.

339
00:32:39,329 --> 00:32:40,329
Goodness.

340
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:45,140
Are you guys just friends?

341
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,200
Sorry?

342
00:32:46,539 --> 00:32:48,069
Gitae likes men.

343
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:53,039
I see you're surprised
so it must be one of two options.

344
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:56,180
Either you didn't know that,
or you aren't just friends.

345
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,980
Here's your fork.

346
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,660
I wonder...

347
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,220
What did my sister do to make
Chisoo uncomfortable?

348
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,130
I told that you like guys.

349
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:11,829
Sister, really!

350
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,000
If you're dating,

351
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,170
be good to this guy.

352
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:21,009
As a youngest brother
who grew up without parental affection,

353
00:33:21,369 --> 00:33:22,640
he only thinks about himself.

354
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,339
I'll explain it gradually.

355
00:33:26,849 --> 00:33:28,410
It's true. We're dating.

356
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,349
Your sister seems very nice.

357
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:37,990
My sister?

358
00:33:39,289 --> 00:33:42,089
Yeah. She's like my mom.

359
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,859
A bit strict as she seems
but she is the most heartwarming person.

360
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,869
When I was senior in high school,

361
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:53,940
I broke up with my first boyfriend

362
00:33:54,009 --> 00:33:55,740
and failed my college entrance exam.

363
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,980
Somehow she just knew,
and consoled me by understanding.

364
00:34:00,579 --> 00:34:03,619
That’s why I actually never needed
to specifically “come out”.

365
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,989
Is that what they call family?

366
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,159
What about your family?

367
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:16,989
My family?

368
00:34:17,829 --> 00:34:19,949
My family...
Well, I don't even have a memory of them.

369
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:23,869
You said you had a foster parent, right?

370
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,239
Your company boss...

371
00:34:29,309 --> 00:34:30,309
Time to leave.

372
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,230
Chisoo.

373
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:53,699
Nobody's around.

374
00:35:22,929 --> 00:35:24,289
Can you cook ramen for me, please?

375
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:27,369
Ramen? Did I buy ramen?

376
00:35:27,869 --> 00:35:28,869
Who is it?

377
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,400
Chisoo.

378
00:35:33,739 --> 00:35:34,739
Who’s that?

379
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:37,440
A new henchman?

380
00:35:38,139 --> 00:35:39,139
What's going on?

381
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,480
What's wrong?

382
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:43,349
Did I come when I wasn't supposed to?

383
00:35:52,059 --> 00:35:53,929
You should go home for today.

384
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,230
Okay.

385
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,885
You know that I don’t like anyone
coming to my house without being invited.

386
00:36:12,909 --> 00:36:13,909
"Anyone?"

387
00:36:18,179 --> 00:36:20,190
Since when I have been just "anyone"?

388
00:36:23,659 --> 00:36:24,659
Why are you...

389
00:36:26,389 --> 00:36:27,889
rarely at the office these days?

390
00:36:29,789 --> 00:36:30,900
By any chance...

391
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:33,329
Are you dating with that guy?

392
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,070
Hey, you piece of shit.

393
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,075
Did you forget the promise
you made with me when I took you in?

394
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:40,309
I did not forget our promise.

395
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,270
Then what's with that asshole?

396
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:47,239
So...

397
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,686
Do you miss the time
when people call you fucking homo

398
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,070
and didn’t treat you like a human?

399
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,889
You want to go back to that time?

400
00:36:55,019 --> 00:36:57,519
- Dad!
- Shut your mouth.

401
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:00,559
I'm your savior before I am your father.

402
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:05,260
You've watched how betrayers end up.

403
00:37:06,869 --> 00:37:08,530
You should know.

404
00:37:15,739 --> 00:37:16,780
This house,

405
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:19,940
everything in it.

406
00:37:20,809 --> 00:37:22,809
Don't ever think this was done by you.

407
00:37:32,489 --> 00:37:34,260
All of this came from me.

408
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,139
Everything you have,
even to your smallest pinky toe.

409
00:37:52,809 --> 00:37:54,369
That’s the reason why I am your father.

410
00:37:55,949 --> 00:37:56,949
And that’s...

411
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,150
the reason why you are mine.

412
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,960
Flying Dagger...

413
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:09,329
You owe me for becoming
the number one hitman.

414
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,670
Our goal is to get rid of Black Leopard.

415
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:18,199
You got it?

416
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,010
Father...

417
00:38:27,949 --> 00:38:30,750
I no longer want
to coat my hands with blood.

418
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,030
Chisoo.

419
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,469
Why Saturnus...

420
00:38:53,769 --> 00:38:57,139
devoured his sons every time
when he had one?

421
00:38:59,139 --> 00:39:00,710
I told you about this.

422
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:03,050
Do you remember?

423
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:12,719
Whether we're doing it one way or another,
let's be sure about our decision.

424
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:20,969
Betrayal to a savior means hell.

425
00:39:39,179 --> 00:39:40,289
If you don't mind,

426
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:42,350
make sure you keep
that handkerchief with you.

427
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:08,880
FINDING A HIDDEN PICTURE

428
00:40:08,949 --> 00:40:11,250
Ok, how’s your sister?

429
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:19,960
It’s hard to find a young man
like you these days. I’m proud.

430
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:30,900
All the bastards after me already knew
the faces of all our members.

431
00:40:33,409 --> 00:40:35,840
We need a face that hasn't been exposed.

432
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:42,710
So take special care not to be exposed.

433
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,550
Yes.

434
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,190
How is...

435
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:52,889
the progress of your mission?

436
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,079
Gitae.

437
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,230
Are you going to the restaurant today?

438
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,780
Sorry?

439
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,219
What are you worried about?

440
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,820
What's wrong?

441
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:24,619
Aren't your love life going well?

442
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,920
Nevermind...

443
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:28,590
Really?

444
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:32,075
You’ve been busy these days
and aren't around at the restaurant much.

445
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:34,429
Have you gotten into fights
or troubles, maybe?

446
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,130
Not at all.

447
00:41:42,139 --> 00:41:43,210
Then what's wrong?

448
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,179
You know you can't pull the wool
over my eyes, right?

449
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:58,519
If you do anything wrong,

450
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:01,439
nosy people will love to gossip about you
as a kid without parents...

451
00:42:03,699 --> 00:42:04,699
I mean,

452
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,969
I don't care what they talk about me.

453
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:13,300
But I can't stand by to watch people
bullshitting about you.

454
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:16,710
I know.

455
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:21,309
I know how much you treasure me.

456
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:25,550
Goodness...

457
00:42:25,949 --> 00:42:27,250
I’m glad that you know.

458
00:42:30,489 --> 00:42:31,489
Sister...

459
00:42:35,289 --> 00:42:37,030
I really love him a lot.

460
00:42:38,659 --> 00:42:40,829
Oh. Then what's the problem?

461
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:43,739
Why? He doesn't love you back?

462
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:46,239
No.

463
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:47,909
He really loves me too.

464
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:50,539
That’s nice.

465
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:57,949
But why the long face?
Looks like you got dumped.

466
00:43:01,989 --> 00:43:05,789
It's hard to find a mate
who loves you as much as you do.

467
00:43:07,389 --> 00:43:10,789
Even if you meet someone who equally likes
you, going through life causes many creaks.

468
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:15,670
Gitae.

469
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:20,369
Don’t disappoint someone you love.

470
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:26,039
Yeah.

471
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:31,019
Goodness...

472
00:43:32,019 --> 00:43:34,820
I remember that guy from that time
that just dumped me and left.

473
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:37,090
Goodness...

474
00:43:38,219 --> 00:43:41,559
I never wanna see his face
again ever in my life.

475
00:44:25,639 --> 00:44:30,809
Your novel is so enjoyable
since it has that reality in it.

476
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,280
Do you think so?

477
00:44:35,809 --> 00:44:40,550
The hitman in the novel is
somehow like you.

478
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:43,820
There's no way
I can be a hitman, you know.

479
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:47,190
You know...

480
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,000
Nevermind. I'll scrub your back.

481
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,849
I wonder if I like you too much.

482
00:45:08,349 --> 00:45:09,349
Huh?

483
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:12,920
I love you.

484
00:45:14,289 --> 00:45:15,920
Don’t be so cheesy.

485
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:20,130
You think so?

486
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:25,360
Gitae. I really love you a lot too.

487
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:31,670
Do you trust me?

488
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:36,809
I trust you,
and I know you won't leave me.

489
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:39,010
But I...

490
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:40,210
Gitae.

491
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:44,550
I know what you're worrying about.

492
00:45:45,349 --> 00:45:47,619
But seriously don’t worry.

493
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:51,559
I will never change, at least not to you.

494
00:45:52,289 --> 00:45:53,289
Okay?

495
00:46:11,739 --> 00:46:12,739
It's 7am.

496
00:46:13,809 --> 00:46:17,349
Gitae, you said you have to go
to your sister's restaurant. Hurry up.

497
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:18,880
Oh! Right.

498
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:20,090
Get up.

499
00:46:20,489 --> 00:46:21,489
Thanks.

500
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:26,219
- Go take a shower.
- Okay.

501
00:47:02,489 --> 00:47:04,000
ALCOHOL

502
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,550
FATHER

503
00:47:46,369 --> 00:47:47,369
Yes.

504
00:47:48,409 --> 00:47:49,409
Yes, father.

505
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:52,510
Ok.

506
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,090
Fine, got it.

507
00:48:00,519 --> 00:48:01,519
I'll head over there.

508
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,920
Let's have a drink with dinner.

509
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:05,820
Sure.

510
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:16,329
I made plans to meet Black Rose...

511
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:18,900
at the Seochang-dong Mahjong house.

512
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:23,909
He said he wants to see me
face to face to apologize.

513
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:28,480
I thought he’ve lost his mind
and messed around.

514
00:48:29,909 --> 00:48:31,880
Well, I guess he realized who’s the boss.

515
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:53,969
Still, get our members ready just in case.

516
00:48:54,539 --> 00:48:58,139
Also get Wild Dog ready.

517
00:49:08,289 --> 00:49:09,289
Hey, you.

518
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:11,820
Give me a cig.

519
00:49:26,199 --> 00:49:27,440
I... Isn't that Flying Dagger?

520
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:29,369
Stop him!

521
00:51:48,309 --> 00:51:53,119
LONG TIME NO SEE, MY LOVE

522
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:18,070
Chisoo.

523
00:53:21,469 --> 00:53:22,539
Chisoo.

524
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,690
I'm sorry, Chisoo.

525
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:43,760
Who are you?

526
00:53:45,329 --> 00:53:47,469
Who the hell are you?

527
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:52,869
I didn’t know this gonna happen.

528
00:53:53,539 --> 00:53:54,539
No.

529
00:53:55,469 --> 00:53:57,440
Chisoo, this is all my fault.

530
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:59,639
Everything is my fault.

531
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:09,690
Tell me.

532
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:13,059
Why were you there?

533
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:17,329
I'm sorry, Chisoo.

534
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:37,449
What are you sorry for?

535
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:41,519
Tell me the truth, now.

536
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:43,760
Otherwise, I'm seriously
going to kill you.

537
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:53,059
Have you tricked me?

538
00:54:57,099 --> 00:54:59,469
You approached to me
with some sort of intent, is that it?

539
00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:02,170
To kill me.

540
00:55:05,539 --> 00:55:06,539
I'm sorry.

541
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:18,619
You’re right!

542
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:20,960
It was intentional.

543
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:28,929
I approached to you at first to kill you.

544
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,170
Because that's my job.

545
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:37,409
But that's not how it is now.

546
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:39,880
What I feel now...

547
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:42,150
What I feel now is different.

548
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:55,760
Chisoo, I'm sorry.

549
00:56:04,369 --> 00:56:05,800
One day, I thought,

550
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:10,380
I've been living a life like this...

551
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:15,949
How can someone like me trust people?

552
00:56:18,449 --> 00:56:19,780
Who the hell can I trust?

553
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:25,920
Who am I...

554
00:56:28,389 --> 00:56:29,530
supposed to trust?

555
00:56:35,869 --> 00:56:38,869
I'll tell you everything,
and I won't leave anything out.

556
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,170
I'm sorry.

557
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:47,750
I'm sorry.

558
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,500
I'm okay.

559
00:58:03,719 --> 00:58:05,389
Come on in.

560
00:58:05,559 --> 00:58:06,590
Hello.

561
00:58:06,929 --> 00:58:09,659
Hey. My big little brother is back!

562
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:11,960
Have a seat. Come on.

563
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,599
You're not even giving
your real brother a glance...

564
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:16,769
Well, I see you every day.

565
00:58:17,469 --> 00:58:21,409
I like my new, handsome little brother.

566
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:24,610
Chisoo, aren't you hungry?

567
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:27,309
I bought some crazy good pork belly.

568
00:58:27,579 --> 00:58:28,750
Want me to grill it for you?

569
00:58:28,909 --> 00:58:31,949
No thanks. I like the spicy beef soup
that you make.

570
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:34,090
I’m down for meat, sister.

571
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:35,349
You, be quiet.

572
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:39,920
Aren't you sick of the soup yet?
You have it every single time.

573
00:58:40,289 --> 00:58:42,529
It seems to just get better
even if I have it every time.

574
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:45,400
Oh, such a nice compliment!

575
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:49,530
Alright then.
I’ll make you the best meat soup today.

576
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:50,599
Hang on.

577
00:58:51,739 --> 00:58:52,739
I want more meat!

578
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,639
Goodness.

579
00:58:55,269 --> 00:58:57,739
Just sighing every day.
Can't even hit me, either.

580
00:58:58,340 --> 00:58:59,340
What?

581
00:58:59,639 --> 00:59:01,110
You want me to trust you again?

582
00:59:01,449 --> 00:59:02,610
Are you fucking kidding me?

583
00:59:03,309 --> 00:59:04,880
What?

584
00:59:05,949 --> 00:59:08,469
Hey! Flying Dagger is a problem
to be taken care of by you guys.

585
00:59:08,619 --> 00:59:11,019
What does it matter to you
whether we save or spare Wild Dog?

586
00:59:11,489 --> 00:59:13,059
Hanging up. Fucking snake head.

587
00:59:17,199 --> 00:59:18,199
Fuck.

588
00:59:22,969 --> 00:59:24,440
Old man has lost his mind.

589
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:27,909
Even though I told him
those two are playing around together.

590
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:38,480
Fine, good then.

591
00:59:41,449 --> 00:59:44,360
I'll just have to
take care of both from my end.

592
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:48,929
Guess I'll give them a lesson this time...

593
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:52,900
at what happens when people cross me.

594
00:59:57,570 --> 01:00:00,170
This snake head fucker.

595
01:00:01,369 --> 01:00:03,380
Why is the weather so damn gloomy?

596
01:00:11,050 --> 01:00:12,150
Flying Dagger,

597
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:13,489
Wild Dog...

598
01:00:15,219 --> 01:00:17,420
Whatever you guys do, I don’t care but...

599
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:23,090
don't expose yourself.

600
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:46,619
- Chisoo.
- Yes.

601
01:00:47,289 --> 01:00:49,119
Do you see your stepfather often?

602
01:00:51,519 --> 01:00:52,559
What's wrong?

603
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:54,659
You aren't on good terms?

604
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,730
Ah, why are you asking him
stuff like that...

605
01:00:58,530 --> 01:00:59,530
Well...

606
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:03,190
Just because you're family doesn't mean
you'll have a good relationship forever.

607
01:01:03,639 --> 01:01:05,070
Gitae and I are the same.

608
01:01:06,199 --> 01:01:09,440
But still, that's not how
parents' minds work.

609
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:19,949
I can tell what he likes
and what he's doing anytime too.

610
01:01:24,190 --> 01:01:30,300
Do you think I wasn't shocked
when I first discovered he likes men?

611
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:37,099
But if I, his only family,
turn my back on him,

612
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:39,400
imagine how colder
would the world be for him?

613
01:01:41,869 --> 01:01:43,940
I learned a lot after that.

614
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:49,880
I need to confide in my sibling so that
others will do the same. Dont you think?

615
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:03,090
That very aspect of family
is the biggest tree that I can lean on.

616
01:02:03,530 --> 01:02:05,800
It's a reassuring shield
that stays on my side.

617
01:02:08,329 --> 01:02:10,139
If you can't do that,

618
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,170
you're not really family.

619
01:02:22,579 --> 01:02:24,349
So, this alley over here is...

620
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:29,289
So there’re many people like us, right?

621
01:02:29,519 --> 01:02:32,119
Yeah. Many. A lot of restaurants too.

622
01:02:33,219 --> 01:02:35,965
There's really nothing special
and the owner here is really great guy too.

623
01:02:35,989 --> 01:02:37,400
- Ok, I’m going.
- Hello.

624
01:02:39,329 --> 01:02:41,276
- Haven’t seen you for awhile.
- Yeah. How have you been?

625
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:42,170
Good.

626
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:44,115
You've gotten quite handsome
since the last time I saw you.

627
01:02:44,139 --> 01:02:46,599
- Oh, this is the boyfriend that I heard last time.
- Yes.

628
01:02:46,969 --> 01:02:48,239
Come here. Come on over.

629
01:02:48,309 --> 01:02:49,239
- It's okay.
- Chisoo.

630
01:02:49,309 --> 01:02:51,586
- What’s wrong?
- Everyone is like that at first. Come here.

631
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:52,909
How long have you seen him?

632
01:03:24,309 --> 01:03:25,340
Have some.

633
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:15,329
This cellular device has been turned off.

634
01:04:17,559 --> 01:04:21,070
This cellular device has been turned off.

635
01:04:22,099 --> 01:04:23,170
Why is it off...

636
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:29,269
What's wrong? Chisoo isn't answering?

637
01:04:29,969 --> 01:04:31,380
Yeah.

638
01:04:32,409 --> 01:04:34,550
Do you think
something went wrong since yesterday?

639
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:38,079
Don't worry. I'm sure he must be busy.

640
01:04:47,989 --> 01:04:53,059
This cellular device has been turned off.

641
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:01,940
Sister...

642
01:05:03,010 --> 01:05:04,890
I think I'll have to go out
somewhere for a bit.

643
01:05:53,530 --> 01:05:54,659
Hi there.

644
01:05:55,730 --> 01:05:58,230
Oh! You came back?
Did you meet up beforehand?

645
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:01,070
I guess everything was fine.
I worried for no reason.

646
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:02,829
Where’s Gitae?

647
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:04,340
Isn't he at home?

648
01:06:05,099 --> 01:06:07,819
What are you talking about?
You didn't answer your phone yesterday...

649
01:06:08,539 --> 01:06:10,139
FATHER

650
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:13,280
Yeah,

651
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:14,650
it's me.

652
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:18,820
I think I gave you a chance.

653
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:20,980
Chisoo...

654
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:22,690
No...

655
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:24,489
Flying Dagger.

656
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:27,690
Just because it's you,
you get one last chance.

657
01:06:29,159 --> 01:06:34,170
Come by yourself and take this bastard
that you picked, Wild Dog or whatever

658
01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:39,159
Gitae.

659
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:42,400
Are you okay?

660
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:46,940
Chisoo... it's you...

661
01:07:51,239 --> 01:07:52,239
I'm here.

662
01:07:53,449 --> 01:07:54,449
Are you okay?

663
01:07:57,179 --> 01:07:58,659
You did a great job hanging in there.

664
01:07:58,849 --> 01:07:59,920
Well done.

665
01:08:15,570 --> 01:08:16,600
Well done.

666
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:18,800
Chisoo.

667
01:08:21,369 --> 01:08:22,840
Let's go home.

668
01:08:28,579 --> 01:08:30,939
You're going to have it your way
no matter what, aren't you?

669
01:08:33,619 --> 01:08:36,720
I needed a hunting dog
to be my side till the end.

670
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:41,740
If I'd known you were just a rat
that goes off by itself...

671
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:43,899
I shouldn't have taken you in.

672
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:48,229
I am...

673
01:08:48,699 --> 01:08:51,600
I'm not a rat nor a hunting dog.
I'm a person.

674
01:08:53,409 --> 01:08:54,609
I gave you...

675
01:08:55,609 --> 01:08:57,609
the chance to choose.

676
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:01,680
But it seems
there’s only one conclusion...

677
01:09:03,149 --> 01:09:05,449
that I’m in the middle of this world.

678
01:09:07,350 --> 01:09:09,350
If I didn't exist, this would be nothing.

679
01:09:10,359 --> 01:09:13,119
Our mob, and this world.

680
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:15,390
A choice?

681
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:18,600
Okay.

682
01:09:20,670 --> 01:09:23,439
I've always had things that I could choose
and things I couldn't.

683
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:25,500
But...

684
01:09:27,539 --> 01:09:30,479
I don't need choices
that are handed down from you.

685
01:09:30,539 --> 01:09:33,550
- I am the one who chooses my life.
- Stop bullshitting, you bastard!

686
01:09:33,609 --> 01:09:35,479
You're a fucking subspecies
anyway, shithead.

687
01:09:35,579 --> 01:09:37,649
Fucking disgusting mutant.

688
01:09:45,319 --> 01:09:46,319
You...

689
01:09:46,829 --> 01:09:48,560
what the hell is that face?

690
01:09:50,359 --> 01:09:51,829
Is this some kind of pity?

691
01:09:53,899 --> 01:09:55,229
Listen, you piece of shit,

692
01:09:56,329 --> 01:09:59,140
sympathy is what I, a savior,
should take over, not you.

693
01:10:00,539 --> 01:10:01,569
Chisoo.

694
01:10:02,710 --> 01:10:04,180
It's not too late.

695
01:10:10,479 --> 01:10:12,279
Stop!

696
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:20,529
Chisoo, you fucker...

697
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:23,430
This is my final warning.

698
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:26,930
Stop here...

699
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:30,000
and leave us alone.

700
01:10:31,699 --> 01:10:33,609
Then there will be no more tormenting...

701
01:10:34,609 --> 01:10:36,510
and pain between us.

702
01:10:39,479 --> 01:10:41,579
I wanted to enjoy many things with you.

703
01:10:43,649 --> 01:10:44,680
Now...

704
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:50,619
I'll have to break off my ties to you.

705
01:13:15,899 --> 01:13:16,899
Let's go.

706
01:13:32,819 --> 01:13:36,350
Hey! You fucking hopeless perverts!

707
01:14:29,539 --> 01:14:30,710
You're very handsome today.

708
01:14:34,979 --> 01:14:36,250
That's enough.

709
01:14:56,899 --> 01:14:58,670
Ok. Look at the camera, please!

710
01:14:58,939 --> 01:15:00,670
I'll take it on 2.

711
01:15:02,710 --> 01:15:03,739
One, two.
