NETFLIX SERIES

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,221
When bullets hit the brain, the heart
or major organs such as large blood vessels

3
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:15,932
Almost no
We can take emergency measures

4
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,226
Other soft tissue damage

5
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:20,812
It is best to learn some emergency measures in advance
Just in case

6
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:21,980
Nairobi

7
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:23,898
If this place in Denver gets shot

8
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:26,985
You need to first understand what organs are in this area.

9
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:28,695
Only then can we judge the injury, right?

10
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,115
liver

11
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,492
It's not the liver, right?

12
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:37,954
Can you draw it?

13
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,581
I have pretended to be a nurse several times when I committed crimes.

14
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:41,666
It doesn't bother me

15
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:43,752
Pull it down again.

16
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:47,714
Hey, let me see, that's either the appendix or the small intestine.

17
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:49,507
This guy is really loyal.

18
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,219
GAN

19
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:54,763
liver

20
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,392
Why don't you try Rio?

21
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:02,145
The doctor has the scalpel ready for you.

22
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,485
I don't understand why this kind of thing is happening?

23
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,071
Because this mission is life-threatening.

24
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,114
Life-threatening? I think it's child's play

25
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,742
Your attitude
Even if you get shot, I won't pull the bullet out for you

26
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,994
Rather than letting a rookie like you pull the bullet out of my hand
Fiddle with it

27
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,412
It's better to leave it alone.

28
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,039
There's someone here who's not a rookie.

29
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,629
Wow, are you really a doctor?

30
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:29,756
What kind of doctor is this? I've dropped out of school for a while.

31
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:31,549
Anyway

32
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:33,718
I only do what is within my responsibility.

33
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:37,347
Play the hospital game by yourselves

34
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:43,520
The brat deserves a beating

35
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:50,026
No matter if he died from being shot or from having the bullet pulled out

36
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,946
It's up to you.

37
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,586
Looks really delicious

38
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,385
Have you eaten?

39
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:16,845
Please give me a bowl

40
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,019
What have you been busy with recently?

41
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,108
You're asking me now?

42
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:31,860
I thought I was invisible.

43
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:34,279
I am with a bunch of bad friends

44
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,949
Taking drugs and messing around

45
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,284
I came back with no money.

46
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,845
I will talk to the school

47
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,680
Just apply to resume your studies.

48
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,103
Shall I prepare some bath water for you?

49
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,703
So impressive!

50
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,331
How much would this kind of house cost?

51
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,125
About 400 to 500 million won

52
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:35,173
How can I earn enough to buy a house like this?

53
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,426
Could it be a robbery?

54
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,720
If North Korea's hereditary class

55
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:44,015
South Korea is hereditary wealth

56
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,560
Aren't you curious?

57
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,812
An ignorant young son of a rich family

58
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,564
How to join our action?

59
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,274
This

60
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,319
Everyone probably has their own reasons.

61
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,912
Hey mom, let's have a drink together

62
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:02,677
No hope

63
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,142
So

64
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:14,397
Oh, I'm so hopeless.
Why did you come to pick me up?

65
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,442
Do you think this is coming to pick you up?

66
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:20,445
Would you mind our plan?
Have you complained to your family members?

67
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:23,239
If this happens, your family will be in danger.

68
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,950
Oh, what are you saying?

69
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,746
If you know this is the case

70
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,540
I told them a long time ago

71
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:36,377
Oh, what a fucking shame.

72
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,796
What a pity

73
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:44,802
Did I say that at the beginning?

74
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,137
What we are going to do

75
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,390
It's not a joke, nor is it a meaningless rebellion.

76
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,477
This is once you join
Something that I can't get away from in my life

77
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,398
Oh, you're so nagging.

78
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,524
Rio

79
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,569
Although it may sound like a rehash of the past
But I still want to say one thing

80
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,614
Always avoiding will eventually become a habit

81
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,369
One day you have to face reality

82
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,846
-Comrade Captain, something big has happened
-Hello, confirm.

83
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:10,847
identity!

84
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,432
- Was he shot?
-He is the Director of the Banknote Printing Bureau.

85
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,349
Authentication

86
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,602
- They said those people were not robbers
- No filming for a moment.

87
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,521
-etc
-We need to know the truth!

88
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,524
Is it confirmed that someone was shot? Who was that person?

89
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,067
The hostage is Zhao Yingmin, director of the Banknote Printing Bureau

90
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,152
- A hostage.
-Can't!

91
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:27,113
I repeat, the person who was shot was a hostage.

92
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,949
Who told you to mess around?

93
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,201
- Hello, how are you? Get up.
- Hey, open your eyes.

94
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,744
Rio, come help!

95
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,833
Cheer up, Rio!

96
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,982
Judging from the location of the gunshot
There shouldn't be any danger to life.

97
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:05,860
Of course, it would be terrible if that person died!

98
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:07,236
Now we are all done!

99
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,407
(Director Zhao Yingmin)

100
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,201
-Hey over here!
-Drag it here!

101
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:16,662
-Hey, be careful.
-Let him lie here!

102
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,086
Hey, bring the first aid kit over here!

103
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,505
-First aid kit
-Here it comes!

104
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,464
What should I do?

105
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,722
It seems like the bullet went in very deep.

106
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,142
If emergency measures can't save him, should he undergo surgery?

107
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,977
Wake up, bastard!

108
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,396
- You can't fucking die here
- Cheer up!

109
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,732
-What?
-Telephone

110
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,276
I want to call

111
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,988
My wife

112
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,912
Hey, shut up! Opening your mouth makes the bleeding worse

113
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:00,581
Wait, Rio, you have to think of something.

114
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,000
- Hey wait
- Too much bleeding

115
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,086
-Rio!
-What should I do if so much blood is coming out?

116
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,213
Hey Rio, why don't you come and take a look!

117
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,006
Rio!

118
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,426
Think of a way.

119
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,105
result

120
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,566
You guys still took action

121
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,568
How is the Director's status?

122
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:30,987
He is not dead yet

123
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,990
Just like we agreed to negotiate, is this how it's going to be?

124
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,453
It was you who created the emergency first.

125
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,081
Was there an internal conflict among the robbers?

126
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,916
We still tried our best to maintain a safe state

127
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,834
To the hostages

128
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,587
You're the ones who fired the shot.

129
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,964
There's no time to argue about who's right and who's wrong.

130
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,508
Don't you also hope that there will be no casualties?

131
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,093
How about being honest?

132
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,929
Police shoot hostage

133
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:58,931
Who will get in trouble for this?

134
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,516
Both sides will do

135
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,561
I mean, if the media keeps pursuing this,

136
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:06,230
So how do you plan to solve it?

137
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,942
Better get to the hospital as soon as possible.

138
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,736
You should know this is impossible.

139
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:12,820
Then…

140
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,075
Let the medical team in.

141
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:19,994
Saving lives is important

142
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,670
I'll call you back in ten minutes.

143
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,684
- No entry here
- Just take a picture, please.

144
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:44,685
Wait a moment

145
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,104
etc.

146
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,648
Please wait a moment

147
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,317
-etc
-Wait a moment

148
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,778
Huh? What did you say?

149
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,242
So how do we determine whether someone is dead or alive?

150
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,786
You should give me some information.

151
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,289
- You can't come in.
- Wait, I can't see

152
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,087
Sorry, it was my error in judgement.

153
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,509
It's my decision.

154
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:18,928
They're not stupid either.

155
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:20,971
They should agree to let the medical team in.

156
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,353
I hope so

157
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,066
Now is not the time to blame yourself

158
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,027
maybe

159
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,655
This would be a great opportunity

160
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,621
I'll go in with the medical team.

161
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,669
Can't fall for their tricks

162
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:54,880
In this situation, let outsiders come in
Who knows what tricks they'll play?

163
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,757
Can't let the hostages die

164
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,262
If I could die from such a small injury, I would have died long ago.

165
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:04,098
That bastard is now clamoring to talk to his wife.

166
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,433
I think he's quite spirited.

167
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:08,269
Besides, he was killed by the police.

168
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:09,478
We have nothing to lose.

169
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,982
Anyway, it's like this
Let him die comfortably.

170
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,567
How about doing some articles for the media?

171
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,902
“Police create excuses for coercive repression

172
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,738
Deliberately shooting a hostage

173
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,448
Don't think too much about Berlin

174
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,616
We haven't settled your account yet. We will settle it later.

175
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,743
Now this mess

176
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,662
Isn't it because you executed a hostage?

177
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,707
There can't be any more victims

178
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,668
I decided that I couldn't tolerate this.

179
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,130
Professor, no matter what

180
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,424
I clearly warned you

181
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,572
The chief wants to speak to his wife before surgery.

182
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:04,617
She should get a call.

183
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,577
Do you agree?

184
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:10,039
After one hour, only
Minimal medical teams and equipment

185
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,499
knew

186
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,167
Is it really possible?

187
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,795
So far the robbers have been one step ahead of us

188
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,463
It seems like everything was planned

189
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:20,216
Except for the director of the Banknote Printing Bureau who was shot

190
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,593
Make sure to let this
Become a factor in our favor

191
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,930
Even if I hide in the medical team and get in successfully

192
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,098
The robbers stared with wide eyes.

193
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,767
Captain Che, what can you do if you go in alone?

194
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,481
Weapons at the ready

195
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,529
When were these prepared?

196
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,950
Our army needs to prepare for any situation during the battle

197
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:46,992
Always Be Prepared

198
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,370
So I asked what to do with this...

199
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:50,746
As you said, Chief.

200
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,082
The robbers' attention
It will definitely be placed on the medical team.

201
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,000
We will take this opportunity to counterattack

202
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:56,961
Let the special forces sneak in.

203
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:58,671
in short

204
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,589
It's a feint strategy.

205
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,811
Comrade Director is very lucky.

206
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,480
A medical team will come.

207
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,232
Move this guy to the exhibition hall.

208
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:24,864
Come on, act fast!

209
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,620
Come back to the team!

210
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:33,455
hurry up!

211
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,627
Is that person going to die?

212
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,672
He tried to escape on his own and was shot.

213
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,549
Did the robber open fire?

214
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,175
Actually, the police opened...

215
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,177
Quick return

216
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,859
She's in this state.
What's the point of putting her here?

217
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,821
There is no other way

218
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,659
The professor doesn't know she's still alive, right?

219
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,870
Because of that bastard in Berlin

220
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,873
Anyway, that guy is the leader here.
So I think no matter what the professor says

221
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:17,833
It won't have any effect at all

222
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,753
Ouch, what should I do?

223
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,088
I said you still...

224
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,508
-What's going on?
-Oh shit

225
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,473
What? She's really still alive?

226
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,021
Ouch

227
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,402
-What's wrong?
- So serious?

228
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:51,867
If you don't have surgery right away
Her legs might be broken.

229
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,286
-What?
- Then you do it.

230
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,496
That's right

231
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,581
A doctor will come over.

232
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,376
I'll try to steal some surgical tools.

233
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:02,920
-that's all
- Please

234
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:04,797
Not that

235
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,424
Who will be responsible if Berlin finds out?

236
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,052
I can't do it even if you ask me

237
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:10,970
Rio

238
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,596
At least I'll keep it a secret

239
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,765
I don't want to cause trouble.

240
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,184
-Rio!
-Hello

241
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,769
Let this damn bastard go!

242
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:21,188
Let me take the place of that coward.

243
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:22,898
What can you do?

244
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,400
Didn't you hear him?

245
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,486
If I'm not careful, my leg will be broken.

246
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:28,862
Are you kidding me about the surgery?

247
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,114
Anyway, I'm going to try it

248
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:32,616
I fired the gun.

249
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,494
I should also be responsible.

250
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,080
oops

251
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,083
-But…
-Um?

252
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,503
You said the doctor was coming.

253
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,339
What does it mean?

254
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,675
That

255
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,303
Police accidentally shot a hostage

256
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:57,808
who?

257
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:04,648
No

258
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,192
Yingmin, huh?

259
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:11,030
He is in a much better situation than you. You don't need to worry about him.

260
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,198
The medical team will be here soon.

261
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:18,245
Dad, please take good care of her.

262
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,955
We'll be back in a bit, okay?

263
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:20,998
knew

264
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,541
Go ahead

265
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,837
What's wrong? Where do you feel uncomfortable?

266
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,843
You put this

267
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:34,845
Pass it to Yingmin

268
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,599
What's this?

269
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,477
He and I...

270
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,191
maybe

271
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,151
I'm leaving like this.

272
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,627
There is an underground vent
Kitchen leading to the staff restaurant

273
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,797
It will take some time to dive into this structure.

274
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,050
But this is the only way to avoid the surveillance cameras

275
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,718
Dangerous but feasible

276
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,554
Once inside, just mingle with the hostages...

277
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:18,847
The medical team is here

278
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,433
You should already know

279
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,353
Captain Che Wuhe
They will go in disguised as a medical team

280
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,312
yes

281
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,356
I understand the basic terminology and knowledge

282
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,400
Just treat me like an assistant.

283
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,735
How long does the surgery take?

284
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,488
If the injury lasts at least 30 minutes...

285
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:37,241
Please do not delay the surgery.
Try to delay the time

286
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,619
Where is Director Zhao Yingmin’s wife?

287
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:41,703
She's waiting outside.

288
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,752
What is this?

289
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,381
-What do you mean?
- That woman

290
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:55,884
I almost died.
Isn't it the director's fault?

291
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,719
But look at this

292
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:01,473
Look at what she said sorry

293
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,102
Are you interested in her?

294
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,104
ah?

295
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,648
Are you crazy?

296
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:12,818
I mean my brain
I can't understand her thoughts.

297
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,361
Is it necessary to understand?

298
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:22,786
Yeah

299
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,307
I apologize for my previous behavior.

300
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,353
each other

301
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:49,771
It doesn't matter

302
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,526
Stay away from me you murderer

303
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,654
What the hell are you talking about?

304
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,244
Hero of the Banknote Bureau

305
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:08,290
That is, Director Zhao Yingmin's wife has a connection

306
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:11,668
Is that your cell phone?

307
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:18,091
I'm about to see the King of Hell
You just remembered your wife, right?

308
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,304
What is the password?

309
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,518
One Two Three Four

310
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,025
Hey, it's rare that you didn't get caught for having an affair

311
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:37,402
Isn’t it?

312
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,697
Well, that's what I mean.

313
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,202
Come one two three four

314
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,082
Okay, what name did you save the number under?

315
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,668
My Favorites

316
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,923
"My Favorites"

317
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:02,678
- I'm talking about romantic comrades
-yes

318
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:06,306
If you take such a risk again
Be careful, you may die before the operation.

319
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:14,856
Hello?

320
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,857
(My favorite)

321
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,276
Wife

322
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,152
It's me

323
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,321
husband

324
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,825
The police said you were injured.

325
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,410
How are you feeling?

326
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:30,372
Hear your voice

327
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:34,710
I really feel alive.

328
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,505
Are the kids around?

329
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,382
If I Die

330
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,260
Tell them dad loves them very much

331
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,221
And your wife

332
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,390
I love you

333
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,735
Captain Che went in with the medical team.

334
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,194
Then convey the internal situation to us

335
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,905
While the robbers were paying attention to the operation

336
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,741
Some of our elite troops will infiltrate

337
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,535
After the important personnel sneaked in
Quickly defeat the robber leader

338
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:10,495
Ensuring the safety of hostages

339
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:13,707
At the same time, a comprehensive sweep inside and outside was launched

340
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,958
It sounds good, but

341
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,419
How do you plan to convey internal information?

342
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,962
The body search must be very rigorous

343
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,799
This is a wireless transmission function
Glasses camera

344
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:47,199
Don't let me drop the chain

345
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,451
I don't want to see anyone get shot again.

346
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,413
What are you looking at?

347
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:58,877
Wear masks now

348
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:00,879
Even though it's a fake gun, just give it to me.

349
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,223
You won't be angry with me, will you?

350
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,768
You know it was forced by the situation.

351
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,230
fine

352
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,524
I blame myself for believing the liar

353
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,251
Are you worried about something?

354
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,294
The monitor is out.

355
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,755
How do you feel about going there?

356
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:47,426
Nothing, just thinking
Will the police play some shady tricks again?

357
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,054
We kept you here just to prevent this kind of situation.

358
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,140
So look carefully.

359
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:57,185
Yeah, it should be

360
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:58,520
That's right

361
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,800
Put your stuff on the security check table

362
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,343
Open your arms and take three steps forward

363
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,681
(Occupy the Banknote Printing Bureau for 53 hours)

364
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:39,102
There are reports that gunshots were heard at the Banknote Printing Bureau

365
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,979
Just before this, the photography team used a telephoto camera

366
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:44,065
Capture the scene of the medical team entering the Banknote Printing Bureau

367
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:47,903
The police only repeated that the situation was "urgent".

368
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:51,156
No position has been expressed on this

369
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,576
Is the injured person a hostage?

370
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,704
Was it the robbers?

371
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,164
The situation is worrying

372
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:10,300
Just a moment!

373
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,849
Among them are police officers

374
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:20,936
See what I said? Which guy?

375
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,562
Tall man with glasses

376
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,690
I'm sure I've seen him in the opposition group.

377
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,694
Damn bastards

378
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:33,990
I shot the hostage by mistake.
Kindly ask them to come for treatment

379
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,200
The result was a stab in the back?

380
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,911
Is it too late to regret now?

381
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:41,248
Why regret?
This is a good opportunity to catch the police together.

382
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:45,293
Listen, they won't just
Take the risk with the inside scoop

383
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,963
To find out what they are planning

384
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,930
Please store your personal belongings here before leaving.

385
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:58,515
No objection?

386
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:16,157
Stop for a moment

387
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,743
Since the inspection must be done seriously

388
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:31,756
All back to original position

389
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,050
Raise your hands and turn back

390
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:17,510
Go inside

391
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,409
Entrance passed

392
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,830
A long queue of people wearing masks in the hall

393
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,500
Judging from the number of people, there should be a lot of hostages among them.

394
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,251
We dive in now

395
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,655
Is it okay to just let the police in like this?

396
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,365
What does the professor say?

397
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,703
- Ask us to sweep them into a hornet's nest
-ah?

398
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:27,539
Aren't jokes funny?

399
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,500
Are you kidding?

400
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,335
Want to change your career?

401
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:38,049
Even if they are all special forces
There won't be a head-on confrontation.

402
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:42,011
So I'm going to try it out.
See what they're up to.

403
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,406
I can do it with medical forceps in one go

404
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,199
Medical…

405
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,410
Oh, I mean pass the pliers.

406
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:15,211
how's it going?

407
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,630
Is there any hope for our comrade director?

408
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,759
Although the bullet is stuck in the pectoralis major

409
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,845
Fortunately, there is no danger to life

410
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:25,930
How long will it take?

411
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,642
-About two hours...
-It'll be done within an hour

412
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,563
Could that guy be the professor?

413
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:36,191
No, he has a Pyeongan accent.
The tone is obviously different

414
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,695
The real professor should be watching this somewhere.

415
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:45,825
scalpel

416
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,081
Give me any one

417
00:29:58,838 --> 00:29:59,798
Wait a minute

418
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:05,011
Can you perform the surgery if you're shaking like this?

419
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:06,805
You get out of the way

420
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,850
Come on, I see you're the only one who's not shaking.

421
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:20,485
You seem to be quite courageous. Aren't you afraid?

422
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:23,029
Most people would tremble if a gun was pointed at them like this.

423
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,282
My reaction is slow

424
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,373
Do you have a cultural accent?

425
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:38,419
I have never heard of Ping An revealing the male nurse

426
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:40,380
Who are you?

427
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,677
- I think I was discovered.
-What?

428
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,803
What should I do?

429
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:53,560
actually…

430
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,606
- I'm a police officer
-What?

431
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:08,032
I just want to make sure
The medical team came in for their personal safety.

432
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,284
No other intention

433
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,036
I'm sorry for hiding my identity.
But from the perspective of the authorities

434
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,289
If you are not sure, just send the civilians in.

435
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,583
Is the plan scrapped now that it's like this?

436
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,045
I think it was Captain Che Wuhe who used his ultimate move.

437
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,172
The role played by Captain Che

438
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,550
It's a feint strategy to prevent the robbers from noticing our attack.

439
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:28,094
That guy finally told the truth.

440
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:30,889
Berlin is pretty scary, isn't it?

441
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,181
It's too early to let your guard down

442
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:35,977
Based on what I observed from the opposing team
He is clearly not an ordinary police officer.

443
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,689
This will attract the attention of the robbers.
All will be focused on him alone

444
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:43,735
Can you guys, the undercover team, arrive at the cafeteria as expected?

445
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:51,367
Protecting civilians? You want me to believe that?

446
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:54,579
If only a medical team is sent in
They were also held hostage.

447
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:56,456
How embarrassing would that be for the authorities?

448
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:57,874
so what?

449
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:01,127
What can you do if you come in here alone and unarmed?

450
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,962
If a medical team becomes hostage

451
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,173
The higher-ups told me to blend in with the hostages.

452
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:10,845
It's quite like that.

453
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,473
OK

454
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,601
It is important to save our director first.

455
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,521
Denver, you're in charge of keeping an eye on this guy.

456
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,815
Yeah, got it.

457
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,152
Hey police, back off!

458
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,972
Arriving at the destination

459
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,266
keep going

460
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,829
What takes so long?

461
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,959
The man named Denver

462
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:25,420
Is that your son?

463
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:30,717
That kid is actually not a bad person.

464
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,178
He just met a useless father.

465
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,347
So

466
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:38,516
If you want to blame someone

467
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,270
Just blame me

468
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,151
It doesn't matter

469
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,653
I told him to shoot.

470
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:28,149
I looked around and didn't find anything wrong?

471
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,318
Could it be that the guy was telling the truth?

472
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,363
I feel like something is fishy but I can't tell what it is

473
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,283
I said professor

474
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,452
if

475
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,038
Berlin did not execute hostages.

476
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:43,915
No

477
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,376
If the hostage is still alive
Things won't develop to this point, right?

478
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,544
It should be

479
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:50,213
Why do you ask?

480
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:52,381
nothing

481
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,783
Arrived at the target location and wait for attack

482
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,435
Then sew it up and it's over.

483
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,687
Is that so?

484
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:52,733
As for you, comrades, you can stay if you want.

485
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,529
I'll leave when the surgery is over.

486
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,823
So that’s all done, right?

487
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,743
I'll help sort it out.

488
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,540
Oops, I'm sorry.

489
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:09,917
Oh, really

490
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,509
- There are changes
-What?

491
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,304
In those glasses
Is it possible that there is something hidden?

492
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:23,848
There may be eavesdropping devices or even cameras.

493
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:27,852
If they want to pass on the inside information
There is only one reason

494
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:29,604
Feint Strategy

495
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,278
I'm sorry just now

496
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,832
One of the robbers left the room first.

497
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:51,792
Could it be that he discovered it?

498
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,753
Even if you find out something, it's too late

499
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,422
It’s time

500
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:58,382
We're going to attack

501
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,766
While that policeman is distracting us

502
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,894
There must be enemies sneaking in from other places.

503
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:14,982
How is that possible?
Didn’t see anything in the surveillance?

504
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:17,860
Maybe there is a path we don't know about.

505
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:20,196
What should I do then?

506
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:23,282
Keep calm and listen

507
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:52,436
come out

508
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:54,397
Follow me

509
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:14,500
What's all the fuss about?

510
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:17,420
Oh this one?

511
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,046
We changed our mood

512
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,299
What do you think?

513
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,180
Thank you to the hard-working medical team.

514
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,391
Everyone applaud!

515
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:58,127
Oops

516
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:00,880
Can't attack and retreat

517
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,383
Huh? We've already infiltrated.

518
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,927
They changed their masks and you will be exposed if you go in.

519
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,181
Stop planning!

520
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,600
Stop planning!

521
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,018
Withdraw quickly!

522
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:15,811
knew

523
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:34,080
The feint strategy was exposed
They will find you even if they turn the house upside down.

524
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:35,790
Hurry up and seize the time!

525
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:06,612
how's it going?

526
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:09,156
All possible infiltration routes have been checked.

527
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:11,534
No problem

528
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:12,952
here you go

529
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:14,495
What about the Trojan horse?

530
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:17,456
It's packed and sent back.

531
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,083
pretty

532
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,502
After the professor saw through the feint strategy

533
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,546
Immediately counterattacked

534
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:27,591
When the situation is at a stalemate
The enemy will find a chance to sneak in.

535
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,845
Like a Trojan horse, it sneaked into the Bureau of Printing

536
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,680
Oh, that one?

537
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,306
I know

538
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,851
- Brad Pitt
- I've seen it too.

539
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,602
Uneducated guys

540
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:40,688
-What?
-What's wrong?

541
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,857
All we need to do is to find them and deport them?

542
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,275
That's right

543
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:47,653
But it doesn’t stop there

544
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:48,654
What else?

545
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:51,657
We arrested all those policemen.
How about being a hostage?

546
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,075
No

547
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,202
We have to take advantage of the situation

548
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:57,663
Start from this link

549
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:01,792
The success or failure of our plan depends on you, Rio.

550
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,300
(Finish)

551
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:31,322
The professor not only drove away the enemy

552
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:35,784
How to stab the enemy in the back?

553
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:50,132
When was our plan discovered?

554
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:53,302
Is it when I reveal my identity as a police officer?
Or before that?

555
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:57,306
No matter how smart the professor is,
How could he be so powerful?

556
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:58,891
I don't have an answer either.

557
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:01,435
All I know is…

558
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:06,607
The professor was standing over us and teasing us.

559
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,817
But when Officer Xuan realized this

560
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:11,028
The professor has taken control

561
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,531
Come on in!

562
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:17,451
Go Faster

563
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:21,413
Go quickly

564
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:25,251
Go fast

565
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,295
We still have time

566
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,172
There is a more important thing to solve

567
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,427
But will it be useless if I turn off my phone?

568
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:36,804
Oh, that phone can't be turned off.

569
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:38,347
Um?

570
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,267
I mean even if I turn off the power
It just looks like it's turned off.

571
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,143
In an undead zombie state

572
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:46,146
What the policeman said about his phone call

573
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,315
You can get the picture that the camera is facing

574
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:51,026
Oh, it's amazing.

575
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,582
What's that expression?

576
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,626
Did you run away without doing your homework?

577
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,054
It seems the anesthesia is taking effect.

578
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:30,608
Damn, why are my hands shaking so much?

579
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,610
Dad is bleeding

580
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,445
Please wipe it carefully!

581
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:35,696
I'm wiping it.

582
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:38,782
But what should I do if the bleeding can’t be stopped?

583
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,618
You should do it carefully!

584
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:41,952
Stop rushing me!

585
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,456
- This won't work.
-Um?

586
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:47,666
- I'll go get Rio.
-Rio?

587
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,543
Will the boy in Rio be obedient?

588
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,962
Drag him over here.

589
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,048
You try to stop the bleeding first.

590
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,884
Okay, I'll think of a way.

591
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,552
Oh, this blood

592
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:01,013
-Why won't the bleeding stop?
-Can be stopped

593
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:02,473
Hey, be careful.

594
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:07,478
Yingmin's surgery

595
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,772
how's it going?

596
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:11,815
Have you recovered?

597
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:13,817
What about Yingmin?

598
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:18,405
The operation went well

599
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:21,325
The doctor said he would recover soon.

600
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,245
You don't have to worry about him

601
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:27,498
So lucky

602
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:29,875
And I…

603
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,254
Am I going to die?

604
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,507
What are you talking about?

605
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:40,844
Tokyo just went to call someone who can perform surgery

606
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:42,846
Please bear with it

607
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:44,390
Good job

608
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,066
Hello, what are you doing?

609
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,944
Let go! What are you doing?

610
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:59,863
I'm having a serious conversation with Rio.

611
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:02,616
You're here, things are easier.

612
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,701
What did you say?

613
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,661
What else could it be?
You two know it but I don't.

614
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,580
What are we going to do in Tokyo?

615
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:11,792
Don't be unreasonable

616
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,586
Threatening hostages alone
That's not enough for you, is it?

617
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,880
I didn't expect you to confess.

618
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:19,049
But Rio will tell me, right?

619
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:21,844
If I threaten you and hand you over to the police

620
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,890
Dangerous person who always causes trouble
I can't just leave it alone, right?

621
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:29,768
Tie them up and throw them directly to the door of the Banknote Printing Bureau

622
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:31,437
The police will come and handle it.

623
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,771
This is going to be a good show

624
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,857
Can you do it?

625
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,608
What if I tell the police everything?

626
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:40,070
Can you? You won't.

627
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,032
You didn't come here for the money.

628
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:46,869
Anyway you hope
The professor's plan can be successful

629
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:49,037
Even if you get caught

630
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:51,790
What does that mean?

631
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,584
Well, let her tell you in person later.

632
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:55,002
Now that's not the point

633
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,336
I just said

634
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:59,298
Handing Tokyo over to the police is no joke

635
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,101
Did you pass the note to him?

636
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:13,228
yes

637
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:15,814
It was given

638
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:18,817
What did Yingmin say?

639
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,987
He...

640
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:27,993
She cried so hard and said she was very lucky

641
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:29,870
And said he loves you

642
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:36,210
What else did you say?

643
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:37,669
He said, "Once you get out of here

644
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:41,465
I will treat you well forever" and so on.

645
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,186
-It seems it's finally here
-Oh, Tokyo is here?

646
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:55,437
Hey, hurry up.

647
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,443
Fuck it

648
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,286
I thought we had a good understanding.

649
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:12,955
I am so disappointed.

650
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:20,045
In the end, I still have to do it myself?

651
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:29,179
Is what Berlin said true?
You don't join for the money.

652
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:35,143
I am more worried about whether the plan will succeed than whether I will be caught.
What is going on?

653
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:40,691
Do you really

654
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:43,861
In love with the professor?

655
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:48,740
What time is it?

656
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:51,326
What do you know, little brat?

657
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,883
Hello

658
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,807
You've had enough of this.

659
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:16,101
If this woman were alive
Killing a chicken to scare the monkeys won't work.

660
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:19,354
Scare everyone by saying he killed someone
It turned out not to be true

661
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,356
What will the hostages take our words for granted?

662
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:25,652
-Berlin!
-Fuck you.

663
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:29,948
You shoot me and you think you can get away with it?

664
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,074
I have to shoot her.

665
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,826
Just need you to get out of the way

666
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:33,744
What?

667
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:36,038
I didn't hear clearly, huh?

668
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:38,916
I count to three

669
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,001
one

670
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:44,922
If the professor knew about this, he would definitely not let you go.

671
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:46,506
I really can't figure it out

672
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,091
What is your reason for doing this?

673
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:51,345
What unusual sparks have been created in the past two days?

674
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:56,683
Because I feel guilty towards her.

675
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,519
-two
- Feed us...

676
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:02,189
-three
- Not in Berlin!

677
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:03,106
That's it.

678
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:08,695
Put down your guns Oslo you too

679
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:11,782
You are all so mean!

680
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:17,245
That is…

681
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:18,956
etc.

682
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:42,813
I have sharp eyes.

683
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,440
I remember you were on my side.

684
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:46,441
You're too much.

685
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:48,819
You have to kill a living person.
How can I join you?

686
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,241
She seems to be almost finished without my help.

687
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,035
-What's wrong?
-Why is this happening?

688
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,453
- Do something?
- You calm down.

689
00:49:58,537 --> 00:49:59,663
What's wrong with her?

690
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:00,998
Rio

691
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:03,792
If you don't help she's going to die.

692
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,337
It can't be me...

693
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:10,757
I'll do the surgery.

694
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:14,803
Dad, please do something, don't faint.

695
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,763
Don't treat me like a kid.

696
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,682
You might as well just run away.

697
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:20,726
Wasn't it you who caught me?

698
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:23,061
Everyone including that bastard in Berlin

699
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:24,438
They're risking their lives here.

700
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:28,567
Whether it's for money or something else
Everyone has a good reason

701
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:31,611
But you said you were stuck here because you couldn't escape?

702
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:33,989
Those who say this are brats.

703
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:36,867
I'll come

704
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:36,968
Are you afraid of blood?

705
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:46,061
I have been vomiting and fainting when I see blood since I was a child.

706
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:49,147
Then why go to medical school?

707
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:52,067
It was planned from the moment I was born.

708
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,153
Our family has been doctors for generations.

709
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:56,113
You have this problem

710
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:58,115
Doesn’t your dad know?

711
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:01,326
Are you talking about my antiques?
He knew that and still sent me to medical school

712
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:04,246
He said I was weak-willed.

713
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:07,874
Not working hard enough

714
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:17,259
I really tried my best to disappoint him.

715
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:19,761
He just won't let go of his obsession

716
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:21,972
He's going to be extremely disappointed now.

717
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:28,186
That's what I mean

718
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:32,774
My identity has been exposed.
My antique saw...

719
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:43,577
But I...

720
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:47,664
Now I don't want to mess around anymore.

721
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:50,292
I thought about it

722
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:53,962
so far
I've been thinking about how to embarrass my dad.

723
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:56,047
There's nothing I really want to do.

724
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:58,300
So you have it now?

725
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:00,927
If this plan succeeds

726
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:05,682
I want to buy a very beautiful island

727
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:07,267
Sounds good

728
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:09,352
Right?

729
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:11,813
I plan to live there

730
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:14,774
With you

731
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:19,905
I passed by

732
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:22,574
Hello

733
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:24,576
I mean it.

734
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:26,328
I want to be on that island

735
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:28,830
Living a secluded life with your loved ones

736
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:30,415
Is there anything wrong with this?

737
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:35,253
It's just a dream, it doesn't matter what you think

738
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:08,828
Are you awake?

739
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:13,333
Even if it's not the same blood type, as long as it's O type...

740
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:16,169
Because I'm type O, they said they can give me a blood transfusion.

741
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:19,422
Medicine is very advanced, right?

742
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,175
What you said before

743
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:25,220
They are all fake, right?

744
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:27,639
Which sentence?

745
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:36,273
No

746
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:37,732
That person

747
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:41,194
He never used that word when dating me.

748
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:43,822
Which one?

749
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:45,490
"Love"?

750
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:52,664
Oh shit

751
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:54,958
sorry

752
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:59,379
I was going to give him the note.

753
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:02,007
But everything went haywire halfway through

754
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,552
It doesn't matter. I've always come this way.

755
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,350
That bastard was just before the surgery.

756
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:14,936
He yelled that he wanted to see his wife and children.

757
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:18,773
Honestly, I can't stand it.

758
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:21,818
But on the other hand, I can understand

759
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:23,945
Before a person dies

760
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:27,782
I suddenly miss some people like this.

761
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:30,368
But

762
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:32,620
I suddenly thought

763
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,958
If it's my turn to face this situation

764
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:39,669
Who will I miss then?

765
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,007
If you want to talk, it's my dad?

766
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,225
If I go ahead of him

767
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:56,436
But I'm afraid he'll kill me.

768
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:58,355
So I can't see him
Just go quietly by yourself.

769
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:04,402
Our old man is so strong.

770
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:11,743
Thank you

771
00:56:16,414 --> 00:56:17,248
Saved my life

772
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:20,960
Oh, really

773
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:23,505
OK

774
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:30,970
You said Yoon Mi-sun is still alive?

775
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,389
Look at the lounge.

776
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,605
Well done indeed.

777
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:45,110
From now on, you will be in charge of the on-site command in Tokyo

778
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:47,612
What should be done with Berlin?

779
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:49,406
Let him answer the phone

780
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:55,370
You should understand why I do this.

781
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:58,623
I understand it, but it doesn't mean I agree with it.

782
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:01,000
You should know

783
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:03,169
Breaking the rules has a price

784
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:05,296
Want to control

785
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:08,133
Severe punishment is essential

786
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:11,386
I hope you understand

787
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:14,806
So what is the punishment?

788
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:25,900
Your gun will be confiscated.

789
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:27,861
and detained until I deem fit

790
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:35,952
I'm sorry for calling you a liar.

791
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:39,330
What? I'm a liar.

792
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:49,841
Enjoy yourself while you still have time.

793
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:56,306
Banknote Printing Bureau Hostage Incident
It started to turn into an extreme bloody incident

794
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:59,142
According to our reporter's on-site investigation

795
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:00,977
The person shot and wounded by the police this afternoon

796
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:04,397
Not a robber
Mr. Zhao Yingmin, Director of the Banknote Printing Bureau

797
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:09,235
This ridiculous incident
Because the police failed to distinguish between robbers and ordinary people

798
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:14,782
Foreign media also reported this extensively
This case has become an international joke.

799
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:18,786
The actual leader of the confrontation team
South Korea's negotiator

800
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:21,873
Officer Xuan Yuzhen seems to be responsible for this

801
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:27,462
Some people said that Officer Xuan was not
The best person to handle this case effectively

802
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:29,005
(Netizens demanded that the negotiation expert be replaced)

803
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:33,092
The key is the time when the robbers occupied the printing office.
Far exceeded expectations

804
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:38,765
The public attributed this to Officer Xuan's incompetent command.
This view is becoming the mainstream voice.

805
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:41,559
And there are claims

806
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:44,604
It is necessary to comprehensively rectify the North-South joint confrontation team

807
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:46,147
Even within the police

808
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:49,901
It is also necessary to significantly reduce the negotiating authority of Officer Xuan

809
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:51,486
- and changed to a hard line
-mom

810
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,489
-I'm back
-Oh, Xuan Yuzhen is back?

811
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,993
I'm hungry, is there any food?

812
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:02,038
Okay, I'll prepare it for you.

813
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:13,967
You obviously want to save people.

814
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:17,804
Those people are eager to kill people.

815
00:59:19,305 --> 00:59:21,391
Don't mind these things.

816
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:26,813
-Where's Min-ah?
- Just fell asleep

817
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:39,325
Hey, look at my memory.

818
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:42,954
To put these in

819
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:51,629
What happened to you? Are you okay?

820
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:55,592
Wait, sorry, I have an important call.

821
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:00,972
Hello?

822
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:40,511
Stop the reporter! How can such news be broadcast?

823
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:43,473
There is also overseas media that are holding on to it and cannot be stopped

824
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:45,933
I'm worried about Officer Xuan Yuzhen. I haven't seen her for a long time.

825
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:48,019
Even if she stayed here, she would still be in a mess.

826
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:49,312
I told her to go home and rest for a while

827
01:00:49,937 --> 01:00:52,482
She can't fall down after stirring up such a hornet's nest

828
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:54,567
Really

829
01:00:58,404 --> 01:01:00,198
(Congress is concerned that the Bank of Printing incident will affect the summit)

830
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:21,594
Yuzhen

831
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:29,435
sorry

832
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:33,022
I…

833
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:37,694
I think I should apologize to you.

834
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:42,365
Today's Events

835
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:44,992
I saw it on the news.

836
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:48,538
without…

837
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:51,082
No big deal

838
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:53,334
There are always times when work doesn't go well

839
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,341
Then I'm leaving

840
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:04,387
Aren't you tired?

841
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:07,390
Live like this?

842
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:15,148
No matter what the rough police are facing

843
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:19,652
Or facing your family who can only rely on you

844
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:24,615
You can't appear tired.
Don't show weakness in front of them.

845
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:27,910
You have been holding on

846
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:36,002
That's why I can get to where I am today

847
01:02:36,669 --> 01:02:38,045
No matter what someone says behind your back

848
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:42,383
Or her ex-husband, who has terrible character, gets elected president or something.

849
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:45,678
To protect my family

850
01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:48,890
I can only be smarter than anyone else

851
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:51,434
Stronger than anyone

852
01:02:55,688 --> 01:02:57,023
So on days like today

853
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:00,485
You have no place to complain, right?

854
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:12,622
-Sun Ho
- I see you are too tired

855
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:15,458
And I need someone to talk to

856
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:24,759
You can lend me your shoulder

857
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:29,263
Want to go in and have a cup of coffee?

858
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:36,896
Is there any wine?

859
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:39,565
Everything is as the professor expected

860
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:41,192
The State of the Banknote Printing Bureau Inside and Out

861
01:03:41,692 --> 01:03:44,362
And Officer Xuan will come back to look for him

862
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:24,026
But there's one thing the professor hasn't expected.

863
01:04:24,735 --> 01:04:27,613
Something that is about to happen that is beyond his expectations

864
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:55,182
Don't be lazy, come out quickly

865
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:23,461
He didn't expect his inner feelings.

866
01:08:26,143 --> 01:08:27,144
