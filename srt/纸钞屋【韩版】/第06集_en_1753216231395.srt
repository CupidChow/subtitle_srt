1
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:09,926
NETFLIX SERIES

2
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,055
Later I found out

3
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:17,475
Until a few years ago, the professor was really a professor.

4
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:21,104
His main research areas are
Economic Effects of North-South Unification

5
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:24,232
Why do we live in a divided country?

6
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:26,151
Seventy years

7
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:29,070
Why couldn’t unification be achieved?

8
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:32,115
The politics,
Cultural and economic issues are complex

9
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,867
To solve this problem

10
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:37,412
The currently proposed spiral model

11
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:39,247
Obviously has limitations

12
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,000
My claim is this:

13
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:46,046
If the north and south are looking at the same target

14
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:49,632
Achieving unity is a matter of moments

15
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:52,510
So what kind of target direction should we look towards?

16
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:55,722
Is it peace on the Korean Peninsula?
Or is it cultural resonance?

17
00:00:58,308 --> 00:00:59,893
It should be desire.

18
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:04,564
That is, the North and the South can become rich together.

19
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,401
desire

20
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:10,945
You talked about desire

21
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:14,032
I was deeply impressed by the speech

22
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:18,495
Where are you taking me?

23
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:23,208
I would like to introduce you to someone
Someone who can help you realize your dreams

24
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:38,556
Thank you for your hard work in coming all the way here. I am Wu Jae-yoon.

25
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:42,560
I know who you are, President.

26
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,855
Let's talk about those two.

27
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,195
Have you been here?

28
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,033
It's the first time

29
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,035
How about it?

30
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,539
It's not so much a tragedy
Wouldn't it be more appropriate to describe it as inefficient?

31
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:07,418
What is it that you want to see me about?

32
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,420
This is top secret.

33
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,885
North Korea is considering full opening up

34
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,013
But economic development requires two things: capital and planning

35
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:23,268
Our group is responsible for the investment

36
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,979
I hope to teach you to plan an economic cooperation model

37
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:29,107
Your research results will become
The golden key to the unification of the Korean Peninsula

38
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,901
What do you think? Want to join?

39
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,493
Professor says

40
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,830
The moment I held his hand

41
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:46,416
He voluntarily embarked on the path of becoming Oppenheimer

42
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,209
Who is that, you ask?

43
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:52,213
That's the scientist who invented the first atomic bomb

44
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,050
Korando white getaway car

45
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,802
Fleeing quickly towards Paju Crossroads

46
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,179
Request Support

47
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,818
Chasing a white SUV

48
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,403
Intend to drive to the intersection ahead

49
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,155
We will overtake him and stop him!

50
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,360
Get out of the way!

51
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,324
Make way!

52
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,584
Hold on tight!

53
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,199
Tokyo!

54
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:07,533
Denver!

55
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,743
There are intruders here!

56
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,787
We need to contact the professor ASAP!

57
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,362
Please move aside!

58
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,292
The professor is not in there.

59
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,924
Park Cheol-woo please respond

60
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:47,925
Park Cheol Woo!

61
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:49,969
pls respond!

62
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,095
Park Cheol Woo!

63
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,438
A male driver was identified

64
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,607
You are surrounded!

65
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,192
Don't try to resist and get out of the car!

66
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,527
Follow the instructions!

67
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,071
If you don't come out, I'll shoot!

68
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,951
Once again you are surrounded!

69
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,995
Don't try to resist and get out of the car!

70
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,748
You are surrounded, surrender!

71
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:49,987
stop!

72
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,369
And you still say you don’t need me?

73
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,253
What's with the gunshots inside, Director?

74
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,712
Damn it

75
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,225
No one!

76
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:23,020
-What should we do, Captain?
- I guess I didn't go far.

77
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,356
-Search around and ask for support
-yes

78
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,192
team leader!

79
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,278
Contact the headquarters

80
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,156
Sure enough, there are outsiders

81
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:37,118
Just blew up the car and escaped

82
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,080
He must be in league with the professor or...

83
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:43,249
I think he is the professor.

84
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:07,189
Just now, several gunshots were heard inside the Banknote Printing Bureau.

85
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,233
(Shooting inside the Banknote Printing Bureau
Police are investigating)

86
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,651
The fate of the hostages is currently uncertain.

87
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:14,905
The police have repeatedly responded in an official manner.
"The situation is under investigation"

88
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:18,284
The hostages' families
Waiting near the Banknote Printing Bureau

89
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,953
Eagerly awaiting news

90
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,372
Even if you tell us

91
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,374
Dead or alive...

92
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,878
Meanwhile, at the Blue House
National Petition Bulletin Board

93
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:32,882
Petition for immediate suppression by force
Received 200,000 signatures

94
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,175
Public opinion not only blames the opposing team

95
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:38,387
I am even more dissatisfied with the passive resistance of the police authorities.
And the voices are growing

96
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,264
Can no longer simply call them robbers

97
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:43,517
should be considered
Terrorists who threaten peace on the Korean Peninsula

98
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,187
There is no point in continuing negotiations

99
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:50,733
We should respond strongly based on the principle of zero tolerance!

100
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,280
Making such a big thing
Don't you say a word to me?

101
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:59,367
You made a mistake in judgment
Resulting in the death of an important person!

102
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:02,787
I have nothing to say

103
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,790
You don't need to apologize to me
You should go and apologize to the family of Park Cheol-woo.

104
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,176
Why do this?
Aren't we a team?

105
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,860
The robbers chose me...

106
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:39,657
so

107
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:41,909
Do you still doubt me?

108
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:43,703
If you are a spy

109
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,288
I shouldn't chase him with rage in my eyes.

110
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,794
Captain, I understand that you are forced by the situation.

111
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:52,962
But from now on

112
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,964
At least we have to trust each other.

113
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:57,675
I understand

114
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,428
Only in old age can one take the Yangguan Road...

115
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,013
Oh, are you back?

116
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,724
I roughly understand the situation

117
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:05,683
that…

118
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,768
Let’s solve the problem first

119
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,690
The truth about the death of Park Cheol-woo

120
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,692
Why did the robbers hide it?

121
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:15,776
Isn’t it simple?

122
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,863
Saying it out loud is like admitting that you are a murderer.

123
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,865
They could guess that the police were coming in.

124
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,117
But several hours have passed and there is still no response

125
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,493
That's why I say it's weird

126
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,412
Common armed robbers

127
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,790
Several hostages were killed during the hostage-taking process
It can be said that it is predictable

128
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,418
If the person killed was a police officer who infiltrated

129
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,794
There won't be too many concerns.

130
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,839
I can also take the opportunity to express
What are the consequences of angering them?

131
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:40,342
Besides, they weren't robbing a small town bank.
This is the Banknote Printing Bureau

132
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,011
They robbed important state institutions.

133
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,053
But what is the result?

134
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,723
A few days passed without any casualties.

135
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,559
Even when the Director of the Banknote Printing Bureau was shot
What happened again?

136
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,811
Medical teams were also allowed to go in to rescue

137
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,481
Are they trying to claim that they are chivalrous thieves?

138
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,483
There is this possibility

139
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,859
What is certain is that

140
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,653
They care a lot about public opinion

141
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,247
We have two cards.

142
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,000
First, use public opinion

143
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,168
What about the other one?

144
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,170
The professor is not in there.

145
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,131
We know this

146
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,759
From now on, I will use these two trump cards

147
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,053
Take back the initiative

148
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,096
What method?

149
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,851
I go in there myself

150
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,733
What about the reporters outside?

151
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,401
They have been waiting outside

152
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,737
Tell them to hold a press conference in two hours.

153
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,489
And three times a day from now on

154
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,200
Regular news release

155
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,993
No need to do...

156
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,037
Disclose accurate information in a timely manner

157
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,249
We act according to principles and public opinion will understand immediately.

158
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,460
They don't blame us.

159
00:13:58,462 --> 00:13:59,547
The robbers

160
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,266
A grown man is crying out in pain at this?

161
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,268
Damn it.

162
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,020
Hey, didn’t they say you’re good at fighting?

163
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,439
Hey, this is a surprise attack.

164
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:21,569
And if you monitor carefully
Can I suffer this?

165
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,571
sorry

166
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:24,572
Done

167
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,116
OK

168
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,829
Let me see if your forehead is broken?

169
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,540
Don't scare me

170
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,375
Am I the one who was attacked?

171
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,169
I didn't say anything?

172
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,560
Hello, Captain

173
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,313
What's wrong with you?

174
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,482
How did you become so depressed?

175
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:02,776
Tokyo?

176
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:05,654
It's not your fault

177
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,741
Blame the policeman
Almost put the hostages in danger

178
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:11,535
is that so?

179
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:14,997
I have no idea

180
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:21,587
My sister is comforting you, so please pretend to accept her kindness.

181
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,009
It's here.

182
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,719
The professor called.

183
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:31,013
What about the car? Did he take care of it?

184
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,141
Yeah, it's the same as what Tokyo said.

185
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:35,893
Look

186
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,646
Good thing you told us
What do those car sellers do?

187
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,357
Hey, we'd be miserable without you.

188
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,399
Yes or no?

189
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,780
The Yoon Mi-sun incident

190
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,574
The professor has reason to trust you.

191
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,243
Go now

192
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,292
Stand up straight

193
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:13,764
If I don't do it

194
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:16,600
This matter is not as simple as Tokyo's death.

195
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,980
So yeah, I want to say

196
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:25,317
It would be better to let Berlin take the lead again.

197
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:26,819
What?

198
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,696
This won't cause anything else...

199
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:32,074
This happened because of me.

200
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,284
Maybe as Berlin said

201
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,037
The most effective way to control hostages

202
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,498
Maybe it's fear

203
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:41,458
What do you think of Berlin?

204
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,009
Well, I have a different opinion.

205
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,469
Isn't there a saying
“Generals are not easily replaced on the battlefield”?

206
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,015
Besides, this matter requires a change of leadership.

207
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,933
Then I'm not qualified.

208
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,185
are you serious?

209
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,604
Professor, I have only one goal.

210
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,023
Our plan to succeed

211
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:07,735
Whether it is a false peace
Or the fear of anxiety

212
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,278
The process doesn't matter

213
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:13,157
Walk out of here with lots of money in your pocket

214
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:14,908
That's enough

215
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,385
professor

216
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,512
Connect first

217
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,228
What's with the gunshots?

218
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:44,897
Did some shooting practice

219
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,858
Huh? Why did he lie?
We are acting in self-defense.

220
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,195
Could it be that he killed someone?

221
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,112
I said

222
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,782
We don't want to hurt the hostages.

223
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,408
But things don’t go as planned, do they?

224
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,120
There's a commotion outside.

225
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:03,082
Family members demand confirmation of hostage's life or death

226
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:06,001
Public opinion demands immediate armed suppression

227
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:09,880
Didn't you watch the news?

228
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,632
I said I was just practicing shooting out of boredom.

229
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,300
It's a bit boring to stay in there.

230
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,136
Really? No one died, right?

231
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,766
How come it's like when the director was injured?
Should we call each hostage one by one?

232
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,352
Or send a video to say hello?

233
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,978
I'll go in and check it out myself.

234
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,522
This way you can't go wrong

235
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,820
You know I won't agree.

236
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,740
If we don't do this, it will be really difficult to appease the people.

237
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,159
We'll both be in trouble if this continues.

238
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:43,247
Good food supply at present
We can't guarantee

239
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:49,962
That's the only way.

240
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:50,879
only

241
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,842
You can't play tricks like last time.

242
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,427
I understand I will go in alone

243
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,222
But I was allowed to bring a camera in for live broadcast

244
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,850
If you are really a person who keeps his promise

245
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,268
The public should also know

246
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,435
If you refuse

247
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,689
We had to tell the reporters who were camped outside

248
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:13,152
The robbers refused to confirm the hostage's life or death.

249
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:19,950
After the food is delivered tomorrow at noon

250
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,076
I'll let you in

251
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:25,664
Officer Xuan Yuzhen fully understood

252
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:29,835
The reason why we strive to protect the safety of hostages

253
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,670
It's public opinion

254
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,424
When we are in trouble

255
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,801
She drew out the sword of public opinion

256
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,761
Decided to stab us

257
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,406
It's no big deal to line people up.

258
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,617
Show her once and ask her to leave.

259
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,286
No, it's better to let the hostages come one by one.

260
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,662
Separate confirmation

261
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,748
We need to avoid emergencies

262
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,750
Anyway, delaying time is good for us.

263
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,668
Why didn't you just refuse?
But accepted the request?

264
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,671
I said there can't be any casualties because of public opinion.

265
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,840
Let public opinion speak for us

266
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,176
This is the last piece of our puzzle.

267
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,345
And if people start to believe

268
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,847
If we are murderers or reactionaries...

269
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,307
Will suppress by force

270
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,642
There's no need to worry so much, right?

271
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,393
Anyway, the hostages are fine.

272
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,646
In the process of identifying the hostages
If we are found to be printing money

273
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:31,772
What should I do about this?

274
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,148
Must be warned in advance

275
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:37,444
What we do here
What happened to Park Cheol-woo?

276
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,446
All information must not be disclosed

277
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,951
So before confirming the hostages
You must be thoroughly prepared

278
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,702
We fight against the squad

279
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,622
To provide relief to the families of the citizens held hostage

280
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:51,667
And the concerns of the general public

281
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,918
Prepared for this press conference

282
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,836
First, the robbers repeatedly emphasized

283
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,339
The shooting that happened this afternoon

284
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:03,595
Did not violate
Its commitment to ensuring the safety of hostages

285
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,681
Does this mean there were no casualties?

286
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:06,807
How can you believe this?

287
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,351
For this we fight against the squad

288
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:13,063
The robbers were asked
Requirement to personally confirm the safety of hostages

289
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:16,316
After negotiation, the robbers accepted the request.

290
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,194
Officer Xuan Yuzhen from the Anti-Japanese Team

291
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,114
Will accompany the photographers to shoot

292
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:25,450
And decided to live broadcast the whole process

293
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,120
-That's all
-Please give your opinion

294
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:30,455
Please tell us if there are any casualties.

295
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,094
It looks like you didn't sleep all night.

296
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:50,642
don’t worry

297
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,186
If you encounter any difficulties, I will help you solve them

298
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,822
You think I'm unreliable, don't you?

299
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:05,490
So you have to cheer up

300
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:08,994
Because I believe you can be trusted

301
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:16,585
I also feel that I can't be so depressed.

302
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:19,755
Helsinki Oslo

303
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,841
Call all the hostages to the lobby.

304
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,638
Come on, don't dawdle, get up quickly

305
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,685
Stay away from me, damn.

306
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,104
They told us all to get up quickly.

307
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:39,900
What? Are you trying to gather the rebels?
Can't we have a people's trial?

308
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:41,026
I won't go

309
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,903
The atmosphere is not like that.

310
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,489
- It's up to you.
-Hello

311
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:49,326
If you hadn't been so nosy as to move the hostages

312
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,661
Now we can all sleep peacefully at home.

313
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,247
I regret it too

314
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:57,417
If I had stopped the policeman before
He won't have to sacrifice.

315
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,628
That child should be the same as I think.

316
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,817
- You let go
-how?

317
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,735
Want to see that boy soon?

318
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:26,279
Even if you're lucky enough to get out of here

319
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:30,575
Don't forget that you committed adultery with the robber
I will make you unable to get rid of this label for the rest of your life

320
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:48,552
The three of us are in the warehouse

321
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,387
Nothing happened

322
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,306
Are you right or wrong?

323
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,310
That's right.

324
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:03,066
So don't cause trouble for no reason.

325
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:06,987
yes

326
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:40,812
After a while until noon
To confirm the safety of the hostages

327
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,939
A police officer will come in.

328
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:46,318
I heard that the family members outside
I was worried when I heard the gunshots.

329
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:47,444
So we specifically allowed

330
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:49,571
So please cooperate

331
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,115
What about the policeman who died?

332
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,367
Anne

333
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,998
Should we hand over the body to them?

334
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,210
What corpse?

335
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,419
Did anything happen?

336
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,798
We just practiced shooting.

337
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,885
-Comrade Director
-yes

338
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,136
Do you know something?

339
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,013
No, I don't know

340
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,431
That's right

341
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,476
Can I say a few words?

342
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:22,938
Although it's a bit late

343
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:25,732
Let me introduce myself

344
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,527
My real name is Song Zhonghao

345
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,903
41 years old

346
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,781
Born in Taecheon, Pyeongan Province

347
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,408
Caught when he defected from North Korea at the age of nine

348
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,994
Spent 25 years in an asylum

349
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,622
I won't go into details about how it came out.

350
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,542
Comrades here

351
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:46,044
My identity is clear

352
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:48,171
So even if I leave here

353
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,882
The chance of getting caught has also increased, right?

354
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:55,679
These days I have been threatening you
This is my own punishment.

355
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:58,557
But it's also a warning

356
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:03,812
My teammates

357
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:07,440
We will still treat our comrades as humanely as possible.

358
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,026
But I have no way out

359
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,654
So better not do anything stupid

360
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,078
There will be a camera accompanying you.

361
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,997
It's been so long since you showed your face to your family.

362
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,249
You should tidy yourself up, right?

363
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:27,168
Come on over here

364
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,684
There are fewer people queuing in the men's restroom

365
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,811
Those at the end of the line, come here.

366
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:50,191
Uncle Deputy Director, let's talk

367
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:03,246
-What are you going to do?
-What do you mean?

368
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,749
Didn’t you hear the police were coming in?
Should I do something?

369
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,293
If someone dies, we really do nothing?

370
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:09,502
You should tell the police

371
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,047
They warned us

372
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:15,175
Provoking robbers in vain will only make things worse

373
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,679
-No matter what...
- It's fine as long as you don't get discovered

374
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:25,685
What did you say?

375
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,439
We secretly slipped the note

376
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:30,732
Write about the policeman's death

377
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,193
There are several robbers in total.
Describe the characteristics of each robber.

378
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:35,403
Include the money they print.

379
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,363
What should I do if I get caught?

380
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:38,990
The robbers won't let us go.

381
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,700
Spare my life

382
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:42,952
It depends on who gets arrested.

383
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:48,792
Do you want to...

384
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:52,170
If it's you, even if you're discovered
I won’t do anything to you, right?

385
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:54,589
You are the daughter of the American ambassador.

386
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,174
No matter what, you can't ask your children to do that...

387
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:00,136
As a police officer, I am also responsible for the death of my uncle.

388
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,473
Let’s not write it on paper.

389
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:05,642
Instead, they write it on newly printed bills and hand it out.

390
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:09,229
Deputy Director, I am the target.

391
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:11,022
You can talk to the printing team.

392
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,899
Find a way to get a banknote out

393
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,151
Let's do it this way

394
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,654
Even if I get caught, I will take the blame alone.

395
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,450
If you feel you can't do it halfway

396
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:23,827
Just give up

397
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,164
For safety reasons

398
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,417
Except for a photographer

399
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,254
You cannot bring other reporters in with you.
Please understand this

400
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:37,298
But we will record the scene

401
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:41,052
To every broadcaster

402
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:45,640
We are concerned
The family members imprisoned near here

403
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:49,811
For their personal safety
In order to promote the rapid resolution of the incident

404
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,312
We arranged this opportunity

405
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:57,277
Family members of the Banknote Printing Bureau employees who were held hostage
and parents of students

406
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,194
besides

407
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,613
Miss Annie King's father

408
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:04,200
Marshall King, the US ambassador to South Korea, and his wife

409
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,577
Also present

410
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:37,859
Are you ready?

411
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,278
How was the video transmission test?

412
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:41,279
No problem

413
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:42,947
let's go

414
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,286
(The police tried to get rid of the professor
Park Cheol-woo was killed)

415
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,207
(They are more than just robbers)

416
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,292
(Still digging escape hatches and printing money)

417
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:55,794
It's time

418
00:29:58,671 --> 00:29:59,506
Will everything be okay?

419
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:06,429
I believe

420
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,182
We are on the right track

421
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,698
(Occupy the Banknote Printing Bureau for 98 hours)

422
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,330
Oh, the door is open.

423
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,087
(Officer Xuan Yuzhen enters the Banknote Printing Bureau)

424
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,847
-No one?
-Where are all the hostages?

425
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,056
Why is it empty?

426
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:51,391
Nice to meet you

427
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:56,646
(The robber shows his face)

428
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:08,783
- Look at that face.
-Is this a double act or something?

429
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:18,209
It's not easy to come here.

430
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,840
Where are the hostages?

431
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:25,717
Follow me

432
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:43,693
- I went in.
-Finally got in

433
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,239
Set up the lens here

434
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,408
-Where are the hostages?
-Why can't I see anyone?

435
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:59,417
From now on, I will confirm the life and death of the hostages one by one

436
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:02,795
No. 1 contestant: Zhao Yingmin, Director of the Banknote Printing Bureau

437
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,216
Are you planning to do this one by one?

438
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,968
To maintain order

439
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,930
After confirming

440
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,557
You can go to the exhibition hall opposite to take a rest.

441
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:21,773
Hello you

442
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:25,652
If you play tricks

443
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:27,403
You know what's going to happen?

444
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:40,875
please

445
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:49,092
First of all, I apologize for the shooting error.

446
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,220
How is the wound healing going?

447
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:55,598
fine

448
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,520
I am Zhao Yingmin, Director of the Banknote Printing Bureau

449
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,105
It's your dad

450
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:03,189
Dear our family

451
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:06,442
Are Hee Chan and Hee Joo okay?

452
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,319
I'm fine

453
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,946
You wait a moment

454
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:10,947
Hee Chan

455
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:12,573
Hee Joo

456
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,494
The robbers were nice to us.

457
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,789
What was that gunshot about yesterday?

458
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,876
I don’t really...

459
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,713
You mean no one was shot?

460
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,185
Personal information obtained

461
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,316
(Song Zhonghao's criminal record)

462
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,818
I said why does it look familiar?

463
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:18,723
Hey Annie

464
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:26,355
Let's go

465
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,464
Nice to meet you. Are you okay?

466
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:53,424
yes

467
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:56,636
If you want to say hello to your dad or other family members
You can start talking

468
00:34:58,304 --> 00:34:59,263
Mother

469
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,015
dad

470
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:02,558
I…

471
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,109
(Annie Kim Myung-sung Foreign Language High School)

472
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,446
I…

473
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:22,411
sorry

474
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,455
It doesn't matter

475
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:27,375
It doesn't matter

476
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,043
It's fine

477
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:31,546
It doesn't matter

478
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,850
I think she's too emotional.
Let her go in and have some rest.

479
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,230
Yeah, it's hard work.

480
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,408
Can't

481
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,956
Your acting is not bad.

482
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,003
What did you hide from me?

483
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,681
Dare to do such a cunning thing

484
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,224
Who came up with this?

485
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:29,687
I thought of this all by myself and I want you to die!

486
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,189
Who ordered this?

487
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:35,943
This attempt ends here.

488
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,528
Helsinki took her away

489
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:41,490
What exactly is Officer Xuan planning?

490
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:43,784
- If this continues...
- Remove the camera.

491
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,120
Now is the beginning

492
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:54,712
What's going on?

493
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,466
At this rate, we'll have to stay up all night.

494
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,761
Gather all the hostages.

495
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:04,764
This is difficult to do

496
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:10,436
Why?
Isn't it great to save time?

497
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:15,149
You clearly said that the hostages were safe.

498
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,401
And he promised to confirm it for us.

499
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,279
Confirm everything and leave.

500
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,781
What's the problem with doing this?

501
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:28,496
good

502
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,175
Please put the camera back on.

503
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:50,017
(All hostages come on stage to check at the same time)

504
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,956
What are the police doing?

505
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:20,298
This is the hostage list.

506
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:23,551
I will check and confirm one by one

507
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,306
Director Zhao Yingmin has confirmed it.

508
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:39,775
He is still alive

509
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,695
Have you confirmed that everyone is safe?

510
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:44,155
Then we'll send you away.

511
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:45,698
One person is missing

512
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:47,825
Security Contract Worker

513
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:50,619
Park Cheol-woo, 33 years old male

514
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,124
The day of the robbery was his first day at work

515
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,251
There is no such person among the hostages.

516
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,670
No, it's clearly in our data.

517
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:03,966
Have you seen this person?

518
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:06,594
Have you seen it?

519
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:12,475
This means that the sacrifice of Park Cheol-woo
Has he been added to the hostage list?

520
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:15,061
The identity of the agent is confidential.

521
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,062
Don't worry about being exposed

522
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,646
Why did you tell me so late?

523
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,441
We are going to create an emergency.

524
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,234
The professor outside could not predict

525
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,196
In case of information leakage

526
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:28,115
The robbers started
I won't agree to confirm the hostages.

527
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,910
Now everyone's attention is focused here

528
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:33,412
Officer Xuan will use the power of public opinion

529
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,247
Bring out the hostages

530
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:38,876
Did something happen yesterday when the gunshots were heard?

531
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,920
I said nothing happened.

532
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,755
Comrade Director Lai, do you know anything?

533
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:45,549
that…

534
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:48,219
It's shooting practice...

535
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,638
If you think you can get away with it by sealing it up
You are totally wrong.

536
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,224
Where is this person?

537
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:54,308
How would I know?

538
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,061
I haven't seen this guy here.

539
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,898
Have you really never seen this person? No one has seen him?

540
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:14,787
Have you really never seen it?

541
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:29,718
I saw him yesterday

542
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,470
The man was shot yesterday...

543
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:33,848
I've seen it too!

544
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,435
So where is this person?

545
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:38,352
Shouldn't

546
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,688
Was he killed by you?

547
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:44,483
If you didn't kill him, bring him here.

548
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,279
This dog trick

549
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,030
Still thought it would work?

550
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,450
This bastard is actually a policeman!

551
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:55,494
Are you admitting to killing him?

552
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,329
You guys secretly sent the police in.

553
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:59,206
We were just acting in self-defense!

554
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,666
You are just making excuses!

555
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,501
Important

556
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:05,713
You broke your promise and killed someone here.

557
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:09,884
Demand armed suppression of your public opinion
The majority opinion

558
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,136
For the safety of the hostages

559
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:14,305
We are trying our best to cooperate in the negotiations

560
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:15,598
But now

561
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:18,559
We can no longer resolve this situation through dialogue.

562
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:21,854
So if you don't want the worst outcome

563
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:26,400
At least release the young students.

564
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:29,820
-That's right!
-At least let the students go!

565
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:32,323
I'm asking you
Give me a reason to continue negotiating

566
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,994
Reason? Let's be honest.

567
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:40,289
Take the American ambassador's daughter away
That's what you meant, right?

568
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:42,791
This way you can attack with confidence and overwhelm the whole field

569
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,585
It seems that you are quite afraid of armed suppression.

570
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,796
I will stay here!

571
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:49,632
Did you hear that?

572
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,801
Except Anne.

573
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,512
How about at least letting the other students go home?

574
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:02,144
Let them go, at least let the students go!

575
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,527
-What's this?
- It was delivered by courier.

576
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:12,404
(Report)

577
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:13,781
There's no other choice.

578
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:17,201
We can only listen to who is telling the truth.

579
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,485
What happened? He wasn't killed?

580
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,863
The fact that we completely concealed

581
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:57,491
It's not Park Cheol-woo's death

582
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,493
But he's still alive

583
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:04,164
Disclose accurate information in a timely manner

584
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,250
We act according to principles and public opinion will understand immediately.

585
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:09,253
They don't blame us.

586
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,005
The robbers

587
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:14,133
So was the car cleaned up?

588
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:16,427
Tell me what happened first.

589
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:19,138
A mouse came out so I caught it

590
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,389
Wouldn't that kill him?

591
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:24,518
Bullets in Berlin
No doubt it hit the policeman's heart accurately.

592
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:28,897
Although Berlin wanted to hit him on the forehead

593
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:30,983
But it still ended with just venting anger

594
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,737
He is still alive

595
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:39,575
Berlin complied.
The principle repeatedly emphasized by the professor

596
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:41,327
Fortunately, Berlin abided by the principles

597
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:44,371
We can seize the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
Let public opinion be on our side

598
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:47,291
Police confirm Park Cheol-woo is dead

599
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:48,792
We take advantage of this

600
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:50,961
Counterattack

601
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:54,715
What is going on?

602
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:57,676
Now reporting the news

603
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,012
Just now we broadcast the vehicle

604
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:02,640
received an anonymous video report

605
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,183
The video content is quite shocking

606
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:07,728
This is the shooting scene that happened in the Banknote Printing Bureau yesterday

607
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,938
Special Forces Soldier Park Cheol-woo

608
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:13,484
Sneak into the Banknote Printing Bureau wearing hostage costumes

609
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:15,778
Creating riots and trying to take advantage of them

610
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:17,863
Kill our commander

611
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,366
That's it.

612
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:22,618
After all, he is a policeman, but then what?

613
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:26,080
Agent Park Cheol-woo!
Then what action did you take?

614
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:28,624
How about I tell you about it?

615
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:31,627
When we lost our commander,

616
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,545
They want to take advantage of the situation to suppress it with force.

617
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:35,047
Oh my god this is ridiculous

618
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,969
The hostages were completely unaware

619
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:43,180
If I hadn't subdued Park Cheol-woo

620
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:45,140
The violent crackdown really happened.

621
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:47,226
Think about what will happen to the hostages?

622
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:49,353
No matter how you answer
Do you think people will believe it?

623
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:52,731
Pretending to be a hostage
Actually, they wanted to use the hostages as a shield.

624
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:56,193
Who would believe a policeman who is so shameless and keeps telling lies!

625
00:44:58,654 --> 00:44:59,655
Is this something people do?

626
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:05,703
No more later...

627
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:10,833
Well-known

628
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,960
We are criminals who come to steal money.

629
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,921
Even so
We know better than anyone that life is precious

630
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:17,464
At least better than these policemen.

631
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,341
If in this printing bureau

632
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,552
Someone has to lose his life

633
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:24,221
I am the first one

634
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:28,058
I won't allow anyone to die before me.

635
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:44,533
(Police used hostages as shields
Attempts to carry out indiscriminate repression were exposed)

636
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:47,703
As the man who looked like the robber leader said

637
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:49,121
So far, the incident

638
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:52,166
No deaths have been reported yet...

639
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,168
-What are you doing?
- Feeling betrayed

640
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,669
The professor said not to watch TV

641
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:59,006
Here comes the "Professor said..."

642
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,175
Are you all happy today?

643
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,676
Don't be so rigid

644
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,221
We dealt the police a heavy blow, didn't we?

645
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:08,015
Now it's all chaos outside

646
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,475
Especially at the last moment

647
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:11,185
Berlin, you just shocked the whole audience

648
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:14,438
People watching the live broadcast were angry at the police

649
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:16,064
Unanimously condemn and demand the truth be revealed...

650
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,691
If the boss wants me to shut it up, I will shut it up.

651
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:19,359
oh?

652
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,154
What happened?

653
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:24,531
We just watched it together happily.

654
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:28,035
That should be about right.

655
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:31,663
The professor repeatedly emphasized the public opinion
Are you more or less starting to stand on our side?

656
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:33,582
Well done Berlin

657
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:44,051
What's wrong? What happened again?

658
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:45,427
that…

659
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,059
Look

660
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:55,604
Finally dug out the soil!

661
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:58,649
So is the digging basically done?

662
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:03,570
The money is almost printed.

663
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:05,239
Three days later

664
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:08,826
Finally I can get out of this unfortunate printing bureau!

665
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,078
It's finally going to see the light of day, right?

666
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,124
Take money out...

667
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,719
We were filled with hope.

668
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,847
But not everyone is like this

669
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,677
Are you here just to change my bandage?

670
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:10,512
Still don’t know after reading it?

671
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:13,098
- So late for this?
- If you go out

672
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:15,809
Forget everything that happened here.

673
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,398
How is this possible?

674
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:28,196
Too

675
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,532
What happened was not normal.

676
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:34,912
I'm sorry

677
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:40,959
No, that's not what I meant.

678
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:43,253
I hope you can pretend nothing happened.

679
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:44,922
Work well

680
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:47,466
It’s time to meet someone better, right?

681
00:48:57,809 --> 00:48:58,727
Work of the Banknote Printing Bureau

682
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:01,313
I'm planning to quit.

683
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:06,026
Why?

684
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:09,321
Oh shit

685
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:11,615
Is it because of that kid Director?

686
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:14,326
This bastard is looking for me to give him...

687
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,021
I can't accept it

688
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:07,981
I should also take responsibility.

689
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:10,400
What can I do?

690
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,194
The public opinion is not favorable to us.

691
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:14,946
There's nothing I can do.

692
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:20,035
This arrangement is also considered tolerant...

693
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:20,952
Isn't it because

694
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:24,122
If I step down, will there be no one to replace me?

695
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:29,377
Please tell your so-called tolerant superiors

696
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:32,547
If Captain Cha Moo-hyuk is replaced
I'm planning to quit too.

697
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,183
team leader

698
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:48,271
You don't have to say that. I agree.

699
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,233
This is my responsibility, it's a fact

700
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:53,485
Compared to me, you are right to stay

701
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:56,780
Are you going to give up?

702
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:58,615
Who said giving up?

703
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:01,326
I must find the professor.

704
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:04,037
Do you have any solution?

705
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:07,290
It's hard to say this at this juncture.

706
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:10,460
But when are you
Met the man named Park Sun-ho?

707
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:11,670
Is that Sunho?

708
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:14,798
Didn’t he break into our tent last time?

709
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:16,007
Captain Che

710
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:19,970
That person

711
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:23,056
Honestly, we haven't known each other for a long time.

712
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,724
But he is definitely not someone who can hurt anyone.

713
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:28,228
The most important thing is that I trust him and love him

714
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:30,564
But…

715
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:33,441
Don't say such useless words
Have a good sleep and see you tomorrow morning

716
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:37,904
They can't fire both of us.
It should be over.

717
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:41,533
team leader!

718
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,672
(Xuan Yuzhen)

719
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:07,559
Okay, I'll heat it up for you. Wait a minute.

720
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:08,894
Please use slowly

721
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:14,191
-How much?
- It looks delicious.

722
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:17,235
- Everything in our house is delicious
- I love this so much

723
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:19,654
- This one too
- One more

724
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:25,118
Come in and eat. Come over here.

725
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,331
How much is one?

726
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:31,875
-Do you want rice cake skewers?
- Hey, come here.

727
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,086
I'm here!

728
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:36,880
Wow looks so delicious

729
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:43,053
Wow!

730
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:46,848
You drank a lot, didn't you?

731
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:49,434
A little bit

732
00:53:57,484 --> 00:54:00,153
Is it okay to drink so much?

733
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:02,447
Eliminate all worries

734
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:05,075
Then I can go back and continue fighting.

735
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:31,726
You said I could rely on you, right?

736
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:32,978
Wait for me

737
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:37,148
I got drunk later
Maybe she will cry her eyes out.

738
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:46,658
Oh, never mind.

739
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:49,911
I have to get drunk first

740
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:57,002
Isn't this unlikely?

741
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:06,636
When she is with the professor, she can forget the reality.

742
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,138
Even if it's just for a moment

743
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:10,849
So does the professor.

744
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:15,145
Temporarily put aside the identity of the robber leader
As an ordinary coffee shop owner

745
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:21,067
When I was face to face with her
Any melancholy and guilt

746
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:22,861
Everything will vanish into thin air

747
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:27,449
We are like this
Would they look like a couple?

748
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,919
Looks like I'm really drunk

749
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:43,006
I seem to be able to hear music.

750
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:51,973
Yuzhen

751
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:58,146
The Banknote Bureau Case

752
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:04,110
Could you please stop interfering?

753
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:09,657
What's the meaning?

754
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:12,744
I just think

755
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:15,914
You look so tired.

756
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,629
The professor uttered these words unconsciously.
Surprised himself

757
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:26,674
If we consider our actions

758
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:28,968
Officer Xuan's resignation should never have happened

759
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,345
Or should I quit?

760
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:32,180
It feels amazing

761
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:34,391
I was really tired

762
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:37,185
I even secretly hope they fire me.

763
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:40,814
Now I feel revived.

764
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:52,700
It's my mom. Wait a minute.

765
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:55,745
Yeah, mom

766
00:56:57,288 --> 00:57:01,918
I should be home late today.

767
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,004
No that...

768
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:11,761
At that moment the professor could no longer laugh.

769
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:13,763
He suddenly realized

770
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:16,766
I fell in love with her too

771
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:28,403
And the next second

772
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:31,072
Officer Xuan suddenly found

773
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:33,032
Important clues that could turn the situation around

774
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:47,964
Have you really never seen it?

775
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,383
I saw him yesterday

776
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,718
-What?
-The man was shot...

777
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:57,557
I…

778
00:57:58,516 --> 00:57:59,601
I have to go now

779
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,562
Sorry, we'll talk later.

780
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,189
sorry

781
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:33,968
(Unlocking)

782
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:35,553
Hello

783
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:48,204
