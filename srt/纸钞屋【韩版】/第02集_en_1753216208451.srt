00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:09,926
NETFLIX SERIES

2
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:20,145
The Yalu River across the China-North Korea border

3
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,440
The narrowest part of the river is only 30 meters wide.

4
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,275
North Korean defectors often take advantage of this

5
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,319
If you're lucky, you can go through a third country

6
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:31,072
To South Korea or other free countries

7
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,198
I mean lucky.

8
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,241
Hide!

9
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,460
Illegal border crossers are crossing the river!

10
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:46,337
Over there!

11
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,839
-Catch him quickly!
-Still standing there?

12
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,052
Catch them!

13
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,272
Mother!

14
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:06,858
Mother!

15
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:08,902
Mother!

16
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:10,653
Hello!

17
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:12,906
Hurry up!

18
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:16,284
Some people say "labor is sacred"

19
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,664
But the forced labor here

20
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,750
No comparison with the divine

21
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,751
Every time Berlin was put in the penalty room

22
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,462
More and more people are afraid of him

23
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:10,964
Then

24
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:13,550
(25 years later)

25
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,506
Let me go!

26
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,096
Comrade, please spare my life

27
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,728
Comrade

28
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:09,939
-Is there a fire?
-have

29
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,962
I think I'll miss the smell here

30
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:35,423
Comrade!

31
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,804
None of his men understood what this meant.

32
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,098
But he meant it.

33
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,405
How is the situation?

34
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:43,074
Banknote printing factory continues to operate

35
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:47,036
The rest of the staff are divided into two shifts: the cooking group and the working group.

36
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:48,788
Let them have no time to think about anything else

37
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,001
You also know that the most important thing now is to control the hostages

38
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,378
They must be made to believe

39
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,921
Cooperate well and everyone will be safe

40
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,465
Um, anything else?

41
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,305
I'm just saying

42
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,348
It's almost shift time.

43
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:20,695
Goodness

44
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:23,072
Are you sleeping?

45
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:26,451
Goodness

46
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,420
Next round of working groups

47
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,255
Next round of working groups!

48
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,008
Don't dawdle, hurry up

49
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,926
Empty your sleeping bags.

50
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,636
Only colleagues who work all night can sleep.

51
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,805
We followed the professor's plan

52
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,557
Have the hostages work in groups

53
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,101
This can reduce anxiety

54
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,188
The robber is taking money

55
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,857
What? Withdraw money?

56
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,025
What did you just come back from?

57
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:02,070
Let's dig a hole in the underground warehouse

58
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,322
So they didn't plan to go out from the beginning?

59
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:05,740
Sly bastards

60
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:09,285
Hey, just find an excuse to switch groups with me.

61
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,622
-Why do you have to...
- Just do as I say.

62
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,262
professor

63
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,140
You are good in everything

64
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:33,643
Just too naive

65
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,779
Mom, are you still awake?

66
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:45,822
Are you here?

67
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:47,990
You just had sex with that man

68
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,535
Stay together?

69
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:53,579
You mentioned that man last time you didn't come home

70
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,249
Is he the owner of the cafe?

71
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,752
No, I came back from work.

72
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,090
Work site?

73
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,595
Why can't you get along with that person?

74
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,098
Looks pretty handsome

75
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:14,642
I'll talk about it later. I have to get back to work.

76
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:17,562
Really

77
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,776
Before I close my eyes

78
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,987
I hope you meet a good person.

79
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,406
You know that's my last wish, right?

80
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,326
I said you don't need to rush me

81
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,122
Mom, if you live long enough, won’t you be able to see it?

82
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,086
Is that the Bureau of Printing and Printing?

83
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,298
I saw it on the news and it seems dangerous

84
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,134
Take care of yourself

85
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,345
I may not be able to take your call while I am at work

86
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:52,805
Um

87
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:56,976
mom

88
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,105
Do you really not need to go to the hospital?

89
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:02,607
Why

90
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,944
It's no big deal, don't worry.

91
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,615
Mom, do you know how to take care of yourself?

92
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,367
- I went
-knew

93
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,499
Yuzhen

94
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,585
At work

95
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,670
Unable to

96
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,340
Answering the phone

97
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,300
(Yuzhen can't answer the phone while she's working)

98
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:36,974
(Looking at the miracle of the Korean Peninsula from the miracle of the Han River)

99
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,394
In the video released by the robbers yesterday
One of the students who appeared

100
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,772
The U.S. ambassador to South Korea
Anne King, daughter of Marshall King

101
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,524
Did you know about this in advance?

102
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,651
So I said we would hold a...

103
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:48,861
Is it true that an attempt was made to suppress it with force last night?

104
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:52,740
Some people say that they are responsible for the failure of the crackdown.
A major reshuffle of North Korean officials is needed

105
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,868
-that…
- That won't happen.

106
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,036
What?

107
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,915
So is it true that an attempt was made to suppress it with force?

108
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,583
That's fake news

109
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:03,709
Fake news?

110
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,546
Our counter-attack team puts the safety of the hostages first.

111
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,258
The robbers' intentions remain to be seen

112
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,300
As for Anne King

113
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,511
Just one of the hostages we need to rescue.

114
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,764
Fake news? Can you say that?

115
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,850
After all, there was no fighting, so they retreated immediately.

116
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,311
Considered repression options
But for the safety of the hostages

117
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,355
It's not really implemented yet, so just publish it like this

118
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,067
Is this ok?

119
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,528
Can it be hidden from the sharp eyes of reporters?

120
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,571
no way

121
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,573
Once you admit that you have tried to suppress it with force

122
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,200
As the reporter said, we have to bear the pressure of public opinion

123
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:39,537
If things develop like that
Someone has to take up the responsibility.

124
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,460
The robbers were led by the so-called professor

125
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:50,172
Unity and meticulousness

126
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,635
We have to work together to deal with them.

127
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,345
Am I right, Captain Cha Moo-hyuk?

128
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,933
But from now on, all negotiations

129
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,894
I hope you will follow my judgment on all important decisions.

130
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,439
From dispatching and deploying special forces

131
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,816
To the news leaked to the media
I have to check them one by one

132
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,737
If everyone agrees
We'll have a press conference in ten minutes.

133
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,924
This is a report of the information obtained during the last operation.

134
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,094
Thanks

135
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,810
Let's summarize the situation

136
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,021
Although the armed suppression failed

137
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:50,274
But it can at least understand the robbers' fighting power.

138
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,859
First of all, their military equipment level cannot be underestimated

139
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,695
Even expected us to launch a forced crackdown
And be prepared

140
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,698
They undoubtedly received some kind of military training.

141
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,243
Is there really any political purpose?

142
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,622
If that's the case then
They have definitely revealed their political purpose.

143
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:08,250
The situation becomes urgent
The true face may be revealed

144
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,837
It's hard to judge at the moment

145
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,632
And what about the ambassador's daughter?
Did the robbers know about the tour itinerary in advance?

146
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:15,800
Don't rule out this possibility

147
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,803
anyway
According to the robbers' current response methods

148
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,724
It's not just a simple bank robbery.

149
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:28,396
Dawn illuminates

150
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,314
The printing house occupied by robbers is still as quiet as death

151
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,982
(The opposition team refuted the rumor that they used force to suppress the Banknote Printing Bureau)

152
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:35,069
Regarding last night's media reports on the use of force to suppress

153
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:37,321
The United Against Team issued a statement to refute the rumors

154
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:40,741
and express a principled position
Do your best to ensure the safety of the hostages

155
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,833
Are the hostages okay?

156
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:50,876
certainly

157
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,003
I'm curious about something.

158
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:54,880
What's up?

159
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,216
When was the last time you had sex with a man?

160
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,680
Why don't you answer? Don't you have a partner?

161
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,810
This question is too private.

162
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,897
It's a pity that it's especially at this critical moment.

163
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,693
The more we communicate about privacy, the more we build emotional bonds.
Isn’t it?

164
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,862
So how about this question?

165
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:20,990
Have you ever faked an orgasm?

166
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,534
-What?
-Don't be shy

167
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:26,662
50% of women have faked orgasms

168
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,705
Let me say

169
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,750
Probably, but not every time.

170
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,503
This helps to make the relationship more harmonious

171
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,964
But this is deceiving the other party

172
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:39,258
Just like the three special forces that broke in last night

173
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,594
We are the ones who were deceived

174
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,763
You mentioned four robbers.

175
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,307
Was this a deliberate omission?

176
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,225
Even the hostage situation

177
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,895
It must have taken a lot of thought to prepare the costumes?

178
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,648
My preparation is meticulous.

179
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:55,566
Preparation?

180
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:59,111
Are bank robbers
Do you usually prepare for hostage-taking scenes?

181
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,363
Now that's not the point

182
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,866
The point is that we are not honest with each other

183
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,036
Don't try to fool me, officer.

184
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,788
This puts everyone in danger.

185
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,708
From now on, I will be in charge
No more cheating

186
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,418
Still not convincing

187
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:20,800
First, we should gradually understand each other and build trust

188
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,426
Then let's do it again

189
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,637
When was the last time you had an orgasm?

190
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,680
Contact me when you can answer this question.

191
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,561
Is this pervert crazy?

192
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:34,230
No

193
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,525
He is very good at negotiation.

194
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:43,280
Don't reveal what you want

195
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,199
This kind of opponent is the most difficult to deal with.

196
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,910
But they will tell us their requirements soon.

197
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,829
Is there any food in the Printing Bureau?

198
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,790
There is a staff restaurant according to the number of people inside

199
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,667
The ingredients inside can probably last for four days.

200
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,126
So I can hold on for now.

201
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,129
But more than 50 hostages were held

202
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,214
It's not an easy thing

203
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,216
They might be planning to flee.

204
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,677
But it is impossible to leave the country

205
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,055
They will gradually become anxious.

206
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:10,808
But what if the standoff lasts longer?
Don't forget to hold the summit.

207
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,935
Whoever can't hold back loses.

208
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,938
Don't look at the robber's calm attitude
It won't last long

209
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,982
Because time is on our side

210
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,779
The fact is that we are trying to gain time.

211
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,699
Time is money

212
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,243
This proverb describes us

213
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,453
Hey, don't you check the letterpress ink?

214
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,789
You see, the label is wrong.

215
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,833
Go change the ink

216
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:38,752
Chief Li

217
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,922
We are now printing money for the robbers.

218
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,507
Does it need to be perfect?

219
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,844
Who will get the money after it is printed?

220
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,679
When will we take care of this?

221
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,230
There's a flaw there.

222
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,442
There are spots on the tail end

223
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,486
It seems there is something wrong with the ink?

224
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,491
Uncle, your name is Li Qingming, right?

225
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,953
Because I have heard of your super dollar incident.

226
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,164
I am your fan

227
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,249
We are happy to cooperate

228
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,836
good

229
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,894
stop!

230
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:40,606
How many times did I tell you
Aim at the center of the cross, do you hear me?

231
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,275
How many holes did you drill?

232
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:46,695
Give me

233
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,408
Look, stand like this first

234
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,535
Align to center

235
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,371
Hit it in

236
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,039
Isn’t this simple?

237
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,749
I've never seen such a clumsy person.

238
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,253
Okay, try again.

239
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:07,800
I

240
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,303
before

241
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,889
Never done this kind of work

242
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,266
What? Hey I said

243
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,853
Who is born to do this?

244
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,355
Me

245
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,024
The Director of the Banknote Printing Bureau

246
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,527
-What do you want to say?
-ah?

247
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,029
Oh, the body is too delicate

248
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,740
You can't do this kind of rough work, right?

249
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,660
Hey, don't do this.

250
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:35,703
Dad, let me go

251
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:38,163
No, I want to see

252
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,957
Will it hurt if there is some ink in the stomach?

253
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,000
Boy!

254
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,586
Just now I was so happy that I was jumping into the pile of money

255
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,963
What the hell are you going crazy about now?

256
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,632
This guy has been watching me.

257
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,301
I sneaked in when I wasn't paying attention!

258
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,389
Dad, this guy
You have to give him some color at the beginning.

259
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,224
You're talking, don't do it.

260
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,392
Is there anything fun?

261
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,437
No, nothing.

262
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,106
What's up?

263
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,400
I'm just here to see

264
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:10,362
Can our director do this job?

265
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,950
Yes, it's OK...

266
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:19,121
Didn't I say I admire you?

267
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,497
I don't know why you always make me notice you

268
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,753
We are in the same boat

269
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,297
Live in Peace

270
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:34,261
That's right.

271
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,305
Hey Denver

272
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,099
Let's talk

273
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,518
I said that bastard

274
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:45,230
He always looked down on me and my dad.

275
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,483
A look of dissatisfaction

276
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,735
It makes me mad as fuck

277
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,945
Hey that bastard

278
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:03,207
-What is this? Is it from North Korea?
- This is the smell of cigarettes

279
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,002
Annoyed?

280
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:08,962
Isn’t this too naive?

281
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,965
Easily influenced by emotions

282
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,509
It will become a stumbling block for you

283
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,053
You're good at fighting.
This should be clear, right?

284
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,137
What's wrong with you?

285
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,433
Recently

286
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,019
My dad isn't feeling well.

287
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:29,024
I always wonder if I can get out of here safely.

288
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,401
Worried about these

289
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:32,820
don’t worry

290
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,949
Denver, look at me

291
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,743
Like someone who gets a piece of the action when something fails?

292
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:45,666
-No
-That's right.

293
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:48,127
So don't think too much.

294
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,296
Just obey the command
This plan will surely succeed.

295
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,048
I will make the plan a success

296
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:05,936
This smoke stinks.

297
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:11,692
What did he say?

298
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,236
nothing

299
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:16,864
-dad
-Um?

300
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,200
- The guy in Berlin
-Um

301
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,952
Better than I thought.

302
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,745
What boring words

303
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:28,584
So you should change your bad temper.

304
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:32,171
I get angry easily...

305
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:33,839
Stop nagging

306
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,260
How come you are so much like your mother when you lose your temper?

307
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,306
You said they were going to kill us?

308
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,850
It doesn't look like that, right?

309
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:45,976
Think about it

310
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,811
We've all seen their faces.

311
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,606
We see everything they do.

312
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,525
They printed money and dug holes
Can it still keep us alive?

313
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,819
Huh? We are no longer useful.

314
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,655
Oh, there is a value in that it protects them from bullets.

315
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,784
We can't sit and wait to die.

316
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,578
So what are your plans?

317
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,413
You have to contact the police.

318
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,873
Once you can contact the police

319
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:10,042
See if their trick can succeed?

320
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:13,962
But my cell phone was confiscated and I can't contact you.

321
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:16,924
Do you have any solution?

322
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:22,554
Agent Park, do you remember me during the staff training?
What has been emphasized repeatedly?

323
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,389
Huh? Those...

324
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,807
To show the spirit of sacrifice

325
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,185
Yes but why suddenly...

326
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,229
Hey, Deputy Director, come grab Agent Park's arm.

327
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,648
What are you going to do now?

328
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,566
Deputy Director, please be kind and persuade the Director.

329
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:36,568
that

330
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:40,197
I don't know what you mean by sacrifice.
But I'll make the sacrifice.

331
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,241
I told you not to mention that woman.

332
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,700
How many times have I said this!

333
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,619
Good to know. Anyway.

334
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:48,038
Is it appropriate to call your mother "that woman"?

335
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,165
A woman who left her family behind

336
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,042
I don't recognize this mother.

337
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:53,502
What nonsense are you talking about?

338
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:56,088
Hey kid, your mom...

339
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,844
What happened?

340
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,347
What's going on?

341
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:08,767
What happened? How did it become like this?

342
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,560
- I accidentally used a shovel.
-shovel?

343
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,271
These little bastards

344
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,523
-How come...
-Which bastard did this?

345
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,275
- Be careful.
- I did it

346
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,401
Come out here!

347
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:18,819
Is now the time to put the blame on someone?

348
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:21,488
Go get the first aid kit! Something serious has happened.

349
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,240
Stop the bleeding quickly

350
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,742
-Go get it!
-knew!

351
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,120
How could this happen if I wasn't careful?

352
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:43,987
Are you mopping the floor?

353
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:46,782
Caught on the first floor?

354
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:52,579
I only have two eyes.
But there are dozens of screens.

355
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:54,915
Come on, Comrade Director

356
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:59,002
What can I do for you?
Want to leave the work site and wander around?

357
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,420
That...that

358
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,008
Is he from the working group?

359
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:07,427
Denver and Moscow are responsible, aren't they?

360
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,263
Come in here.

361
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:13,600
Huh? What's going on?

362
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,310
Why is this guy here again?

363
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,353
What is going on?

364
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:19,731
Oh, that...

365
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,819
The young man was injured while working

366
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,404
so what?

367
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,364
I usually treat him as a family member

368
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:28,865
Seeing him injured made me crazy

369
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:31,034
I searched everywhere for a first aid kit and ended up running to...

370
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,119
Are you okay?

371
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,415
Why would you hide when looking for a first aid kit?

372
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:41,128
Afraid of being punished for being absent from duty

373
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,754
This is all true

374
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,714
This is indeed AWOL.

375
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,426
He escaped when supervision was inadequate.

376
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,514
no

377
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:57,394
Seeing the bloody scene, there was chaos.

378
00:23:57,477 --> 00:24:00,480
There was a mess and no one noticed that this person was missing.

379
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,565
Oh, really.

380
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,483
Am I right?

381
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,655
-Yeah, that's right.
-You see?

382
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:12,159
What else can we do about what has already happened?

383
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,456
Notify all hostages to gather

384
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,005
I was happy just now printing money

385
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:26,923
What happened?

386
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:28,758
All attention

387
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:33,138
From now on, people from North Korea stand on the right

388
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:37,225
From South Korea, please start from the left.

389
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,312
Come act fast!

390
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,586
What if I don't belong to either side?

391
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:07,506
You stand out

392
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,800
Rio later put her in
Keep a close watch on places like the lounge.

393
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:17,224
We will still be gentlemen to everyone.

394
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,142
But if someone disobeys the order

395
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:22,979
or endangering the safety of everyone will be punished

396
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,733
People from South Korea make mistakes
Let the people from North Korea be punished

397
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,152
People from North Korea make mistakes

398
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,446
Let the people from South Korea be punished

399
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:39,329
If you don't want to be punished for what others do

400
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:40,330
So what should we do?

401
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,168
We need to supervise each other

402
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,346
-that…
-Comrade Director

403
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:57,931
Do you have any questions?

404
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,225
How do you want to punish?

405
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:02,811
Why are you curious about this?

406
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,230
Don't ask

407
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,525
It won't be long before you understand

408
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,236
I think it's better not to know in advance.

409
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,749
There are many hostages and it is very likely that an emergency will occur.

410
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,918
Tell me how to control it effectively?

411
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,088
Why not just lock them all up?

412
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,758
Lock up all the idiots and you let the cows print money?

413
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,595
What? There are cows there?

414
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,850
The best solution is to win their trust

415
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,893
Let them understand
It is also beneficial for them to cooperate with us.

416
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:46,730
Give them appropriate rewards on this basis

417
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:48,940
Final note

418
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,318
Not only in the past, Rome, Mongolia, Britain, etc.

419
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,570
Commonly used by imperialist countries

420
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:56,448
There are also some that were adopted during the Japanese colonial rule.
Methods of ruling colonial people

421
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,784
Simply put, it's about creating division, right?

422
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:01,536
That's right

423
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,580
To stir up internal hostility

424
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:04,497
(Divide and conquer)

425
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:05,749
Make them forget about the real enemy

426
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,709
But this method is not recommended

427
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:09,210
This is only a last resort

428
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,838
We should treat the hostages as best as possible.

429
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,256
Adopt humane management

430
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,634
Try to create a cooperative atmosphere, right?

431
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,344
This is what the professor said

432
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:18,845
How am I dehumanizing?

433
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:20,805
Just divided into north and south

434
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,475
Hasn’t it been like this for more than 70 years?

435
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:25,810
How about asking them to supervise each other?

436
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,937
You might as well start a fight between the two sides.

437
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,024
This in turn may encourage them to unite with each other.

438
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,777
For example, North Korean hostages do not want to be punished.

439
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,279
May help cover up South Korean hostage mistakes

440
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,324
Although unlikely

441
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:47,957
You put the one in the north
It's fun to copy it here and play with it, right?

442
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:51,544
I just think the subtle tension is good for us.

443
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,881
Just like the air current between us

444
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:01,137
Want to kill the chicken to scare the monkey
Punishing the director alone is enough.

445
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,555
How to punish him? Let him starve?

446
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,265
Do you think being hungry can change a person for the better?

447
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,433
You know this very well, don't you?

448
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,647
Don't be confused. This is not a shelter.

449
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,358
All I did was awaken their subconscious

450
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,735
The basic position on hostages has not changed

451
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,238
Win trust and humane management

452
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:20,573
As the professor said
There won't be any problems if we do this, right?

453
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:23,118
I really hope so

454
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,270
Made such a low-level mistake?

455
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:52,439
It's us who are punished for your mischief.

456
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,274
Hello, what's going on?

457
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:56,776
This guy screwed up the printing again

458
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,571
I really can't understand what people are saying.
You don't understand Seoul dialect, right?

459
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:00,488
Hello!

460
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:02,866
Don't sing to me

461
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,995
I didn't expect that before I closed my eyes
I encountered this mess again.

462
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:12,876
It might be a bit boring to stay here
At least it’s better than working, right?

463
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,883
-What are you looking at me for?
- Because you're handsome

464
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,885
Why is the robber so handsome?

465
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,386
Don't come

466
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:27,807
The camera is recording your every move
Don't think crookedly

467
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:30,602
Today's kids are really

468
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:40,403
Only sniper teams were deployed in a few places for surveillance.

469
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:42,197
Tell the rest to wait in the back.

470
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,114
So now

471
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,993
We just wait for the robber to raise his hands
Just surrender and it's over, right?

472
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:48,828
Just started weaving fishing nets

473
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,831
Is it reasonable to complain about not catching any fish?

474
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:01,341
Any clues?

475
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:03,968
No radio frequency detected

476
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,262
Not even a single communication device was found.

477
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,680
What about the surveillance camera footage inside?

478
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,683
All networks are closed

479
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,352
It seems to be cut off manually.

480
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:15,313
Could there be an IT expert among the robbers?

481
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:18,983
What base stations are there nearby?

482
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:22,529
Wireless communication company authorized by the Economic Cooperation Zone
Only the state-owned telecommunications company

483
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:23,530
So, through there

484
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:27,283
-Can you bring up all the communication signals around here?
-right

485
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:30,620
Notice

486
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,665
From this moment on

487
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,209
All personnel turn off their mobile phones and smart devices

488
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:38,670
Only intercom is used here.

489
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:08,366
Staff and reporters staying in surrounding buildings

490
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:09,409
(police)

491
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:11,160
Have them evacuate outside the base station radius

492
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:16,666
hello

493
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:19,085
Oh, that girl named Annie.

494
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:21,170
She actually said I was handsome

495
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:24,966
I said she had good taste.

496
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:33,224
Too arrogant

497
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,685
(Road blocked, vehicles prohibited from entering)

498
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:46,446
No matter how much preparation the so-called professor has done

499
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,782
How perfect is the plan?

500
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,576
over time

501
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,745
There will definitely be flaws

502
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,541
Or the hostage makes a sudden move

503
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,756
Either there are disagreements among the robbers

504
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:08,259
A tiny crack in the dam

505
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,929
As long as a drop of water leaks from there

506
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,723
No matter how large and strong the dam is,

507
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:15,308
Can collapse instantly

508
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,603
We will seize that unique opportunity

509
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:23,358
Let's talk

510
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,738
Don't you know that we are spying on each other now?

511
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:29,822
Why are you making things difficult for me?

512
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,076
There is actually a way to contact the police.

513
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:35,662
No, there was before
Is that the smartwatch we use to communicate secretly?

514
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,538
In the drawer of the director's office

515
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:38,957
Just get it in your hands

516
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,919
can tell the police that the robbers are printing money

517
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:45,421
This way the police won't sit idly by.

518
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,006
What else can I do now that I know?

519
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,634
Even if I break in, I can't tell who is who.

520
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,302
Aren’t I here this time?

521
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:53,596
Able to report the situation to the outside world

522
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,974
It can totally turn the situation around

523
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:56,891
So I said

524
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,268
Could you please get the smart watch?

525
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:01,604
What's the meaning?

526
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,941
Are you giving me the most dangerous task?

527
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,651
No, it's not like that.

528
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,572
Is this all for my sake?

529
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,992
No matter what
We need to find a way to resolve this situation, right?

530
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,952
As the Director of the Banknote Printing Bureau and as your man

531
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:18,204
I really reflected a lot

532
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:22,083
At this critical moment concerning life safety
I finally figured it out

533
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,877
I love you, you are the only one in my heart

534
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,296
I'll get a divorce if I can get out of here.

535
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,261
I don't believe it

536
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,680
Believe it or not, but if this continues we'll all die.

537
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,932
I'm thinking about everyone's safety.

538
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,809
You are the only one who can get the watch.

539
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,728
Why don't you give me a call?

540
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,479
-How to play?
- Hey there

541
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,773
What are you doing?

542
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,777
Nothing actually

543
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:52,655
She is pregnant

544
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:54,991
Sudden morning sickness

545
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,868
So I worry about her

546
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,122
Really?

547
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:10,256
-yes
-Can you give her a break?

548
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,092
I'm tired when I'm pregnant, so I might have a miscarriage.

549
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:15,470
Is this true?

550
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,181
Okay, follow me.

551
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,493
I don't have a cell phone to play with. I'm so bored.
You're here just in time

552
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:39,619
Sister, what’s your name?

553
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,665
Why do I belong to neither north nor south?
So you don't like me?

554
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,876
Does it matter where you're from?

555
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,087
We are all in the same situation and need to monitor each other

556
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,338
They're really monitoring me. How funny!

557
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,466
It's simply unreasonable

558
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,469
You haven't experienced it, so of course you don't understand

559
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,262
Some things are on their own

560
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:02,892
Only then did I realize that I was helpless

561
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:06,562
Is there anyone guarding the director's office over there?

562
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:08,523
have

563
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,191
This place is also under surveillance.

564
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:12,819
What's wrong?

565
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,368
You are hiding something

566
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:25,123
What is it? Maybe I can help.

567
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:27,792
nothing

568
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,255
What's wrong? Are you afraid that I'll tell on you?

569
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:35,842
Don't you believe me?

570
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,102
What are you doing?

571
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:47,019
Don't do this

572
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:48,938
What's wrong?

573
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:54,068
that

574
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:57,697
I have my period and need to go to the bathroom

575
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,574
Will it take long?

576
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:01,576
Just a moment

577
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,539
Just sit there and don't move.

578
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,540
Restricted Access Card

579
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:06,182
Are you pervert?

580
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,684
No

581
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,229
Have you been sitting for too long?

582
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,856
Please, there must be a please

583
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:30,873
let's go

584
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:39,799
Do you have a girlfriend?

585
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:43,719
So what if not?

586
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:12,290
Don't move or I'll shoot.

587
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,835
Base station detected signal

588
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,966
One of the hostages should have opened the channel

589
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,971
Hello, this is the 112 emergency center.

590
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,391
Hello…

591
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,022
what are you doing here?

592
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,577
Hands up

593
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,828
Raise your hands now!

594
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,081
You try shooting

595
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:56,625
Shoot!

596
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,003
Raise your hands now!

597
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,254
Just shoot!

598
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:02,673
Come and shoot!

599
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:09,889
Damn it

600
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,225
Hey, get down

601
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:15,644
Get down!

602
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,358
Don't blame yourself too much.

603
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:24,111
I often forget to pull the bolt and get scolded by Tokyo

604
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:27,948
actually

605
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,452
I'm so hungry.

606
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,289
Looking for something to eat

607
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,583
Oh yeah

608
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:38,793
You don't say

609
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:42,129
I really don't know what to eat when you're pregnant.

610
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,465
See food

611
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,343
I just grabbed a few of them.

612
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:54,433
For the fetus, the mother's health is the most important thing now

613
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:57,103
No matter how hard it is, just bear with eating these.

614
00:39:58,521 --> 00:39:59,939
Which one do you want to eat?

615
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,694
-Have a glass of milk
-OK

616
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,698
Oh wait

617
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:12,284
The milk is a little cold. I'll heat it up for you.

618
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:24,088
But this...

619
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:29,760
What's wrong?

620
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:31,470
Where do you feel uncomfortable?

621
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:47,653
That bastard

622
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,323
Did he ever hit you?

623
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:57,037
Am I right? That bastard

624
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,790
You can tell at a glance that he's a scumbag

625
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:05,421
no

626
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,965
In fact, he is married

627
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:22,438
So you guys are having an affair?

628
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:26,400
Got it and understood

629
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,651
What about your children?

630
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,030
Did he ask you to have an abortion?

631
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:38,454
I really want that person's child.

632
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:40,998
But he doesn't seem to think so.

633
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:44,084
This is total scumbag.

634
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,504
Damn, no conscience.

635
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:48,714
-What are you doing here?
-nothing

636
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,134
Come with me

637
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:54,512
You drink this.

638
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:58,807
That guy is really

639
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,776
Did you find out who called the police number?

640
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:12,196
In the name of Zhao Yingmin, Director of the Banknote Printing Bureau
Activated smart watch

641
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:13,822
It's a hostage indeed.

642
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,283
But why did it hang up immediately?

643
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,744
Maybe the supervision was too strict or it was discovered.

644
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:24,750
I can find out why.

645
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:43,227
Officer Xuan Yuzhen is really good at playing hard to get

646
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,312
Are you waiting for my call?

647
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:46,730
Okay then

648
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:50,609
Are you ready to talk about your orgasms?

649
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:59,743
You asked me about my most recent experience
When is the orgasm?

650
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:01,495
That's right

651
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:03,122
perhaps

652
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,291
Two months ago?

653
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:08,294
Who is the target?

654
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,713
It was the first person I met that day.

655
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:14,049
One night stand?

656
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:16,385
About the same

657
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,055
Is he living well?

658
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,059
It should be said that it fits well.

659
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:38,032
Are you satisfied now?

660
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:41,869
- I also want to ask you something.
-Can

661
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:44,455
What happened to the hostages’ cell phones?

662
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,582
Have all been confiscated and shut down?

663
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:48,000
Do you know it well?

664
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:50,628
Can you see what's going on here?

665
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:54,423
According to the workflow
We have to do a communications test

666
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:55,758
how?

667
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:59,428
Are you afraid that any hostage might contact you?

668
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:02,014
No matter who or through what channel

669
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:04,391
The possibility of sending out a distress call cannot be ruled out

670
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,268
It was our job to help.

671
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:08,812
There will be no such thing

672
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:12,107
This is not a five-star hotel.

673
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:14,485
But it's okay to live there

674
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:17,696
That's good

675
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:20,908
So many hostages

676
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,410
If you need anything, just let me know.

677
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:26,872
Obviously not for free
But let me think about it and I'll contact you again

678
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:33,879
It seems that the robbers were not aware that someone contacted us.

679
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:34,963
Since the hostage situation

680
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:37,007
This may be the first time that the situation is favorable to us.

681
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:38,884
The problem is

682
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,512
When you turn on the other side

683
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:44,598
How can we communicate without being monitored?

684
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,141
Is there any good solution?

685
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:47,643
It is estimated that it is difficult to make a call

686
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:50,479
It's better to tell the police in writing.
and send a link

687
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,606
One click will implant a backdoor and allow hacking

688
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,192
No need to make calls
Can you hear the sound over there too?

689
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:57,486
Depending on the device, you may also see images

690
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,114
- You are ready
-yes

691
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:12,835
The next round of work team changes

692
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:25,264
Hello!

693
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:30,728
-Are you crazy?
-ah?

694
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,771
He actually asked his woman to do that kind of thing?

695
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:35,566
Are you still a man?

696
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:36,483
No that...

697
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:38,402
That's it

698
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:44,241
You are responsible for getting someone pregnant, you bastard.

699
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:48,871
That's right.

700
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:51,832
But actually...

701
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,375
How dare you chew your tongue?

702
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,127
Cut off your tongue

703
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:56,754
Don't do this

704
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:00,090
After knowing what kind of person he is, I have given up on him.

705
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,930
You're not fit to be a parent.

706
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:09,183
Denver

707
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:11,226
Um

708
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:13,187
past

709
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:17,691
What are you just sitting there watching?

710
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:19,693
Why don’t you get up quickly?

711
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:26,200
Move on, you bastard!

712
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:47,554
On the surface, there seems to be no problem

713
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,015
But somehow

714
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:53,101
From Officer Xuan's calm tone
The professor vaguely sensed something was wrong

715
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,188
This may mean that she has to make the next crucial move.

716
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:10,536
-exist
-What about Berlin?

717
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,454
What happened when he was inspecting?

718
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:14,665
-Nothing happened?
-What's up?

719
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:17,543
Speaking of

720
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:20,045
A big thing happened.

721
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:23,841
What's up?

722
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:25,926
Does it count as starting to feel bored?

723
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:42,901
Are you busy?

724
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:49,116
(Occupy the Banknote Printing Bureau for 28 hours)

725
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:59,418
It seems that hacking into the system will take some time.

726
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:01,920
About two hours?

727
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:09,261
I understand that I've been in a state of tension.

728
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,848
Captain, why don't you go out and have a meal?

729
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:15,934
From dawn till now
Captain, you just didn't eat a meal, right?

730
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,606
Go faster!

731
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:23,859
Are you going to try to use your evil ideas on me again?

732
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:27,237
No, I really have a stomachache.

733
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,908
Damn, you have too much shit and piss

734
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,286
Go and pull it back quickly

735
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:36,997
good

736
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,396
- There's a signal again.
-What?

737
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,106
-Fast receiving
-yes

738
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,946
I repeat: two bowls of sweet and sour pork, ten bowls of noodles with soybean paste

739
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:11,031
Ten bowls of seafood noodles equal one bowl of three-fresh seafood noodles, right?

740
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:13,033
The director doesn't eat spicy food

741
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:14,910
You know, the three-fresh seafood noodles should not be too spicy?

742
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,832
- The director has ordered takeout.
-oh

743
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,960
Anyway, you said it would take some time, right?

744
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,087
You still have to eat, right?

745
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:28,340
It is said that in North Korea
There's no noodles with soybean paste to eat, right?

746
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:30,133
Your faces are all good.

747
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:39,101
What is this for?

748
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:40,936
- The door is open, pull your
-What?

749
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:44,564
Everything you do is suspicious.

750
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:48,110
I said no matter how much I dislike it

751
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:50,112
Treating me in such an inhumane way

752
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:52,948
As a hostage representative, I also have something to say.

753
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:54,741
You're the only one who talks too much

754
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:57,536
It seems you are not in a hurry to go up

755
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:23,937
(119 Emergency Team)

756
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:29,818
Are you busy?

757
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:35,991
Come over if you have time.
At least take a sandwich.

758
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,286
What

759
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,538
I thought you had made the sandwiches.

760
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:44,082
I thought you would take a long time to come as usual.

761
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:45,834
Play hard to get with me

762
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:53,300
By the way, you suddenly became busy
Did something big happen?

763
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:55,635
Not quite the opposite

764
00:50:58,096 --> 00:51:00,557
Maybe I'll make some achievements.

765
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:04,895
What kind of grades?

766
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:07,230
That

767
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:09,900
Sorry, I cannot disclose the content of my work.

768
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:14,488
-Okay, it's done.
- It looks delicious.

769
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:20,452
You can take it

770
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:33,507
Um, are you okay?

771
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:36,134
The equipment is a bit special and it took some time.

772
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:39,054
Now
Just wait for the smart watch over there to turn on again?

773
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:40,347
Once powered on

774
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,474
You will see the text messages we sent.
Then click on the link

775
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:44,476
You can start installing hacking tools and restart

776
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:47,562
-How long does it take to hack into it?
- 30 seconds is enough

777
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,856
Models with a camera
So you can still see the image

778
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:52,442
knew

779
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:00,367
Is the call over?

780
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,035
I have to go back

781
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,289
I know you are busy

782
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,292
I am satisfied just to see your face for a moment

783
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:12,796
Pack for you?

784
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:15,924
Why did you tap my phone?

785
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:21,555
Yuzhen that...

786
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:24,266
You need to explain it well.

787
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:37,237
Yuzhen

788
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:42,284
I know you don't take this relationship seriously.

789
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:45,954
But I seem

790
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:48,498
I'm becoming more and more attracted to you

791
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:58,800
Want to get closer

792
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,595
But no progress can be seen

793
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:04,181
I'm starting to wonder if you have another man.

794
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,808
Am I too cowardly?

795
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,145
I know it too

796
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:13,481
But for me, this is a long-lost feeling.

797
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:16,985
Want to relax and enjoy

798
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:20,447
But I just can't relax

799
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:30,957
I seem to be overly sensitive because of my work

800
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:37,005
sorry

801
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,008
besides

802
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,554
I don't have any other man

803
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:46,765
It's not that I've lost interest in you, Sunho.

804
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:51,603
My current situation is not suitable for a romantic relationship

805
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:53,563
I said Yuzhen

806
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:56,149
I'm leaving

807
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:28,390
Didn't anything happen?

808
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:30,725
How come the professor also asked the same question?

809
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:31,726
You also see it

810
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:38,233
I feel something is not right

811
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:54,040
Um, what's up, professor?

812
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:57,377
Listen to me
Some of the hostages were carrying smart watches

813
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,254
Trying to contact the police

814
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:03,425
Got it, I'll handle it.

815
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:09,889
Hey, what's up?

816
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:14,227
Is it time for the shift change so soon?

817
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:17,856
Berlin ordered all hostages to be gathered

818
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:18,940
What are you doing?

819
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:21,985
It's damn busy here.

820
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:24,988
He seems to be very happy playing the captain, right?

821
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:27,949
Dad, you take a rest. I'll take the hostages over.

822
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:29,367
knew

823
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:32,287
Come over here and walk this way

824
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:34,664
- Come and follow me
- Come and follow me

825
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:03,234
-What about Tokyo?
- In Nairobi

826
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:05,028
The printing press cannot stop

827
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,409
Are you all gathered together?

828
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:20,001
What about me

829
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:22,379
When I was so young

830
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:24,839
Doing collective labor in the shelter

831
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:27,717
A group of five cannot complete the day's portion

832
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:30,512
I'm going to be hungry and beaten

833
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:32,972
But there are tools

834
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,516
The hoe given is too old

835
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:38,770
One of the people in a group
I accidentally broke the hoe.

836
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:40,855
Guess what?

837
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:45,360
The remaining four people have to work hard to complete their share.

838
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:48,696
wrong

839
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,407
The guy who broke the hoe

840
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:53,451
Go to another group and steal a hoe

841
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:55,995
If you're lucky enough to steal it

842
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,706
The other group that was stolen will be punished.

843
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:00,542
But once the truth is discovered

844
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:04,379
Let's imagine the result.

845
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:14,514
- You covered it.
-Are you crazy?

846
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:16,558
- If found...
- I have a bad feeling

847
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:18,685
If I don't do it now, I guess I won't have another chance.

848
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,019

849
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:23,189
(Joint Counterattack Team)

We can eavesdrop on what is going on inside)

851
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:28,278

Restart successful

854
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:40,957
Is there any sound?

855
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:43,668
Zhao Yingmin took a step forward

856
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:47,464
-What?
- Stand up

857
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,174
You as the Director

858
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:50,967
The hostages have work to do.

859
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:53,011
Come out

860
00:58:15,783 --> 00:58:17,243
No reason...

861
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:19,537
Among the hostages

862
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:23,249
Someone broke their promise to us.
Trying to contact the outside world

863
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:27,712
Comrade is the director

864
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:31,674
You are responsible for finding the guy who hid the communication device.

865
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:51,486
What's going on?

866
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:53,154
-Unclear
-Why can't I see the picture?

867
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:55,073
The connection is fine. The watch must be hidden somewhere.

868
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:57,116
I really tried

869
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,996
I really want to treat my comrades well.

870
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,831
But I don't know who among the comrades

871
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:06,543
Did something that endangered all of us.

872
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:08,503
Honest and law-abiding comrades

873
00:59:08,586 --> 00:59:10,296
So there will be blood.

874
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:12,298
Is this really beneficial to everyone?

875
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:24,978
Comrade Director, you are not doing it right.

876
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:28,648
It should be more standardized like this

877
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:50,628
What's that sound?

878
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:08,313
Next

879
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:33,713
(No signal)

880
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:34,672
No signal

881
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:36,549
It seems like if they are discovered, will they let the hostages go?

882
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:37,759
The moment the hostages were taken

883
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:39,844
That guy also understood that the negotiation was over.

884
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:41,554
This can't go on.

885
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:44,140
Check personal safety immediately
And take appropriate measures...

886
01:00:44,223 --> 01:00:45,308
The professor called.

887
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:53,441
Have you thought it through?

888
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:55,902
Supplies that the hostages need, etc.

889
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:58,863
You should know why I called you.

890
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:03,451
Oh? What happened?

891
01:01:04,118 --> 01:01:04,952
Smartwatch

892
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:09,540
Negotiations require mutual trust
You guys can't negotiate with me if you do this.

893
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:13,002
I said that communication testing is a process requirement.

894
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:16,255
It's normal for hostages to be afraid of sudden actions.

895
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:18,383
All understand

896
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:20,968
What is something that people in desperate situations dare not do?

897
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:23,137
But we can also go to extremes.

898
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:27,392
Because if something happens to the hostage

899
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:29,560
Negotiation is almost impossible

900
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:31,688
I should be the one to say this.

901
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:33,564
This time I don't care

902
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:36,109
But remember

903
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:38,778
There won't be a next time

904
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:41,781
knew

905
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,245
Come and have a look

906
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:52,166
This is the video I took before the watch was smashed

907
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:38,421
Execute this woman

908
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:42,633
What?

909
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:47,638
-What did you say?
- That's too much of a joke...

910
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:49,015
This is killing the chicken to scare the monkeys

911
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:51,851
Hey, have you forgotten what the professor said?

912
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:53,686
This is just an ideal, but this is reality!

913
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:58,608
The only one that can completely
What controls people is fear

914
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:06,657
You are such a person

915
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:09,327
This is too much anyway.

916
01:03:10,077 --> 01:03:12,246
You guys should keep a close eye on that woman from the beginning.

917
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:14,248
Things wouldn't have come to this.

918
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:17,543
No problem, right? Who of you will do it?

919
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:21,005
Damn

920
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:23,508
Hey, fuck

921
01:03:24,425 --> 01:03:25,593
This woman is pregnant

922
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:29,639
Denver

923
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:31,599
Otherwise, you can do it.

924
01:03:36,395 --> 01:03:39,273
You really can't communicate.

925
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:40,358
Come over here

926
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,568
Come over here for a moment

927
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:49,283
The hostages must be terrified by this.

928
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:51,327
How do you shoot a pregnant woman?

929
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:52,286
I told you

930
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:54,997
What are the consequences of being easily influenced by emotions?

931
01:03:56,123 --> 01:03:56,958
Listen

932
01:03:58,543 --> 01:04:00,253
The woman is pregnant

933
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:02,255
Do you really believe it?

934
01:04:54,515 --> 01:04:55,433
Never mind the phone

935
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:00,104
We haven't finished here yet.

936
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:14,744
I see, this thing is quite expensive.

937
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:17,872
Is this that woman's?

938
01:05:17,955 --> 01:05:19,624
If it wasn't her

939
01:05:20,499 --> 01:05:23,085
But if someone instructed him to do so, wouldn't that be unfair?

940
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:32,386
It was the director who ordered it, not that woman's fault.

941
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:34,513
It's not that I don't know about this at all!

942
01:05:35,973 --> 01:05:37,850
Really? But I heard

943
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:39,936
That woman is pregnant with your child?

944
01:05:45,149 --> 01:05:46,609
Damn it!

945
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:01,082
Berlin said something strange

946
01:06:01,165 --> 01:06:03,459
You must be honest

947
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:07,880
Say you are pregnant

948
01:06:10,424 --> 01:06:11,258
Is it true?

949
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,482
No, I said money is good.

950
01:06:26,565 --> 01:06:29,360
Why negotiate for months over a pattern design?

951
01:06:29,443 --> 01:06:32,071
But I am still quite satisfied with the new currency

952
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:33,322
Something big happened!

953
01:06:37,201 --> 01:06:38,786
They're all lies.

954
01:06:38,869 --> 01:06:40,913
There was no pregnancy from the beginning.

955
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:43,874
I understand.
Comrade has nothing to do with this matter, right?

956
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:46,627
Spare me

957
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:48,796
I have two children

958
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:53,968
I really can't die. I really can't die.

959
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:55,636
All right

960
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,805
Having said that, I can only believe it

961
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:01,517
But the poor woman had to die.

962
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:05,229
The answer is whether it is true!

963
01:07:08,899 --> 01:07:10,818
Damn it!

964
01:07:23,914 --> 01:07:24,749
you

965
01:07:25,666 --> 01:07:28,085
Are you treating me as a pawn?

966
01:07:32,673 --> 01:07:36,218
I'm nice to you, but you think I'm making fun of you, right?

967
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:38,804
Damn it, right?

968
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:45,144
Is that right!

969
01:07:59,366 --> 01:08:01,869
Don't blame me for being rude.

970
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:36,612
I know it's you who did it

971
01:08:36,695 --> 01:08:40,324
But I won't punish you

972
01:08:41,033 --> 01:08:43,828
Reason? This is my punishment for you.

973
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:58,731
