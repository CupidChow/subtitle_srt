00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:09,926
NETFLIX SERIES

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,555
The alleged acts of violence
There were no witnesses

3
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:18,143
I can't give my daughter custody.
It is only natural to hand it over to the father who beats his wife

4
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:20,186
But if the beating is not true

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,731
Who will be responsible for my daughter's future?
It's self-explanatory.

6
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:23,773
I'm done

7
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:25,859
Officer Xuan Yuzhen

8
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:29,112
Whether at the scene of the case
Or within your own family

9
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:31,489
Both sides are experiencing a war that cannot be compromised.

10
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,491
We request additional evidence

11
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:36,995
This is a witness to the defendant's violence
Ms. Park Pil-soon's personal statement

12
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,204
Good recognition evidence

13
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,674
The declarant is the plaintiff's mother

14
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,843
The credibility of this statement is highly questionable.

15
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,219
You can judge by looking at the content

16
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,056
The eyewitness account is too specific to be a fabrication.

17
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,267
It is better to listen to the testimony directly

18
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,479
Admit her as a witness at the next trial

19
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:06,941
The problem isn't her opponent.
Only perpetrators of domestic violence

20
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,693
He is also a politician who is good at political tactics.

21
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:09,903
-Here we go
- It's out

22
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:12,906
And he is a candidate who is expected to be elected in the next general election.

23
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:14,282
Mr. Congressman, you personally promoted

24
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:17,619
The third North-South Economic Cooperation Summit is about to be held

25
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:20,163
After the two countries finally signed the agreement

26
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,624
I heard you are about to announce

27
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:26,336
Participate in the general election of a unity government

28
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:30,548
This summit will determine the future of our Korean Peninsula

29
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:34,219
So please don't
On par with my personal political career

30
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,888
Now that you've mentioned your personal side

31
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,973
What about the ongoing custody litigation?

32
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,309
It's because of Mr. Congressman's domestic violence.
Is this statement true?

33
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,738
It's all my fault.

34
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:56,074
How much resentment did I cause my wife to harbor?

35
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:59,452
She would make up this
Absurd lies to frame me?

36
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,537
But I am Kim Sang-wan

37
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,748
Even if he is not a perfect husband for her

38
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,208
I swear

39
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,043
I'm not a bad father.

40
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,130
The current situation makes me sad and heartbroken
for me

41
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,965
Compared to reputation as a politician

42
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,717
I want to be a better father...

43
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:19,097
So those who want to do great things must meet a good woman.

44
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,349
He said Captain Xuan was lying?

45
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,184
No way?

46
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:26,062
Isn't this what you want in the end?

47
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,483
Domestic violence at the heart of divorce proceedings
Is this true?

48
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,152
Are you saying that what your wife said is not true?

49
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,029
Your wife is a police officer but did she lie?

50
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,663
Yeah, daughter

51
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,499
Why did you think of calling mom at this time?

52
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,211
Mom and grandma are missing

53
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:51,838
What?

54
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:56,426
If we can't find it after driving a few more times, we'll go to the police station.

55
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,844
Mom's side

56
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,311
-mom
-Grandma

57
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,228
mom

58
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,772
Yuzhen

59
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,821
Mom, what are you doing here?

60
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,489
Why don’t you bring your cell phone with you when you go out?

61
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,368
I

62
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:24,871
Can't remember

63
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,084
Let's go to the hospital

64
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,920
Is there any disease that cannot be cured nowadays?

65
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,671
Hey, it's okay

66
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,049
No big deal

67
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,719
-never mind
-Mom, why did you just let it go?

68
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,388
What if her dad finds out?

69
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,353
Hold on till the next trial.

70
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:55,193
My daughter is worried that she will live apart from me.

71
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,490
My mother is not feeling well in front of them.
I can't show weakness.

72
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,624
They all depend on me.

73
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,837
I didn't know your mother was ill.

74
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,298
What is the disease?

75
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,637
Just old.

76
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,323
Please respond to Park Cheol-woo

77
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:43,908
Park Cheol Woo!

78
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,289
Was it attacked?

79
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,249
What exactly is the content of the communication?

80
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:54,252
The result of Morse code decryption is "Infiltration Successful"

81
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,716
If there is any more communication, please report it immediately.

82
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,386
The Security Department judges the current situation

83
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,389
We can't just sit there and do nothing anymore

84
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,224
Captain Che Wuhe, what do you think?

85
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,227
I don't want to make excuses

86
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,523
But I have something important to report to you.

87
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,236
Comrade Platoon Leader

88
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,905
Let's go first. We'll all die if we continue like this.

89
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,365
Go fast

90
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,431
Among my direct reports
The most responsible person

91
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,807
The body is also healthy

92
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,725
Have you reported to the confrontation team?

93
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,811
Before I report
Didn't you call me here?

94
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,896
You better shut up.

95
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:23,067
so far
Every time we act, we come to a halt

96
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,235
Don’t you think it’s strange?

97
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,821
There must be something wrong with the South Koreans.

98
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,448
In particular

99
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,702
Xuan Yuzhen looks like a traitor

100
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,912
Officer Xuan Yuzhen cannot be a traitor

101
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,084
sorry

102
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,963
Sorry, this is an occupational disease.

103
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,173
fine

104
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,133
this

105
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,969
This is the information our reconnaissance team found.

106
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,221
A few months before the incident

107
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,348
The robbers hacked

108
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,684
South Korean police who may be involved in this case

109
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,937
and revealed their dirty laundry to the media

110
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:03,399
Officer Xuan was involved in the Banknote Printing Bureau case

111
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,318
The robbers planned it all.

112
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:11,073
We cannot be sure
The exact relationship between the robber and Xuan Yuzhen

113
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,001
Important

114
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:24,462
The robbers are taking advantage of Xuan Yuzhen

115
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,633
Doesn't this mean that the opposing team shouldn't be notified immediately?

116
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:32,220
Dealing with Xuan Yuzhen now will alert the robbers

117
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:35,139
And the summit is imminent and there is not much time left.

118
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,641
The leader above

119
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:39,268
Everyone wants to attend the summit in a relaxed mood

120
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:43,814
So, let's keep dragging it out.
Comrade Captain, you have to be mentally prepared.

121
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:49,695
You need to have your undercover agent resolve this matter as quickly as possible.

122
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,573
What you mean is
We have to do it at all costs, right?

123
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:02,083
For the reunification of the motherland
What price did we pay?

124
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,209
Don't you forget

125
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,182
What's this?

126
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:01,809
storehouse

127
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,314
Aren’t you hungry?

128
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,569
What should I cook for you?

129
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,356
How come the boy’s fingers are so beautiful?

130
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:37,655
If there is no special situation, please take a rest.

131
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,283
Good to know

132
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:55,840
Here comes the radio

133
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:59,009
Why are you so late? Let's go.

134
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,721
-Thank you for your hard work.
-yes

135
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,520
Can Park Cheol-woo hear me?

136
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,815
Yes, but I can't talk for a long time.

137
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:13,858
knew

138
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,485
The Party ordered to understand the current situation as soon as possible

139
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,405
Find the robber leader and kill him quickly

140
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,949
-Do you mean professor?
-Yes.

141
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,660
Without him the remaining robbers
Just a bunch of rabble

142
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,746
You get rid of the professor in there.

143
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,622
In the meantime, we'll deal with the remaining robbers.

144
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,875
What about the hostages?

145
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,670
Get rid of the professor

146
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,922
Is your first priority

147
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:40,593
As for the inevitable losses
We can only bear

148
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,730
We currently suspect that there are spies from the robbers in the confrontation team.

149
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,815
Therefore, this action must be carried out in secret

150
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,275
At that time

151
00:12:56,358 --> 00:13:00,404
The seeds of failure that could destroy the professor's plan

152
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,156
It is quietly spreading inside and outside the Banknote Printing Bureau

153
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,450
In the next twelve hours

154
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,827
We must kill or arrest all the robbers.

155
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:10,664
One of the seeds spread in the professor's heart

156
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:11,999
That's guilt.

157
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,568
Why are you sweating so much?

158
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,488
I have a terminal illness

159
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:45,366
Isn't it?

160
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:46,951
Rio

161
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,745
Inside the director's desk over there

162
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,997
I hid a box of medicine.

163
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,250
Can you bring it over?

164
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,629
Don't play tricks

165
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,131
Just eat your meal.

166
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,425
Don't you guys miss me?

167
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,677
Ouch

168
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,888
They

169
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,724
I think everyone is very happy now that we have a new leader.

170
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,936
Thanks to Tokyo, everything is finally back to normal now.

171
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,356
Can everything go as you expected?

172
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,571
Hey Berlin Comrade

173
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:27,575
This change

174
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,494
You have to accept it.

175
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:14,705
The reason why you are all gathered here...

176
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,422
Can you tell me?

177
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:24,965
knew

178
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:33,307
There is good news and bad news
Which one do you want to hear first?

179
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:36,644
Look at this atmosphere

180
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,234
Dear troublemaker friend, which one do you want to listen to first?

181
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,321
Good news? Bad news?

182
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:48,948
You said bad news

183
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,241
Could it be that someone died again?

184
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,037
What? What do you take us for?

185
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,666
You really don't want to live anymore?

186
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,669
No, it's not like that. I have a wound here and it hurts.

187
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:08,175
Then I'll start with the bad news.

188
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,221
Berlin is out for now

189
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:18,102
So what’s the good news?

190
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:19,937
You will know when you see it

191
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,525
Can you walk?

192
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:25,985
Be careful here

193
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:28,445
How could that be?

194
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,585
Goodness

195
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,482
Start living here now

196
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:09,153
We only control the entrance and exit
So you can use the restroom at will

197
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,904
The injured will be treated separately

198
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,198
The rest of the people can sleep separately, male and female

199
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,410
It’s better than sleeping in the hall, right?

200
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,539
Are the wounded accommodated here?

201
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,709
Come on, walk slower

202
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,046
- I'm telling the truth
-Slower

203
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,506
We really don't mean to hurt you.

204
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:31,341
Be careful

205
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,761
Please forget the bad memories of Berlin

206
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,513
-Hope to establish cooperative relationship
-Are you okay?

207
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,891
No complaints from everyone, right?

208
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,020
No complaints, right?

209
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,774
The good working group is about to start working

210
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,525
Except for the wounded

211
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,695
Before your shift
The rest of the staff can have a good rest here.

212
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:52,613
Is that ok?

213
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,620
Hey Nairobi you are good at management

214
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,498
besides

215
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:06,126
Tokyo is really much better than Berlin, right?

216
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,754
From now on, I intend to be loyal to Tokyo

217
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:09,755
Captain Tokyo

218
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:11,799
Must win!

219
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,902
I know everyone had a rough night.

220
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,196
Actions failed again and again

221
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,907
This has led to widespread criticism and pressure

222
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,659
But think about the people who are locked up.

223
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,328
We can't be so unmotivated.

224
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,791
“Police from the north and south work together

225
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:48,252
Dozens of hostages were safely rescued.”

226
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:52,506
Before seeing this sentence in the news
Let's all work harder.

227
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:54,299
-yes
-good

228
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,095
Is there anything special?

229
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,558
You looked much more energetic overnight.

230
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,103
You should have had a good rest, right?

231
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,230
You rested at home yesterday.

232
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:12,067
Or did you meet that gentleman?

233
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,325
Why does it sound like an interrogation?

234
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,244
Do I need to answer?

235
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,831
I'm sorry if my words made you uncomfortable.

236
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,293
That's right

237
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,962
It's been a long time since I had such a hot night.

238
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,548
Do you want to hear more details?

239
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,262
Enough of the nonsense.

240
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,472
Prepare to connect

241
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:43,599
Good to know

242
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:08,582
Good morning

243
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:10,918
Have you eaten?

244
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:15,881
I've eaten here and the chef's skills are very good

245
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,966
What did you have for breakfast?

246
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,722
sandwich

247
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,226
first

248
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:32,022
Thank you for assisting the Chief of Emergency

249
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:35,984
The idea of changing masks is quite novel.

250
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,030
Do you think it’s a good idea to change your mood?

251
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,824
So thoroughly prepared

252
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,702
You don't just want to come out, do you?

253
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,871
Even if I want to go out, you won't cooperate.

254
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,123
How was the food?

255
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,834
Are you starting to run out of ingredients now?

256
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:56,255
Yes, reduce the hostages' meals.
I should be able to survive for a few more days.

257
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,090
But I don't want to do that

258
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:00,676
I can help you with this part.

259
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,469
Surely it’s not free?

260
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:06,765
Ask him for Annie

261
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,937
Just take it as a goodwill gesture.

262
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:15,691
As a condition, promise me not to harm the hostages.

263
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,776
Humanize them

264
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,487
I promise

265
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,489
I'll call you when I'm ready.

266
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,703
How can it be rude of you to give him food for free?

267
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,038
Isn’t give and take the essence of negotiation?

268
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:31,790
Hand over Annie.

269
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,835
Don't the robbers know?
Would this make them more vulnerable to armed suppression?

270
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:37,754
Our little trick has been discovered by them twice

271
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,340
Just rebuild trust.

272
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,760
Contact the food supplier

273
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:44,678
Good to know

274
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,900
Berlin is the only problem

275
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,986
The rest don't seem to be bad people.

276
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:02,654
That's right

277
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:06,158
That Denver comrade
Didn’t you save our Agent Yin’s life?

278
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:09,202
The people who are injured by your quarrel cannot have a good rest!

279
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,290
Damn

280
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,877
Look, we are wounded.

281
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,837
Stop bothering us and go away.

282
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,297
Go away!

283
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,800
What a bunch of confused people.

284
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,224
Isn’t it easy?

285
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,394
I thought you were dead

286
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,898
I felt like it was all my fault and I was going crazy

287
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,901
So I'm not in my right mind

288
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:44,196
I wanted to shoot these bastards and that's why they did this.

289
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,699
I'm so glad, Meishan, you understand me, right?

290
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,037
Where's your necklace?

291
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:52,954
Oh, here it is

292
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:56,041
I thought they took it away.

293
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:57,959
This is quite expensive.

294
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:02,464
I want to take a break

295
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,382
Um?

296
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,385
Oh ok

297
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,723
What do you want to do?

298
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:12,682
Yoon Mi-sun

299
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,060
that

300
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:17,771
You need to change the bandage.

301
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,152
Why are you so slow?

302
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:27,697
Come like this

303
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,369
Come on, put it on.

304
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:35,914
When can I change the bandage?

305
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,666
Come on my shoulders

306
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:38,834
Be careful

307
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,172
What about me?

308
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,425
I am also a patient.

309
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:49,052
Didn’t the doctor cure you?

310
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:53,098
Come on, walk slower

311
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:08,196
Oh, sorry.

312
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:11,491
Did I hurt you? I'll be careful.

313
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,827
Wouldn't it be less painful this way?

314
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,625
that

315
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,211
Do you need a place to rest alone?

316
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:34,598
That guy stays with you.

317
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:37,726
Is it making you uncomfortable that I always disturb you?

318
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,687
If you weren't there at the beginning

319
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,856
There won't be any inconvenience.

320
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:46,276
-Um?
-Thank you for saving my life

321
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,945
But you are the robber and I am the hostage

322
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,833
I will change my own bandages in the future

323
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:07,756
Ouch, are you okay?

324
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,925
Oh, really

325
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,426
Ouch

326
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,431
Damn

327
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:26,858
Hello

328
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,528
That guy from Denver and Yoon Mi-seon went in there, right?

329
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,364
etc.

330
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:35,951
I don't think I've seen you?

331
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,537
You are not our employee

332
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:43,583
- I'm from school.
-School?

333
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,168
Isn’t there only one teacher?

334
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:47,671
Not like a student

335
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,881
-that…
-uncle!

336
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,716
Um

337
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:56,346
The toilet in the ladies' room seems to be broken. Can you come and take a look?

338
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,014
Do you know this person?

339
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,433
What's wrong with him being our school bus driver?

340
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:03,019
What are you still doing here? We are in a hurry.

341
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,360
Ouch

342
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,424
Aren't the police bad?

343
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,426
Sneak in wearing the same clothes

344
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,386
You don't have to thank me

345
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:39,264
You're Annie, right? Annie King, right?

346
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,016
So what’s the action plan?

347
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,893
I can help you like I just did.

348
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:48,481
Among the robbers there was a man called the Professor

349
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:49,399
Have you seen it?

350
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,109
professor?

351
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:53,570
I haven't seen

352
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:00,035
I know who might know him.

353
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:01,953
(Police Special Forces)

354
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,663
Avoid light meals

355
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,457
Please prepare more and the cooking time will be longer

356
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,169
Ingredients that require extra effort

357
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:10,086
good

358
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:14,799
(Dried vegetables, leeks, burdock, lettuce
Purple cabbage, red pepper…)

359
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:17,385
No sandwiches or anything like that.

360
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,764
All prepared according to Korean food ingredients
So there won't be those

361
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:21,681
good

362
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,530
We were totally fooled

363
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:38,948
The professor is not in there.

364
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,241
What?

365
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:43,244
Previously on the call
Didn’t I ask him what he ate?

366
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,455
He made a mistake

367
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,834
Why do robbers always stay one step ahead of us?

368
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,128
The answer is finally revealed

369
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,798
The professor was watching all this from outside the Bank of Printing

370
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:56,549
He was outside directing the robbers.

371
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:00,845
This tiny clue
Can we conclude that the professor is outside the Printing Bureau?

372
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,597
We control the entire communication network

373
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,349
How does the professor communicate with the robbers?

374
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,684
Don't they have a hacker too?

375
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,602
Although it is not clear

376
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,854
But maybe they know a way to evade tracking?

377
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:10,855
Even if you know

378
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,233
Unless we have their spies among us

379
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,362
How could they know everything about our actions?

380
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,239
I don't know about that.

381
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,242
Maybe the spy is very close to us.

382
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,953
The surveillance camera captured a car last time, right?

383
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,497
-How's the investigation going?
-Oh that?

384
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,833
Same trick as the car that drove into the Banknote Printing Bureau
It just disappeared midway.

385
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:32,168
Is there any way to check more carefully?

386
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,169
What happened to that car?

387
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,133
Where do you think the car went after it scouted the scene?

388
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,759
Back to the robbers?

389
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,512
Those robbers.
A week later, he broke into the Bank of Printing and robbed

390
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:44,389
Still holding hostages

391
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:46,182
But there is another one outside

392
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,435
If that was the leader of the robbers
What about professors?

393
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:51,146
We can't just rely on your assumptions to disperse resources

394
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,897
This will only cause disruption

395
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,525
But what if the professor is really outside?

396
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,903
Once we catch him, everything will be settled.

397
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,365
If you have to
Then send some South Korean police away.

398
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:03,700
How about having them track the vehicle?

399
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:06,327
We also need to prepare for emergencies on site

400
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,787
I think Captain Xuan is very good.

401
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:12,500
All right

402
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:17,088
Dongzhe, please confirm the vehicle's movement route again.

403
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,340
They may have abandoned the vehicle before committing the crime.

404
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,717
So check the junkyard too.

405
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,010
Yes I know

406
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:31,936
Please make way.

407
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:37,484
Hey, I saw it in a movie.

408
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:40,445
It seems that this kind of phone number can be reversed and searched

409
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:41,863
Will this thing work?

410
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:42,781
Hello

411
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,700
What do you think all these devices are used for?

412
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:49,162
Why do we connect fiber optic cables while smelling shit?

413
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:51,790
Can you understand me?

414
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:54,292
This kid is awesome.

415
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,170
Even your shit smells good, you stinky boy

416
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:58,087
Oh shit

417
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,218
But nothing else

418
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:06,304
Putting this thing in such a prominent place in the store

419
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,348
Shouldn't it be placed in a more secluded place?

420
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:12,268
The more you have to hide
The less you hide, the better the effect.

421
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:13,812
What's the meaning?

422
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,941
Anyway, if we do this now, we might get caught.

423
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:20,443
I will definitely pretend not to know you

424
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,445
Hey you pig head

425
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,447
It was the professor who told us to do this.

426
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:27,534
I mean don't say the professor was arrested.

427
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:30,954
Just knowing that the professor is not in the printing office
We're all done.

428
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,747
-What do you want?
-Oh, it's annoying

429
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:33,706
That's right.

430
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,166
If they found this

431
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:40,004
The police will know our actions.
It's not just about taking hostages.

432
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,423
Our plans will be disrupted.

433
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,346
Is there anything wrong with the escape hatch?

434
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:53,059
I hope halfway
Don't suddenly dig up some big rock or something...

435
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,481
Hey that silly boy

436
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,650
You still think you're a man, right?

437
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:09,826
Professors won't forbid love without reason

438
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:10,994
You have to get it right

439
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,037
That won't happen.

440
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:18,376
At your age
When our eyes meet, sparks fly

441
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:22,005
Especially in this life-threatening situation

442
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:25,717
I can't tell when sparks will fly.

443
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,469
You're speaking from experience, right?

444
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:32,807
Where is it

445
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,351
Anyway, you have to have a number in mind

446
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:45,028
Professor

447
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,407
What?

448
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,826
Cough fuck

449
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,737
What is this for!

450
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,948
He's a policeman and he wants to ask you some questions.

451
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,826
-police?
-Ms. Yoon Mi-seon?

452
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,536
You have more contact with robbers, right?

453
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,622
Have you ever seen someone called Professor?

454
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,166
professor?

455
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:41,918
I count to Trinity

456
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:45,630
If the professor knew about this, you would be in big trouble.

457
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:47,882
I've heard

458
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,801
Could you give more details?

459
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:54,514
Come and change shifts in the banknote printing group

460
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:57,684
Thank you for your hard work, old man and everyone on the previous shift.

461
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,227
Improved benefits for everyone

462
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,729
I hope everyone in the next shift will cooperate.
Happy money printing!

463
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:03,731
What are you standing there for? Go now.

464
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,737
Don't you need to rest?

465
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,741
The person who directs the work is the busiest, and the work will run smoothly

466
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,410
You don't know

467
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,544
-Everything is fine, right?
-certainly

468
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,048
-Thanks a lot
- Come on, let's go over there.

469
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:30,967
We will print 100 billion next

470
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:32,760
But one hundred billion

471
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,562
Hey Park Agent

472
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:44,397
Where did Yoon Mi-sun go again?

473
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,693
I don't know. I haven't seen her for a while.

474
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,320
Did you go change the bandage?

475
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,238
What?

476
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,301
asshole!

477
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,011
You mean Denver told Berlin

478
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,513
“It would be a big trouble if the professor knew”?

479
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,390
I heard it with my own ears.

480
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,975
Have you seen others?

481
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:24,979
What is this…

482
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:28,608
Anyway, this shows
Neither Berlin nor Denver are professors, right?

483
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:31,027
So there is a professor among the others?

484
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,696
Yoon Mi-sun! Are you here?

485
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,031
Are you the director?

486
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,995
Are you here? Open the door!

487
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,289
You still think I don't know?

488
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:45,124
Was he saving her so that they could get together?

489
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:52,548
-What are you doing?
-Hey, what the hell are you doing in there?

490
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,509
Keep your voice down.

491
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,843
Quietly? Everyone should hear it!

492
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,309
I saw a man.

493
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:05,603
-what to do?
-Why don't you open the door?

494
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,526
Calm down, I'm a police officer.

495
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:20,368
How can the police...

496
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:21,452
What's all the noise?

497
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:30,753
What's wrong?

498
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,130
that

499
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,924
There is something wrong with the bathroom door

500
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:37,510
No matter how urgent the situation was, why would you go into the women's restroom?

501
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:41,931
That's right.

502
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,273
Nothing

503
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:20,344
Better not to open that one.

504
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,345
Why?

505
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:24,307
The toilet is clogged and it smells bad

506
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:43,492
What are you doing here?

507
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,287
It's a bit weird here

508
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,830
The professor is looking for you. Go check it out.

509
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:48,998
Professor looking for me?

510
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:50,750
Did you do something wrong?

511
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:56,214
If you didn't do anything wrong
Why would the professor come to you directly?

512
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:57,715
Go check it out

513
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:25,785
Are you really a policeman?

514
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,079
Walk

515
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,041
-What are you doing in there?
- Like a fight

516
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,217
No big deal

517
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,010
Uncle Director, it's all your fault

518
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:04,699
car?

519
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,450
-Are you sure you abandoned the car?
-Of course

520
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:09,453
I also paid some money to ask them to deal with it quickly.

521
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,205
Did you witness the process?

522
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:16,877
That's not...

523
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:21,090
Not just you
Even my fingerprints and DNA are there.

524
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:22,508
I think they've dealt with it.

525
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:23,426
It should be fine...

526
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,262
Where is the scrap yard located?

527
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:30,308
The place near Imjingak is called Brothers Car City

528
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,350
Wait a moment

529
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,436
Where did you say it was?

530
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,395
Please look at this

531
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:40,234
This is one of the illegal second-hand car trading sites

532
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,986
It looks like the license plate has been changed.

533
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:44,405
But the color, model and year all match

534
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,157
That's right

535
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,828
With the economic cooperation between North and South and the opening of borders
North Koreans who have achieved financial freedom

536
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:54,332
The first thing you want to get is a symbol of success

537
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:55,541
South Korean sedan

538
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:59,503
Demand for cars in North Korea begins to surge

539
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:02,089
This also gave rise to many social parasites.

540
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:05,176
They brought in scrap cars from South Korea
Just do something with its appearance

541
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,177
Then sell it as a used car

542
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,181
Such a randomly modified scrap car

543
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:12,433
It's like a time bomb running on the street.

544
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,518
But no one cares

545
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,480
The seller doesn't care, and neither does the buyer.

546
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,649
It is the brother car city of Imjingak

547
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:24,904
I'll leave it to you here.

548
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:27,948
- Let's go
-yes

549
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,221
professor…

550
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,264
What do you plan to do once you find a professor?

551
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,183
Get rid of him

552
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:57,436
At the same time, external police forces will launch an armed crackdown

553
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:01,190
Launch a sweep?

554
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:03,818
Wait, where are the hostages?

555
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:05,945
Isn't it in danger?

556
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,739
Am I right? Even if you get rid of the leader,

557
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,825
The remaining robbers will not surrender.

558
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:12,910
Once the crackdown begins

559
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,621
It's gonna be chaos here.

560
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:18,416
Hey, even if it's a little dangerous
It's always good to end it quickly, right?

561
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,673
Then do it

562
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,134
We told everyone in advance to avoid it...

563
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,510
Really

564
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,762
Wouldn't that have been discovered by the robbers?

565
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,305
Don't make things worse

566
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,312
I have a way to find out who the professor is.

567
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:47,820
Bring over the dumbest of them all

568
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,864
Torture him to tell the truth

569
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,079
- Are you...
-how?

570
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,670
But he saved me...

571
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:07,465
Wasn't it him who shot you and injured you?

572
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:11,886
Hello Yoon Mi-sun

573
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,388
I think you haven't figured it out yet.

574
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,891
Now this is all fucking

575
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,642
Those robbers did it.

576
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:21,645
No matter how good that bastard is to you

577
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,606
Don't be confused.

578
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:47,171
Thank you

579
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:48,839
Saved my life

580
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:54,553
that…

581
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,307
What's the matter?

582
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,184
Someone asked me to pass this to you.

583
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:06,148
What's this?

584
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:19,745
(I have something to say
Please come to the exhibition hall warehouse for lunch)

585
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:26,293
this…

586
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:00,953
Beauty?

587
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:06,000
Meishan, are you not here?

588
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,153
How are you?

589
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,741
Oh yeah

590
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:40,034
Why don't you take more rest?

591
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:42,620
You just had surgery yesterday so it must still be painful, right?

592
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:45,414
The movement is not big, but it is tolerable

593
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,916
But am I still pushing myself too hard?

594
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,794
Sitting still

595
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:53,130
I'll think too much.
So I have to be busy with something.

596
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:56,759
that…

597
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:06,935
No, it's okay.

598
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:32,336
Fortunately, we can stay with the same partner, right?

599
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:33,253
Um?

600
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:36,173
- Yeah, kind of.
- I'm worried about you.

601
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,303
I'm not the only one worried.

602
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:42,221
Teachers too

603
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:14,461
Is Director Zhao up to something again?

604
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:17,589
I don't know

605
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:22,720
I'm just worried about the safety of the hostages.

606
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:25,097
Can I stop worrying?

607
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,946
Save your breath and be careful not to die

608
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:42,948
You bastard

609
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:46,994
There's a good show to watch

610
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,038
You'd better tell me where the professor is.

611
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:52,666
professor?

612
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,251
What do you want to see the professor for?

613
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:56,503
Want to slit his throat?

614
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:58,255
Say it quickly

615
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:00,841
Then you have to cut my throat

616
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:03,385
Because I am the professor

617
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,179
Damn it!

618
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,764
It's just nonsense.

619
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:12,186
Next time you will really die

620
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,065
Damn, so who is the professor you are looking for?

621
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:20,944
The leader who came out to negotiate

622
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,696
He calls himself a professor

623
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,407
None of the hostages had seen the professor.

624
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:26,492
Where is the professor?

625
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,162
No, it's wrong.

626
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:32,790
You should ask who is the professor?

627
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:35,542
I know neither you nor Berlin

628
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,920
Helsinki and Oslo are also out of the question.

629
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:40,255
Only four left

630
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:42,841
Is it one of them?

631
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:43,967
Neither is Moscow

632
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:46,011
Rio?

633
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:48,555
No, Rio is too young.

634
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:50,307
Nairobi?

635
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,391
Captain Tokyo

636
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:53,310
Must win!

637
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:59,191
Tokyo is Tokyo!

638
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:01,360
Nairobi just looks like the leader

639
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:03,403
But it was all Tokyo's fault, right?

640
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:06,740
It was Tokyo that brought down Berlin and saved the good.

641
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:08,283
It's Tokyo, right?

642
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:09,660
Is it Tokyo?

643
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,266
Of course

644
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:34,309
We are doing our best

645
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:36,520
I will give you the good news right away...

646
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:41,650
Time is so tight, Officer Xuan, what is she going to do...

647
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:44,862
Captain Che

648
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:47,155
Do you think it's okay for us to just wait and see?

649
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:49,324
Even though the robbers did not take any action, is that right?

650
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:51,827
Oh, really

651
00:47:58,333 --> 00:47:59,167
Captain

652
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,839
What's the matter? It's okay, just tell me.

653
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,633
It is said that the professor found

654
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:08,886
What does this mean?

655
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:12,931
Prepare to get rid of the professor immediately

656
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:14,516
Launch a crackdown

657
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:18,687
If you do not agree
We'll miss our only chance to end this.

658
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,149
(Brother Car City)

659
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:46,089
This is the one

660
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:48,467
The car you said

661
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:16,411
(License plate search 35 9125)

662
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:27,381
Then clean up

663
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:29,591
-Okay, I'll clean it up.
-What's going on?

664
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:32,010
Who is it?

665
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,680
Doesn't it look like someone is here to scrap an old car?

666
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,683
That 9125

667
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:41,061
Is Korando still available? I bought it.

668
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:42,646
I said

669
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:47,401
What's the point of buying a car from a junkyard?

670
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:51,154
I checked beforehand.
Don't waste my time.

671
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,198
How much do you want?

672
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:56,702
At least show your face and speak.

673
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:59,079
Who are you? A policeman?

674
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,707
-Come and catch him!
- It's the eldest brother

675
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:02,708
Who the hell is this bastard?

676
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:07,504
Come here, you bastard!

677
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,006
Come here!

678
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:13,343
Come to me

679
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:14,469
Catch that bastard!

680
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:30,402
Catch him!

681
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:36,867
Ran over there and went there

682
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:39,619
Let me go

683
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:42,039
They launched an armed crackdown?

684
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,250
Even if the robber leader is eliminated

685
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:48,920
There will inevitably be shootings.

686
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:50,881
What should we do?

687
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:53,717
How is he?

688
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:57,596
this…

689
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:12,611
-What's wrong?
-What's up?

690
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:19,785
-What's going on?
-What's going on?

691
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:22,704
Looks like the action has begun

692
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:06,289
What happened?

693
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:09,793
I don't know if there is a fire?

694
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:12,003
What's wrong with him?

695
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:18,385
All team members are dispatched

696
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:22,639
Use all the weapons to get it done in a short time

697
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:25,433
That fire alarm is
Was it sent by an important person who infiltrated the inner circle?

698
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:26,685
yes

699
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:29,312
He will get rid of the professor immediately.
Then send me a radio

700
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:30,522
We'll raid immediately.

701
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:43,493
Is it okay to proceed like this?

702
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:45,579
Anyway, Officer Xuan...

703
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:49,332
She is suspected of being a spy. That's all I can do.

704
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:53,920
Don't you also hope to end this incident as soon as possible?

705
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:57,883
Ten minutes at most
This hostage situation is over.

706
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:13,231
Hey you bastard!

707
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:17,360
She looks pretty with a gun, doesn't she?

708
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:20,655
It feels bad to have the roles reversed now, right?

709
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:23,950
You don't have to feel too wronged.

710
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:26,661
Anyway, you're all going to die!

711
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:29,289
What are you doing? Stop it.

712
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:31,625
You staggered over here just to say this?

713
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,210
Are you relieved enough?

714
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:36,379
What is your relationship with this bastard?

715
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:38,006
It's not what you think

716
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:41,384
Good to know

717
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:45,013
I see

718
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:48,016
So you two

719
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,436
It's already an unclear relationship, isn't it?

720
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:54,731
It's really not like that.

721
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:55,649
Get out of the way!

722
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,983
It seems that you are really crazy.

723
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,694
You're the crazy one.

724
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:42,862
Untie him now.

725
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:44,948
Whose side are you on?

726
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,242
I'm really going to shoot!

727
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:49,703
You just shoot.

728
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:53,123
Let's shoot.

729
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:54,291
Shoot!

730
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:56,293
I told you to try shooting!

731
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:08,847
How are you?

732
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:10,473
What are you doing here?

733
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:12,559
It's dangerous here

734
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,274
I have to go there quickly.

735
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:22,277
Where are you going now?

736
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,611
Tokyo is dangerous now

737
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:27,657
The alarm in the exhibition hall went off.

738
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:30,243
Look here

739
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:32,954
Nairobi

740
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:34,998
Stop printing money first.

741
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:36,666
Gather all hostages in the lobby.

742
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,209
knew

743
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:40,670
Rio, just in case you should go to Berlin

744
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:42,339
I patrol the exhibition hall.

745
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:47,260
What's wrong with just being nice?

746
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:49,512
If the fire alarm goes off, doesn’t that mean there is a fire?

747
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,222
Need to escape quickly

748
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:52,182
It's really annoying

749
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:54,684

Helsinki Follow Me

753
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:04,903

Come here soon

758
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:16,808
What the fuck?

759
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:20,186
Hey Berlin!

760
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:21,688
Damn it!

761
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:25,525
What happened to this bastard?

762
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:04,481
-Tokyo!
-Denver!

763
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:05,690

764
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:08,318
Contact the professor quickly!

765
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:18,953
-What's that sound?
-Isn't that a gunshot?

766
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:27,587
professor

767
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:30,089
He's not in there

768
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:32,634

769
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:54,822
