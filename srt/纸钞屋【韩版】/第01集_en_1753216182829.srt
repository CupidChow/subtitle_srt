00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,563
Fans of the K-pop group BTS
Known as "ARMY"

3
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,901
These fans are all over the world

4
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:37,412
certainly

5
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,373
North Korea also has "ARMY"

6
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,208
(Long live the Democratic People's Republic of Korea)

7
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,002
For those who secretly watched Korean dramas since childhood

8
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:46,546
I am listening to Korean music secretly.

9
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,007
This doesn't sound magical.

10
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,770
What is the difference between me and other "ARMY"?

11
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,523
That means I have to join the army.

12
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,204
South Korea, North Korea and the United States
Several years have passed since the summit at Panmunjom

13
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,833
People's expectations for unity
As time goes by, it gradually fades away

14
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,544
Change comes suddenly and quietly like a thief

15
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:27,462
Check this out

16
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,215
-What are you talking about?

17
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:31,758
Is this news reliable?

18
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,510
I told you it wasn't easy.

19
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,595
(Agreement on the Establishment of the Economic Cooperation Zone on the Korean Peninsula)

20
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:39,182
The two countries will establish an economic community for this purpose

21
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,892
A common currency will be created and used in both countries

22
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:41,893
Using a common currency?

23
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,522
Does this mean that we can buy South Korean products now?

24
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,565
Is there any need to say more?

25
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:51,402
I heard that as long as you get a pass
You can come and go freely

26
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,238
No need to consider

27
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:57,283
As soon as I was discharged from the military, I left Pyongyang for Seoul

28
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,369
(2025)

29
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,662
Full of Korean dreams

30
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,836
(Sinuiju, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea
To Seoul, South Korea)

31
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,046
Look there!

32
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,008
From this perspective, it is only a matter of time before the two countries are unified.

33
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:18,138
The train is passing through the JEA Economic Cooperation Zone

34
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,598
As we all know, this is the past

35
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:24,269
The Joint Security Area symbolizes division

36
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:28,523
Now it has become a place towards peaceful reunification
Economic Cooperation Experimental Field

37
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,692
Free travel of all people from north to south

38
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,569
and economic activities can be guaranteed

39
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,112
Besides

40
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:37,365
Many organizations and companies from the north and south
Already settled in this area

41
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,742
It is expected to enter in the future

42
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,162
The Korean Peninsula Unified Banknote Printing Bureau and
Unification Preparation Committee

43
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:47,667
We in North Korea will become like this soon, right?

44
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,544
Gotta make more money

45
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,629
Buy a high-rise apartment in my hometown

46
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,048
Is that where Mount Konggang used to be?

47
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:57,385
Because it is an economic cooperation zone
It's like building a new city.

48
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:01,764
Everyone on the train
Apparently they all smelled the same scent.

49
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:04,726
That is hope

50
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:25,455
Soon after, South Korean big companies promised

51
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,916
Large-scale investment will be made in the North Korean market

52
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,294
Taking advantage of this reform trend

53
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:34,839
People who suddenly became rich are constantly emerging in the north and south

54
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:35,965
(The stock price hit a new high in a row)

55
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:38,801
but

56
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:49,270
The house and job agreed by the immigration agency
It's all fake

57
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:57,862
(Preferential loans for immigrant residents)

58
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,239
Welcome to the world of capitalism

59
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,340
Hello

60
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,384
Do you want to eat?

61
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,347
Just don't eat it

62
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,349
Damn

63
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:29,435
Why does that South Korean girl pick up garbage to eat?

64
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,146
Since the first and second economic cooperation

65
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,691
With the influx of North Korean migrant workers

66
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:38,194
Social prejudice against them is also increasing

67
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,196
(Exploiting South Korean people
Reds, get out!)

68
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,075
At the same time, it is expected to be held in a month
All tickets for BTS' Pyongyang concert sold out

69
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:46,327
This shows that the cultural exchanges between the north and the south

70
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:49,163
But it went beyond imagination

71
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,625
What on earth is going on in this world?

72
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,295
(Mudanbong Nightclub
North Korean etiquette ladies are waiting at any time)

73
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,588
Whistle

74
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,716
Gradually going away

75
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:07,515
Leave me and go far away

76
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,990
I can't figure it out

77
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,160
How did things turn out like this?

78
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,340
fifty thousand yuan

79
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,009
Do you know that there is a 20% exchange fee for old currency?

80
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,389
What are those?

81
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,974
What else could it be? I'm using it as a loan.

82
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:53,311
What do you want to do? Take it out and let me see
Give you a good price, eh?

83
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,777
I understand

84
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,529
Have you been having a hard time lately?

85
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,493
This thing is called "ice" in North Korea, you know that, right?

86
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,703
I know you're having a hard time so I gave it to you

87
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,246
No need

88
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,125
Hey

89
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,921
Isn’t it nice to work happily?

90
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,090
Try running a second round with the client

91
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,593
Hmm? When will you pay back the principal if you continue like this?

92
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:34,268
To make some money here you have to be flexible

93
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:36,437
Why don't you try it?

94
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:37,980
Um?

95
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,276
Let me go!

96
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,655
The atmosphere was just getting better. What happened?

97
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:49,200
This bitch took the money and tried to run away. I caught her and brought her back

98
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,243
How about taking one of her kidneys?

99
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,370
Seeing how serious her drug addiction is, can her kidneys be used?

100
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,498
Do you want to eat?

101
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,544
It's all because of bad guys like you.

102
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:01,712
What?

103
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,425
You bunch of bandits

104
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,081
Did you pull the bolt?

105
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,084
The TT pistol has no bolt.

106
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:47,967
I'm sorry, I get it. Let's talk it over, okay?

107
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,902
Anyway, this is a world where thieves make money

108
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,531
There is no reason not to let me be a thief

109
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,132
Hey, what are you standing there for?

110
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,134
Get your stuff and get out of here.

111
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:29,569
(One year later)

112
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,576
Two suspects have been
Serial robbery loan sharks

113
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:40,204
He is currently wanted

114
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,082
On-site discovery

115
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:46,168
One of the suspects died at the scene

116
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,254
Police are hunting for suspected illegal immigrants

117
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:49,714
Another suspect

118
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,465
(Publicly wanted for the fugitive armed robber Li Hongdan)

119
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:55,344
It is reported that the robbers held
Homemade guns brought in from North Korea

120
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,846
Police warn nearby residents...

121
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,431
Please respond to 1506

122
00:09:58,514 --> 00:09:59,890
1506 No suspect seen

123
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,726
Looks like it went to Second Street

124
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,061
I know. I will bring four police officers over right away.

125
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:25,124
Recent crimes related to illegal immigrants
There is a surge in the trend

126
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:28,794
Expert judgment
With the rapid development of North-South economic cooperation

127
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,088
A large influx of low-income workers

128
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:36,469
This phenomenon is caused by the widening gap between the rich and the poor.
We hope that there will be relief measures soon...

129
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:49,023
Now there is no place I can go or want to go.

130
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,412
Are you okay? You look badly hurt.

131
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,248
The first time I saw him

132
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:49,667
I thought it was the god of death coming to greet me

133
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,589
That's you, right?

134
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:59,885
The bad guys who robbed and exploited the migrants

135
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,766
I thought it was a wild beast
He's just an ordinary person.

136
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,144
Who are you?

137
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,315
how?

138
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,818
Kill some of those bad guys.
Do you see any turning point?

139
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,322
Who are you?

140
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,074
I have a plan

141
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,869
A big hope that you will participate

142
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,832
Are you proposing that I join in on the robbery?

143
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,376
Looking at my appearance, how dare you mention it?

144
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,220
A robber who steals small change

145
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,598
The end result is being hunted down or imprisoned

146
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,809
The robber who stole a huge sum

147
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,147
Will change the world

148
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,608
Will become a hero

149
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,332
How much does it take to change the world?

150
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,795
Four Trillion

151
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,342
It's a matter of life and death

152
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,805
How about you believe me for once?

153
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,811
He asked me to call him professor.

154
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,063
professor?

155
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,440
Who do you teach?

156
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,153
I asked him
He introduced me to a group of his students.

157
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,470
Before the formal class

158
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:07,972
Start now

159
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,641
We put aside age and origin

160
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,643
Everyone communicates in plain language

161
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:15,729
And use nicknames instead of names

162
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:19,608
Forget about the nickname, but speak plain language?

163
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,569
Does it have to be like this?

164
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,070
This is just in case

165
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,281
It's safer if we don't know each other's identities

166
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:29,493
OK, then how about calling it by city?

167
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,162
You can pick a city you want to go to after you get rich.

168
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,039
Or maybe you just like the pronunciation.

169
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,333
Just pick the one you like

170
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,714
Oh my god, what a coincidence

171
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:44,216
I wanted to go to Rio Carnival.

172
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,261
Isn’t samba the highlight of the carnival?

173
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,222
The one who looks like an idol star

174
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,141
It's Rio

175
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,476
(Rio)

176
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,103
（JEA Seoul）

177
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,646
Even though dancing is terrible

178
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,189
But it is said that hackers are extremely powerful

179
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,858
(Violation of the Information and Communications Network Act)

180
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:01,775

Then I invited my North Korean family to immigrate here.

363
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,614
Hey, I've been sterilized for ten years.

364
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:40,116
Who are you hanging out with to blackmail me?

365
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:43,453
blackmail?

366
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:45,955
Capitalism is really chilling

367
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,290
I'm really scared

368
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,544
Where did I lose it?

369
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,591
Oh, it's connected.

370
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:00,011
It turns out that here

371
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:03,515
(No entry or exit of cars)

372
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:13,441
(Choi Jin-ho, Korean Peninsula Unified Banknote Printing Bureau)

373
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,365
Thank you for your hard work, both of you.

374
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:21,282
Keep going!

375
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:25,078
It's fun to have some excitement

376
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,664
Stop talking nonsense and turn off the alarm

377
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,673
I really hate this place

378
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,758
I don't understand why I have to go to school here.

379
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,385
I really hate my dad.

380
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:46,766
Come

381
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:50,937
Come again

382
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:54,566
I'm not allowed to do anything

383
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,527
Look at this rustic school uniform.

384
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,780
Looks pretty sexy.

385
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:02,532
Shut up

386
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:05,326
real?

387
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,095
Am I the only one who has benefited from this?

388
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:25,805
You said I was alone...

389
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:29,934
Lied?

390
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,227
Continue reversing

391
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,146
Can I take off my coat?

392
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:35,315
That's right

393
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,902
I lied too. The pregnancy was fake.

394
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:43,490
Lying to each other is equal to breaking up.

395
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,074
Goodness

396
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,535
-Agent Yin, that's not what I meant.
-Let me go

397
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,262
Wait, you can't go in.

398
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,280
What's going on?

399
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:30,036
What's going on?

400
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:35,583
Kneel down!

401
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:40,255
Hello everyone, have I become a light bulb?

402
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:46,845
Don't be so smart, I'll blow your head off.

403
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,142
Get out!

404
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,270
Bow your heads!

405
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,356
I told you to bow your head!

406
00:30:58,439 --> 00:30:59,566
Did you hear that?

407
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,985
You told the kids to be quiet!

408
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:03,194
Otherwise it will hurt them!

409
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,410
Hello!

410
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:11,536
No one is allowed to move!

411
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,204
Hey, get going!

412
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,632
-Get up quickly!
-Get back here!

413
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,803
Hey, go quickly

414
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:34,183
Hey, everyone, hurry up.

415
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,604
Hey, I'm sorry to bother you with your hard work.

416
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:40,940
But please put your guns on the ground.

417
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,901
-What's that sound?
- Already upstairs?

418
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,955
come out!

419
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:05,882
hurry up

420
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:08,009
come out!

421
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,474
Mom, please

422
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,101
Answer the phone quickly

423
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,355
I didn't see that girl.

424
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:23,650
hurry up

425
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,666
Pick it up quickly

426
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:23,209
Nice to meet you all. I'm the person in charge here.

427
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:25,294
Sorry, from now on, comrades

428
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:27,714
They are our hostages.

429
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,260
People are alive.

430
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:34,429
Going through all kinds of weird things

431
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,806
Every time I feel like the sky is falling

432
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:39,726
But looking back, it's nothing.

433
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:43,271
If the comrades obey our orders

434
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,649
This is no big deal.

435
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,570
Decades later, when we have grandchildren

436
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:53,698
You can tell them an adventure story.

437
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:54,991
But what if

438
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:58,077
If someone wants to cause trouble, just remember this.

439
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,997
I like this kind of person very much

440
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,293
Take out your cell phones.

441
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,465
Take off the pass hanging around your neck.

442
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:13,676
All mobile phones and electronic devices will be confiscated

443
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:28,900
What phone call?

444
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,945
If the headquarters doesn't answer

445
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:35,615
Should have noticed what happened.

446
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:43,623
I have a good impression of you

447
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,333
I have a feeling I will like you

448
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,542
Answer the phone

449
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:58,638
No need to be nervous

450
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,389
Take a deep breath

451
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:20,409
This is the Banknote Printing Bureau.

452
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,705
Yes, it's a network error.

453
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,212
I'm not a network expert

454
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,047
Shouldn't you find out the reason?

455
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,473
So what's the phone?

456
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,185
No big deal

457
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:51,649
OK

458
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:01,534
She said it was no big deal

459
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:06,080
You have nothing else to do now?

460
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:09,876
Okay

461
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:29,770
How long will it take?

462
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,272
dad

463
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,274
When will I see the money?

464
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,568
Hi, break through the triple door lock

465
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:37,737
Could it be that easy to add electronic safety devices?

466
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,406
What is this guy talking about?

467
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:50,082
Is that it? Can we open it now?

468
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,718
good

469
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,847
Be careful

470
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,096
Dad!

471
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,181
alright

472
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:54,814
money!

473
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:55,815
Dad!

474
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:59,860
Did you see that? This is my dad!

475
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,076
dad

476
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,495
I've always dreamed of sleeping on a pile of money someday

477
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,330
Let me sleep here for a while

478
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,957
Ouch

479
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,377
When will this brat of ours grow up to be sensible?

480
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,671
We are rich!

481
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:22,466
How come two people went crazy?

482
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,553
Feed these two guys and lose all the money!

483
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,028
Professor, we are going out.

484
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,658
It's okay. They're leaving now.

485
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,160
Be patient

486
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,550
What are they doing?

487
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,898
I didn't see anything

488
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,734
It’s okay, just take a look, okay?

489
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,486
You can watch

490
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,781
You want to know what we're doing, right?

491
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,616
Not at all

492
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:30,409
I don't know anything

493
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,787
I don't want to know anything

494
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,288
It doesn't matter

495
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,582
I like you as a comrade, so I want to tell you

496
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:42,088
We're going to have a shootout with the police.

497
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:44,090
Just like in the movies BAM!

498
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,813
Don't be afraid, you coward.

499
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,773
What are you worrying about if you can't even hit the target when you aim and shoot?

500
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,274
Am I right?

501
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,115
The professor emphasized from the beginning

502
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,701
There must not be any casualties.

503
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,286
Good when the police show up

504
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:17,915
Just pretend you were caught running away
Start shooting

505
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:20,292
Then hide back inside

506
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:22,294
Like a mouse in a dilemma

507
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,797
So why are we told to shoot into the air?

508
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:27,216
I told you

509
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,802
Our plan cannot have any casualties.

510
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:31,554
Who plans to die?

511
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:33,681
Yeah, who knows what will happen?

512
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:36,100
It's possible that one or two might be shot dead accidentally.

513
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,101
Absolutely not

514
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,271
Only in this way can our plan succeed

515
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,356
plan?

516
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,859
You're probably expecting this, right?

517
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,485
That's a lot of words.

518
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:49,196
It's the professor who makes the plan and we just have to execute it.

519
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,197
If you can't do it, quit

520
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:03,127
An alarm signal sounded at the main entrance of the Banknote Printing Bureau

521
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,588
Police cars patrolling nearby please report your current location

522
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,131
Car number two is coming soon

523
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:09,425
You don't need to know why you do this.

524
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,510
Just do what the professor says.

525
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,139
What are those guys doing?

526
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,143
(police)

527
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:23,230
It's an armed robbery gone wrong!

528
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,065
Get off the vehicle first after requesting support!

529
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,109
It's a request for support!

530
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:35,618
-Hide behind!
-how so?

531
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,287
What the hell is going on?

532
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:42,791
-Everyone hide and avoid it!
-Why shoot us?

533
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,382
Rio, what are you standing there for?

534
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,429
Rio!

535
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:01,769
These bastards don't want to live anymore!

536
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:04,230
Hey you fucking bastards!

537
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,689
That's enough, we're retreating!

538
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:08,067
Die, bastard!

539
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:13,614
Don't shoot!

540
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:15,616
Don't shoot!

541
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,159
What else?

542
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,869
If this continues we will surely die!

543
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,042
Actually, she is right.

544
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,585
We don't intend to shoot the enemy.

545
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,421
But the enemy doesn't think so.

546
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,970
Damn, I can't shoot.

547
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:46,564
Try holding your breath

548
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:50,568
What about fingers?

549
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:52,736
Take it easy

550
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,424
Hey, do you like the professor?

551
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:15,509
What?

552
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:20,681
The professor said
You are ready to go through fire and water

553
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:29,398
You think we're playing house?

554
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,444
Want to have fun masturbating?

555
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:39,199
I mean, how did the professor seduce you?

556
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:42,244
It's no use talking to a little fool like you.

557
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:49,877
But I can't just watch
The professor's plan came to nothing

558
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,004
You have to think of a solution!

559
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:53,756
Tokyo!

560
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:55,841
Stay away from Denver!

561
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:03,932
It's a smoke bomb, everyone stand back!

562
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:06,477
Come in quickly!

563
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:08,604
These bastards shot without mercy!

564
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:09,980
Hey Rio!

565
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,690
Hey, drag it in!

566
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:13,734
Drag it in!

567
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,498
-Rio!
-Damn it!

568
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:29,124
-Rio, are you okay?
- This kid

569
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:34,672
Scared to death

570
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,008
Hello

571
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:40,386
Are you feeling sorry for me?

572
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:43,347
All my plans almost went down the drain because of you.

573
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:58,654
As soon as the news that the Banknote Printing Bureau had been occupied by robbers spread

574
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:01,615
The South Korean government is trying to resolve the situation immediately

575
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:04,243
Discussions with North Korea begin

576
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:07,955
The two countries reached an agreement

577
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:11,291
The police chief of the Economic Cooperation Zone
Appointed as Commander

578
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:14,837
and evenly distribute police forces between the north and south

579
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,505
Form a confrontation team

580
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:19,717
(Personal information of Xuan Yuzhen)

581
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:27,599
Once this matter affects economic cooperation
This will become an international laughing stock.

582
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,352
The only divided country on earth

583
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:33,021
Unification of the Korean Peninsula is within reach

584
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:36,775
Moreover, this unprecedented event

585
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:38,527
Occurring in special areas of economic cooperation zones

586
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,612
This not only attracted the attention of neighboring powers

587
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:42,614
has also attracted worldwide attention

588
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:43,824
(near JEA, Paju, South Korea)

589
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:44,867
Thief!

590
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:45,868
There's a thief!

591
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,121
Really

592
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,582
What has become of the room?

593
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:54,084
Others would think a thief had come.

594
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:58,380
Mom finally got some rest today.
You treat your mother like this?

595
00:45:58,464 --> 00:45:59,715
It's noon, okay?

596
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:08,807
(Park Sun-ho: Are we going to meet today?)

597
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:20,944
Don't you go to school?

598
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:23,489
I'm back from school. It's exam time now.

599
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:25,657
If I have to say, I did well in the exam.

600
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:30,996
You wouldn't wear this kind of thing
Go on a date with your crush

601
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:34,792
Hey, come here quickly.

602
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,543
Little one!

603
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,254
Since my daughter did well in the exam

604
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,466
How about we all go out for dinner together tonight?

605
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,301
OK

606
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:47,304
Mom, is there anything you want to eat in particular?

607
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:49,598
Me

608
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:52,476
It's nice to eat food cooked by others

609
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:55,479
But can Xiao Jin spare the time?

610
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:03,946
(Director Yoon Chang-soo)

611
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,158
I'm not on duty today

612
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:13,580
Banknote Printing Bureau?

613
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:22,756
Now all of our hostage comrades
Take off your blindfolds

614
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,967
Hey, why are you just standing there? Why don't you take it off quickly?

615
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:26,885
It's okay, just take it off.

616
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:36,562
It's nice to talk face to face like this

617
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:38,355
Don't be so scared

618
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:41,316
We're all locked up in this building together.

619
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,527
So we have to break out together, right?

620
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:03,797
We break in here
It's not to hurt you guys.

621
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:06,884
As long as we cooperate well, comrades will be safe and sound

622
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:09,052
You can go home safely

623
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:10,512
I promise

624
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:12,973
Then we get along well.

625
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:28,155
What about communications equipment?

626
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:29,948
Oslo is connecting

627
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,481
alright

628
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,200
Can the professor hear me?

629
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:14,117
How is everyone?

630
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:17,537
No one was hurt, right?

631
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:22,209
So everyone knows what to do now, right?

632
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:28,799
Due to the occurrence of
Unprecedented gang hostage robbery

633
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:31,009
It is said that the North and South authorities have carefully considered

634
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:34,388
The Gyeonggi National Police Agency and

635
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:36,181
People's Defense Ministry direct forces

636
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:39,226
According to the agreement between the two countries, the chairman of the joint confrontation headquarters

637
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:42,688
The Economic Cooperation Zone Police Department Director Yoon Chang-soo will serve as

638
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:44,564
South Korean negotiator

639
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:47,526
Officer Sun Yuzhen of the Gyeonggi Police Agency will serve as

640
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:50,779
This is the first joint operation by police from the north and south

641
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:52,239
What are the concerns?

642
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,866
A high-level North-South economic cooperation summit will be held soon

643
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:56,994
How do you think this incident will have an impact?

644
00:49:57,077 --> 00:50:00,706
From the perspective of being responsible for public security in the economic cooperation zone

645
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:02,791
I am taking the opinions of the two governments seriously.

646
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:05,210
To resolve the issue safely and peacefully

647
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:06,545
I'm trying my best

648
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,297
-Here it comes!
- I want to ask a question

649
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,470
I felt more at ease when I heard Officer Xuan was here.

650
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:18,265
- You probably heard about it?
-How did they get in?

651
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,100
They hitched a ride on a paper truck

652
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:22,978
The surveillance camera keeps tracking the moving path

653
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:25,522
But there was a monitoring error in the middle
It should have been started at that time

654
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:29,609
Opened the safe
Why didn't the automatic alarm go off?

655
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,820
Not sure if it will sound when opened manually

656
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:33,280
So I guess the employee pressed the password.

657
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,032
How many hostages are there in total?

658
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:38,201
This is still analyzing
Including security guards, there are 35 people in total

659
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:40,662
But because it was the opening of the museum
So there should be more people inside.

660
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:41,580
Let's go in and talk

661
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:46,793
(Occupy the Banknote Printing Bureau for Three Hours)

662
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:52,132
The shells are imitations from North Korea.

663
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:54,176
I guess they are from North Korea

664
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:55,761
Let me introduce this

665
00:50:56,803 --> 00:51:00,390
I am from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
Captain Che Wuhe of the Ministry of Civil Defense

666
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:04,561
I am from the Gyeonggi Province of Korea
Crisis Negotiation Team Leader Xuan Yuzhen

667
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:05,937
Thank you for coming in person

668
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:07,856
But I don't think there's any need to discuss this.

669
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:12,277
From what I know about the armed robbers

670
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,529
We haven't figured it out yet, have we?

671
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:21,078
No matter how many people

672
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:23,997
Just send our special forces.
It can be done in five minutes

673
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:26,792
We selected key personnel with rich experience in the Korean War...

674
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:28,460
Do they have experience in rescuing hostages?

675
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:31,713
It is estimated that there are fifty hostages trapped inside.

676
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,548
If a fight breaks out

677
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:36,259
How many casualties will occur in less than five minutes?

678
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,954
The robbers probably didn't have time to pull the bolt.

679
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:05,872
Not long ago, my group

680
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:08,959
They are all training to invade the Blue House
The guys who slit the president's throat

681
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:12,838
Beslan school incident in Russia

682
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,298
You don't know that, do you?

683
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:19,594
This is
National crisis situations occurring in economic cooperation zones

684
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:23,431
How can you control this situation when you are so soft-hearted?

685
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:26,852
That is why negotiation is even more necessary.

686
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,397
Now you should at least study.

687
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,650
Look at normal countries that put human rights first

688
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:36,444
How to deal with this situation

689
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:39,739
What?

690
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,117
What are you two doing?

691
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:45,412
As you said, Chief.

692
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:50,959
We are working hard to resolve the issue safely and peacefully.

693
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:54,880
If the incident occurs on the first day
A gunfight broke out and some hostages died.

694
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:56,631
Imagine what would happen if these were broadcast on the news.

695
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:01,178
You look forward to completing your term here successfully.

696
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:03,054
Then return to the dream of headquarters

697
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:05,849
It should be a bubble, right?

698
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:12,272
Yes, we will follow the steps.

699
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:14,274
Then let's start the negotiation.

700
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:17,611
First we will conduct non-face-to-face negotiations

701
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,447
- Start preparing
-good

702
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,449
-Ready to connect
-yes

703
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:33,501
I heard your nickname is Little Sun

704
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:36,504
I want to see how peacefully you can resolve this.

705
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:39,758
Do you know me well?

706
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:42,886
I also know that you are the ex-wife of a famous South Korean politician.

707
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,765
Then you should have heard that I rely on this background
The one who took the captain's position?

708
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:50,685
So you admit it?

709
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,147
Information comprehension is terrible

710
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:57,609
Because of child custody issues
I'm in a lawsuit with that guy.

711
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:01,279
Let me tell you my nickname.

712
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:07,410
Because I squeeze people dry with a smile
That's why they call me "little sun"

713
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:11,623
Those who say I rely on my husband and am a vicious woman

714
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:15,961
Those guys who have no strength and like to gossip behind others' backs
Took it for me

715
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:18,880
Phone connection ready

716
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,210
Hello

717
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,296
I'm the leader of the crisis negotiation team of the Gyeonggi National Police Agency.

718
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,256
Officer Xuan Yuzhen

719
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:04,759
I'm not okay at all
You know, now that things have gotten bigger

720
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:06,052
This is a tampered sound.

721
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:10,515
Your voice sounds a little strange
Can I hear your original voice?

722
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:13,601
This is a mobile app
It seems to be working well

723
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,146
Once the identity is revealed, even if you escape by helicopter

724
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:17,647
It's no use.

725
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:20,608
So before we enter into negotiations

726
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:23,153
At least there should be a name, right?

727
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:29,326
professor?

728
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:31,786
Call me professor

729
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:33,705
professor?

730
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:34,622
All right

731
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:37,208
Professor

732
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:40,211
Do you want a helicopter? How many seats?

733
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:43,089
First of all, I want to negotiate with someone who doesn't procrastinate.

734
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:45,258
Unlike a civil servant like you who has no weight

735
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:47,886
Find someone who doesn't need to ask a superior for advice.

736
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:49,304
that…

737
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:54,184
As you know, processes are not easy to change

738
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:57,354
Is this how it has to be from the beginning?

739
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:59,022
Please use your imagination

740
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:01,483
We just want to take some money and leave.

741
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:04,611
But because you are trapped here

742
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:08,031
And with a bunch of annoying hostages who are holding us back.

743
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:10,867
Would you be patient?

744
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:13,953
But this is also your fault

745
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:16,414
The Banknote Printing Bureau is located at the junction of the north and south

746
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:18,041
So it's complicated.

747
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:20,293
Why not just rob a regular bank?

748
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:23,254
-Yes.
- Talk to me.

749
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:26,549
I'll handle all the complicated stuff in the middle

750
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:27,884
But to be honest

751
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:31,304
I am really a powerless civil servant

752
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:35,266
So I have to convince my superiors.
You need to take a step back at the same time

753
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,184
for example?

754
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:38,978
How about at least letting the students go?

755
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:43,650
Then you will send us a helicopter?

756
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:48,029
- At least I can convince my superiors with this
-Are you kidding?

757
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:49,614
The hostages

758
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:53,118
Aren't you taking too much control?

759
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:55,745
The situation wouldn't be any different if there were fewer people.

760
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:58,289
Too

761
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:00,125
It's a bit... just the four of us taking charge

762
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:03,294
Let me think about it

763
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:18,226
What are the results of the sound analysis?

764
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:21,146
I don't know what the tampering tool is.
No way to restore nature

765
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:24,065
Judging from the accent of a man in his forties,

766
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:25,608
Definitely South Korean

767
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:29,028
Does that mean the four northern and southern robbers have formed a group?

768
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:32,449
(Occupy the Banknote Printing Bureau for 11 hours)

769
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:36,536
What are you thinking about?

770
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:39,789
Dongzhe

771
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:43,126
That guy just now

772
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:45,712
It's four people

773
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:50,091
Does it really look like his mistake in your opinion?

774
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:53,720
That is to say

775
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:03,730
What are those?

776
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,069
What are you doing?

777
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:11,696
You just heard it.

778
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:13,656
There are only four of us, so let's get this over with quickly.

779
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,742
This isn't something that can be resolved quickly.

780
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:17,535
Maybe he said it on purpose for us to hear?

781
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:19,287
Maybe I overreported it.

782
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:21,539
How could the number of people be underreported?

783
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:22,874
What if he did it on purpose?

784
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,709
It could be a trap

785
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:31,674
I'm in a difficult situation too, but the situation is not good now

786
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:34,719
Both governments are urging
This matter needs to be resolved before the Economic Cooperation Summit

787
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:37,972
You can return to the team.

788
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,183
No, you are...

789
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:42,602
I mean, the negotiations were just for show from the beginning.

790
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:44,521
Thanks for your hard work

791
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:47,065
The captain is leaving, who will see her off?

792
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:00,370
(Come to the cafe and I'll make you something delicious)

793
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:01,788
(Sorry to bother you, you are busy with work)

794
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:03,206
(Aren’t you off duty today?)

795
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:06,167
(Am I being too ignorant?)

796
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:11,422
I was just forced to leave work

797
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:12,882
Are you in a cafe?

798
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:19,013
(Forced? Off work?)

799
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:23,393
It’s a long story

800
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:41,369
(First floor plan)

801
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,624
The cover team will sneak in first, centering on the support area.

802
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:48,876
Invasion team at the emergency exit

803
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,254
Dive in from both sides

804
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:58,261
(Preparation for business)

805
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:36,883
Sunho?

806
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:37,925
Oh, that

807
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:40,803
Something completely wrong has happened. Did you see it?

808
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:43,097
I'll come from over there.

809
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:47,644
Are you coming from next door?

810
01:00:49,103 --> 01:00:49,937
next door?

811
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:53,274
Yes, the water pipe burst, don't even mention the fuss.

812
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:57,445
Is there something else important?

813
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:00,031
No

814
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:01,908
Wait a minute, you haven’t had dinner yet?

815
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:06,871
let me see

816
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:09,624
What good food can I prepare for you?

817
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:13,461
In fact, the person who really grasps the overall situation

818
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:16,297
Not the South nor the North but the Professor

819
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:21,511
He had predicted that during the battle
All situations that can happen

820
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:23,137
So we made a plan

821
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:26,933
Of course, this plan also includes her existence

822
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:30,603
Although the security of the Economic Cooperation Zone is dominated by the south

823
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:33,856
But if a kidnapping occurs in a place like the Banknote Printing Bureau,

824
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:36,067
North and South to form joint counterattack team

825
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:37,276
(Yun Chang-soo is now the Director of JEA)

826
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,319
(North Korea Operations Captain)

827
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:42,490
That is to say, the North and South will send experts in this field

828
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:45,785
North Korea may send special forces

829
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:47,745
It should be irreconcilable.

830
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:49,247
That's right

831
01:01:49,747 --> 01:01:52,375
Who holds the leading power is crucial

832
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:55,211
I'm going to take advantage of this.

833
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:58,423
No, I said these all sound good.

834
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:02,885
But how can things go according to plan?

835
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:05,513
Like who of us expected

836
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:08,224
We're gathering here to plan a robbery?

837
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:11,060
So yeah, as Berlin said

838
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:13,354
Once the special forces are deployed, we're done.

839
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:15,231
Tyson said

840
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:17,191
“Everyone has a plan

841
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:19,444
Until you get punched."

842
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:20,361
That's right.

843
01:02:21,028 --> 01:02:23,239
The number one strategy for winning a fight

844
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:25,575
Just choose your opponent

845
01:02:25,658 --> 01:02:27,535
Do you mean to choose the negotiating partner yourself?

846
01:02:27,618 --> 01:02:29,495
But everything in North Korea is confidential.

847
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,706
Who knows who they'll send against the Squad?

848
01:02:32,331 --> 01:02:33,916
We can at least determine the south

849
01:02:37,211 --> 01:02:40,006
Xuan Yuzhen, leader of South Korea's crisis negotiation team

850
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:43,009
She is our negotiating partner.

851
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:44,427
She looks pretty

852
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:50,016
But South Korea's police crisis negotiators

853
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:51,684
She's not the only one, right?

854
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:54,854
Although there are several strong candidates

855
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:58,107
But they are all involved in sex scandals and bribery.

856
01:02:58,191 --> 01:02:59,108
Right Rio?

857
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:02,862
Oh, that's why you asked me to investigate.

858
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:05,782
I will make her someone who can assist our plan.

859
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:06,991
(Divorce proceedings are ongoing)

860
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:08,659
She won't even notice it.

861
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:13,956
You know, it's been exactly two months today.

862
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,249
It's been two months?

863
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:17,001
But what do you count those for?

864
01:03:17,084 --> 01:03:18,920
We're not dating. It's embarrassing.

865
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:21,756
I'm talking about the opening of my store.

866
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:33,893
Aren't we dating after all?

867
01:03:46,697 --> 01:03:48,574
From her ordinary text message

868
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:50,743
The professor can guess a lot of things.

869
01:03:51,452 --> 01:03:53,579
She left the confrontation team

870
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,498
This means that North Korea is in control.

871
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:57,291
The enemy is about to break in.

872
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:58,376
Act according to plan

873
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:01,712
This means that an armed crackdown is imminent

874
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:05,967
Operation Cover Team

875
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:07,510
Rescue team operations

876
01:04:07,593 --> 01:04:08,553
Invasion team please report

877
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:09,971
Dive in now

878
01:04:17,436 --> 01:04:19,856
There's no way those guys would accept negotiations

879
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:21,732
So we launched a forced crackdown

880
01:04:22,483 --> 01:04:23,526
Sneak in quietly

881
01:04:25,152 --> 01:04:26,821
There are five entrances in total

882
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:28,281
Main Entrance

883
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:29,949
roof

884
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:32,159
Underground parking lot

885
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,078
Side emergency exit

886
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,706
There is also an unloading area

887
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:40,918
In addition to the easily visible gate and roof

888
01:04:41,502 --> 01:04:43,087
They will sneak in from these three places

889
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:47,258
Damn, they really came in like a pack of mad dogs.

890
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:51,429
Well, thanks to that woman
We know the time when the enemy broke in.

891
01:04:51,512 --> 01:04:53,598
But special forces swarmed in from all directions

892
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:54,974
How to stop that plan?

893
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:55,933
That's right

894
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:58,102
Good question

895
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:01,230
Go quickly!

896
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:03,316
move!

897
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:04,317
quick!

898
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:06,193
Run!

899
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:08,112
-hurry up!
-run!

900
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:18,873
What's bothering you?

901
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:20,666
ah?

902
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,336
No, not

903
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:28,049
You're a negotiation expert?
Your expression betrays you.

904
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:29,675
that

905
01:05:30,509 --> 01:05:31,719
Negotiation is not deception.

906
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:35,848
Wouldn't it be easier for people to trust me this way?

907
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:40,102
That's true.

908
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:43,230
Cover team ready

909
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:45,149
- Rescue team ready
-Invasion team ready

910
01:05:51,822 --> 01:05:52,657
Get started

911
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,671
So in this situation where we are surrounded by enemies,

912
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:08,464
What would be our best solution?

913
01:06:08,547 --> 01:06:09,715
What other options are there?

914
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,052
- It's over.
-Why do you think you can't resist?

915
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:15,137
The majority versus the minority

916
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:17,390
Isn’t the result obvious?

917
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:28,651
We have quite a few people

918
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:31,237
No, actually more

919
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:02,977
Robbers armed with heavy weapons
Waiting for the armed forces to break in

920
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:03,978
Please look at this

921
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,482
It seems unlikely that the cover team will be able to infiltrate

922
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:10,901
The rescue team encountered the same situation.

923
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:13,571
How many people are there?

924
01:07:13,654 --> 01:07:14,655
What to do Captain?

925
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:16,657
Captain, I need your confirmation.

926
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:18,617
-what else?
- A YouTube live stream is being recorded inside

927
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,453
Please don't force repression

928
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:21,871
Please don't force repression

929
01:07:21,954 --> 01:07:25,916
The robbers and hostages wore the same clothes

930
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,836
The robbers and hostages wore the same clothes

931
01:07:28,919 --> 01:07:30,463
Give each of us a fake gun

932
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:33,132
It is difficult to distinguish true from false

933
01:07:34,842 --> 01:07:35,676
yes

934
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:37,887
What?

935
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:41,932
Who is that child on the screen?

936
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:43,392
Please ask the police

937
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:44,643
The daughter of the American ambassador?

938
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:46,312
Please agree to negotiate!

939
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:49,315
Please agree to negotiate

940
01:07:50,691 --> 01:07:51,525
retreat

941
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:54,236
All retreat

942
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:10,711
Come on my comrades

943
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:13,380
Take off the mask

944
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:25,476
Thanks to everyone's cooperation

945
01:08:26,685 --> 01:08:30,231
The police crackdown was called off

946
01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:36,570
Everyone showed extraordinary cooperation and courage

947
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:39,824
Applause to our comrades

948
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:16,944
You said the attendance site is nearby, right?

949
01:09:17,027 --> 01:09:20,322
Come over at dinner time
This is your first meal of the day. That's outrageous.

950
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:22,533
I told you I was forced off work today.

951
01:09:22,616 --> 01:09:23,742
They said they didn't need me

952
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:27,913
Are you still thinking about work?

953
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:29,748
Close to our store

954
01:09:31,208 --> 01:09:32,168
No

955
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:35,171
Hey, I came to see you, Sunho.

956
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:38,966
They won't call me over again.

957
01:09:39,049 --> 01:09:41,051
Maybe they need you again?

958
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:46,432
ah?

959
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:49,977
Because you're the best negotiator I know.

960
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:54,356
You only know me as a negotiation expert, right?

961
01:09:55,774 --> 01:09:56,859
Yeah, that's right.

962
01:10:01,238 --> 01:10:02,072
(Police officer Nam Dong-chul)

963
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:05,451
Um

964
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:08,871
What?

965
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:16,295
Even if you can't hear, the professor can guess

966
01:10:17,129 --> 01:10:18,631
Infiltration failed

967
01:10:19,506 --> 01:10:23,135
More importantly, among the hostages
There is even the daughter of the American ambassador

968
01:10:23,844 --> 01:10:27,306
Coercive repression does not work
So we have to restart the negotiations.

969
01:10:29,266 --> 01:10:30,142
Leaving?

970
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:31,769
sorry

971
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,022
Sunho, you are right.

972
01:10:35,105 --> 01:10:36,106
I said

973
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:38,275
Then I'll prepare dinner and wait for you, okay?

974
01:10:54,166 --> 01:10:59,171
(Suspended business preparation)

975
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:10,849
Is everyone okay? Is anyone injured?

976
01:11:11,725 --> 01:11:13,477
What happened? What happened?

977
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:15,646
Where is that woman?

978
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:17,898
When we get back, we'll follow our plan.

979
01:11:19,566 --> 01:11:20,401
Okay then

980
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:23,153
How about we take the next step?

981
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:26,782
Is there really enough money in there?

982
01:11:26,865 --> 01:11:31,161
Since it is the Banknote Printing Bureau, it is possible, right?

983
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:34,248
Oh, go talk in your sleep

984
01:11:35,082 --> 01:11:36,333
Huh? Where are you going?

985
01:11:36,417 --> 01:11:38,502
No matter what

986
01:11:38,585 --> 01:11:40,504
Is it realistic to have four trillion in cash?

987
01:11:40,587 --> 01:11:41,672
You are right

988
01:11:43,507 --> 01:11:44,842
-impossible
-What the hell does that mean?

989
01:11:44,925 --> 01:11:46,802
Why would we steal if the money isn't there?

990
01:11:46,885 --> 01:11:47,803
I said...

991
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:50,764
Listen to the complete sentence in Korean

992
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:52,725
Thanks

993
01:11:54,059 --> 01:11:56,478
I'm not trying to steal money.

994
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:58,355
I don't want to steal other people's money.

995
01:11:58,981 --> 01:11:59,815
What?

996
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:01,650
What is it like?

997
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:07,323
Could it be…

998
01:12:07,406 --> 01:12:09,575
What the professor meant was...

999
01:12:10,242 --> 01:12:11,702
Not a money grab

1000
01:12:11,785 --> 01:12:12,828
It's printing money

1001
01:12:14,204 --> 01:12:15,372
Really use a money printing machine

1002
01:12:15,956 --> 01:12:17,875
Four trillion printed in vain

1003
01:12:17,958 --> 01:12:21,128
Untraceable money?

1004
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:26,675
Then we disappeared perfectly

1005
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:47,446
This will become a

1006
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:50,157
A revolution in criminal history

1007
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:53,786
(United currency 100,000 yuan)

1008
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:00,597
