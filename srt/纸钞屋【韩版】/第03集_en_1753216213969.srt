00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:09,926
NETFLIX SERIES

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,221
(Achieving advanced transformation that opens up the future)

3
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:15,265
(Southern Prison)

4
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:08,735
My plan won't work without you.

5
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,322
But once you decide to join

6
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:15,366
You can't regret it, so please consider it carefully.

7
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,284
OK

8
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:18,787
No need to say more

9
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:24,626
I join

10
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:27,295
But I have a condition

11
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,423
Add one more person

12
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:33,093
Hey, you bastard, stop right there!

13
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,469
Watch how I kill you!

14
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:37,138
Moscow went straight to Denver

15
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,683
But he still has to wait in line to see Denver.

16
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,940
Because Denver caused illegal fighting ring gamblers to lose money

17
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,567
So they sent the thugs to get him.

18
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,240
He was going to cross over and catch him!

19
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,285
Hello!

20
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,538
etc.

21
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,082
Hey, don't push.

22
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,544
-Hey, damn!
- I told you not to push

23
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:08,461
Hey kid!

24
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:10,630
Oh shit

25
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:13,842
-Hurry up, asshole!
- Hey, that guy ran away

26
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,260
Why don't you just stop right there, kid!

27
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,970
Hey, what's going on? Did you catch him?

28
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:18,680
Come on

29
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,140
Today is your memorial day

30
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,267
So relentless?

31
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:27,105
Come here, you little bastard!

32
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,898
Come down and try it.

33
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,442
This is trouble.

34
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:34,946
(Clear)

35
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,001
Hey what do those guys do?

36
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:50,378
Dad

37
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,881
I was scared to death

38
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:55,550
Hey you little bastard come here

39
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:57,302
I'm going to fall!

40
00:02:58,970 --> 00:02:59,804
Hey, come here quickly

41
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,097
- This way
- Over there?

42
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,057
By the way, dad was released from prison today, right?

43
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,059
-You actually forgot?
- I haven't forgotten.

44
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,312
I was just about to buy some tofu to pick you up.

45
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,563
At least buy some tofu, boy.

46
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:11,566
Run this way!

47
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:20,617
Hey dad, you’re still as good as ever!

48
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:22,619
Shortness of breath

49
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,292
Dad, are you okay?

50
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,545
It's no big deal that I'm old.

51
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,676
Dad, you don't have to wait long.

52
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,889
I will make a lot of money soon so you can enjoy a comfortable life

53
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,976
Stop bragging

54
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,977
You're with dad.

55
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:49,812
Just once

56
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,106
We'll do this vote.

57
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:55,693
What to do?

58
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:59,113
Our fucking lives can be rewritten this time

59
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:00,657
Now you should

60
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:05,036
Live like a human being
Is that right? Am I right?

61
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,288
Oh, you little bastard

62
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,882
I know it's you who did it

63
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:44,594
But I won't punish you

64
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:46,554
reason?

65
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,056
This is my punishment for you.

66
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,202
Did you really kill her?

67
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,746
It wasn't even one shot, it was two.

68
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:13,498
I should have reloaded my gun.

69
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:14,916
How can this be?

70
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,918
Knowing that it was dangerous, he encouraged Agent Yin to do it.

71
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,169
Pretend to be ignorant after being exposed?

72
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:20,296
What? Please explain clearly.

73
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,257
It's not me who instigated it, it's Meishan who wanted to do it

74
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,803
What kind of director are you with this behavior?

75
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,971
-How could this be?
- Was it the director's order?

76
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,932
- It's too obvious
- I knew it was like this

77
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,350
Stop talking, please!

78
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,685
I am the biggest victim here.

79
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,313
I lost my beloved

80
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,649
It was those robbers who did it!

81
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,609
Love? Stop talking nonsense.

82
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:44,028
Chief Cui, you are
Isn't that a bit disrespectful?

83
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,656
If Agent Yoon is Korean
Will you also watch someone die without helping?

84
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,033
Hey, why are you talking about South Korea and North Korea at this point?

85
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:49,951
Hello!

86
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,286
Shut up and get back to the team

87
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,010
If you do well, you'll get used to it.

88
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,858
Hiding the body is up to you.

89
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,579
- The professor should be informed
-What?

90
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,372
etc.

91
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,541
Wait a minute Tokyo!

92
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,377
Are these two people flirting?

93
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,756
If not, why?
Entering this room without my permission?

94
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,132
Explain it.

95
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,009
The professor said there must be no casualties.

96
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,552
So you want to sue?

97
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,097
That watch almost ruined it all

98
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,683
If we don't teach them a lesson, they will rebel.

99
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,477
You are rebelling

100
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,811
The professor should also understand the situation, right?

101
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,482
When the time comes, I will tell him in person.

102
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,074
Can you please move aside while I work?

103
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:00,706
I won't say it a second time

104
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,238
Why is the atmosphere so tense?

105
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:34,782
Let's go out

106
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,466
Hello, professor?

107
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,551
What happened?

108
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:54,802
nothing

109
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:57,805
There were some minor disagreements but they were resolved.

110
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,599
I don’t think it’s a small matter, right?

111
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,559
Did you take a hostage with Denver?

112
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:03,978
Are they related?

113
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,146
Oh that?

114
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,362
That woman is pregnant

115
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,824
I thought she needed some rest, so I left her alone.

116
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,869
Yes, I created a bit of a scary atmosphere.

117
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,538
Now the hostages no longer dare to have any evil thoughts.

118
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:24,999
Know you understand

119
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,754
But I have to emphasize
Now is the critical moment for our action to succeed or fail

120
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,048
knew

121
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:35,051
So the watch thing is taken care of.
It's all right, right?

122
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:39,972
Let Rio answer the phone.

123
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,106
Yes, it's me

124
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,233
Can you analyze the usage records of a broken watch?

125
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,195
You can try but why do you need this?

126
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,989
Just in case, I want to confirm

127
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:58,741
Did they find out anything?

128
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,790
Don't think about it.
Do the homework the professor gives you.

129
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:33,526
Fuck you, you scared me to death

130
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:34,443
What about that woman?

131
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,196
Where is she?

132
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,156
This side

133
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,757
Damn, I'm going crazy!

134
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,759
How can I shoot and kill people?

135
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,221
What should I do?

136
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:08,811
Please help me

137
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,272
Even if I don't kill you, that guy in Berlin will kill you.

138
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,858
Is it okay to pretend to kill him?
Is it okay to shoot someone in the thigh or something?

139
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,818
I'll pretend to be dead and you'll pretend to kill me, okay?

140
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,279
but…

141
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,115
Shoot here

142
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,242
If you get shot, it will hurt like hell.

143
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,911
-Can you bear it?
- It's okay, hurry up

144
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:26,996
Okay, let's give it a try.

145
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,415
If I shoot you, it will hurt a lot.

146
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:30,958
You bite this

147
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,002
Hello, are you ready?

148
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,253
Grit your teeth!

149
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,386
Fortunately, it was you I met at that time

150
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,722
I don’t need to tell you what will happen if Berlin finds out, right?

151
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:45,973
Not just you

152
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,975
I was also in trouble.

153
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,268
I know this

154
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,229
I will be careful

155
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,902
Take off your clothes

156
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:00,446
I'll check the wound.

157
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,090
Oh sorry

158
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,301
You do your thing and I'll leave.

159
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:09,723
Please check on her at any time.

160
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,686
And don't forget to give her antibiotics on time.

161
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:16,272
knew

162
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,899
No matter how painful it is, bear it

163
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,235
I'll think of a way.

164
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,202
but

165
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,040
Have you told the professor about this?

166
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:38,711
No

167
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,548
Under the current situation, even if I tell the professor
Berlin will kill her himself.

168
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:44,091
So what should we do?

169
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,802
I can't keep it hidden for long.

170
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,470
I think about it

171
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:51,974
I also feel that we can’t just let Berlin do what it wants.

172
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:53,851
so what?

173
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,394
To remove him from his leadership position.

174
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,396
But first

175
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,106
Helsinki and Oslo

176
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,234
We need to get rid of these two guys.

177
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,785
Joseph Han, 22-year-old medical school dropout

178
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:12,786
(Criminal Investigation Records)

179
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,291
So he's just a hostage?

180
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,419
From what I gather, this guy isn't on the hostage list.

181
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:21,879
He has no criminal record?

182
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,797
He was a minor at the time so he was only given a warning and pardoned.

183
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,674
He has been a hacker since he was a teenager.

184
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,887
Our network team has put so much effort
There are reasons for all this.

185
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,847
He was apparently one of the robbers.

186
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,729
Such a well-prepared crime

187
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:42,942
There must have been a site visit before the incident.

188
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,653
Surveillance cameras around the Banknote Printing Bureau

189
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,821
Check all that can be found

190
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,372
Once you enter

191
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,500
I can only use the screen and the phone
Understand what's going on inside

192
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,711
No one can predict what will happen inside.

193
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,090
So I need someone to direct the scene for me.

194
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,466
Who should be responsible?

195
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,096
I, who have worked in a team, am responsible for this.
More suitable, right?

196
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,807
Really? What have you done?

197
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,184
Let's say a big

198
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:19,770
Casinos in Jeju Island

199
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,272
-What?
-70 large bills

200
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,024
Did you really do that?

201
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,487
-What thing?
-You don't know?

202
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,531
Don't mention the magic tricks.

203
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:33,242
No one noticed the money was missing for a while.

204
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,495
Ouch

205
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,248
The gang involved in that case were all foreigners

206
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,582
And I heard they were all arrested.

207
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,334
I wasn't caught.

208
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,212
I told them all the designs from the beginning.

209
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,590
I guess they didn't quite understand?

210
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,925
Partnering makes people anxious

211
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,385
What are you talking about?

212
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,014
You really are a teller of lies, huh?

213
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:57,933
I'll come

214
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,480
Does anyone have any objection?

215
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,566
I'm just a little curious

216
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,360
Do you have any reason for recommending yourself?

217
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,655
Do you enjoy the feeling of being superior to others?

218
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,241
I don't deny

219
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,786
But not just for this

220
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,792
The professor's plan is perfect.

221
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:27,421
From the outside it looks like this paper house

222
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,383
But once we actually got in

223
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,968
what happens?

224
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,472
People struggling to survive

225
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,891
People who are greedy for money

226
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,477
There will be all kinds of dirty desires intertwined

227
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,104
A boiling furnace

228
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,901
As a result, this exquisite and beautiful plan

229
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,361
Will be reduced to ashes, leaving only a trace

230
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,781
What can the professors who are outside do then?

231
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,074
Nothing can be done

232
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,285
I mean

233
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:03,457
Someone has to bring order out of chaos.

234
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,918
Are you saying that you are the one who can play this role?

235
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,800
If anyone else is capable of doing this besides me, please step forward.

236
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:16,970
Oh, the way South Koreans like it

237
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,264
A democratic election?

238
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,064
Otherwise according to age

239
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,525
Can my dad be in charge?

240
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,361
Don't get involved.

241
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,321
- I'm sorry
-What's wrong?

242
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,159
Excuse me
But Moscow also has another important task

243
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:44,123
He was responsible for opening an escape route.
Let's return to the world

244
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,670
The escape hatch dug by the hostages was fake

245
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,964
We will release the hostages when the time is right.

246
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,466
Then escape from the real escape hatch.

247
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,344
Of course the police will be hot on your trail.

248
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:01,431
But they are chasing
Run in the direction of the fake escape exit the hostages told you

249
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,228
Has so much time passed?

250
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,105
No cheating here

251
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,816
Let's continue after dinner.

252
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,443
Ouch

253
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,112
Go to eat

254
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,701
Where did this kid go without even showing his face?

255
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,476
I'm going to the bathroom, everyone continue working.

256
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,979
The cameras are watching.

257
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:54,276
You, especially you

258
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,112
If you play tricks again

259
00:19:58,864 --> 00:19:59,781
You understand, right?

260
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:05,829
Let's continue

261
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,424
Psychopathic bastard

262
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,718
Killed someone

263
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,679
It feels good to poop by yourself, right?

264
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,389
That is to say

265
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,058
You bastard, you’ll die of diarrhea!

266
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:31,521
Back to the point

267
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,483
How long will I have to do this miserable job?

268
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,530
What's wrong?

269
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,700
I have something to ask Director Park, please don't interfere.

270
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:47,996
Are you hungry?

271
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,041
No more appetite

272
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,043
Eat it so you can survive.

273
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:54,628
That person

274
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,632
Thought I was dead?

275
00:20:58,715 --> 00:20:59,549
who?

276
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:01,468
Director?

277
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,473
That should be

278
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,058
What did he say?

279
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,560
I am a person who can't die.

280
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,980
It's no problem for him, right?

281
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,024
Hey I said

282
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,568
Is it your turn to worry about him now?

283
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,197
What the hell is that bastard?

284
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,992
Come eat this

285
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,535
Open your mouth

286
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,755
Can you bear with us?

287
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,300
Actually, there are plans

288
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,637
I'll just say it straight out.

289
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:49,016
We will no longer tolerate your arbitrary behavior, Director.

290
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,768
What? Tolerance?

291
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,354
The robbers said that as long as they didn't cause any trouble

292
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,814
They will treat us humanely.

293
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:58,442
Please stop causing trouble. We will not let you do whatever you want.

294
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,277
What else can I do?

295
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,447
Because of you, Yoon Mi-sun, she died

296
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,450
Hello, did I kill him? Huh?

297
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:07,784
It was those guys who killed people.

298
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,828
And should I do that?

299
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,415
Do you want to survive alone?

300
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,624
Think about it carefully

301
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,210
We're digging an escape hatch for those guys.

302
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,546
We'll tip off the police if we're let go.

303
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,381
Is it possible for them to give us life?

304
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,175
They'll kill us before they get away!

305
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,593
Stop saying "we we"

306
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,678
I don't understand yet
Is there only yourself in your mind?

307
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:31,850
Hey, are you going to hold a people's trial?

308
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:35,103
Look at you reds.

309
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,564
- Now his true nature is revealed
-What?

310
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,276
Hey these North Korean guys are rebelling!

311
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:46,156
This bastard is simply incommunicable.

312
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:50,285
- This time give him some color
-Don't do that.

313
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,954
You will regret it!

314
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,335
If you live for yourself

315
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,712
And once again put other hostages to death

316
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:02,964
Better be mentally prepared

317
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,217
What is this doing?

318
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,805
You're here at the right time!

319
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,849
These red elements
Do you hear me? We want to work together to kill me.

320
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,851
-What?
- That's not the case.

321
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,771
This is collective labor, but this person is being lazy.
I'm just warning you.

322
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,231
Hey Park Agent

323
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:21,608
You saw it all, so tell me what you think!

324
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:26,822
that…

325
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,282
Look at your behavior.

326
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,869
Aren’t you in the same situation?

327
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,372
It's too late to help each other

328
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,042
You should stop thinking crookedly.

329
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,211
When others are working, you should join in!

330
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,215
Where did this guy go?

331
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:46,925
To create this situation?

332
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,220
Now put down your tools and go eat.

333
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,889
What are you standing there for? Come on!

334
00:23:58,186 --> 00:23:59,229
Ouch

335
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,573
Go fast

336
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,912
Excuse me, could you give me a little more?

337
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,289
- Get another one.
-say what?

338
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:20,083
It's not that the kid wanted to knock over the plate.

339
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,126
It was the people behind who kept pushing...

340
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,919
I'll say it again

341
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,505
No one told me to get another one.

342
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,924
Just give me a little more. Don't be so stingy.

343
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:31,052
We are responsible for any problems with meal distribution

344
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,762
What is this?

345
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:34,973
Come eat this

346
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,892
Sir, mind your own business.

347
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,810
What are you doing?

348
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,479
Give them now

349
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:51,531
I mean, what's the atmosphere among the hostages?

350
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:57,370
What's wrong?
I think our system is now functioning normally.

351
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:00,665
I was digging a hole over there by myself and it was like dying
Didn't anything happen during this time?

352
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:02,417
This

353
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,086
Why not ask Denver?

354
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,965
Hey, look here!

355
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:09,883
Um?

356
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:13,136
Where have you been, boy?

357
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,139
Did I eat something wrong?

358
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:19,184
I feel a little upset. What happened?

359
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:22,521
Are you getting into trouble again?

360
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:27,651
I'm not a child, so why would I get into trouble every day?

361
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:31,029
Your dad is asking the hostages if anything happened.

362
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:32,364
Do you know something?

363
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,285
No, nothing.

364
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:38,828
Yeah?

365
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:43,250
The two sides have been fighting each other for years.

366
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,293
So get together
Can we get along well all of a sudden?

367
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,753
It's no problem for us.

368
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:49,422
They fight among themselves and don't consider us as enemies.

369
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,217
That's what I mean

370
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,195
Ouch

371
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:15,740
What's wrong?

372
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:54,779
If everyone has finished eating, feed you

373
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,491
Tie the person up again

374
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,298
Oh shit!

375
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:57,592
Oh really

376
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,721
I thought you were just a paper tiger without a gun.

377
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,933
Teletubbies, you have had some fights in Yanbian, right?

378
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,102
What do you want to do, you lunatic?

379
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,187
Teletubbies you boy

380
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,272
Make a move

381
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,991
Yingmin, I'm still alive

382
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,998
(You don't have to worry about me
Take care of yourself. I'm sorry.)

383
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,110
Put Down Your Guns Helsinki

384
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:10,660
Have you found out?

385
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:14,455
The data is gone but the sending record can be seen

386
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,959
Look at this capacity
The content you send should be pictures or short videos.

387
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,004
What we are worried about may happen

388
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:24,674
If any of us were photographed in the face
Isn’t this a big deal?

389
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:29,429
Anyway, I'll find out first.

390
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:31,556
See what intelligence they got.

391
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,018
This was a week before the incident.

392
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,895
Surveillance video of a convenience store across from the Banknote Printing Bureau

393
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,190
- As expected
- Zoom in and see

394
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,029
Just the two of them?

395
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:47,739
This is the case at the moment

396
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:49,532
Find out who this woman is first.

397
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:52,118
Then focus on checking
Video footage before and after this time point

398
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,245
Look who they are talking to.

399
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,122
Don't miss the people who walk by them.

400
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,545
At the beginning of the incident, the police...

401
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:06,507
The identity of the robbers is yet to be confirmed

402
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,510
Three days have passed since the Banknote Printing Bureau incident

403
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:13,389
So far, it has remained peaceful and there is no special...

404
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:25,193
(Xuan Yuzhen)

405
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:30,823
The user you dialed is powered off
You will be forwarded to voicemail

406
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:44,712
- Goodbye
-goodbye

407
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,612
(Yuzhen)

408
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:13,032
The user you dialed is powered off
You will be forwarded to voicemail

409
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,702
The call fee will be charged after the beep

410
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,833
(Never let your son-in-law and Min-ah be alone together)

411
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,584
(You can find out about Yuzhen by opening the desk drawer)

412
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:32,677
(Yuzhen's boyfriend
Goodbye Beauty Cafe)

413
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,264
What? Are you afraid that the watch might capture your face?

414
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,099
There is no such thing as nothing

415
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:41,936
What information can they capture in such a short time?

416
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,854
Isn’t it?

417
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:46,524
What if they obtained important information?

418
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:50,445
The professor will definitely know how to deal with it.
He will handle it well...

419
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:51,362
Handle it well?

420
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:54,115
Is the professor a god? Does he know how to handle this?

421
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:58,161
It seems that Tokyo treats him as a god.

422
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:05,626
Aren't you curious? Why is it that everything the professor says
She obeys everything you say?

423
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:09,672
-How come you know?
- It couldn't be clearer.

424
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,591
I also know this is very dangerous

425
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,427
The Danger is You Berlin

426
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,678
Come in quickly!

427
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,266
Executing the hostages is not enough

428
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:21,934
You want your accomplices to monitor each other?

429
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,062
This isn't something someone would say when they're pointing a gun at their accomplice.

430
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,229
What's wrong with you, Denver?

431
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,481
I thought there was nothing wrong between us.

432
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,441
Shut up you asshole!

433
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,193
All because of you

434
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,277
Give me the gun

435
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,363
Rio calls the professor

436
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:35,698
Oh, I see.

437
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:51,589
What is this mess?
It seems like something happened today?

438
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:52,507
Please let us in

439
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,134
Please make way for us. We are reporters.

440
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,471
- Please let us pass.
-Wait a moment

441
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:01,682
- Let's go in for a minute
- Please move aside

442
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:03,309
Please let me go

443
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,402
No photography allowed here

444
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,154
Can't go in

445
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,114
No, please don't come in.

446
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,782
Put your phone away and don't take pictures

447
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,450
Go back, you can't take pictures.

448
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,202
No entry, no taking photos allowed

449
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,287
Put your phone away. No photos allowed.

450
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,622
Can't shoot

451
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,666
Hey, go take a look

452
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,963
- You can't enter
- Wait a minute.

453
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:33,965
No entry, no photography

454
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,342
Put your phone back and don't take pictures

455
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,511
Are you a reporter?

456
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,848
What do you do? Hello

457
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:43,516
Don't let that man in to stop him.

458
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:46,769
Shen Yingwen, 38 years old

459
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,855
- Has a history of fraud
-Fraud?

460
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:51,649
The identities of the two beautiful robbers have been confirmed

461
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:53,192
How about releasing it to the media?

462
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,111
The robbers know that they can create some pressure

463
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,487
The superior will be satisfied after hearing this.

464
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:00,158
No, I don't know how to use this card.

465
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:02,368
Let's keep it secret for now.

466
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:07,290
What puzzles me is
Robbery and hackers are allowed to join

467
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:08,958
How could there still be scammers?

468
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:10,751
That's what I mean

469
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,379
There is a mobile phone signal nearby

470
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:15,006
Turn on speakerphone so everyone can hear

471
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,053
I told you not to go in!

472
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,263
So I said

473
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:25,057
I want to talk to Officer Xuan Yuzhen.

474
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:26,684
This is a private matter and it will be done in a moment!

475
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:27,810
Just a moment!

476
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:30,521
Shanhao

477
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,441
-You are...
-Yuzhen

478
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,735
Your mother called you.

479
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:37,111
It seems to be urgent

480
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:38,738
The old man can't contact you

481
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:41,157
He must have seen my business card and contacted me.

482
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:45,870
Hello, mom?

483
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:46,996
Is it Yuzhen?

484
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,540
Min-ah comes back from school

485
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,126
Her dad suddenly showed up...

486
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,962
I understand. I'll call you back later.

487
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,759
Excuse me

488
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:01,928
Sorry to bother you all

489
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,439
Is grandma okay?

490
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:17,777
But

491
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,196
Where are we going?

492
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,698
Dad wants to take you out to eat delicious food

493
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:25,409
Hey, what do you want to eat?

494
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,912
How about going to your favorite fire pit pizza place?

495
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,455
Mom will be angry if she finds out.

496
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:33,918
(Xuan Yuzhen)

497
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:38,047
Why did you take the child away?

498
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:39,840
Don’t you understand that approach is prohibited?

499
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,343
I don't understand what tricks you are trying to use to instigate Min Ah.

500
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,262
What tricks are there? It's too much to say.

501
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,514
I just haven't seen my child's face for a long time.

502
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,642
I won't tell you anymore
I sent the child here before I called the police

503
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:50,643
Now

504
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:52,561
I'll take her home after dinner!

505
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,026
Don't make it a big deal.

506
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,737
If you don't want to get into trouble

507
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:04,031
Send the child back immediately.
This is the final warning!

508
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:04,949
Hello

509
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:06,909
Xuan Yuzhen you...

510
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:12,540
that

511
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,293
Does your husband have children?

512
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:22,008
I made a fool of myself in front of you.

513
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,052
How could that be?

514
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,639
I haven't heard you mention your ex-husband before.

515
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,352
Is he on good terms with his daughter?

516
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:36,063
Listen to your mother...

517
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:39,650
This has nothing to do with you, Sunho.

518
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,820
So just pretend you didn't hear what happened just now.

519
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:44,405
Feel sorry

520
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,533
I rush in without caring about anything
It should be difficult for you.

521
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:49,535
I see your mother is worried.

522
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,580
So I was anxious too.

523
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,750
- I'm sorry
-Thank you for worrying about our family.

524
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,668
But this is a martial law zone.

525
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,007
I understand.

526
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,469
I'll go first, then if I have time later...

527
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:07,386
Go well

528
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:33,788
What does he do?

529
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:37,708
Don't mind him.

530
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:49,637
Because of this incident, the relationship between the professor and the police officer
It may end forever

531
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:52,473
Hello, mom?

532
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,684
The professor took Xuan Yuzhen, who had been working for a long time
This card is a bet

533
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,603
You can see

534
00:39:58,437 --> 00:39:59,772
How urgent is the professor's situation?

535
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,069
Result Professor

536
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,071
I still got the cards I needed.

537
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,408
I know, wait a minute.

538
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,119
Excuse me

539
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:14,954
Sorry to bother you all

540
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:17,832
However

541
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:20,668
This bet

542
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,421
No one expected the result.

543
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,881
Damn, this professor is such a

544
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:28,968
Where did you go when you left your position at this critical moment?

545
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,886
Could something really have happened?

546
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,013
See, that's why this happens.

547
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,974
The professor entrusted me with the command of the scene.

548
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:36,267
You are not qualified

549
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,894
I know you think so but do others think so too?

550
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:39,979
What?

551
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:43,357
How about we gather everyone together and ask them one by one?

552
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:44,900
Let's have some democracy

553
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,485
Are you out of your mind?

554
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:47,403
Are you crazy?

555
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,157
If you refuse

556
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,285
You are
Launching a coup in the professor's absence

557
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,787
So who disrupted the plan?

558
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,428
Come in, everyone.

559
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,346
Move slowly

560
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:17,099
It's not a big deal, don't be afraid

561
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,060
Excuse me

562
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:23,230
Can you separate me from those people?

563
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,523
What kind of nonsense is this?

564
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,443
The North Koreans keep provoking me.

565
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:31,614
I think you are provoking me?

566
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,657
I mean it.

567
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,076
What really? You bastard.

568
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,369
What!

569
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:38,704
Look, I'm not going to slap you.

570
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:40,998
What the hell is this bastard?

571
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,542
Just for him.

572
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:45,753
Why don’t you let me in?

573
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,546
Come in quickly!

574
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,114
Don't look for trouble

575
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,825
If you don't behave yourself, we will come first.

576
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:31,674
What is going on here?

577
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:33,968
What about Moscow?

578
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,762
He's probably still busy digging holes.
But I've called him over.

579
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:41,016
The kung fu of fooling around here
Do you know how much money can be printed?

580
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:44,812
Tokyo said I was not qualified to direct the scene

581
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:47,064
I'm curious what you guys think

582
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:50,192
Berlin violates professor's instructions
Creating divisions among hostages

583
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:53,404
And broke the taboo of not killing anyone.

584
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:56,365
If this continues, the professor's plan will be ruined.

585
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,158
This is exactly what he wants, right?

586
00:42:58,784 --> 00:42:59,702
Long story short

587
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:01,412
Just go by the majority vote you like.

588
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:15,384
You know I'm always on your side.

589
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,598
Thanks, but now is not the time to take sides.

590
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:23,517
Think about it everyone
Why did we join this program?

591
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:24,727
Because I trust the professor.

592
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:27,521
Not because of this controlling sadist

593
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,439
Am I wrong?

594
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:35,696
You know
I was originally on your side, Berlin, right?

595
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:39,325
But this time it really went too far

596
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:41,660
Look at it this way

597
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,330
My dad is definitely in the same group with me, so

598
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:46,498
One two three four five to three

599
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:47,708
Game Over

600
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:51,045
Don't you know that proxy voting is illegal?

601
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,130
Are you dissatisfied with the result?

602
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:14,109
You confessed that you killed the hostage.

603
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:20,032
Let me be honest

604
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:21,033
Hey Professor

605
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:23,702
Are you in love?
Why don’t you answer the phone?

606
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,371
What are all these doing?

607
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:28,707
It's a shame Tokyo wants to impeach me

608
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:30,918
There should be a reason. Explain it.

609
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:35,172
I actually executed a hostage.

610
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,176
A pregnant woman

611
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:41,970
It's the pregnant woman

612
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:52,147
She made up the pregnancy.

613
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,190
Nonsense

614
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:56,443
No matter how much I emphasize, the result is still

615
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:58,237
Or take the hostages...

616
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:00,197
but

617
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:04,993
Thanks to that, this place is working perfectly now.

618
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:06,412
What?

619
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:08,580
Perfect?

620
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,290
Did you say perfect?

621
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,208
Too

622
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,002
The identities of some of us

623
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:16,880
Maybe the police already know about it.

624
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:19,425
That's not perfect, is it?

625
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:21,009
What?

626
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:27,891
Not only is this possible
So the professor said to check it out.

627
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:28,934
So did you find out?

628
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:35,691
Police have identified Rio and Nairobi

629
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,117
Is it true?

630
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,953
The watch seems to have captured only Rio

631
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:50,122
But our on-site surveillance

632
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:52,082
They turned it all out.

633
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,919
Nairobi with Rio
The face and identity are exposed.

634
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:01,049
See, I started out my way.
This won't happen.

635
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:02,968
We were too polite to the hostages.

636
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:03,969
Isn't this a rebellion?

637
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:05,721
I just want to avoid this situation.

638
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:06,764
Berlin

639
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,391
Of course I'm sorry for not reporting it truthfully.
It also violates the principle

640
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:10,684
Look at this result

641
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:13,771
Someone has to do the dirty work, right?

642
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,564
All for the success of this plan

643
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:16,940
Your hands are dirty!

644
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,943
-Have you had enough of the trouble?
-Oh shit

645
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:22,112
Hey Nairobi Rio

646
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,615
Still think I was wrong?

647
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:27,367
So what? You've changed your mind now, right?

648
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,329
Talk about

649
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:33,582
I'm afraid the hostages are afraid of Berlin.
I won't rebel again.

650
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:38,378
-Nairobi
- This kind of thing is common on the scene

651
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:39,671
You have to change direction according to the situation

652
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:42,049
Fuck

653
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:44,968
Rio cheers up

654
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,929
Don't be so cowardly.

655
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:48,639
So what if my face is shown?

656
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:53,018
Just such a small matter?

657
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:56,063
Fuck, your face isn't exposed, so you don't feel any pain in your waist when you talk?

658
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,232
You're such a jerk.

659
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:01,401
What's the point of you complaining now?

660
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:04,446
- You are really a man.
-How good do you think you are?

661
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,323
Your mother ran away from home

662
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:10,202
I saw you robbing on the TV.
How happy she should be!

663
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:11,620
You fuck

664
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:14,540
Shut up

665
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:15,582
Too

666
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,793
A criminal from the ancestors

667
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:21,588
He even killed someone, so what are you afraid of? Right?

668
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,757
This damn bastard

669
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:26,260
You're going too far, asshole.

670
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:27,678
-stop!
- Stop it, both of you!

671
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:29,179
Denver, stop it!

672
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:30,973
-Hey stop Denver!
-open

673
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,307
-Stop!
-Who is…

674
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:36,895
Who killed?

675
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:40,858
No, not like that.

676
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:43,819
I ordered it.
Because the hostages are going to take over our heads

677
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,572
If Denver hadn't executed that woman

678
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:48,323
It won't end like this.

679
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:55,497
Is it true?

680
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:57,791
Um?

681
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,005
I'm going crazy

682
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:07,259
Damn you kid

683
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:09,803
Why do you want to kill people?

684
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:12,764
Who do you think you are to kill someone?

685
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,933
If he tells you to kill someone, you will kill me too, right?

686
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:16,101
Right?

687
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:17,728
-Calm down
-Let me go

688
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:18,937
- Dad, calm down.
-open

689
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:21,648
Professor, what's going on?

690
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:24,026
Didn’t we agree not to kill anyone?

691
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:25,277
It's not like everything goes according to your plan.

692
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:29,197
Does it go according to your design?

693
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,700
But what is going on?

694
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:34,328
Why did he kill people?

695
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:37,080
Dad, dad!

696
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:38,832
Are you okay, Dad?

697
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,334
Are you okay?

698
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:41,710
Cheer up, Dad.

699
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:43,921
-fine
-Is Dad okay?

700
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:44,922
alright

701
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:48,008
Come get up and take a look

702
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:53,764
Damn

703
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:00,395
dad

704
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:27,339
Oh shit

705
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,342
Fuck

706
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:32,344
Dad!

707
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:35,931
Damn it

708
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:40,519
You said you can't kill people
Is this a moral issue?

709
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,900
No, this is our action.
Essential principles

710
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:49,569
You have uprooted this principle.

711
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:50,862
Then I'll be relieved.

712
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:53,865
That's good.

713
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:56,201
What?

714
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:58,328
Can't we just keep it secret?

715
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:02,165
Since it is not about conscience
Isn't it okay to just not let anyone know?

716
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,459
As long as we act like this, won't we be unaffected?

717
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:08,296
Berlin

718
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:09,881
dad

719
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:11,925
I said that's not the case.

720
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:13,301
dad

721
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:16,054
Dad, listen to me.

722
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,808
Don't live like me.

723
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:22,728
What are you saying suddenly?

724
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,857
These are probably all excuses.

725
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:31,278
But I don't have a penny in my pocket
There's no ink in my stomach

726
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:35,323
I have a son

727
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:40,579
Dad wants to raise you well, but it's not easy

728
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:45,417
You mean I've grown ugly?

729
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:47,711
That's not what I meant.

730
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:53,925
I'm done with drama in this life.

731
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:59,598
But at least I wanted to let you

732
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,851
To live decently

733
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:12,819
- In the past your mother...
- The cough comes again

734
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,614
Listen to this

735
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:20,744
Before your mother left us

736
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:23,205
Guess what she said during her last visit to the prison?

737
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:25,749
at last

738
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:30,003
You will follow my path

739
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:33,757
I've been struggling not to let you wade into this muddy water

740
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:35,509
dad

741
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,386
This is a father-son inheritance

742
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,639
What's wrong with us being similar?

743
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:45,560
You always get into trouble

744
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:47,979
In and out of prison

745
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:51,149
There is no lower point in life than this, right?

746
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,902
I think this is all my fault.

747
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,864
I feel really bad.

748
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,788
Okay, I never thought of that even once.

749
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:06,957
Zexiu

750
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:14,923
This time we

751
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:17,759
Finish it well

752
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:19,886
After successful completion

753
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:23,640
We are like others

754
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:26,560
Live an ordinary, decent life

755
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,689
Yeah, got it.

756
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:35,485
I'm getting goosebumps. Please stop doing this.

757
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:38,363
sorry

758
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:41,783
dad

759
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:43,493
-Um?
-Are you crying?

760
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:45,328
Why am I crying?

761
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:48,748
You really can't cry, try crying for me

762
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:49,749
knew

763
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:01,720
Ah, Dad!

764
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:04,389
What do you think? This is already spilled water.

765
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:08,185
If the police want to confirm
What to do if the hostages are alive or dead?

766
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:10,228
I'll think of a solution then.

767
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:13,148
Don't say such irresponsible things.

768
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:15,442
I asked you if you have a clear plan

769
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,152
If not

770
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:20,405
Then you have to take responsibility for screwing up the original plan.

771
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:22,574
So what do you want to do?

772
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:26,036
The plan you mean
Is it to hand over on-site command to Tokyo?

773
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:28,246
I think most people are on my side.

774
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,497
Ah, it's over.

775
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:32,500
Someone tried to open the door

776
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:36,171
The printing house door opened

777
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:00,403
He is not armed, so he is a hostage?

778
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:01,947
I'll go check it out

779
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:05,951
All the troops gathered in front of the main gate

780
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:32,727
It was confirmed to be an unidentified middle-aged man.

781
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:33,687
Seems to surrender

782
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:37,023
All team members remain vigilant to deal with emergencies

783
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:47,534
A team maintains range to ensure personal safety

784
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:50,328
The team remained alert while approaching the target

785
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:57,502
Oh shit!

786
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:00,839
Dad!

787
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:04,426
Another one came out

788
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,430
Dad, get down.

789
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,181
Dad, you have to cover your face.

790
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:13,435
Masked and armed

791
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:24,571
Can't show them my face.

792
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,197
You lie down

793
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:29,367
That's good.

794
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,287
You come with me

795
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:37,250
But the woman's father will say that I killed her.

796
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:38,668
Do you understand?

797
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:43,840
Dad, are you crazy?

798
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:45,717
Even if things turn out like this

799
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:49,471
For our surrender
They will commute our sentences.

800
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:54,726
I shouldn't have brought you here in the first place.

801
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:56,853
Didn’t you say you wanted to start a new life?

802
00:55:56,936 --> 00:56:00,023
Yes, I want to give you a new path in life.

803
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:04,819
I don't want you to be a killer, kid.

804
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:07,989
I really didn't kill anyone!

805
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:13,286
That guy looks like a robber.

806
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,412
Is it time to rescue the hostages now?

807
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:17,874
Both are robbers.

808
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:20,627
What?

809
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:23,046
If you want to prevent the hostages from escaping

810
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:24,589
He had already shot

811
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:28,009
Sniper team on standby

812
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:34,808
- Professor, what should we do now?
-What else?

813
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,184
What can be changed by being quiet?

814
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:37,268
I'll go there

815
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,065
What can you solve by running out alone?

816
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:43,691
Is this a Hollywood movie?

817
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,402
Are we just going to leave these two alone?

818
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:47,987
You need to have a plan first.

819
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,074
- Am I right, professor?
-Do you have any solution?

820
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:55,662
I don't know if the professor still trusts me.

821
00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:01,793
How can I believe you now that you say that?

822
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:03,962
I really didn't kill anyone.

823
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:06,047
That woman is still alive.

824
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:09,175
If you don’t believe me, just ask Tokyo!

825
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:12,512
Really?

826
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:18,059
What's this?

827
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:19,978
We know you two are robbers.

828
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:22,397
There are three sniper teams aiming now.

829
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:26,568
You can't go back, and you can't escape.

830
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:28,778
So put down your weapons and surrender!

831
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:31,156
dad

832
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:33,324
-go out!
-Get out!

833
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:34,284
Move fast!

834
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:36,870
The selected personnel will perform a special task

835
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:38,705
What is this for? Are you going to execute us?

836
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:41,791
What's going on? Didn't you talk to the police?

837
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:42,876
Don't yell

838
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:46,004
Just remember that any rash action will shorten your life.

839
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:48,089
don't want

840
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:53,303
Get out!

841
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,723
Could it be that there was a conflict among the robbers?

842
00:57:58,349 --> 00:57:59,601
Just arrest them and ask them.

843
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:01,895
As long as we catch these two people

844
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,897
It's only a matter of time before this kidnapping case ends.

845
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:07,484
Keep an eye on people with weapons

846
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:09,277
Better to subdue and capture alive

847
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:13,072
Someone came out from the front door again.

848
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:58,660
I can't tell the difference between the robbers and the hostages.

849
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:01,496
All of them carry guns

850
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:04,874
professor

851
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:08,169
What's my plan?

852
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:11,047
I appreciate your ability to adapt but it's too risky

853
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:13,424
If the hostages try to escape...

854
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:15,593
The hostages won't play tricks anymore.

855
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:17,887
They have witnessed

856
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,681
What is the result of the trick?

857
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:21,015
This is the nature of human beings

858
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:23,017
Bow down if threatened

859
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:25,186
Once you get the chance, bite back

860
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:27,355
To completely control these humans

861
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:29,649
Can only instill fear

862
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:33,861
Of course I respect your lofty ideals.

863
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:36,781
And know that Tokyo follows your orders

864
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:38,700
but

865
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:42,495
Where there is light, there is shadow

866
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:44,747
I am just responsible for playing the role of Yin

867
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:47,792
So that you can continue to shine

868
00:59:58,386 --> 00:59:59,721
Your current behavior

869
00:59:59,804 --> 01:00:02,807
Not only did he put the hostages in danger, he also put himself in danger.

870
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:04,809
I demand that you lay down your weapons immediately!

871
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:06,561
We're not trying to fight!

872
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:08,688
We will go back obediently

873
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,315
That's why you should lay down your weapons!

874
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:12,900
Just watch? Do something!

875
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,820
Rash actions will only make the situation more complicated.

876
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:17,989
Really

877
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:22,619
Dad, put this on first.

878
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:25,622
Put this on first and cover your face.

879
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:33,046
Hey, it should be less than 100 meters from here to there, right?

880
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:35,256
Chief, be careful, you might get shot.

881
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:40,136
Is it true that the woman in Tokyo is still alive?

882
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:41,346
It's alive, yes.

883
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:43,640
Denver doesn't have the guts to kill people

884
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,391
He is your son, you should know better, right?

885
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,852
I told you to pretend to kill her.
Then he hid her in the basement.

886
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:50,188
It's because of that guy in Berlin that I didn't tell anyone

887
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:51,814
Hey, what did you just say?

888
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:52,732
Berlin

889
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:54,901
You said you would use fear to control

890
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:57,195
Does this only apply to hostages?

891
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:58,321
What?

892
01:00:58,404 --> 01:01:00,073
After the video in the watch was leaked

893
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:02,825
The members have also changed as you expected.

894
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:04,327
Did you design all this?

895
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:08,623
How could that be?

896
01:01:20,426 --> 01:01:22,136
Is what you just said true?

897
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:25,223
What happened? Damn it.
Are you going to snitch to Berlin like a bitch?

898
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:27,308
- You kid
- No time.

899
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:28,643
Let's go back and talk first

900
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:31,646
What tricks are you playing to make others suffer?

901
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:32,814
shut up

902
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:33,731
-Helsinki
-clear

903
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:36,317
I know, tell me if it's true.

904
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:38,778
You bastard, why don’t we go in and talk?
No time for nonsense!

905
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:40,446
What are you talking about?

906
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,073
You are such an idiot!

907
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:44,826
- Hey, really.
-What are you two doing?

908
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:47,245
Hold still you bastards!

909
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:49,872
Come over here and I'll shoot! Don't move!

910
01:01:50,748 --> 01:01:51,708
