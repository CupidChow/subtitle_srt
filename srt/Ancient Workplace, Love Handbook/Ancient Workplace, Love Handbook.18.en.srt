00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,260
=Episode 18=

3
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,020
(Arrangement Office)

4
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:44,520
Mr. Yan.

5
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:49,880
Mr. Yan.

6
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,640
I personally bought it for you.

7
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,580
I didn't do anything.

8
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,220
Princess Zhenzhen,

9
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,260
haven't you heard

10
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,980
a melon forced
off its vine isn't sweet?

11
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:08,820
You can't force a cow

12
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,480
to drink water
by holding its head down.

13
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,060
I like forcing things.

14
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,400
I will make the cow drink water.

15
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,620
So, did you succeed in forcing things

16
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,860
or making the cow drink?

17
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,020
None of your business.

18
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,760
I bear the responsibility of uniting
the two cities through marriage.

19
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,140
Why is she pestering Mr. Yan now?

20
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,460
Princess.

21
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,220
Did Mr. Yan accept your pastries?

22
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,580
It's because of that Xu Xinglan.

23
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,800
If she hadn't messed it up,

24
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:02,800
he wouldn't have refused.

25
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,570
Princess,

26
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:05,740
haven't you noticed?

27
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,380
After Mr. Yan came back

28
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,700
after being away for a while,

29
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,800
he seemed closer to Miss Xu.

30
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,580
You noticed it too?

31
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:15,320
Do you think your marriage
with Mr. Yan might fall through?

32
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,070
You said it in front
of the madam and Miss Xu...

33
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,300
If you hadn't said
he cared for me so much,

34
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,810
how could I have thought
this marriage was almost a done deal?

35
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,000
What should we do now?

36
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,990
I'll have to think of another plan.

37
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,420
Are you awake?

38
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:01,900
Yuwen Yan.

39
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,980
What were you just doing?

40
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,180
Reading.

41
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:06,980
No.

42
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,900
You were hugging Zhenzhen.

43
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:12,980
I don't care.

44
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,580
In my dream, you were hugging her.

45
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,140
Madam.

46
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,180
You didn't see how arrogant she was.

47
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,140
The mansion

48
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,660
is in chaos because of her.

49
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,420
Mother,

50
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,660
I wasn't this scared

51
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,000
even on my first battlefield.

52
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:36,900
She even took

53
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,100
my wedding handkerchief.

54
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,740
Madam.

55
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,900
She's clearly disrespecting you.

56
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,340
She's disrespecting me.

57
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,540
She's ruining our reputation.

58
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,740
If this goes on,

59
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,340
I'm afraid my marriage to Mr. Jun...

60
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,340
Yunxin.

61
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,880
I didn't expect this princess

62
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,440
to be such a troublemaker.

63
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,340
This concerns the alliance

64
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,460
between Xiliang

65
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,900
and Anjin.

66
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,260
We cannot let peace be disrupted.

67
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,460
Madam,

68
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,500
what should we do?

69
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:17,980
Don't worry.

70
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,600
I have another plan.

71
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,700
(Yuwen Qi, third son of the City Lord)

72
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,580
- Qi.
- Qi?

73
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,060
So, that is

74
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,580
what happened.

75
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,470
So, Mother,

76
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,140
you urgently called me back

77
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,030
just to marry that Xiliang princess?

78
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,620
Mother,

79
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,140
am I really your biological son?

80
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,820
What nonsense are you saying?

81
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,260
Look, your eldest and second brothers

82
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,300
both have wives now.

83
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,620
You're the only one

84
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,660
still single.

85
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,060
So, tell me.

86
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,460
Who else can I turn to for help?

87
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,540
But I...

88
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,680
What?

89
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,870
What do you want to say?

90
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,940
Let me ask you.

91
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,770
Do you have a girl you love?

92
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,420
The scope of "the girl I love"
is too narrow.

93
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,260
My dream is

94
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,420
to give every girl in the world a home.

95
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,220
(Scumbag.)

96
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,660
Where are you going?

97
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,820
I'm going to see that Xiliang princess.

98
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,820
Don't worry, everyone.

99
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,380
For your happiness,

100
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,260
I'll take this on without hesitation.

101
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,380
But Qi,

102
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,340
her methods

103
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,300
are hard to predict.

104
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,420
From my experience...

105
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,260
Experience?

106
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,620
Do I look like I don't have any?

107
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,860
So, how do you plan to act?

108
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,360
The wise have their strategies.

109
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,540
Mr. Qi

110
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,020
seems very confident.

111
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,540
Maybe

112
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,780
he really can solve this.

113
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,290
Princess Qinqin.

114
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,540
(Isn't this the girl I love?)

115
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,860
Who are you?

116
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm the one you're going
to fall in love with.

117
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,460
(Zhen)

118
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,220
Do you know which three people
in this world are the most beautiful?

119
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,980
That'd be me in the morning,

120
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,900
me at noon,

121
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,740
and me at night.

122
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,180
If you're uneducated,
go read more books.

123
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,420
My name is Zhenzhen.

124
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,640
Everyone else calls you Zhenzhen,

125
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,780
but you're different to me.

126
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,740
Uneducated rogue.

127
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,030
Report!

128
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,820
In the first clash,

129
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,100
Mr. Qi was defeated.

130
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,580
Defeated?

131
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,380
Wasn't Qi very confident?

132
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,580
Military texts say

133
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,020
that arrogance leads to defeat.

134
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,240
Scout again and report.

135
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,180
Yes.

136
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,020
No worries.

137
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,420
Seems it is
an unprecedented clash of masters.

138
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,500
Qi will fly his battle flag up front.

139
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,780
We'll hold firm

140
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,300
in the rear.

141
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,660
Let's all pray for Qi.

142
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,940
(Did I enchant her
without even making a move?)

143
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,180
What's that smell?

144
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,460
Even the most beautiful flowers

145
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,340
can't outshine...

146
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,850
That's my manure flower.

147
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,760
Why did you bring them here?

148
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,490
Report!

149
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,740
In the second clash,

150
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,180
Mr. Qi was defeated.

151
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,420
Defeated again?

152
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,820
Scout again

153
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,780
and report.

154
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,740
Yes.

155
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,500
I brewed some
brown sugar ginger tea for you.

156
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,620
Drink it while it's hot.

157
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,900
How did you know?

158
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,860
Don't ask me why I knew.

159
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,580
I just can't control my feelings.

160
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,820
Did this go bad?

161
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,340
Report!

162
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,700
In the third clash,

163
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,300
Mr. Qi first won

164
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,140
but then was defeated.

165
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,020
What does that mean?

166
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,820
It means he was defeated.

167
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,340
Scout again

168
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,260
and report.

169
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,300
Yes.

170
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,220
Report!

171
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:38,980
Report!

172
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,260
Report!

173
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,160
Report.

174
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,040
Report.

175
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,920
Report.

176
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,980
Stop reporting.

177
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,180
We surrender.
