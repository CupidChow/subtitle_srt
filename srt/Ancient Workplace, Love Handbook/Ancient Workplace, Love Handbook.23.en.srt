=Episode 23=

3
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,980
(Yanyu Pavilion)

4
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,150
Xinglan, you're awake.

5
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:53,710
What are you doing

6
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,070
in my room so early?

7
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:57,000
You have such big dark circles
under your eyes.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,350
Didn't sleep well last night?

9
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,150
Maybe it was
because the candlelit dinner

10
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,640
lasted too long last night.

11
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,510
What candlelit dinner?

12
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,390
You don't remember?

13
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,090
I'll go get your medicine.

14
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,070
What medicine?

15
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,070
I'm not sick.

16
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,220
(What's wrong with her?)

17
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,070
Xinglan.

18
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,150
- Where's Xinglan?
- Mr. Yan.

19
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,710
Miss Xu went to the office.

20
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,760
She's still sick.

21
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,230
How can she run around?

22
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,120
It seems her illness has improved.

23
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,260
(Arrangement Office)

24
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,350
Look, this is the course I planned.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,840
I didn't expect you

26
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,950
to have a talent for teaching.

27
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:08,630
Xinglan.

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,960
Drink your medicine.

29
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,190
Are you sick?

30
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,520
I just overslept.

31
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,410
What medicine
do you need for oversleeping?

32
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,680
This medicine isn't bitter.

33
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,710
You have 15 minutes to talk.

34
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,430
Tell her what you have to say.

35
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,280
Once you're done, I'll take her away.

36
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,800
Come on, I...

37
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,590
This is a travel guide.

38
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,800
This is Xiliang.

39
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,080
Help me take a look.

40
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,310
Xinglan hasn't been to Xiliang.

41
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,470
You can discuss these

42
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,310
with the other female officials
at the office.

43
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,630
I can also arrange
for some experienced travelers

44
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,490
to guide you.

45
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,520
In any case, don't bother her

46
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,800
with these matters anymore.

47
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,190
- I can help...
- You can't.

48
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,550
Let's go.

49
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,360
Wait.

50
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,740
Didn't you say we have 15 minutes?

51
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,590
I haven't even said anything!

52
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,430
It's just to look at something.

53
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,310
Is this necessary?

54
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,080
There are other people
at the office too.

55
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,310
I'll have them help you
share the load more.

56
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,430
I'm fine.

57
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,370
You slept for a whole day and night,

58
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,360
and after waking up,
you forgot so many things.

59
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,030
How could you be fine?

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,590
The body is mine,

61
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,400
so the time for you to control it
will surely become less.

62
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,360
(It seems the dream is real.)

63
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,530
Okay, okay.

64
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,100
I promise I won't go to the office
for the next few days.

65
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,960
I'll rest.

66
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:44,840
Is that okay?

67
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,470
Alright.

68
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,700
Young Master,

69
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,130
why did you send for me so late?

70
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,280
Starting tomorrow,

71
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,150
look for folk physicians who can treat
difficult illnesses.

72
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,910
Once found,

73
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,000
bring them back quickly.

74
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,200
Yes.

75
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,940
Greet the City Lord of Xiliang
on behalf of Father.

76
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,780
Yes.

77
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,540
Qi,

78
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,950
be more composed from now on.

79
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,690
Alright, alright.

80
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,930
After you finish the inspection,

81
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,160
the Xiliang Travel Agency
should be established.

82
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,930
By then, you'll make a fortune.

83
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,340
Don't forget to share some with me.

84
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,980
Take the official road.

85
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,020
The small road isn't safe.

86
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,420
Got it, Yan.

87
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,420
When did you become so naggy?

88
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,900
Princess, remember to write.

89
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,930
Safe travels.

90
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,970
Remember to come for fun.

91
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:02,940
If there's a chance,

92
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,860
Yunxin and I

93
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:04,900
will go to Xiliang.

94
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,020
It's getting late.

95
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,340
You should hit the road early.

96
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,780
Take care.

97
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,700
Take care.

98
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,180
Are you serious, Mother?

99
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,380
How could I use this to deceive you?

100
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,610
Jun and Qi

101
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,100
are already married.

102
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,860
Only you two aren't in a hurry.

103
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,220
Your father

104
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,900
had someone predict this.

105
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,070
The day after three months is perfect.

106
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,500
You and Xinglan will get married.

107
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,420
Three months?

108
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,280
What, Xinglan?

109
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,580
Is that too late?

110
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,500
No, no, no.

111
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,420
I just feel it's too sudden.

112
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,940
I haven't prepared anything.

113
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,900
What do you need to prepare?

114
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,780
Mother is right.

115
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,460
You don't need to prepare anything.

116
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,100
Just attend the wedding.

117
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,100
(Arrangement Office)

118
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,210
Why do I always feel like

119
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,220
the school is so empty?

120
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,780
Miss,

121
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,900
the princess suddenly
took away half the people.

122
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,220
Of course, it's empty here.

123
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:23,820
What about mine?

124
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,860
This is the brush Zhenzhen used.

125
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,420
Keep it as a memento.

126
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,340
Do you miss her that much?

127
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,500
If one day I also go far away,

128
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,500
will you miss me?

129
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,260
What if I go far away?

130
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,940
I'll definitely miss you.

131
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,380
I'll think of you

132
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,340
day and night.

133
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,020
No.

134
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,570
If you go far away, I'll surely follow.

135
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,700
How could you
have the chance to go alone?

136
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,730
Miss,

137
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,100
Mr. Qi and the others
are going for an inspection.

138
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,540
Maybe they'll return

139
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,860
soon after the inspection is over.

140
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,700
Mr. Yan.

141
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,740
Mr. Yan.

142
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,280
You're from the inspection team.

143
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,040
They were ambushed
ten miles outside the city.

144
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,840
Mr. Qi and the princess
are being attacked.

145
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,820
Mr. Yan, hurry and bring people
to rescue them.

146
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,260
Young Master.

147
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,380
The guards are ready.

148
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,380
Let's go.

149
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,860
Don't worry; nothing will happen.

150
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,580
They're back! They're back!

151
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,750
- Who's back?
- Everyone's back!

152
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,900
What happened?

153
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,060
We've captured the enemy.

154
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,500
Qi was slightly injured.

155
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,540
What about you? Are you injured?

156
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,580
I'm fine.

157
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,580
Miss Xu,

158
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,980
I'm the one who got injured.

159
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,700
Who told you to act recklessly

160
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,020
and stand in front?

161
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,660
Luckily, Yan had a plan,

162
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,380
or we might have fallen into their trap.

163
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,620
Had a plan?

164
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,780
There might be an ambush?

165
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,460
Recently, several forces
have been lurking outside the city.

166
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,780
We think they are after the princess.

167
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,940
Your journey won't be smooth.

168
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,440
Then tomorrow...

169
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,030
You must protect the princess tomorrow.

170
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,180
I've made arrangements on the way.

171
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,300
It's good that you all returned safely.

172
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:44,440
Glad you're safe.

173
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,280
Later, I'll report to the City Lord

174
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,240
and hold a banquet for you
to calm your nerves.

175
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,100
Sounds good.

176
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:58,500
(Yanyu Pavilion)

177
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,740
What's wrong?

178
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,140
You said it.

179
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,540
The spies want to remove Zhenzhen

180
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,300
to incite conflict
between the two cities.

181
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,780
But

182
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,820
you've killed Yun Ying.

183
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,940
Who else would target her?

184
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,980
This is quite complicated.

185
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,700
I'm still investigating.

186
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,060
Is that so?

187
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,780
What's that reaction?

188
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,140
It's nothing; I just...

189
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,060
Are you okay?

190
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,190
I'm just a bit dizzy.

191
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,660
Put me down.

192
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,020
You must be very tired today.

193
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,220
I am tired.

194
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,900
I can't even carry you anymore.

195
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,300
How dare you scare me!

196
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,090
- Let's go.
- Yuwen Yan!

197
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,100
Are you out of your mind?

199
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,300
Well.

200
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,540
I'm getting ready to sleep.

201
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,660
Mr. Yan, why are you still here?

202
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,940
I'll stay here with you tonight.

203
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,940
You're becoming more and more unruly.

204
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,580
We've set our wedding date.

205
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,440
Why should I care about these rules?

206
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,780
Then I'll sleep first. Good night.

207
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,580
Good night.
