=Episode 15=

3
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,710
How is she?

4
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,390
The princess ate too much food.

5
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:49,470
It's nothing serious.

6
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,030
I'll prescribe some medicines
to help with digestion.

7
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,430
Who gave her all this food?

8
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:54,630
Mr. Yan.

9
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,470
The princess asked
for all of it herself.

10
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,600
Didn't I instruct you?

11
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,640
Everything she has
must be shown to me first.

12
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,820
(Yuwen Yan)

13
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:15,710
Xinglan.

14
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,760
I heard what happened this morning.

15
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,000
He can marry whoever he wants.

16
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,430
None of my business.

17
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,000
Mr. Yan is getting married?

18
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,190
Yeah.

19
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,710
The princess said it.

20
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,510
Is there some misunderstanding
between you two?

21
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,790
Like the one Jun and I had.

22
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,330
How could there be a misunderstanding?

23
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,950
You haven't seen him,

24
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,350
always fussing over her,

25
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,120
treating her like a treasure.

26
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,340
Clearly, they have feelings
for each other.

27
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,270
Besides,

28
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,430
she's a princess.

29
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,560
And I'm just someone
with an unknown past.

30
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,150
(I'm an assassin.)

31
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,320
No way.

32
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,760
We've all seen

33
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,950
Mr. Yan's feelings for you.

34
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,560
There must be some misunderstanding.

35
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,630
Come on,
I'll take you to clear things up.

36
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,590
I'm not going.

37
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,840
You told me

38
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,470
to always ask
for clarity on everything.

39
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,030
When it comes to you,

40
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,520
why can't you see it?

41
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,150
(Yeah.)

42
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,360
(Xu Xinglan.)

43
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,710
(Why are you being such a coward?)

44
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,120
Forget it.

45
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,630
It's not a big deal.

46
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,910
If they're getting married,

47
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,030
I wish them a happy union.

00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,920
Xinglan.

68
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,060
- Mr. Yan.
- Mr. Yan.

69
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,950
Where did you go last night?

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,680
Why didn't you return to Yanyu Pavilion?

71
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,590
I was afraid

72
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,490
staying at your place
would be inconvenient.

73
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,750
What do you mean by that?

74
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,310
Have you been avoiding me lately?

75
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,350
No.

76
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,720
Then how about

77
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,720
we go to the new restaurant
in the city tonight?

78
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,560
No.

79
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,820
How about play mahjong
with Jun and Miss Zhong?

80
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,270
Not interested.

81
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,680
Then let's...

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,270
No, no, no.

83
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,380
What exactly do you want?

84
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,830
I just wanted to ask you

85
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,190
how to confess my feelings

86
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,600
to the girl I love.

87
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:50,270
Oh, you've fallen in love.

88
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,240
Well, girls these days

89
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,000
all love romance, right?

90
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,570
Fireflies,

91
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,240
a sea of flowers,

92
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,590
and candlelit dinners.

93
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,770
You can watch the snow,

94
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,000
the stars, and the moon.

95
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,590
Besides,

96
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,510
you've had feelings for each other.

97
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,630
Feelings for each other?

98
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,430
You think it over.

99
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,500
I'll get back to work.

100
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,070
Feelings for each other...

101
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,560
Xinglan?

102
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,600
What's wrong with you?

103
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,470
I'm fine.

104
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,120
I just want to stay
at your place tonight.

105
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,240
Don't kick me out.

106
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,240
What's going on?

107
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,000
I've been busy at the office recently.

108
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,630
Going to Yanyu Pavilion
is such a hassle.

109
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,800
Going here is more convenient.

110
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,750
But from Yanyu Pavilion to the office

111
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,310
only takes about 15 minutes.

112
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,000
From here to the office...

113
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,510
Alright, Yunxin.

114
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,870
I just want

115
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:09,720
some peace here.

116
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,600
I don't want to go back

117
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,870
to see someone

118
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,430
caring for that princess every day.

119
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,030
Yunxin.

120
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,290
On the wedding day, I think...

121
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,950
Miss Xu?

122
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,420
What's wrong with her?

123
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,190
She's arguing with Mr. Yan.

124
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,320
You should leave.

125
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,000
Then let me make you some snacks.

126
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,590
No, I'm not hungry.

127
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,130
How about I warm up your bed for you?

128
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,430
No need.

129
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,070
Let me add a heater. It's getting cold.

130
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,870
Just go; stop nagging. Go.

131
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,190
Looks like
it's not so peaceful here after all.

132
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,870
He's too much of a nag.

133
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,560
You should be grateful.

134
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,800
Mr. Jun treats you very well.

135
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,590
Don't worry.

136
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,070
You can stay here tonight.

137
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,240
No one's going to disturb us.

138
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,440
Indeed.

139
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,750
Friends are more reliable than men.

140
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,700
(Arrangement Office)

141
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,240
(Still not here at this hour.)

142
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,160
(Can't even bother
to show up for work?)

143
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,430
(Their marriage)

144
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,630
(should be settled soon.)

145
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,390
(In the end, I don't belong here.)

146
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,240
(Looks like I should go back.)

147
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,470
Miss!

148
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,070
Miss!

149
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,950
Miss, don't scare me!

150
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:55,790
Miss!

151
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,760
Miss!

152
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,190
Miss!

153
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,220
(Arrangement Office)

154
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,840
Young Master!

155
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,630
What are you doing,
rushing around like that?

156
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,750
Miss Xu...

157
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,880
I know.

158
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,870
I was going to bring her back
to Yanyu Pavilion.

159
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,160
No, I...

160
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,120
I got it.

161
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,120
Care for her more, and argue less.

162
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,390
No, that's not...

163
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,430
And be sincere and warm, right?

164
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,440
No...

165
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,750
- Young Master.
- What's wrong?

166
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,160
Miss Xu, she...

167
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,190
She fainted.

168
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,340
- Why didn't you say so earlier?
- I...

169
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,600
You didn't give me a chance.

170
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,440
Young Master.

171
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,840
Xinglan.

172
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,840
Xinglan.

173
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,630
Yan, you've really disappointed me.

174
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,200
How is Xinglan?

175
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,150
Do you still care about Xinglan?

176
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,280
Yunxin.

177
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,640
The physician said

178
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,130
Miss Xu caught a cold a few days ago

179
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,140
and didn't rest well.

180
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:51,990
And she was upset.

181
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:52,950
That's why she fainted.

182
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,790
Alright.

183
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,790
Let's all leave.

184
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,510
Stay and keep her company.

185
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,440
Miss, you're awake.

186
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,720
Have I been asleep long?

187
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,030
You've been unconscious
for an entire day.

188
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,320
Mr. Yan came,

189
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,120
but the princess called him away again.

190
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,390
Thank you for your concern.

191
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:02,750
I'm feeling better now.

192
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,840
That's a relief.

193
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,490
Good to know you're alright.

194
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,750
Princess, rest early.

195
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,590
I'll take my leave.

196
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,440
Mr. Yan, take care.

197
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,280
Xinglan.

198
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,920
You're awake.

199
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,650
How are you feeling now?

200
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,360
I'm alright; I'm not going to die.

201
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,320
Why are your eyes red?

202
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,910
It's my fault for neglecting you

203
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,550
these past few days.

204
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,040
Actually,

205
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,390
I have something to say.

206
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,560
Perfect.

207
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,600
I have something to say, too.

208
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,120
This place is...

209
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,440
How is it?

210
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,800
Yuwen Yan.

211
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,720
I've caused you quite a bit of trouble

212
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,360
while staying at the mansion.

213
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,200
Thank you for taking care of me.

214
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,590
Why are you suddenly

215
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,030
saying such things?

216
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:25,480
I don't belong here;
I only came here by accident.

217
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,560
It's time I go back.

218
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,110
Goodbye.
