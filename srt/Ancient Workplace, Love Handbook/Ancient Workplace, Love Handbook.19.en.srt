=Episode 19=

3
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,310
Why haven't I seen you
with Zhenzhen these days?

4
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,710
Have you admitted defeat?

5
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,560
Everything is under control.

6
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,600
So confident?

7
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,700
(The Flirtation Quotes)
With the secret manual,

8
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,810
I have true love.

9
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,990
Could this even be published?

10
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,040
You wrote it?

11
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,030
It's one of the top three bestsellers
in major bookstores.

12
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,480
If you weren't my brother,

13
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,920
I wouldn't even give it to you.

14
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,120
I'm off.

15
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,520
Xinglan.

16
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,430
What's up?

17
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,870
Do you feel lonely?

18
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,870
You live in my heart all alone,

19
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,280
with not even a neighbor.

20
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,920
Where did you learn that?

21
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,380
(The Flirtation Quotes)

22
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,230
Corny pickup lines are so out of style.

23
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,040
Some of these are things
he heard from me.

24
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,350
I think it's quite nice.

25
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,510
Today,
Qi said everything was under control.

26
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,280
Maybe the princess
will like this approach.

27
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,660
(Arrangement Office)

28
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,430
Mr. Yan,

29
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,360
I haven't had any appetite
for meals lately.

30
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,520
Can you stay with me tonight?

31
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,000
If you have no appetite, don't eat.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,120
He's not pickled vegetables.

33
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,440
What's so appetizing about him?

34
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,430
Come on.

35
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,560
Mr. Yan.

36
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,870
Why is it you again?

37
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,360
How could it be anyone else?

38
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:36,790
Mr. Yan.

39
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,870
(Tempting you with my charming face.)

40
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,470
(Don't you find it enticing?)

41
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,280
Stop bothering me.

42
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,840
Good morning.

43
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,470
Has your injury healed?

44
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,240
Seeing you has healed all my wounds.

45
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,870
Which courtyard are you from?

46
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,710
Why are you so idle?

47
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,960
Actually, I am...

48
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,960
I don't care who you are.

49
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,030
You're being persistent,

50
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,680
a trick I've long mastered.

51
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,120
(Looks like a tough nut to crack.)

52
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,190
(But that's okay.)

53
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,870
(It's for the happiness of my brothers.)

54
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,430
Yan.

55
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,280
Miss Xu.

56
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,470
Why aren't you with Zhenzhen?

57
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,910
What are you doing here?

58
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,030
I didn't expect her
to be this difficult.

59
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,680
Mr. Qi.

60
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,280
Don't say that.

61
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,030
There's always a way out.

62
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,630
So, I need to change my strategy.

63
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,940
(New Book Launch)

64
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,080
(Qiqi's Travelogue, Volume 2)

65
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,960
Ladies.

66
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,240
(New Book Launch)
This is my latest travelogue.

67
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,400
I hope everyone supports it.

68
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,590
Mr. Qi, can I get your autograph?

69
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,430
Of course.

70
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,470
- I want one too.
- I want to see.

71
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,820
What's going on with Qi now?

72
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,750
No rush, one at a time.

73
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,520
He said this was a new strategy.

74
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,310
Thank you, Mr. Qi.

75
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,470
Mr. Qi is a talented young man.

76
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,910
Such beautiful writing.

77
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,840
Right.

78
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,660
- Indeed.
- I'll treasure this.

79
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,030
Busy men are the most charming.

80
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,190
Thank you, Mr. Qi.

81
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,310
You're truly talented.

82
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,390
Yes.

83
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,480
You're flattering me.

84
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,560
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

85
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,800
(So, he's the third son
of the City Lord.)

86
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,960
Qi is a travel enthusiast

87
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,480
and a bestselling author.

88
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,000
His persona

89
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,750
makes him quite the winner in life.

90
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,080
Compared to me,

91
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,360
he's still a bit lacking.

92
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,360
- You really are...
- But he's still good.

93
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,730
Well.

94
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,240
Could you do me a favor?

95
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,180
(Arrangement Office)

96
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,040
You both can first review
each other's resumes.

97
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,340
A male.

98
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,700
(Yuwen Qi)
Loves females.

99
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,970
Why didn't you fill out
the weaknesses section?

100
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,870
I have many weaknesses.

101
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,560
My biggest weakness

102
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,240
is being without you.

103
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,380
Then I'll be straightforward.

104
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,240
I am

105
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,180
decisive

106
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,120
and easygoing.

107
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,290
(Dominant and proactive.)

108
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,800
I was born loving freedom.

109
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,120
(A playboy.)

110
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,240
I'm pure and kind.

111
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,310
I believe in true love.

112
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,330
(Looks like there's no one special.)

113
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,080
(Still single now.)

114
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,720
I've been hurt in love,

115
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,950
so I know
how to take care of a girl better.

116
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,200
(Experienced in relationships.)

117
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,390
(But none ended well.)

118
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,390
Alright, let's wrap it up for today.

119
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,510
You can go now.

120
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,950
He just

121
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,350
sent her away like that?

122
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,190
That's not very gentlemanly.

123
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,800
To catch, let go.

124
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,950
To refuse, yet invite.

125
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,040
That's called strategy.

126
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:10,600
Don't you think Princess Zhenzhen
is a bit strange?

127
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,310
She used to refuse,

128
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,390
but now she's taking
the initiative to date.

129
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,600
Qi has failed several times.

130
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,770
Now he's playing hard to get.

131
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,430
He should be able
to handle the princess.

132
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,830
Definitely not.

133
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,750
Not with this cheap shot.

134
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,190
I actually see some hope.

135
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,870
Let's make a bet.

136
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,430
Whoever loses

137
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,360
has to serve the other for three days.

138
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,350
Deal.

139
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,300
(Yanyu Pavilion)

140
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,510
Getting married?

141
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,510
Getting married?

142
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,560
Are you surprised?

143
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,480
Is it unexpected?

144
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,270
Is it real?

145
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,410
Have you thought it through?

146
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,480
Of course. This is for you two.

147
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,100
(Yuwen Qi; Zhenzhen)
So quick?

148
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,390
In the face of true love,

149
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,030
these aren't issues.

150
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,180
But I heard

151
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,550
Mr. Qi

152
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,480
is unreliable and idle.

153
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,920
I like that kind

154
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,270
of carefree character.

155
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,550
She's knowledgeable, sensible,

156
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,880
graceful, virtuous,

157
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,600
beautiful inside and out,

158
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,040
intelligent, and kind.

159
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,610
They say Mr. Qi is not ambitious

160
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,560
and doesn't even have

161
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,870
his courtyard in the mansion.

162
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,480
He treats money like dirt.

163
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,680
I didn't expect him

164
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,840
to be so noble.

165
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,450
He's always surrounded

166
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,320
by beautiful ladies.

167
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,000
That's a charm

168
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,270
that ordinary men don't have.

169
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,320
I like that.

170
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,600
Marriage

171
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,870
is not a joke.

172
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,040
You should think it over

173
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,680
to avoid regret later.

174
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,480
If I don't marry Mr. Qi,

175
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,810
how about I continue

176
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,160
to steal your fiances?

177
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,160
- Congrats.
- Congrats.

178
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,430
For the happiness of my two brothers,

179
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,500
for the friendly relations
between the two cities,

180
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,730
and to stop being pressured
by Mother to marry,

181
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,790
it's my responsibility.

182
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,020
I'll definitely

183
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,150
marry her.

184
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,020
What a perfect match.

185
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,270
This wedding is happening too fast,

186
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,600
like a roller coaster.

187
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,360
We need to hurry too.

188
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,390
You two insisted

189
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,910
on Xiliang's simple customs.

190
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,000
But I feel it's a bit unfair to you.

191
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,480
No need for too many formalities.

192
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,910
Just let Xiliang know about my marriage

193
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,240
to Mr. Qi as soon as possible.

194
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,510
Of course.

195
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,320
Qi has been

196
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,080
traveling for years.

197
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,630
His ambitions aren't at home,

198
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,720
and he doesn't want us
to prepare a house for him.

199
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,790
This bracelet is
a congratulatory gift for you two.

200
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,000
The rest of the betrothal gifts

201
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,440
are already on their way to Xiliang.

202
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,240
Thank you, Madam.

203
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,000
Did you forget

204
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,120
about our bet?

205
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,900
(Arrangement Office)

206
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,630
Distinguished Young Master,

207
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,480
fruits and snacks.

208
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,610
Tea and breakfast.

209
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,750
They are all ready.

210
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,720
Welcome to your duty.

211
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,480
The bet

212
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,360
was just a joke.

213
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,360
How could I let you do these things?

214
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:45,910
After we get married,

215
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,440
I'll handle everything.

216
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,550
I won't need to do anything?

217
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,910
Then

218
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,690
what about sweeping and washing dishes?

219
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,630
What about doing laundry and cooking?

220
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:56,790
I'll do it.

221
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,830
What about making the bed?

222
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,870
I'll do it.

223
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,030
Mr. Yan, Miss.

224
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,390
How can you two do it?

225
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,240
What about me?

226
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,080
Let me handle it.

227
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,120
I'll take care of it.
