=Episode 5=

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
(I can't ask him for it.)

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,840
(Peace and Eternity)

5
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,350
(But what if I accidentally
wander into his room)

6
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,710
(and the ledger
fell into my hands?)

7
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:47,710
(That'd be fine, right?)

8
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,960
(He didn't even lock the door.)

9
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,040
(He's so fair-skinned.)

10
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,400
Song Heng?

11
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,790
Leave everything for tomorrow.

12
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,760
I want to rest early tonight.

13
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,560
(I need to find the ledger quickly.)

14
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,790
(I can't let him find out.)

15
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,820
Where is it?

16
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,260
(Tao Te Ching)

17
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,000
Why isn't it here?

18
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,360
Not here either.

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,400
(Ledger)
Are you looking for this?

20
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,910
Yes, that's it.

21
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,750
How did you...

22
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,760
(Running into my room
in the middle of the night.)

23
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,030
(What exactly does she want?)

24
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,680
Good night, Mr. Yan. Rest early.

25
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,520
Stop.

26
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,470
This is my room,

27
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,590
not somewhere you can just

28
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,750
come and go as you please.

29
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,840
Let me tell you.

30
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,240
I'm the supervisor

31
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,240
appointed by the City Lord.

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,750
If anything happens to me...

33
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,590
Who's your superior?

34
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,030
What superior?

35
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,630
I don't even have a bottom line.

36
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,570
Who can be my superior?

37
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:14,850
What nonsense are you saying?

38
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,960
Sneaking into my room,

39
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,510
peeping while I bathe,
and now trying to steal the ledger,

40
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,870
what are you really up to?

41
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,870
Should I call everyone over

42
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,150
to see what your intentions are?

43
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,800
If you could speak to me properly,

44
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,800
would I need
to steal the ledger so late?

45
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,000
Madam promised me

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,690
that if I solve the issues
at the office,

47
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,710
you can...

48
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,800
What will I do?

49
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,080
Forget it.

50
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,310
You're intentionally
targeting me everywhere.

51
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,030
Xu Xinglan,
you could've kissed him just now.

52
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,030
Why didn't you?

53
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,000
Such a coward.

54
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,910
(I didn't get the ledger
and was humiliated by him.)

55
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:02,990
(Forget it.)

56
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,680
(I have plenty of methods.)

57
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,620
(Arrangement Office)

58
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,520
Eight of Characters.

59
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,550
Five of Characters.

60
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:10,990
Wait.

61
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,120
I won again.

62
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,520
Pay up, pay up.

63
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,870
Gambling in groups.

64
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,800
This is absurd.

65
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,470
Go, go, go.

66
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,440
Go.

67
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,070
Come catch me. Catch me.

68
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,430
- Don't run.
- Can't catch me.

69
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,470
Over here.

70
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,610
- If this goes on,
- Here.

71
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,270
the Arrangement Office

72
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,160
will be a mess.

73
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,950
- Gotcha.
- Oh my.

74
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,240
Miss, you're amazing.

75
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,670
Young Master,

76
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,720
I think Miss Xu is quite lively.

77
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,360
It's been a long time
since the office was this lively.

78
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,000
Miss, this duck is so cute.

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,190
This way, come on.

80
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,850
- Here.
- Catch me.

81
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:53,760
Over here. Over here.

82
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,950
- Here.
- Here.

83
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,000
Still trying to run?

84
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,630
This doesn't feel right.

85
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,560
What are you doing?

86
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,950
Didn't you see? We're playing.

87
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,830
This is ridiculous.

88
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,240
It's fine. Let's continue.

89
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,350
Mother.

90
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,720
Yan, why are you here?
Where's Xinglan?

91
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,920
This concerns our mansion.

92
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,360
I have to speak up.

93
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,310
Five, six, seven, eight.

94
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,800
What are you doing?

95
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,420
(Arrangement Office)

96
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,830
Tell me. What's going on?

97
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,680
What do you mean?

98
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,950
Xinglan.

99
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,040
The City Lord and I brought you
to the Arrangement Office...

100
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,070
To let me organize internal affairs.

101
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,160
I know.

102
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,160
Then why haven't you done anything?

103
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,720
I haven't done anything?

104
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,320
Pay up, pay up.

105
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,310
Come on, come on.

106
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,390
You lost all your living expenses to me.

107
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,120
What are you going to do this month?

108
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,480
It's okay; we still have some.

109
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,000
Are there other ways to earn money?

110
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,360
We're family now,

111
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,600
and when I

112
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
start making money,

113
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,160
I won't forget you.

114
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,800
We're playing mahjong together,

115
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,870
so I'll tell you this.

116
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,630
At the end of the month,

117
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,000
we can add a few more items

118
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,680
to the masters' purchase reports.

119
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,240
Then the money for playing
will come in.

120
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,800
(Falsifying accounts
and embezzling public funds.)

121
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,310
It's fine. Let's continue.

122
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,560
By the way,

123
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,480
why is the actual number of people here

124
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,040
fewer than the names on the list?

125
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,270
The registers are all our family.

126
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,160
Adding a name is easy.

127
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,600
(Management loopholes.)

128
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,120
(No wonder there is
a severe labor shortage.)

129
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,600
Let's go. Come on, let's continue.

130
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,430
Here we go. I won.

131
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,480
Come on, stick it on yourself.

132
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,830
We play mahjong like this every day.

133
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,190
If Miss Wei finds out,

134
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,260
will she report us?

135
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,290
Don't worry; Miss Wei is off duty.

136
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,750
We won't see her for at least

137
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,800
ten days or half a month.

138
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,070
She's off for that long?

139
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,430
Every position has

140
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,680
at least ten people.

141
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,040
If everyone takes turns once,

142
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,750
that's about ten days to half a month.

143
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,390
(It's severely overstaffed.)

144
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,920
(So, the payroll expenses are high.)

145
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,950
So,

146
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,720
you've done all this to understand

147
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,000
the situation at the Arrangement Office?

148
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,310
Yes, but not entirely,

149
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,950
because it's really fun.

150
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,270
Mother,

151
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,430
I told you.

152
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,920
She's still stubborn.

153
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,240
This is absurd.

154
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,310
Xinglan,

155
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,870
this is so fun.

156
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,920
You should invite me earlier next time.

157
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,630
Of course, no problem.

158
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,310
Mother, she...

159
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,250
What's wrong with her?

160
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,870
Do you have any prejudice
against her?

161
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,790
But I still need to tell you.

162
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,840
Xinglan.

163
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,000
If you want to investigate,

164
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,390
just investigate openly.

165
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,480
What's with going around in circles?

166
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,870
Some people accused me

167
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,550
of having ulterior motives

168
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,000
and sneaking around for secrets.

169
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,320
I'm afraid that'd be improper.

170
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,360
Who dares to say that?

171
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,120
I'll tear their mouths out.

172
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,240
If you need anything, just ask Yan.

173
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,320
I want the ledger for work purposes.

174
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,720
The ledger?

175
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,140
(Arrangement Office Ledger)

176
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,960
Madam.

177
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:37,990
Give me.

178
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,360
Here, Xinglan.

179
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,910
Thank you, Madam.

180
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,900
(Arrangement Office)

181
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,600
I believe you

182
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,870
will certainly handle the matters

183
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:59,750
I entrust to you well.

184
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,080
Madam,

185
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,790
why do you trust me so much?

186
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,670
I don't know why.

187
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,600
Maybe it is

188
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,840
because when I first saw you,

189
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,600
I felt that you needed

190
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,270
someone to help you.

191
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,720
I don't know what brought you

192
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,000
to my mansion initially,

193
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,790
but I can sense that

194
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,120
you carry a certain burden.

195
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,720
Xinglan,

196
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,000
if you feel wronged here in the future,

197
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,440
just come to me.

198
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,670
Thank you, Madam.

199
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,380
(Arrangement Office)

200
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,960
First-rank maids are paid
one tael monthly.

201
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,390
Second-rank maids
are paid 800 qian monthly.

202
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,510
Third-rank maids
are paid 500 qian monthly.

203
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,600
Currently, the office

204
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,120
has 10 first-rank maids,

205
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,200
20 second-rank maids,

206
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,320
and 30 third-rank maids.

207
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,150
So the monthly salary expenses are...

208
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,320
Fourty-one taels.

209
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,750
Zhong Yunxin.

210
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,630
What's wrong, Miss Xu?

211
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,790
My math can't be wrong.

212
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,790
Yunxin, you're so good at math.

213
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,240
(Account Details)
Can you help me?

214
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,200
I can't look at the ledger
due to my status.

215
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,550
If you keep saying that,

216
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,870
I'll really get angry.

217
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,440
As my friend, you can call me Xinglan.

218
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,000
Okay, Miss Xu.

219
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,470
Xinglan.

220
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,300
(Account Details)

221
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,360
It's done.

222
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:00,960
Based on this number,

223
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,440
you missed some earlier.

224
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,630
Young Master.

225
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,360
(Serenity and Fragrance)
Miss Xu's ways of doing things

226
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,750
are truly unprecedented.

227
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,000
No wonder Madam likes her so much.

228
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,390
She knows everything clearly

229
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,080
and even has the ledger.

230
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:31,960
Miss Xu is doing this to complete

231
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,670
the tasks assigned by the City Lord

232
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,240
to reorganize the Arrangement Office.

233
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,320
I want to see

234
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,330
how she reorganizes
the internal affairs.

235
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,920
Young Master,

236
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,360
I do have a way.

237
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,390
What?

238
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,840
I will never do such a thing.
