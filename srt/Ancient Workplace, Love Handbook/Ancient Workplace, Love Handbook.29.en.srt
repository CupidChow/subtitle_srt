(Feiyu Pavilion)

4
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:39,750
I've asked Mother

5
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,640
to set our wedding date
for three days later.

6
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,480
Three days later?

7
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,920
You don't blame me
for doing this without telling you?

8
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,030
Not at all.

9
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,980
It's just that I've gained some weight,

10
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,430
and I don't look good in anything.

11
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,150
You look good in anything.

(Arrangement Office)

13
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,510
Now,

14
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,040
is it still just a little one?

15
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,160
It's obvious you've never been pregnant.

16
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,560
You make it sound like you have.

17
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:14,390
Xinglan.

18
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,440
Why didn't you take your medicine
this morning?

19
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,950
I'm all better now,

20
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,350
so I don't need to take it.

21
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,200
You still need to.

22
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,440
This is a reward for you.

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,710
How considerate of Yan.

24
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,520
By the way,

25
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,710
I made this for the baby.

26
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,950
I don't know
if it's a nephew or a niece,

27
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,430
but it doesn't matter; it's unisex.

28
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,400
This is...

29
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,920
Did you make it yourself?

30
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,560
I'm a little clumsy.

31
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,430
Please accept it.

32
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,710
When the child grows up,

33
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,630
if they ask me

34
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,680
who made this ugly quilt,

35
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,710
I'll tell them

36
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:10,850
it was their Aunt Xinglan.

37
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,960
If they don't like it,

38
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,470
I'll handle them.

39
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,200
You're an adult,

40
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,270
yet still arguing with an unborn child.

41
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,000
Ignore him.

42
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,120
Don't be scared.

Zhenzhen.

45
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,560
How's your inspection team going?

46
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,560
We've chosen the members.

47
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,410
A total of twenty.

48
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,680
Xinglan, we plan to set off

49
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,960
right after you and Yan get married.

50
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,320
So soon?

51
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,540
Not at all.

52
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,490
Father has written several letters
urging it.

53
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,840
He said he wanted to see
my matrilocal husband.

54
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,380
That's perfect.

55
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,440
Here's something for you.

56
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,260
How can I receive a gift
for your wedding?

57
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,400
That's not appropriate.

58
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,450
This is the proposal
for the Xiliang Travel Agency.

59
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,400
You'll definitely need it.

(Proposal for Xiliang Travel Agency)

61
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,310
How long did it take you to write this?

62
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,200
Xinglan,

63
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,110
you need to rest more lately.

64
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,810
You can't overwork.

65
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,430
You two are underestimating me.

66
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,750
How could this little work

67
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,000
crush me?

68
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,380
I love you the most.

69
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,750
You.

70
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,180
When you're there,

71
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,680
be nice to Zhenzhen.

72
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,920
Who do you think

73
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,500
we should invite to our wedding?

74
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,780
Do you have many friends?

75
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,800
Not many.

76
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,150
Should the invitation be in bright red

77
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,250
or rose red?

78
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:45,680
Either is fine.

79
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,000
What about the wedding blanket?

80
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,300
As for the pattern,

81
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,440
a mandarin duck pattern

82
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,370
is too cliché.

83
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,880
How about a truelove knot pattern?

84
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,460
Okay.

85
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,720
For the wedding attire,

86
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,270
I want it to be the most special.

87
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,960
Okay.

88
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,830
Why do you keep saying okay
to everything?

89
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,240
Are you really listening?

90
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,760
As long as it's something you like,

91
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:03,850
I'll say okay to it all.

92
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,630
That's more like it.

Quick, quick, quick.

95
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,950
Hurry up and bring it in.

96
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,840
Over here, over here.

97
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,110

98
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,230
Alright.

(Happy)

100
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,000
A bit higher.

Nanny Cui.

102
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,030
- Is this high enough?
- Lower a bit.

103
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,400
Sure.

104
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,600
Wait a moment.

105
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,630
- Be careful.
- Alright.

106
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,250
Keep the jewelry and clothing separate.

107
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,300
- There's more.
- Yes.

Be careful.

111
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,880
The style is wrong.

112
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,090
Xinglan doesn't like these.

113
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,270
- Go change them.
- Yes.

(Arrangement Office)

115
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,470
That character over there is too low.

116
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,540
- A bit higher.
- Okay.

117
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,230
Right.

118
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,920
Yanyu Pavilion is hosting the wedding.

119
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,670
How come the Arrangement Office
is so busy?

120
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,310
The Arrangement Office
is Xinglan's home.

121
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,870
She'll be married off from here.

122
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,000
We all are her family.

123
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,040
That counts me in.

124
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,710
- Of course.
- And over here.

125
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,420
Everyone is busy preparing
for our wedding,

126
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,860
while we two

127
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,960
feel like idlers.

128
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,550
If you think it's boring,

129
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,090
come back to Yanyu Pavilion with me.

130
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,360
You wish.

131
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,200
I mean you could go with me

132
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,550
to write the wedding invitations.

133
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,520

134
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,390
- Miss Xu.
- Miss Xu.

135
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,190
This is a gift for your wedding.

136
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,480
It's not worth much,

137
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,350
but I bought it with the first reward
from you.

138
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,280
I made this myself.

139
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,970
It's a small gift;
I hope you'll like it.

140
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,050
This is the amulet I got for you.

141
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,500
I hope you can be safe.

142
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,150
This is mine.

143
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:46,880
Give them all to me.

144
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,630
The bride's wedding gifts

145
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,030
shouldn't be in the groom's hands.

146
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,340
Be careful not to get tricked.

147
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,500
Give them to me;
they should be kept by the family.

you're finally here.

00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,120
Come on, sit down.

00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,050
How's the wedding preparation going?

153
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,770
We're all quite idle.

154
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:16,830
It's them who are busy.

155
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,670
You all need to get to work.

156
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,620
You have to write

157
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,610
your wedding invitations

158
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,900

159

and ornaments.

This is

161
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,140
a once-in-a-lifetime event.

162
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,780
Yes, Madam.

163
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,040
Why are you

164
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,980
so quiet now?

165
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,100
She's about to get married.

166
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,070
Of course, she'll be a bit reserved.

167
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,160
Xinglan.

168
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,700
Madam, this...

169
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,080
Since the day you came here,

170
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,180
I've been looking forward

171
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,900
to giving you this.

172
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,060
Today, my wish finally came true.

173
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,180
I can finally

174
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,830
be relieved now.

175
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,460
Then I can't refuse it.

176
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,780
Thank you, Madam.

177
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,220
Why are you still calling me Madam?

178
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,740
You should change how you address me.

179
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,100
Yes, Mother.

00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,900

Childhood Memories of Yan.

184
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,580
When my son was four,

185
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,460
he drew circles on his father's face

186
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,540
while he was sleeping.

187
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,280
The next day, his father went to court.

188
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,740
Everyone saw his face covered in ink

189
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,060
and laughed heartily.

190
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,300
This became a humorous tale.

00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,010
My son was punished by his father
to kneel for three days.

192
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,900
Right, these are all

193
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,460
from Yan's childhood.

194
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,300
I have several volumes of these.

195
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,660
In the future,

196
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,940
if he bullies you,

197
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,540
just take this out and read it to him.

198
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,180
I guarantee

199
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,860
it will make him submit.

200
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,260
Mother,

201
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,900
why show her these?

202
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,050
This gift is excellent.

203
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,160
I'm giving a gift to Xinglan.

204
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,460
It's none of your business.

205
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,370
You two can't meet each other

206
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,070
a day before the wedding.

207
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,420
Come on. Get him out of here.

208
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,380
It's too late.

209
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,700
I'm taking her away.

210
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:21,900
Mother.

211
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,180
You... Come on.

212
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:34,620
(Yanyu Pavilion)

213
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,060
I didn't expect you to be
so mischievous as a child.

214
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,740
Our children won't be so naughty

215
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,860
because I will discipline them well.

216
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,660
Young Master.

217
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,780
The wedding attire is here.

218
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,940
Do you want to try them on?

219
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,060
Aren't they made to my measurements?

220
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,140
What if they don't fit?

221
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,900
Don't think I don't know
what you're thinking.

222
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,140
The groom isn't supposed to see

223
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,620
the bride in her wedding dress
before the wedding.

224
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,140
Miss Xu is so clever.

225
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,540
What will happen to Young Master
after marriage?

226
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,220
What nonsense is that?

227
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,660
Of course,
they'll be together every day.

228
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,860
You're right.

229
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,380
They say we can't see each other today.

230
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,420
I don't care.

231
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,840
As long as I don't see you for a day,

232
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,620
I feel uneasy all over.

233
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,100
By the way,

234
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,460
which room will we stay in
after marriage?

235
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,980
Your room or mine?

236
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,060
Forget it; let's keep both.

237
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,950
If we argue, I'll just move out.

238
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,980
I won't give you that chance.

239
00:09:53,580 --> 00:10:00,580
(Happy)

240
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,500
Miss, you can't lift the veil.

241
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,660
But I've been hungry all day.

242
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:15,650
Wait.

243
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,500
I'll go get you something
to eat right now.
