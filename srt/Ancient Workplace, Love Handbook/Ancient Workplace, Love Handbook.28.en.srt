=Episode 28=

3
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,350
I heard Nianxia say

4
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,710
we were very much in love before.

5
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,920
Could you give me some time

6
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,150
to try to recall everything?

7
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,400
Sure.

8
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,480
Let me take you somewhere.

9
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,580
(Hongxiang School)

10
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,230
Hongxiang School?

11
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,600
You named it.

12
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,050
Did I?

13
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,940
Where's the best workplace
for older maids?

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,570
- The school in the City Lord's mansion.
- The school...

15
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,840
This was your slogan

16
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,560
at the time.

17
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,760
How could I ever

18
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,040
say such strange things?

19
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,310
I think it's quite good.

20
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,430
In Xiliang,

21
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,640
with plenty of sunshine,

22
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,680
our fruits are very sweet.

23
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,840
You established this school.

24
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,990
- These are the students.
- People love our fruits.

25
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,480
You once said

26
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,190
that older maids had no future
once they left the mansion,

27
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,960
and that only by having a skill

28
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:11,900
could they live independently.

29
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,000
That does sound like something
I would say.

30
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,910
Do you remember this street?

31
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,960
For the first class,

32
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,120
you sold 500 taels

33
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,360
in a single day,

34
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,840
silencing all the gossip
about the mansion.

35
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,690
Freshly made marinated snacks.
It's free to taste.

36
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,030
It's free if not tasty.

37
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,790
Ladies, our clothes

38
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,560
are exclusively designed
by professional designers.

39
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,620
No more outfit repeating.

40
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,750
You'll look the prettiest with them.

41
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,830
What's that smell?

42
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,970
They actually have
snail rice noodles here.

43
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,590
Mr. Yan, Miss Xu.

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,840
You know me?

45
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,040
I'm Qingke from the first class
of Hongxiang School.

46
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,910
Qingke?

47
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,560
Thanks to you and Mr. Yan,

48
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,960
I've mastered this skill.

49
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,680
Today, it's on me.

50
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,310
Enjoy.

51
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,870
Try it.

52
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,180
Keep your legs apart.

53
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,650
Use both hands.

54
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,910
Use your wrist and arm strength.

55
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,490
Push and pull.

56
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,800
Lift and lower.

57
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,750
Snail noodles.

58
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,120
Stinky tofu.

59
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,610
Fish mint.

60
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,740
These are the new products

61
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,950
from the culinary class.

62
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,460
I want you to try it for them.

63
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,430
Don't go.

64
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,680
Have you done eating?

65
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,430
Let me take you somewhere else.

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,840
Look.

67
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,400
The design here is truly exquisite.

68
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,910
- It is.	- I didn't expect that at all.

69
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,270
Mr. Yan.

70
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,830
This is also a place you managed.

71
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,680
Am I really that capable?

72
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,960
Don't miss out when you pass by.

73
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,390
Come and take a look.

74
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:31,850
Come and take a look.

75
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,740
The experience house is now open.

76
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,510
Each script has a puzzle,

77
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,630
and everyone plays a role.

78
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,560
Whoever can guess the puzzle
will be the winner.

79
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,070
So that's how it is; it's quite nice.

80
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,510
This is better than watching a play.

81
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,350
Exactly.

82
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,190
Given the current situation,
can we call it a success?

83
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,000
For now,

84
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,430
it's not quite a success.

85
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,400
But Madam,

86
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,360
there might be endless stories
for you to write.

87
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,630
This is the madam's property, right?

88
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,870
Have you remembered?

89
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,190
Vaguely.

90
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,680
May I ask if you accept storybooks here?

91
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,790
We do.

92
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,560
Are they original or copied?

93
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,880
I wrote it myself.

94
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,590
Please follow me.

95
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,440
Alright.

96
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,390
I didn't expect this experience house

97
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,120
could also help scholars earn a living.

98
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,560
Why did you bring me here?

99
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,270
Xinglan,

100
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,030
let's drink like last time.

101
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,440
Here?

102
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,040
But I'm afraid someone
will get drunk and cause trouble.

103
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,120
Like dancing,

104
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,600
paddling,

105
00:05:59,070 --> 00:05:59,950
or doing the splits.

106
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,720
Are you talking about me?

107
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,190

You know in your heart.

121
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,000
You insisted on saying I was late.

which is why I was late.

130
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,830

What are you thinking?

132
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,570
I just feel like it's been a long time
since I sat here.

133
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,820
It feels familiar

134
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,710
yet strange.

135
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,800
Miss Xu,

136
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,810
it's really you.

137
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,920
I haven't seen you for quite a while.

138
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,040
You've managed the office very well.

139
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,480
Miss Xu, look.

140
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,680
This is last quarter's ledger
for the office.

141
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,800
Our monthly income

142
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,640
has increased again.

143
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,390
I won't look at the ledger.

144
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,580
You've done a great job.

145
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,480
It's thanks to your previous teaching.

146
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,070
Don't forget to inform us

147
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,600
about your wedding.

148
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,800
I'm glad I remembered.

149
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,360
As long as you're well,

150
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,160

But there's no auspicious time now.

160
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,320
I don't care about that.

161
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,670
I just want to marry her quickly.

162
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,270
