=Episode 3=

3
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,260
An experience house for storytelling?

4
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,100
That's right.

5
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,980
Madam is interested
in the experience

6
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,140
from that day.

7
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,740
She asked me to turn all her stories

8
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,060
into immersive scripts.

9
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:53,900
Madam,

10
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,900
don't forget your identity.

11
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,940
How can you go out and show your face?

12
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,380
(It's just as I expected.)

13
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:02,620
Madam,

14
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,580
I can help you open the shop,

15
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:05,420
but

16
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,860
I need an assistant.

17
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,580
Miss Xu really has the influence

18
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,220
to have Mr. Yan

19
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,140
take on this for her.

20
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,660
Who said I wanted to help her?

21
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,180
I just want to take this opportunity

22
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,780
to see if she contacts
any spies outside.

23
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,340
Understood.

24
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,170
In the end,

25
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,180
you still want to help Miss Xu.

26
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,020
(Qingyuan Theater)

27
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,660
Be careful.

28
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,900
Slow down.

29
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,460
Mr. Yan has taken over this place

30
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,620
to use it for your so-called

31
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,820
storytelling experience house.

32
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,450
- Did the City Lord agree?
- Coming.

33
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,540
I'm opening the shop in my own name.

34
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,260
Once the shop is up and running

35
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,580
and starts making a profit,

36
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,540
I'll inform my father.

37
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,300
Action before the report.

38
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,740
I didn't expect you to help me.

39
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,300

(Experience House for Storytelling)

42
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,020
We're opening tomorrow,

43
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,460
and it's not ready yet?

44
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,860
As you know, just give me a hand.

45
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,140
Here's the deposit.

46
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,620
If you can find him

47
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,660
and kill him,

48
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,900
the price will double.

49
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:22,060
(Zuixin House)

50
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,420
(Wait a minute.)

51
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,860
(Aren't those fragments of memories?)

52
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,220
(No wonder they don't show up
however I touch him.)

53
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,260
(So, the right way
to get them is to kiss.)

54
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,020
(This is just too absurd.)

55
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,600
What kind of expression is that?

56
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,100
I'm telling you;
you must not tell anyone about this.

57
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,140
(It's not easy to want to kiss him.)

58
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,420
(I'll first establish my footing here)

59
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,580
(and then think of a way.)

60
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,340
Young Master, are you thinking
about Miss Xu again?

61
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,380
Stop being suspicious.

62
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,700
I think Miss Xu is quite resourceful.

63
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,100
She's beautiful and kind-hearted;
Madam is quite fond of her.

64
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,940
(Gaining people's hearts.)

65
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,980
(It seems)

66
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,860
(kissing me is also part of her plan.)

67
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,940
(I can't be bewitched by beauty.)

68

(Experience House for Storytelling)

69
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,660
Ladies and gentlemen,

70
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,800
don't miss out on this.

71
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,160
Come and have a look

72
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,980
at the Experience House
for Storytelling.

73
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,340
It's now open!

74
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,100
Wasn't this a theater before?

75
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,300
Without the theater,
how will we watch the shows?

76
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,900
What is this experience house?

77
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,740
Everyone, please be patient.

78
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,420
I know you like to watch shows
at the theater

79
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,180
as you want to experience
a different life,

80
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,940
just like those on stage.

81
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,020
While watching a show at the theater,

82
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,940
(Red Makeup)
you can only be an audience member.

83

(Flowers and Moon)
But the experience house

84
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,740
allows everyone to participate

85
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,060
and become the character.

86
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,780
Each script has a puzzle,

87
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,700
and everyone plays a role.

88
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,060
Whoever can guess the puzzle
will be the winner.

89
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,140
Looks really nice.

90
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,260
Yeah.

91
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,860
Today, it's the opening celebration.

92
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,060
The space is limited;
first come, first served!

93
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,580
I'll go first! I'll go first!

94
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,590
I want it too!

95
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,740
I want to sign up too!

96
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,140
You're everywhere.

97
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,340
- This is mine.
- Mine.

98
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,430
- Got it.
- Good.

99
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,820
Mine. Mine.

100
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,820
Madam, hold this.

101
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,380
Xinglan.

102
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,430
Madam.

103
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,060
Given the current situation,

104
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,460
have we succeeded?

105
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,260
I can't say for sure yet,

106
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,380
but Madam,

107
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,140
there might be endless stories to write.

108
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,820
What's wrong?

109
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,140
Miss Xu,

110
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,660
Madam has to hide her interests

111
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,140
due to her identity.

112
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,700
(Flowers and Moon)
Madam's hobby

113
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,260
has brought joy to so many people now.

114
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,900
You helped Madam

115
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,700
fulfill a long-held wish.

116
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,340
I can finally do

117
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,820
what I love.

118
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,900
Thank you, Xinglan.

119
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,700
(Song Heng is right.)

120
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,500
(She indeed has the talent
to please others.)

121
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,860
(But I won't)

122
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,500
(fall into your plans.)

123
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,710
Our experience house has been open

124
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,700
for some time now.

125
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,860
Everyone has worked hard for it.

126
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,340
(With these new tricks,)

127
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,100
(what is she up to?)

128
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,180
Today, I made dishes from my hometown

129
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,580
and brought good wine for you.

130
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,740
Come on. Cheers.

131
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:03,900
Wait.

132
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,180
You've worked the hardest.

133
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,660
You went outside the city

134
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,780
to buy a jar of good wine.

135
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,460
Miss Xu should drink first.

136
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,340
Everyone has worked hard.

137
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,500
Hold on.

138
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:33,460
Miss Xu has been busy

139
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,340
with this meal in the kitchen
for a long time.

140
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,380
Miss Xu should eat first.

141
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,140
(Brat, you know
how to cherish your wife now.)

142
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,660
Everyone, dig in.

143
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,300
I didn't expect Xinglan
to not only be beautiful

144
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,700
but also an excellent cook.

145
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,620
Everyone, eat up.

146
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,620
Yes, dig in.

147
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,460
It smells so good.

148
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:05,860
Try this.

149
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,020
The City Lord has returned.

150
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,500
Why did the City Lord
suddenly come back?

151
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,220
Is he here to settle scores?

152
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,820
(Yuwen Yi, City Lord)

153
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,500
Xu Xinglan,

154
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,180
it was you who incited my wife

155
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,540
to open that ridiculous place

156
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,660
with you, right?

157
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,980
I'm sorry, My Lord.

158
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,740
It's all my fault.

159
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,340
(Oh no, what do I do now?)

160
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,820
My Lord, are you done playing around?

161
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,380
Madam, don't be angry;
it was just a joke.

162
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,580
Just a joke.

163
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,580
Everyone, sit down and eat.
It was just a joke.

164
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,500
Just a joke.

165
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,960
Sit down, everyone.

166
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,100
Madam, I...

167
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,100
You can get up.

168
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,020
Actually,

169
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,300
I told the City Lord

170
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,380
about the store a long time ago.

171
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,500
Right.

172
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,100
However,

173
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,580
there are still some things

174
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,420
that I need to discuss with you.

175
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,420
Xinglan, first,

176
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,620
I want to toast to you.

177
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,140
If it weren't for you,

178
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,740
I might never have been able

179
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,860
to do what I love

180
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,500
in this lifetime.

181
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,660
Thank you.

182
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,060
Madam, you're too kind.

183
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,100
Please, sit down.

184
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:55,940
Sit down.

185
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,300
During this time, I've actually

186
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,540
been observing you.

187
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,940
While opening the shop,

188
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,180
I noticed your initiative

189
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,340
and decision-making skills.

190
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,220
In the past two years,

191
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,980
the servants in our mansion

192
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,740
have become increasingly lax,

193
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,100
yet their salary hasn't been cut at all.

194
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,220
It's almost become unsustainable.

195
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,900
Why not let Xinglan

196
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,810
go to the Arrangement Office
and give it a try?

197
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:26,860
- No way.
- No way.

198
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,220
(If I go to the Arrangement Office,)

199
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,980
(I can't see
that wooden-faced guy anymore.)

200
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,260
(How will I get home then?)

201
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,300
(She's an assassin.)

202
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,580
(How can she meddle
in the domestic affairs?)

203
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,580
Well.

204
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:46,180
Miss Xu is new here

205
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,780
and may not be familiar

206
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,700
with many things.

207
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,460
How about letting Yan accompany her?

208
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,660
What do you think?

209
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,660
- Sure.
- Sure.

210
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,980
(If I can be with this guy,)

211
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,140
(then I'll reluctantly agree.)

212
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,100
(I should find my memory
and go home.)

213
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,220
(With me here,)

214
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,900
(don't think you can
confuse anyone again.)

215
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,580
(I'll definitely expose
your true color.)

216
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,700
Alright, it's settled then.

217
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,540
Good.

218
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,500
Xu Xinglan.

219
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,700
Yes.

220
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,260
Starting the day after tomorrow,

221
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,100
you will move
into the Arrangement Office

222
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,660
as a supervisor.

223
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,740
Yes.

224
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:22,980
Yan,

225
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,100
you'll become the chief
the day after tomorrow

226
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,460
to accompany Xinglan

227
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,860
and manage the internal affairs

228
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,140
of our household.

229
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,420
Yes.

230
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,900
If this is handled well,

231
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,780
you can ask the City Lord
for any reward.

232
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,180
Right.

233
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,620
Madam.

234
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,540
Then I...

235
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,500
I want...

236
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,900
Mr. Yan.

237
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,140
My Lord.

238
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,700
Madam, don't worry.

239
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,860
I will do my utmost

240
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,220
to assist

241
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,300
Mr. Yan.

242
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,500
Being an official is not that easy.

243
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,060
Report to the office at 7 am

244
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,340
the day after tomorrow.

245
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,780
If you're late,

246
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,260
don't bother to come at all.

247
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,780
(Even if the sky falls,)

248
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,740
(I won't be late.)

249
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,900
(Once I do my job well)

250
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,860
(and get a reward,)

251
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,780
