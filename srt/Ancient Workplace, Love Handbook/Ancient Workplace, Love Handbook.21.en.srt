3
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,820
(Peace and Eternity)

4
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,920
You want Zhenzhen to join you?

5
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,160
Why?

6
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:45,870
Haven't you seen it?

7
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,390
She and Mr. Qi are about to fall out.

8
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,780
Zhenzhen came here to revive Xiliang

9
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,520
through a marriage alliance.

10
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,250
If her marriage with Qi fails,

11
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,470
Xiliang will be in danger.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,710
Who told you that reviving Xiliang

13
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,000
can only rely on marriage?

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,040
Do you have a better way?

15
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,030
Trade connectivity,

16
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,040
cultural exchange,

17
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,040
and craftsmanship export.

18
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,510
Which of these can't revive Xiliang?

19
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:07,920
So,

20
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,920
openness, cooperation, and development

21
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,150
are the long-term strategies.

22
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,040
Our Xinglan

23
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,760
also knows how to govern the city.

24
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,070
Such a grand plan

25
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,230
will surely cost a lot of money.

26
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,860
If the money at the office isn't enough,

27
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:21,940
just let me know.

28
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,640
Where do you get so much money?

29
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:30,790
From Yun Ying.

30
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,310
When did Yun Ying give you money?

31
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,510
Not for me.

32
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,070
Here's the deposit.

33
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,680
If you can kill him,

34
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,840
the payment will double.

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,480
How do you know

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,680
Chiyuan left the money there?

37
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,040
Because

38
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,280
Chiyuan's memories are in my head.

39
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,070
Although they're just fragments,

40
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,840
I managed to piece them together

41
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,840
and find the money.

42
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,590
Wow.

43
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,150
Your life is really valuable.

44
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,230
This is just the deposit.

45
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,150
So,

46
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,350
shouldn't you share half

47
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:01,950
with me?

48
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,790
Everyone will remember

49
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,510
the immense contributions

50
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,120
you made to Anjin and Xiliang.

51
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,430
Young Master.

52
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,680
Young Master.

53
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,430
I found out.

54
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,030
The flower was a Fairy Flower

55
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,030
from Mengyun.

56
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,800
Mr. Qi took it
from the office's flower room.

57
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,030
There's also a bouquet
in the princess's room.

58
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,080
The flower room?

59
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,680
The flowers were bought
the day before yesterday.

60
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,520
Here's the list.

61
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,030
The princess chose these maids

62
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,560
from the Arrangement Office.

63
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,190
Another task for you.

64
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,030
Okay.

65
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,800
Who are you?

66
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,870
I thought you'd do
everything possible to go back.

67
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:09,840
I didn't expect you

68
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,310
to stick around in my body.

69
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,190
Chiyuan?

70
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,750
That's right.

71
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,000
I will wake up eventually.

72
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,310
You only have a dead end.

73
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:20,750
Go back.

74
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,870
What dead end?

75
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,590
Chiyuan,

76
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,960
clarify yourself.

77
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,150
Miss?

78
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,200
Miss?

79
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,360
You had a nightmare again?

80
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,120
How did you know?

81
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,520
You kept calling someone

82
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,350
to wait and telling them not to leave.

83
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,400
Stop thinking about it;
it's almost noon.

84
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,750
- Get up quickly.
- Noon?

85
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,270
I'm sorry.

86
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,470
I'm late.

87
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,120
Didn't sleep well last night?

88
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,590
I went to bed pretty early,

89
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,360
but somehow I just couldn't get up.

90
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,120
Glad you're here.

91
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,710
I heard

92
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,870
this is the welcome gift
you gave me for my job?

93
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,120
I went through a lot of trouble

94
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,960
to find it.

95
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,680
No wonder I value you.

96
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,030
From now on,

97
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,400
we are the Hongxiang Trio.

98
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,480
Let's officially welcome Zhenzhen

99
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,560
to the school.

100
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,740
(Arrangement Office)

101
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,160
(It's true that earnest girls
are the most charming.)

00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,460
(Hongxiang School)

103
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:26,340
(Sphygmology Classic)

104
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,480
Great!

105
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,510
- So beautiful.
- So beautiful.

106
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,070
- Gorgeous.
- You danced so well.

107
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,800
What are you looking at?

108
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,920
If you want to look, look openly.

109
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,400
Who said that?

110
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,390
Sincerity

111
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,800
is always the trump card.

112
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,460
(Arrangement Office)

113
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,950
This design is

114
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,120
- pretty good.
- Morning.

115
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,510
Zhenzhen,

116
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,680
what color do you like?

117
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,750
- Yellow.
- I knew it'd be red.

118
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,780
What are you doing?

119
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,740
(Ledger for July)

120
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,880
Confessing.

121
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:27,160
Last time it was too rushed,

122
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,950
this time I want to do it again,

123
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,950
with all my sincerity.

124
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,270
Zhenzhen, listen to me.

125
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,270
Aren't you going to confess?

126
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,110
Go on.

127
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,150
Zhenzhen,

128
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,750
you know what I care,

129
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,120
and you know what I want.

130
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,310
It was all my fault before.

131
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,000
Can you give me another chance?

132
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,720
I swear.

133
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,560
I will never make you angry again.

134
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,760
And?

135
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,390
From now on, whatever you say goes.

136
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,230
And?

137
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,080
And...

138
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,150
(It turns out)

139
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,360
(sincerity is always the trump card.)

140
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,220
(Arrangement Office)

141
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,830
I will wake up eventually.

142
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,670
You

143
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,870
only have a dead end.

144
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,200
Miss Xu,

145
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,680
this is the teaching schedule
for the Xiliang language class.

146
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,000
Just leave it here.

147
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,190
Miss Xu,

148
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,430
here's the list of teaching supplies
to buy tomorrow.

149
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,480
Please take a look.

150
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,870
You go buy it.

151
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,750
There's quite a bit to get.

152
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,950
Do you want to check again?

153
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
Let me see.

154
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,110
It's okay.

155
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,520
What's up?

156
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,450
Do you think

157
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,270
the things that happen in dreams

158
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,950
are real or fake?

159
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:00,920
What dream?

160
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,080
Tell me about it.

161
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,790
It's nothing.

162
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,870
Just some strange things.

163
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,360
They say you dream about what you

164
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,430
think of during the day.

165
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,160
You must be too tired today.

166
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,830
Come back early to rest tonight.

167
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,000
Xinglan,

168
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,560
let's take Yunxin with us

169
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,830
for a girls' night out.

170
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,270
Okay.

171
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,310
Get back early to rest.

172
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,310
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

173
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:33,510
Xinglan,

174
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,550
now you're the last one.

175
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,320
I'm the last one?

176
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:38,510
What's the rush?

177
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,790
Feelings

178
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,390
can't be rushed.

179
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,720
Rushing won't help.

180
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,910
Right, when you rush, you go blind,

181
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,120
bumping into some awful men.

182
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,150
It's already lucky to encounter someone,

183
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,080
so cherish the people in front of you.

184
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,390
Besides,

185
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,550
being able to be

186
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,960
with the one you love for a lifetime

187
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,150
is a great blessing in life.

188
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,150
It's already hard enough

189
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,480
to find someone you love,

190
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,560
let alone

191
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,120
to stay together

192
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,910
with that person.

193
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,120
That's even harder.

194
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,200
Exactly. You two should listen to me;
I have experience.

195
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,240
For those awful men,

196
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,480
you just need to be tough.

197
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,960
How can that be?

198
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,630
As long as two people
truly love each other,

199
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,240
however many difficulties they face,

200
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,630
they will eventually be together.

201
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,720
Look at me and Jun.

202
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,080
After going through so much,

203
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,390
we're finally getting married.

204
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,230
That's wonderful.

205
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,240
Marriage.

206
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,510
Is it really that good?

207
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,120
She got married quite early.

208
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,440
Right.

209
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,670
I remember it well.

210
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,660
Zhenzhen and Qi got married
ten days after they met.

211
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,270
After five days of marriage,
they wanted a divorce.

212
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,240
Now, after fourteen days,

213
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,600
you've finally reconciled.

214
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,750
Okay, okay.

215
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,200
Let's stop talking about those men.

216
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,720
So, here's to tomorrow.

217
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,270
- Happy wedding.
- Happy wedding.

218
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,670
It's you again.

219
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,510
What do you want?

220
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,510
I just want to take back my body

221
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,270
and then kill Yuwen Yan.

222
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,600
Yun Ying is already dead.

223
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,080
You won't get anything
from killing Yuwen Yan.

224
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,270
If it weren't for you,

225
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,480
I wouldn't be trapped
in this dark place.

226
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,200
When I wake up,

227
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,750
I will kill all of you.

228
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,910
That's why it's hard for me to wake up.

229
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,240
It's because of you.

230
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,960
The body is mine,

231
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,670
so the time for you to control it
will surely become less.

232
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,840
I will wake up.

233
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,750
It's only a matter of time.

234
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,670
Miss, wake up.

235
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:47,710
Miss.

236
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,390
Miss, wake up.

237
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,230
Miss.
