00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,260
=Episode 25=

3
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,070
What is this thing?

4
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,170
Why are you staring at it?

5
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,520
I found it from Yan.

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I always feel it will be
of some help to us.

7
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,790
It seems like a kind

8
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,480
of character.

9
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,670
Have you seen it?

10
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,680
Yan wouldn't collect useless things

11
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,740
like this out of nowhere.

12
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,560
What is it?

13
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,950
It's Yan's item.

14
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,480
Would Xinglan know about it?

15
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,150
(What is going on?)

16
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,840
(Yuwen Yan.)

17
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,390
(Why did you disappear at this time?)

18
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,760
I heard

19
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,040
that all women like this.

20
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,150
How dare you scare me!

21
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,150
Yuwen Yan!

22
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,280
Are you out of your mind?

23
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:48,710
If one day

24
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,950
I also go far away,

25
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,150
will you miss me?

26
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,950
What if I go far away?

27
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,150
I'll definitely miss you.

28
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,790
I'll think of you

29
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,640
day and night.

30
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,200
No.

31
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,280
If you go far away, I'll surely follow.

32
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,950
How could you
have the chance to go alone?

33
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,470
Yuwen Yan,

34
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,120
where exactly are you?

35
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
See you at 7 pm tomorrow

36
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,120
at the city gate.

37
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:33,220
(Yanyu Pavilion)

38
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,310
This item was found in Yan's room.

39
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,280
I don't understand it.

40
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,590
Miss Xu, please have a look.

41
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,960
(Isn't this...?)

42
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,030
(Could it be...?)

43
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,470
Miss?

44
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,400
Miss?

45
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,270
Dear,

46
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,270
the evidence is right there.

47
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,830
Ministers are urging me
in the court every day.

48
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,390
I have no choice.

49
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,270
He's our child.

50
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,830
If you don't believe him, I do.

51
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,750
Dear, don't cry.

52
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,720
We've already lost a son.

53
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,160
Are you going to make Yan...

54
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,230
Report.

55
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,200
My Lord,

56
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,630
Miss Xu is missing.

57
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,320
What?

58
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,310
Dear, dear.

59
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,190
How did she disappear?

60
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,390
How could she just disappear
from Yanyu Pavilion?

61
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,020
Hurry up and find her.

62
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,880
Yes.

63
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,390
Dear, are you alright?

64
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,520
Madam,

65
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,710
this is the account list for this month.

66
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,720
Neither Mr. Yan nor Miss Xu is here,

67
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,310
so I had to bring it to you.

68
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,230
Just put it there.

69
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:13,330
Alright.

70
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,670
Madam,

71
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,100
you should take care of yourself,

72
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,800
so that Mr. Yan won't worry.

73
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,410
They've all been away.

74
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,820
You can manage

75
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,110
the office for now.

76
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,040
Thank you for your hard work.

77
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,990
It's my duty.

78
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,340
I don't think it's hard work.

79
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,640
Madam,

80
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,610
it seems there are fewer guards

81
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,270
in the mansion.

82
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,670
They've all been dispatched.

83
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,920
How can there be manpower left?

84
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,250
My Lord.

85
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,230
Madam.

86
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,780
The situation in the city
is tense right now.

87
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,870
I think

88
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,240
we should recruit more guards

89
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,480
to strengthen our defenses.

90
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,750
We need to be prepared for assassins
from enemy states.

91
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,410
You can arrange
for the recruitment of guards.

92
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,400
Yes.

93
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,750
I wonder where Xinglan is right now.

94
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,480
She received a note yesterday

95
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,100
and disappeared this morning.

96
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,870
It could be Yan.

97
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,750
What's wrong?

98
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,830
Why do I feel like someone
is following us?

99
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,860
(Arrangement Office)

100
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,950
Starting today,

101
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,360
Nianxia is demoted

102
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,830
to a lowly maid for oversight.

103
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,600
No way.

104
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,000
Nianxia is Miss Xu's personal maid.

105
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,680
It seems the rumors
about Miss Xu are mostly true.

106
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,390
A lot of things have happened.

107
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,040
The City Lord and Madam

108
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,510
have always valued our office.

109
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,600
At this time,

110
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,710
we should each perform our duties

111
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:14,630
and do as ordered.

112
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,540
Whoever doesn't listen to orders

113
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,390
will be dismissed at once.

114
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,660
Yes.

115
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,300
Do you all feel

116
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,780
that Miss Shen seems
a bit different?

117
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,620
Yeah.

118
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,260
I never noticed Miss Shen
was so strict before.

119
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,820
Shh, stop saying that.

120
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,060
(Arrangement Office)

121
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,100
Who is it?

122
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,120
Miss Xu?

123
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,180
What are you doing here?

124
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,700
Do you know the City Lord
has ordered to search for you?

125
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,820
How dare you come here?

126
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,460
Miss Shen,

127
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,020
you should know in your heart

128
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,660
that Yuwen Yan is innocent.

129
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,500
What?

130
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,700
Please help me.

131
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,220
He went to find evidence

132
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,980
and asked me to meet him
outside the city.

133
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,140
But the guards are so strict now

134
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,260
that I can't get out at all.

135
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,500
You know where Mr. Yan is?

136
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,900
He left this for me.

137
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,020
(See you at the city gate
tomorrow at noon.)

138
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,780
It really is his handwriting.

139
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,180
But...

140
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,140
Miaoyi,

141
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,100
after working with him at the office,

142
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,900
you should know
his character very well.

143
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,880
I'm really out of options.

144
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,060
Only you can help me.

145
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,220
Alright.

146
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,300
I promise you.

147
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,740
Thank you.

148
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,860
I thought this trip
would only be the two of us,

149
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,840
but I didn't expect you

150
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,820
to bring so many people.

151
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,610
The City Lord is sending people
to search for you two.

152
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,310
If they really find Mr. Yan,

153
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,250
they can protect him too, right?

154
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,340
You actually

155
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,020
dared to take such risks for us.

156
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,220
Actually, I trust Mr. Yan.

157
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,820
If we find him soon,

158
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,740
he and the City Lord can clear up
their misunderstanding early.

159
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,740
Isn't that right?

160
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,180
By the way,

161
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,180
why are there so many new faces
in the mansion?

162
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,100
A while ago,

163
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,780
we hired a batch of guards,

164
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,500
taking shifts day and night.

165
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,540
Everyone is on edge.

166
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,000
It's always good to be careful.

167
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,460
You're quite thoughtful.

168
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,180
The mansion is lucky to have you.

169
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,700
You...

170
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,580
You actually dared to do

171
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,660
so much for Mr. Yan.

172
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,140
I just did what I wanted to do.

173
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,900
I didn't expect that one day

174
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,660
you would also do anything for Mr. Yan.

175
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,940
Have you ever done that for someone?

176
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,100
It's nothing.

177
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:56,940
Let's go.

178
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:00,900
Stop.

179
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,020
By the order of the City Lord,

180
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,900
we need to search for someone
outside the city.

181
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,060
Why does one of the guys

182
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,580
look so unfamiliar?

183
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,300
Go then.

184
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,300
Is it here?

185
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,740
This is what's written on the note.

186
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,780
It should be right.

187
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,240
Miss Shen, we didn't find him.

188
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,320
Search again.

189
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,180
Yes.
