=Episode 14=

3
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,740
Tell me who the Chief Inspector is.

4
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,340
Absolutely no.

5
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,500
Who is the Chief Inspector?

6
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,740
You deserved it.

7
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,860
Miss, you're awake.

8
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,780
How did I

9
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,820
get back last night?

10
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,060
Mr. Yan brought you back.

11
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,780
Yuwen Yan?

12
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:22,740
(Gosh.)

13
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,180
(What did I do?)

14
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,020
Last night.

15
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,020
Last night?

16
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,300
What's wrong?

17
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,700
Do you remember
what you said last night?

18
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,700
What I said?

19
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,600
Have you forgotten everything?

20
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:38,500
Young Master.

21
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:40,900
She's here.

22
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,100
I'll be back in a minute.

23
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,220
What's the matter?

24
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,980
Why so urgent?

25
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,140
Miss, there's a big event
at the mansion today.

26
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,380
A big event?

27
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,660
I didn't even know.

28
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,260
Xiliang's Princess Zhenzhen is here.

29
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,060
I heard she's a great beauty.

30
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,780
Everyone went out to her.

31
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,820
How can I miss

32
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,780
the chance

33
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,380
to see a beauty?

34
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,660
Then shall we...?

35
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,020
(Princess Zhenzhen from Xiliang)

36
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,820
After a long journey,

37
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,460
Princess, you must be exhausted.

38
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,740
I will definitely be a good wife.

39
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,180
Well.

40
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,660
The visitor does not come in peace.

41
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,900
(Arrangement Office)

42
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,100
Marriage alliance?

43
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,460
My father made a marriage pact

44
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,100
for their grandchildren
with the old city lord of Xiliang

45
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,340
over drinks.

46
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,180
This is all the lord's fault.

47
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,420
Come on.

48
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,220
How could you forget this?

49
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,980
How was I supposed to know

50
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,140
what they said while drinking
still counts?

51
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,820
If Mr. Jun had
to marry Princess Zhenzhen,

52
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,340
what would've happened to Miss Yunxin?

53
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,260
Miss Xu,

54
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,500
you should worry about yourself.

55
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,420
Mr. Yan has already taken her.

56
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,260
What?

57
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,740
Stop.

58
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,980
What are you doing?

59
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,260
Who are you?

60
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,180
This is my room.

61
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,780
You must be Mr. Yan's concubine.

62
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:01,820
Concubine?

63
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,060
It's alright.

64
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,420
Since you like this room,

65
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,420
I'll let you have it.

66
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,460
I'll move to the next room.

67
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,540
Princess, didn't you immediately

68
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,700
take a liking to this room?

69
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,660
I'm a dignified princess from Xiliang.

70
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,340
How can I compete with a concubine?

71
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,380
What?

72
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,660
Concubine?

73
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,420
Let me have it?

74
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,700
(Arrangement Office)

75
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,700
What's wrong?

76
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,420
Do you know that...

77
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,340
Mr. Yan.

78
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,380
What are you doing here?

79
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,900
Princess, what do you need?

80
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,780
I was in a hurry

81
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,820
and only brought two maids to serve me.

82
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,380
I want to ask for more maids.

83
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,860
If you want maids,

84
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,980
just take some from my courtyard.

85
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,140
(Arrangement Office Records)

86
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,180
I heard everyone
in the Arrangement Office

87
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,300
is capable.

88
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,240
I want maids from here.

89
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,160
- Is that okay?
- No.

90
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,420
We only have a few people at the office.

91
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,060
We can't even finish our own tasks,

92
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,100
let alone give you any.

93
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,660
I want maids from here.

94
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,380
The princess wants maids.

95
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,300
Just arrange it.

96
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,500
You can reassign maids

97
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,380
to the office.

98
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,220
Besides the ones you arranged,

99
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,820
I also want

100
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:20,860
her.

101
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:23,980
Me?

102
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,060
No, she's an official at the office.

103
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,980
You can't have her.

104
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,700
Mr. Yan.

105
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,540
Just do as the princess wants.

106
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,620
Thank you, Mr. Yan.

107
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,580
I'll be going.

108
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,820
(Let it be; she's the guest.)

109
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,820
(After all,
she is the princess of Xiliang.)

110
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,900
(It's reasonable for him
to be polite to her.)

111
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,140
- Are the ingredients the freshest?
- Yes.

112
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,420
Princess of Xiliang.

113
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,860
Make sure to use the softest fabric.

114
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,740
- Yes.
- Fickle in love.

115
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,420
Don't forget to remind the princess

116
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,900
not to leave her room at night.

117
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,740
Understood.

118
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,740
Only the new lover's smile is seen,

119
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,740
but who hears
the old one's crying?

120
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,100
What are you doing?

121
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,450
Nothing.

122
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,820
It's a pity for Miss Xu.

123
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,900
Ever since that princess arrived,

124
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,340
Mr. Yan has been glued to her side.

125
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,460
Could it be

126
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,940
Mr. Yan is interested in her?

127
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,770
Mr. Yan must like

128
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,900
lively, cute,

129
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,140
resourceful,

130
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,580
smart, and bold girls.

131
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,300
Who he loves is his business.

132
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,580
Not my concern.

133
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,100
(Perhaps that princess
is too overbearing.)

134
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,380
(He's ordered to look after her,)

135
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,420
(so he has no choice.)

136
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,740
(It must be like that.)

137
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,580
Miss, stop feeding the fish.

138
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,220
They can't even eat anymore.

139
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,620
(Yanyu Pavilion)

140
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,660
What did you eat last night?

141
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,260
The meals at Yanyu Pavilion
are to my taste.

142
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,540
Thank you for the hospitality.

143
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,660
You're too kind.

144
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,700
So, about our marriage...

145
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,980
(So, the engagement was with Yuwen Yan.)

146
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,060
(Arrangement Office)

147
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:43,860
Madam.

148
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,940
Since everyone is here,

149
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,100
I have something to say.

150
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,460
From today on,

151
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,060
we are family.

152
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,860
Who is family with you?

153
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,740
Because I've decided to marry Mr. Yan.

154
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,780
What?

155
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,580
Mr. Yan has been

156
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,780
caring about me a lot

157
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,340
and must have long been fond of me.

158
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,500
Since you are his concubine,

159
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,300
naturally we are family.

160
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,300
But don't worry.

161
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,180
I am

162
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,340
very reasonable.

163
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,340
Princess,

164
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,580
you shouldn't speak recklessly.

165
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:16,900
Well.

166
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,780
Yan hasn't agreed yet.

167
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,640
Besides,

168
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:20,740
I only recognize Xinglan

169
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,180
as Yan's wife.

170
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,700
If you don't believe me,

171
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,980
I'll ask Mr. Yan.

172
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,380
Who wants to be his concubine?

173
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,260
If you like him, just keep him.

174
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,900
Xinglan.

175
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,700
Xinglan, don't leave yet.

176
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,540
Have you heard?

177
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,660
A new group of guards has arrived.

178
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,140
I heard each is very tall

179
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,060
and cute.

180
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,180
Is that true?

181
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,580
Should we organize a social event?

182
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,020
Like the previous team-building one.

183
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,660
I think that's a good idea.

184
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,740
- Great.
- I'll go too.

185
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,060
Let's all go together.

186
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,470
- Miss Xu.
- Miss Xu.

187
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,420
Miss, they're discussing a social event.

188
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,420
Are you going?

189
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,380
What's wrong, Miss?

190
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,460
You look unwell.

191
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,340
It's nothing.

192
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,340
Mr. Yan.

193
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,220
What were you saying
about a social event?

194
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,260
I didn't hear it clearly.

195
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,820
What social event?

196
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,540
What kind of event?

197
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,940
Are those young men

198
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,100
really handsome?

199
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,100
They are very cute.

200
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,660
- Yes, very handsome.
- Handsome?

201
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,060
Also cultured and sensible.

202
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,540
- Exactly.
- Perfect.

203
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,240
The key is they have
great martial skills.

204
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,940
What do they mean by that?

205
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,980
Alright, alright.

206
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,180
Young Master, don't you know?

207
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,380
What do you mean?

208
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,580
Jealousy.

209
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,700
You run to the princess every day,

210
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,140
hastily asking about her well-being.

211
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,220
Miss Xu hasn't punched you.

212
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,260
It's already virtuous of her.

213
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,340
Okay, it's decided then.

214
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,300
Tomorrow, after duty,

215
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,440
we'll have the social event.

216
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,940
Understood.

217
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,220
Don't forget

218
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,740
the social event tomorrow.

219
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,580
- Okay.
- Okay.

220
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,580
Nianxia, Nianxia.

221
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,100
Xinglan.

222
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,900
(Six Chapters of a Floating Life)

223
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,140
Actually, I have abs too.

224
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,780
For tomorrow's social event,

225
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,940
let's go together.

226
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,740
There will definitely be a lot of fun.

227
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,940
Deal.

228
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,820
I've looked at the list
for the second class.

229
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,020
You did very well.

230
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,420
Mr. Yan, something's wrong.

231
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,540
Mr. Yan.

232
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,500
The princess is vomiting
and having diarrhea.

233
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,980
Song Heng, call the physician.

234
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,740
