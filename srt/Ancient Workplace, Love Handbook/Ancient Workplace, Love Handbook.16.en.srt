=Episode 16=

3
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,960
What's going on?

4
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,030
I haven't...

5
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:00,840
Do you like it?

6
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,870
Are you asking me?

7
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,790
Not just the fireworks.

8
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,070
There's more.

9
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,870
I just wanted to ask you

10
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,070
how to confess my feelings

11
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:34,920
to the girl I love.

12
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,870
Is all of this for me?

13
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,680
Wait.

14
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,230
What about Zhenzhen?

15
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,950
Let me tell you another story.

16
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,120
This is a dancer hired by Zuixin House.

17
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,510
The City Lord especially
prepared this for you.

18
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,150
Great.

19
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,470
Princess!

20
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,620
- Princess!
- Princess!

21
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,040
Yang Master!

22
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,520
Guard Song!

23
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,360
Mr. Jun!

24
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,310
So, Chiyuan killed you.

25
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,280
And then what?

26
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,870
After that, for some reason,

27
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,800
I woke up again.

28
00:03:59,140 --> 00:03:59,980
(Yanyu Pavilion)

29
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,590
Young Master.

30
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,400
We're going
to Zuixin House to catch the spy.

31
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,570
Please wear this outfit.

32
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,000
I went back to a few months
before the incident.

33
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,360
You've been reborn?

34
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,270
The spy wants to use Zhenzhen's death

35
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,390
to incite a war

36
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,160
between Anjin and Xiliang.

37
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,240
When I woke up,

38
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,160
Princess Zhenzhen hadn't arrived
in Anjin City.

39
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,230
So,

40
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,270
I want to stop anyone
from hurting her again.

41
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,900
So,

42
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,870
you're treating Zhenzhen so well

43
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,510
not because you like her.

44
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,850
I just don't want anything

45
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,860
to happen to her in Anjin City.

46
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,880
Wait.

47
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,890
What about your engagement
to Zhenzhen?

48
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,680
You're the only one I love.

49
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,830
How could I agree to marry her?

50
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,390
Before you kissed me,

51
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,600
why did you say goodbye to me?

52
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,810
Do you want to leave?

53
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,840
Yes.

54
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,000
Still want to leave?

55
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,030
Of course. I can't sleep here tonight.

56
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,520
What's wrong?

57
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,480
My legs are numb.

58
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,120
I'll carry you.

59
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,510
You're walking too slowly.

60
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,800
You're too heavy.

61
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,270
How can you say that?

62
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,300
(Peaceful)

63
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,230
Young Master.

64
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,510
What are you doing?

65
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,490
Why don't I have any clothes to wear?

66
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:56,800
What are those then?

67
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,240
Xinglan has seen all of those.

68
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,560
Go buy me some new outfits.

69
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,710
Yes.

70
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,440
Wait.

71
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,630
Get something colorful.

72
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,240
A man in love.

73
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,200
Miss, how much longer do you need?

74
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,270
Why is it taking so long?

75
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,600
Doing my eyebrows.

76
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,440
Almost done.

77
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:37,430
Miss, you never liked
dressing up before.

78
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,410
What do you think? Does it look good?

79
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,400
Yes.

80
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,070
Oh, right, Nianxia.

81
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,540
Go to the beauty class
and bring me a new box of face powder.

82
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,960
Yes.

83
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,510
A woman in love.

84
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,670
I heard

85
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,920
that all women like this.

86
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,960
Xinglan.

87
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,430
This is your favorite.

88
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,480
You eat first.

89
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,430
You first.

90
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,400
You first.

91
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,480
You first.

92
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,510
There's another bowl here.

93
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,860
Forget what I said.

94
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,160
Since you've decided to stay,

95
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,440
what are your plans?

96
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,920
Of course, I'm going to continue
running the school.

97
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,030
I've always wanted

98
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,180
to prove myself through my career.

99
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,730
I didn't have the chance back there.

100
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,900
How could I give it up now?

101
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,510
Besides that,

102
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:02,870
what else?

103
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,510
Besides that?

104
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,950
(Yanyu Pavilion)

105
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,510
I can't think of anything else for now.

106
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,560
What about you?

107
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,410
I'll continue my mission
as the Chief Inspector,

108
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,750
protecting the people of Anjin City.

109
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,270
Oh, right.

110
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,430
I just remembered

111
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,360
something about Chiyuan.

112
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,480
Here's the deposit.

113
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,300
If you can find the person
we're looking for,

114
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,750
money won't be an issue.

115
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,670
If you can kill him,

116
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,200
the payment will double.

117
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,720
His life is really valuable.

118
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,670
He's constantly ruining our plans.

119
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,790
He must be killed.

120
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,630
He ordered Chiyuan
to kill the Chief Inspector.

121
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,670
To kill me?

122
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,600
After that,

123
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,630
Chiyuan went to meet the man in black.

124
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,960
I've found him.

125
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,440
When will you act?

126
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,360
During the banquet.

127
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,240
Once it's done,

128
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,840
send a message from Zuixin House.

129
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,200
I'll pay the rest.

130
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,200
Deal.

131
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,550
Lord Yun Ying.

132
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,550
Yun Ying?

133
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,910
He instructed Chiyuan to leave a signal

134
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,270
at Zuixin House
after completing the task.

135
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,350
What else?

136
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:22,750
Right.

137
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,790
That person had

138
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,480
a scar over one eye.

139
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,040
A knife scar?

140
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,040
And

141
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,150
every time I kissed you before,

142
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,670
I'd think of these things.

143
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,840
Maybe you haven't kissed me enough.

144
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:37,990
Want to try again?

145
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:40,200
(Yanyu Pavilion)

146
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,200
It's no use.

147
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,200
Now, I can't always remember things
every time I kill you.

148
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,840
Who exactly is Yun Ying?

149
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,840
Why does he want to kill you?

150
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,390
He's the leader of enemy spies

151
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,610
I've been searching for years.

152
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,120
My job as the Chief Inspector

153
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,360
is to eliminate spies
trying to disrupt Anjin City

154
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,390
and incite a war between us and Xiliang.

155
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,840
Then we have to find him quickly.

156
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,840
This is very complicated.

157
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,880
You shouldn't get involved.

158
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:05,880
How can that be?

159
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,840
I work for the City Lord now.

160
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,790
(Yanyu Pavilion)
All the clues are in my mind.

161
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,510
Besides, taking down a spy network

162
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,750
is too important

163
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,080
to leave me out of it.

164
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,270
I can't let you be in danger.

165
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,130
Don't worry.

166
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:20,510
I'll be fine.

167
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,610
