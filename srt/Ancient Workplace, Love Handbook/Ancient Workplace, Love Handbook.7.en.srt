00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,260
=Episode 7=

3
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,590
Miss Xu,

4
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,420
thanks to you for getting help
for this event

5
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,960
and ending Miss Wei's arrogance.

6
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,230
Of course.

7
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,710
She secretly plotted against us.

8
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,390
I see she hasn't stopped bullying you.

9
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,430
If she dares to order you around again,

10
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,880
and I let her off lightly,

11
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,390
I won't be surnamed Xu.

12
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,350
The wind is picking up.

13
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,760
Nianxia, let's go...

14
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:23,350
Put it on.

15
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,640
Don't overthink it.

16
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,760
I'm just afraid you might get sick

17
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:28,940
and infect everyone.

18
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,330
Why does your caring

19
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,320
sound so harsh?

20
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,150
- Forget it.
- Don't.

21
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,270
By the way,

22
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,350
here's this.

23
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,200
How did you know I wanted this?

24
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,680
Well.

25
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,230
I just bought it randomly.

26
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,910
The flavor of three taels.

27
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,960
You've been tricked.

28
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,800
It only cost 300 qian.

29
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,800
Anyway,

30
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,750
it's the taste of money.

31
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,080
You said strange images

32
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,750
would appear in your mind
when you touch me.

33
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,400
What appeared last time?

34
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,800
So, you believe me now?

35
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,000
This is a bit odd.

36
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,840
Should I trust my eyes

37
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,990
or my mind?

38
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,650
(The fragments of memory
aren't good things.)

39
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,360
It's hard to explain
in just a few words.

40
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,710
Here.

41
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,990
I'm leaving.

42
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,150
Thanks a lot.

43
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,660
(Arrangement Office)

44
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,000
The garden party is coming soon.

45
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,840
I called you all here today

46
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,710
to ask if anyone

47
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,870
has any new ideas.

48
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,120
The garden party?

49
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,390
Every Mid-Autumn Festival,

50
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,400
mother holds a grand event,

51
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,030
inviting everyone in the mansion

52
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,420
to enjoy the flowers in the gardens.

53
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,300
(So, it's a planning
for the Mid-Autumn event.)

54
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,150
Madam,

55
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,910
Miss Xu always has
plenty of fresh ideas.

56
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,150
How about splitting the office
into two teams,

57
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,560
with me and Miss Xu each
leading a team?

58
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,240
The City Lord and Madam can judge.

59
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,400
How to arrange the garden party

60
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,750
is up to Madam.

61
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,710
You don't have a say here.

62
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,150
Mr. Yan.

63
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,960
This is a great opportunity

64
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,470
to showcase Miss Xu's talents.

65
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,240
Maybe she'd be

66
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,800
more than willing.

67
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,270
I...

68
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,840
Are you suggesting
a competition against me?

69
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,560
Are you scared?

70
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,150
Who said I was scared?

71
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,240
Then let's make a bet.

72
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,840
If you lose,

73
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,310
you leave the office.

74
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,030
And if I win?

75
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,030
I'll leave.

76
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,590
Madam,

77
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,170
what do you think of my proposal?

78
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,000
A competition based on skills.

79
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,680
That's not a bad idea.

80
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,430
Mother, Xinglan has just arrived.

81
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,270
I'm afraid...

82
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,270
It's settled.

83
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,800
Alright, as you said,

84
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,640
the bet is on.

85
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,430
Since everyone knows now,

86
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,920
you can choose teams.

87
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,680
Miss Xu's teammates
stand over here.

88
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,750
Miss Xu is so carelss.

89
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,430
She can't nurture flowers well.

90
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,400
Miss Yingying is from a good family,

91
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,780
studying flowers since childhood,

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,190
so her skills must be great.

93
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,920
We'll choose Miss Yingying then.

94
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,760
We're sure to win.

95
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,670
You all...

96
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,560
You all...

97
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,520
Forget it.

98
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,480
Xinglan, I choose you.

99
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,800
Miss Xu has fewer teammates,

100
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,870
so I'll go to her team.

101
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,680
It's not too late to admit defeat.

102
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,830
Mr. Yan is here.

103
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,830
Mr. Yan, why not team up with me?

104
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,950
You and I together

105
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,590
can surely make it splendid.

106
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,430
(Mr. Yan sided with Xu Xinglan.)

107
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,170
(It won't be in my favor.)

108
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,240
(I need to think of a way
to win Mr. Yan over.)

109
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,160
Mr. Yan.

110
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,510
I dropped my handkerchief in the tree.

111
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,510
Could you help me, please?

112
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,160
Walk forward.

113
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,060
Look up.

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,840
Reach out.

115
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,710
Grab it.

116
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,390
Mr. Yan.

117
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,070
Xu Xinglan is so vile.

118
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,000
I'll surely drive you out.

119
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,430
Yunxin, where are you?

120
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,310
I want to ask you
about the garden party.

121
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,080
Yunxin.

122
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,430
Who? Stop.

123
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,480
What is it?

124
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,560
I thought I saw
a shadow behind just now.

125
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,630
No one's there.

126
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,670
You must've seen it wrong.

127
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,920
No.

128
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,630
A gust of wind just blew by.

129
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,980
It might've been a tree's shadow.

130
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,990
A tree's shadow?

131
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,340
Glad you joined Xu Xinglan's team.

132
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,180
(Arrangement Office)

133
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,630
Report to me immediately
if they make any moves.

134
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,800
That doesn't feel right.

135
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,160
Shen Miaoyi,

136
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,510
don't forget.

137
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,160
When you couldn't enter the mansion,

138
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,070
it was me who took pity on you

139
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,600
and helped you stay here.

140
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,870
If you don't listen to me,

141
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,240
I can have you leave the office anytime.

142
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,630
I...

143
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,680
Do you believe I can
make you leave here right away?

144
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,350
Don't worry.

145
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,750
As long as you listen to me,

146
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,310
you can not only stay here

147
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,240
but also rise in rank
and wealth with me.

148
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,680
As long as we get rid of that wild girl,

149
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,600
we can return to our previous lives.

150
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,300
(Arrangement Office)

151
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,630
Everyone, be careful.

152
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,510
These flowers are
for tomorrow's competition.

153
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,000
Slow down.

154
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,310
Be careful.

155
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,160
If you break them,

156
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,390
we won't be able to compete.

157
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,800
- Let me do it.
- Okay.

158
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,680
Can we put this here?

159
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,880
Sure.

160
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,550
The ideas are quite good.

161
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,150
The garden of the mansion

162
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,300
will be left to you tomorrow.

163
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,320
Xinglan will arrange
the southern courtyard,

164
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,560
and Yingying will arrange
the northern courtyard.

165
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,910
Don't forget

166
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,120
the bet between you.

167
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,120
Yes.

168
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,480
I won't let you down.

169
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,140
(Arrangement Office)

170
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,870
Look at Wei Yingying's demeanor
these days.

171
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,300
Seems she thinks she's already won.

172
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,470
Xinglan.

173
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,320
You've worked hard these days.

174
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,120
These delicious treats
are a reward for you.

175
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,270
How nice of you.

176
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,110
Miss Zhong.

177
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:20,630
You all eat first.

178
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,550
I'll go get busy.

179
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,360
These

180
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,910
seem to be Yunxin's favorites.

181
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,120
There's a note here.

182
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,360
Yunxin.

183
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,670
I know you're a foodie,

184
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,790
so eat more.

185
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,630
Relax about weight.

186
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,080
(Is someone pursuing Yunxin?)

187
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,390
Who? Stop.

188
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,200
Could it be that a pervert
is really after her?

189
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,510
Let's go.

190
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,000
What happened?

191
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,960
Yunxin.

192
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,560
Xinglan.

193
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,840
Who messed up my flowers like this?

194
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,840
(It must be Wei Yingying.)

195
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:25,340
(Garden Party Day; Arrangement Office)

196
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,790
You are so tender, though of pale,
light yellow hue.

197
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,550
I used the four arts as the theme.

198
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,630
City Lord, Madam,

199
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,750
do you like it?

200
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:01,480
Why do you need the color
of rose or green jade?

201
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,790
Beside you, there are
no beautiful flowers but fade.

202
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,510
What a good poem.

203
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,080
Not bad.

204
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,670
You've put in effort.

205
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,840
What do you think, Madam?

206
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,440
We can head
to the southern courtyard now.

207
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,270
Is the southern courtyard ready?

208
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,910
City Lord, Madam,

209
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,440
everything is prepared.

210
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,560
Let's go.

211
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,680
(Xu Xinglan,)

212
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,850
(without flowers at the garden party,)

213
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,670
(let me see how you'll manage.)

214
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,820
(Yisu Milk Tea)

215
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,700
(Milk Tea)

216
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,080
Don't miss it

217
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,360
as you pass by.

218
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,080
Come try the freshly made milk tea.

219
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,480
A hundred-year-old brand

220
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,670
deserves your trust.

221
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,630
(Welcome to the Garden Party)
Welcome to the garden party.

222
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,480
I'm your guide, Xu Xinglan.

223
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,390
Take a look, take a look.

224
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,360
City Lord, Madam, try this.

225
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,840
Welcome to the food area.

226
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,720
You can taste anything.

227
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,630
So exquisite.

228
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,580
This is the new pastry
from Zuixin House.

229
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,150
Madam, why don't you try the milk tea?

230
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,390
Milk tea?

231
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,630
Sure.

232
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,720
Let me try.

233
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,960
So delicious.

234
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,670
Let's go check over there.

235
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,480
Please follow me to the next stop.

236
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,630
Come and take a look.

237
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,890
Each kebab smells amazing,

238
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:55,960
driving away the sadness.

239
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,990
Try this.

240
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,910
So abundant?

241
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,390
Yeah.

242
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,910
Let's go.

243
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,640
- My Lord.
- It's all for tasting.

244
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,270
This is for entertainment and leisure.

245
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,580
(Immersive Storybooks)
All stories are available.

246
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,460
(Romantic Story)

247
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,180
(Red Snow, Mandarin Duck)
Going straight

248
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,580
from beginner to advanced.

249
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,910
Xinglan, you brought
the experience house here.

250
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,720
This is called a mobile experience.

251
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,270
Good, good.

252
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,240
But it can't be eaten.

253
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,310
City Lord.

254
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,000
It's a garden party.

255
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,720
Why are there no flowers at all?

256
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,480
Of course, there are flowers.

257
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,000
Please follow me.

258
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,550
There's more?

259
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,840
Let's go.

260
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,800
Well.

261
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,750
What is this flower?

262
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,670
I've never seen it.

263
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,790
Madam, this is the Frost Flower.

264
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,960
There's only one in the world.

265
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,030
It looks like it's covered
with a layer of frost.

266
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,840
Amazing.

267
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,670
(That's impossible.)

268
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,320
(How could flowers grow overnight?)

269
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,910
Who do you think wins,

270
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,840
the southern courtyard

271
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,550
or the northern courtyard?

272
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,840
I think

273
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,630
Xinglan wins.

274
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,080
- Good.
- Good.

275
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:51,910
She cheated.

276
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,630
Her flowers are all dead.

277
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,790
Why can she win?

278
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:57,790
How do you know

279
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,910
