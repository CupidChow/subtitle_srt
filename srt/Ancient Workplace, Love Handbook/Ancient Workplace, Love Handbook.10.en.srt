=Episode 10=

3
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,520
The love strategy: Start with feelings.

4
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:39,710
Play to her interests.

5
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,320
Yunxin.

6
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,110
Lower her guard,

7
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,540
and close the distance between you,

8
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,110
leading to further development.

9
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,880
This is for you.

10
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,520
I don't want it.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,840
If you don't want it,

12
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,150
I'll eat it raw.

13
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,950
What are you doing?

14
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,560
How can you eat it?

15
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,840
I'll take it then.

16
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,310
I'll keep the rabbit.

17
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,280
You can leave now.

18
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,340
(Love Strategy)

19
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,310
Heaven.

20
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,680
Let the wind blow.

21
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,870
The beauty strategy.

22
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,640
With your stunning looks,

23
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,070
subtly win her heart,

24
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,070
making her fall for you,

25
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,070
to deepen the relationship.

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,560
Does your neck hurt?

27
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,520
Did you pull your back?

28
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,030
How is that possible?

29
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,310
My back is as good as ever.

30
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,280
Glad you're okay.

31
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,750
I...

32
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,840
Yunxin.

33
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,150
Yunxin.

34
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,000
Stop blowing.

35
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,870
Do you even understand romance?

36
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,520
The wind is so strong.

37
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,150
It's killing me.

38
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,300
(Beauty Strategy)

39
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,280
I heard you caught a chill.

40
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,900
The self-harm strategy.

41
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,120
After those plans,

42
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,630
her energy is probably depleted,

43
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,710
and you must harm yourself

44
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,800
to show your weakness

45
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,430
and trap her step by step.

46
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,840
Her defense will gradually collapse.

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,360
This strategy will surely succeed.

48
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,560
How is it?

49
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,590
Feeling unwell?

50
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,630
Let me see.

51
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,960
Why is it so hot?

52
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,190
Have you taken medicine?

53
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,430
Have you eaten anything?

54
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,310
Then you lie here for now.

55
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,460
I'll go prepare the medicine.

56
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,150
(Yan's self-harm strategy
is indeed effective.)

57
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,280
What's wrong

58
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,030
with Mr. Jun?

59
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,630
It was so cold yesterday,

60
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,910
yet he soaked in the water for an hour.

61
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,900
- You don't get it.
- Not true.

62
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,680
(He did it on purpose.)

63
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,240
How do you know?

64
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,520
Did you peek at Mr. Jun?

65
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,960
My figure is better than his.

66
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,530
I didn't.

67
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,340
I said I didn't.

68
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,980
(Self-harm Strategy)

69
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,560
I've never seen anyone who'd use

70
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,680
military tactics
to pursue a girl like Mr. Jun did.

71
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,390
He used to lead troops at the border.

72
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,480
Using military tactics is normal.

73
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,520
His plan failed?

74
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,120
Not just failed.

75
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,630
It fell apart completely.

76
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,040
I think

77
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,040
it's okay.

78
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:45,870
I think

79
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,430
Yunxin likes Mr. Jun.

80
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,720
But why does she keep avoiding him?

81
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,830
Maybe Miss Zhong
doesn't want to burden Jun.

82
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,270
Burden?

83
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,400
What do you mean?

84
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,040
Miss Zhong's father

85
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,190
is the Scholar General.

86
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,040
He hanged himself
due to treason.

87
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,070
Miss Zhong has been unable
to let go of this matter.

88
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,320
Really?

89
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,600
Father also found this suspicious,

90
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,560
so he didn't order action
against Mr. Zhong.

91
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,930
Then why did he hang himself?

92
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,270
Wasn't that confirming
his guilt of treason?

93
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,240
Mr. Zhong was proud.

94
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,370
Suddenly being accused of such a crime,

95
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,010
he was filled with anger and injustice.

96
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,310
And then?

97
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,680
After Mr. Zhong's death,

98
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,310
Father didn't assign blame

99
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,630
or implicate anyone else.

100
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,040
Miss Zhong was assigned
to the Arrangement Office.

101
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,160
I think

102
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,680
Miss Zhong doesn't dislike my brother.

103
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,680
She just...

104
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:47,120
She just fears that her background
will implicate Mr. Jun,

105
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,360
so she simply doesn't respond.

106
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,070
No wonder

107
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,870
Mr. Jun's efforts have all been in vain.

108
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,300
But...

109
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,990
But how can we

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
help Yunxin let it go?

111
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,360
The little tiger is me.

112
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,950
The little rabbit is you.

113
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,040
Whatever will happen in the future,

114
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,660
we'll always be together.

115
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,360
Okay, it's settled then.

116
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,200
Pinky promise.

117
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,830
(I've never changed my mind.)

118
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,270
(You'll just need to take care
of yourself from now on.)

119
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,100
(Junling Pavilion)

120
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,660
Whoever starts the problem can end it.

121
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,630
Where is Mr. Jun?

122
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,240
I haven't seen him for several days.

123
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,870
Has he given up because previous plans

124
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:06,800
all failed?

125
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,190
I don't think so.

126
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,280
Is he using

127
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,720
the escaping strategy?

128
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,830
Do you know something?

129
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,120
I don't know anything.

130
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,390
How can he disappear?

131
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,830
Men really aren't any good.

132
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,740
(Arrangement Office)

133
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,190
Yunxin.

134
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,160
Zhong Yunxin.

135
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,860
Recently, you and Mr. Jun...

136
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,800
Don't mention him.

137
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,870
It's just been three days.

138
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,600
Even if it's been three years,

139
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,310
it's none of my business.

140
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,430
I haven't even asked about that.

141
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,750
Seems Mr. Jun hasn't shown up
for a long time.

142
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,080
Yunxin.

143
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,870
This is the list
of older maids you wanted.

144
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,040
By the way, Xinglan,

145
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,480
I need to talk to you.

146
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,200
Changing the topic again.

147
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,440
The older maids in the mansion

148
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,560
will have to leave
when they reach a certain age.

149
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,870
This is the list of maids
leaving this time.

150
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,920
So many?

151
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,480
I don't even know

152
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,150
what they'll do after leaving.

153
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,960
If they marry someone unreliable,

154
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,270
it'll be even worse.

155
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,590
Xinglan.

156
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,970
I was just looking for you.

157
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,630
What is this?

158
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,790
In the mansion, many maids

159
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,830
have reached a certain age
but haven't left.

160
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,030
Because after leaving, they are helpless

161
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,200
and cannot live independently.

162
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,090
The City Lord has to spend
a large amount

163
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,000
of money every year to support them.

164
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,100
That's right.

165
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:17,030
So, what if we help them
find a solution?

166
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,080
What solution?

167
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,240
Where's the best workplace
for older maids?

168
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,550
The school in the City Lord's mansion.

169
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,080
Run a school?
