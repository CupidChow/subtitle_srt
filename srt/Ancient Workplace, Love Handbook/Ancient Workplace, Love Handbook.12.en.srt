00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,260
=Episode 12=

3
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,560
Finance conditions have been tightened.

4
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,040
If it breaks, we'll have to fix it.

5
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,100
Let's wait a bit longer.

6
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:44,740
That's true.

7
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:50,940
Why are you looking at me?

8
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,500
Whenever I'm with you,

9
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,700
nothing good ever happens.

10
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,300
But you're not entirely useless.

11
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,690
At least you've contributed

12
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,540
to the school.

13
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,980
Should I feel honored then?

14
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,980
Finally, Miss Xu praised me.

15
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,780
Don't get too excited.

16
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,980
The school is running well

17
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,740
because Yunxin manages it well.

18
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,980
Speaking of Yunxin,

19
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,220
what's going on with your brother?

20
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,900
Do you think he's playing hard to get?

21
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,460
He isn't that kind of person.

22
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,540
I've never seen anyone
who'd chase a girl like him.

23
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,780
I don't know which fool
gave him that idea.

24
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,500
If he had to use the self-harm strategy,

25
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,740
he should do it thoroughly.

26
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,380
A packet of softening powders

27
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,940
can let him stay in bed for three days.

28
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,740
You're more ruthless than I am.

29
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,130
Is it you?

30
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,740
It's

31
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,580
Song Heng.

32
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,820
Such a fool.

33
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,740
Who else could it be?

34
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,900
Empty talk is useless.

35
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,120
Obviously,
you have no practical experience.

36
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,040
Do you have practical experience?

37
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,420
Of course.

38
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,580
If you ask me,

39
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,260
Mr. Jun should just

40
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,980
grab Yunxin

41
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,220
and then directly...

42
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,660
Well.

43
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,580
I have to go.

44
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:42,940
Bye.

45
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,180
Didn't you say
the door couldn't be opened?

46
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:48,860
I just...

47
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,140
(That was such a good opportunity.)

48
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,260
(Why did I dodge?)

49
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,580
Young Master, why are you...

50
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,420
Shut up.

51
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,780
Why are you back so soon?

52
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,630
(She used to be very proactive.)

53
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,700
(Why did she dodge just now?)

54
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,340
(Was it all just my one-sided feelings?)

55
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,940
(Did I overthink things?)

56
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,900
Xu Xinglan.

57
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,180
What's wrong with you?

58
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,820
Have you fallen for him?

59
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,300
No.

60
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,160
Don't you want to go home?

61
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,180
Of course, I do.

62
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,220
You're too scared to kiss him.

63
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,620
It means you can't bear to leave.

64
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,810
What should I do?

65
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:16,900
Miss.

66
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,300
Miss. Miss.

67
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,260
- What's wrong?
- It's bad.

68
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,930
Someone wants to drop out of the school.

69
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:24,880
What?

70
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,040
The female officials
are waiting for you at the door.

71
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,660
(Arrangement Office)

72
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:33,980
You can't drop out.

73
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,740
Whatever it is, let's wait for Miss Xu.

74
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,900
I can't stay here for another moment.

75
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,500
That's right; I can't stay either.

76
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,510
- Don't.
- What's going on?

77
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,340
You finally came.

78
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,340
They want to drop out.

79
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,180
Miss Xu, you may not know this,

80
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,380
but everyone at the school

81
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,420
is being belittled outside.

82
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,260
That's right.

83
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,860
They say what we're learning is useless.

84
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,860
- We can't make any money outside.
- Yes.

85
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,260
How are we supposed to survive?

86
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,380
Young Master,

87
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,900
you're worried about Miss Xu.

88
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,080
Just go check on her.

89
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,860
Running the school is the madam's idea.

90
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,100
Who dares to slander it?

91
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,260
The school has rules.

92
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,340
If you drop out without permission,

93
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,420
you'll have to leave
without any money.

94
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,060
But we don't even know

95
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,440
if what we learn here

96
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,520
will help us make money.

97
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,500
- Right.
- Exactly.

98
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,540
What if we can't profit?

99
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,540
Then let's give it a try.

100
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,260
Everyone,

101
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,100
let's get to work.

102
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,540
Come and take a look.

103
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,820
Freshly made marinated snacks.

104
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,660
It's free to taste.

105
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,740
It's free if not tasty.

106
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,860
Ladies, our clothes

107
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,300
are exclusively designed
by professional designers.

108
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,320
No more outfit repeating.

109
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,940
You'll look the prettiest with them.

110
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,780
Feeling down?

111
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:48,960
Change your hairstyle.

112
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,180
Just broke up?

113
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,220
Change your hairstyle.

114
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,460
It'll be designed
by a professional stylist.

115
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,740
Xiaohei has been

116
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,860
retching a lot lately.

117
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,980
Can you take a look?

118
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,050
Generally, this is mostly

119
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,780
because it licks its fur often.

120
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,620
When you go back,

121
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,560
give it some cat grass,

122
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,140
and it will throw up the hairball.

123
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,740
Is that so?

124
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,140
Alright, thanks.

125
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,380
It smells bad

126
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,860
yet it tastes so delicious.

127
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,180
Come on, I want one too.

128
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,170
I want one too.

129
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,020
You'll all get it.

130
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,420
Here.

131
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,010
Don't worry; we have plenty.

132
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,250
Cool and cute.

133
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,850
You'll be pretty soon.

134
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,370
I just got dumped.

135
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,970
I want to change to a trendy hairstyle.

136
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:23,860
Come on.

137
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,860
Everyone, come and taste.

138
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,780
Freshly made marinated snacks.

139
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,150
I wanted it first.

140
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,300
It's mine.

141
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,140
Unbelievable!

142
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:33,820
We have tastings.

143
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:34,980
It's free if not tasty.

144
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,380
Come and try it.

145
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,480
Come on.

146
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,660
Give it a taste.

147
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,270
I want some too.

148
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,460
It smells so good.

149
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,060
Jot it down.

150
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,740
No pushing; there's plenty for all.

151
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,580
Young Master.

152
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,620
I want to try too.

153
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,180
What are you joining in for?

154
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,700
I can support Miss Xu.

155
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,190
Maybe

156
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,780
she doesn't want to see us.

157
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,100
What happened between you two

158
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,460
that night?

159
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,750
- I feel...
- Shut up.

160
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,990
We have professional stylists.

161
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,580
- Miss. Come look here.
- This way.

162
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,580
Come look here.

163
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,580
Check out this outfit.

164
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,190
This is for styling hair.

165
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,500
How about this outfit?

166
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,060
Don't miss out when you pass by.

167
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,780
Can we really take these?

168
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:26,980
Of course.

169
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,390
You earned this yourself.

170
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:30,800
Thank you, Miss Xu.

171
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,170
Is there anyone else
wanting to drop out?

172
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,900
- No, no.
- No, no.

173
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,580
Alright, take your money.

174
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,700
So much.

175
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:41,740
This is mine.

176
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,740
I heard they earned

177
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,180
lots of money in just one day.

178
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,340
If I'd known,

179
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,100
I would've gone with them that day.

180
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,420
I need to get my sister in here too.

181
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,560
Didn't you make a fuss before,

182
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,740
saying they were embarrassing

183
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,980
and couldn't make any money?

184
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,340
If I'd known they'd earn so much,

185
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,530
I would have gone earlier.

186
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,620
Mr. Yan asked me to warn you two.

187
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,860
If you talk too much again,

188
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,300
don't blame me...

189
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,930
Let's go, let's go.

190
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,160
Young Master.

191
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,300
It's all settled.

192
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,820
Miss Xu is amazing.

193
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,260
It only took her one day to...

194
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,660
Indeed impressive.

195
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,500
Why don't you go congratulate Miss Xu?

196
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,700
What's there to congratulate?

197
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,060
What's there to congratulate?

198
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,820
I hereby announce

199
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,020
the graduation of the first cohort
of students from Hongxiang School.

200
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,700
From now on,

201
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,940
you are the first batch
of professional women in Anjin City.

202
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,700
We hope you can start your career

203
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,700
with passion

204
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,980
to realize your personal value

205
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,790
and become role models for women.

206
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,780
(Graduation Ceremony of the First Class
of Hongxiang School)

207
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,300
Xinglan,

208
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,460
the fact that we could have such girls
graduate from here

209
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,020
is thanks to you.

210
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,820
Madam,

211
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,180
I didn't do a lot.

212
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,820
It's Yunxin who has been busy
managing everything.

213
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,110
Good, good.

214
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,740
You are all good kids.

215
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,940
Everyone gets a reward.

216
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:43,710
Great.

217
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:44,850
Great.

218
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:45,690
Thank you, Madam.

219
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,540
Thank you, Madam.

220
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:49,460
(Graduation Ceremony of the First Class
of Hongxiang School)

221
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,700
Young Master.

222
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,180
You've been going back and forth
for an hour.

223
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,980
Don't disturb me while I'm reading.

224
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,860
Do you like reading upside down?

225
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,420
Young Master.

226
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,540
Do you have something
on your mind?

227
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,380
No.

228
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,980
You must be thinking
about Miss Xu.

229
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,140
I have a friend

230
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,980
who fell for a girl.

231
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,500
And then?

232
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,540
That girl seems

233
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,260
to have rejected him.

234
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,130
What?

235
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,020
You got rejected by Miss Xu?

236
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,270
- I...
- No.

237
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,020
Your friend got rejected.

238
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,660
Why do you think that happened?

239
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,620
Obviously, it was...

240
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,220
You've asked the right person about it.

241
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,140
A woman's thoughts

242
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,960
are as hard to grasp
as a needle in the ocean.

243
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,220
Sincerity

244
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,300
is always the trump card.
