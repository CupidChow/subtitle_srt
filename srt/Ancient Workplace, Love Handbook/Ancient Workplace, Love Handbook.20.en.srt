2
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,260
=Episode 20=

3
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,960
(Arrangement Office)

4
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,110
Although you won the bet,

5
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,110
I still think those two are strange.

6
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,560
You didn't dress up today,

7
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,760
but you're still very handsome.

8
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:46,900
Yan.

9
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,220
Qi.

10
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:51,790
What a sweet couple of newlyweds.

11
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,000
So inseparable.

12
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,070
I have no choice.

13
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,200
She's too clingy.

14
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,110
Right, right.

15
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,710
It's me who's clingy.

16
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,080
Let's go.

17
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,550
What a sweet couple.

18
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,150
How could there be a problem?

19
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,080
Not right.

20
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,380
What's not right?

21
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,070
When Zhenzhen approached him,

22
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,430
her feet stood outward,

23
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:16,510
and she kept her distance,

24
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,560
maintaining a safe space.

25
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,680
She was on guard.

26
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,260
When they smiled at each other,

27
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,460
Zhenzhen's lips went up
about 150 degrees,

28
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,750
her facial muscles were stiff,
and her gaze wandered.

29
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,690
So, she was pretending.

30
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,620
She looked like leaning on Qi,

31
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,890
but in fact, she wasn't.

32
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,760
So, something's wrong

33
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:34,480
with these two.

34
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,950
What should we do?

35
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:39,920
It's too high.

36
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,760
Honey,

37
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,230
why not help them?

38
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,760
Mr. Qi, Princess.

39
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,870
It's so high. I...

40
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,000
Come on.

41
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,870
Great. Mr. Qi can help.

42
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:57,950
Just a little more.

43
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,040
Yes, just a little more.

44
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,190
Mr. Qi!

45
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,560
Are you okay?

46
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,400
- Honey!
- Mr. Qi!

47
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,560
Get up.

48
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,800
Good for me.

49
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,910
Thank you, Mr. Qi.

50
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,240
- Thank you.
- You're amazing.

51
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,550
- It broke my heart.
- Let's go.

52
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,800
Clean up yourself.

53
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,910
As expected.

54
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,780
Yuwen Yan.

55
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,380
I've discovered something.

56
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,200
I've discovered something.

57
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,160
What did you discover?

58
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,340
I've discovered

59
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,900
the major secret
between Mr. Qi and Zhenzhen.

60
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,540
When others are around, they're close,

61
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,060
but when alone, they ignore each other.

62
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:56,170
Something's fishy.

63
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,340
Are you overthinking it?

64
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,180
Who's always glued together?

65
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,300
We are.

66
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:08,980
Come on.

67
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,420
Really?

68
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,480
If you don't believe me,
see for yourself.

69
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,460
I'm not going.

70
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,500
Shall we just go back?

71
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,940
- I want you to know
- Stop it.

72
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,340
my judgment is correct.

73
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,620
Be gentler.

74
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,380
I'm already being very gentle.

75
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,860
You're hurting me.

76
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,780
Forget it.

77
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,140
(The sage said)

78
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,700
(love wasn't about obvious actions)

79
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,940
(but careful ones.)

80
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,420
Honey, you've worked hard.

81
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,420
I'll give you a massage too.

82
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,820
Stop looking.

83
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,740
It's broad daylight; being that intimate

84
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,580
indicates a problem.

85
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,340
Your shoulders are really wide.

86
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,300
Is this pressure suitable?

87
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,160
I'll pour you some tea.

88
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,500
Please, dear.

89
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,100
Come with me.

90
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,060
Let's go.

91
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,700
Princess, I feel

92
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,060
that you've been different
towards Mr. Qi recently.

93
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,180
Last night...

94
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,520
Yes, Princess.

95
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,980
I thought you were only interested
in the marriage alliance,

96
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,360
but I didn't expect you
to have feelings for Mr. Qi as well.

97
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,180
I just want to marry
a young master of Anjin asap.

98
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,780
I have no other intentions.

99
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,140
That's true.

100
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,260
Those few books Mr. Qi sent

101
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,260
have been left untouched.

102
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,420
You didn't read any of them.

103
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,420
Why did you marry me?

104
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,540
- Because I like you.
- Because of my status?

105
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,340
Of course not.

106
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,600
- It's because...
- I heard it.

107
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,920
I didn't expect you
to be this kind of person.

108
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,620
How can you judge me?

109
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,620
Do you think you're a good person?

110
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,140
You spouted nonsense when we first met.

111
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,980
It seems we're evenly matched.

112
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,620
We're the same.

113
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,540
You're a vain liar.

114
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,820
You're a sly scoundrel.

115
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,060
Well, in that case,

116
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,300
let's get a divorce.

117
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,140
Divorce then.

118
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,020
(A familiar scent.)

119
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,010
Are you saying
this flower is poisonous?

120
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,060
Infusing this flower into wine

121
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,420
is deadly.

122
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,740
How do you know that?

123
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,660
Go check who brought in this flower

124
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,920
and where to get more.

125
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,020
Remember.

126
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,180
Don't alert anyone.

127
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,140
Yes.

128
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,700
Young Master.

129
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,740
So soon?

130
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,300
No, I forgot to tell you

131
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,820
they want a divorce.

132
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,220
A divorce?

133
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,260
Yes.

134
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,500
Let's go.

135
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,340
Let's go take a look.

136
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,740
What's going on?

137
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,540
You just got married
and now want a divorce?

138
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,820
How can you do this?

139
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,460
Qi, I don't want to lecture you.

140
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,680
You've always been mischievous.

141
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,360
You'd cause trouble if undisciplined...

142
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,820
The contract?

143
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,220
First, regularly display affection.

144
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,740
The princess must help Mr. Qi

145
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,300
maintain a doting image in public.

146
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,620
He wants me to set up a persona for him.

147
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,620
Isn't that excessive?

148
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,460
Second,

149
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,700
when the two parties aren't pretending,

150
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,740
no physical contact is allowed.

151
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,620
This clause applies to Mr. Qi.

152
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,740
What does that mean?

153
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,300
It means

154
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,540
only the princess can touch Qi,

155
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,180
but Qi can't touch her.

156
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,340
The princess cannot interfere

157
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,980
with Mr. Qi's career plans.

158
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,300
If necessary,

159
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,380
the princess should firmly express

160
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,900
unconditional support

161
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,220
for Mr. Qi's career
in all public settings.

162
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,060
He doesn't necessarily have a career.

163
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,500
Actually, he...

164
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,420
Mr. Qi must acknowledge

165
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,320
his status as a matrilocal husband
in Xiliang.

166
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,940
Both parties must live in Xiliang
annually for several months.

167
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,070
A matrilocal husband?

168
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,420
Maybe Mother doesn't even know

169
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,780
her son has become a matrilocal husband.

170
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,540
Sorry for the suffering, Qi.

171
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,460
What about you?

172
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,610
Why are you doing this?

173
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,340
With Xiliang in turmoil,

174
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,860
I can only rely on the power of Anjin

175
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,220
and marry into Anjin City

176
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,860
to help my father stabilize his rule.

177
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,980
I'm the only princess of Xiliang,

178
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,900
so I must fulfill this mission.

179
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,650
So,

180
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,540
it doesn't matter who it is,

181
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,780
as long as it's a young master
of Anjin City.

182
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,820
No wonder you were wavering
between Mr. Jun

183
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,740
and Mr. Yan.

184
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,060
I don't like either of them.

185
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,540
Mr. Jun is so boring,

186
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,580
and Mr. Yan...

187
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,220
What did you eat for dinner?

188
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,180
The food here suits my taste.

189
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,540
Thank you for your hospitality.

190
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,420
You're too kind.

191
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,820
So, about our marriage...

192
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,180
You traveled a long way.

193
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,780
I'll take good care of you
on behalf of Mother.

194
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,540
Although he seems to care about me,

195
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,700
he always keeps his distance.

196
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,890
Maybe ghosts and monsters

197
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,780
wouldn't dare to approach him.

198
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,100
I'm not talking about you.

199
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,800
Since you don't like them,

200
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,900
what about Mr. Qi?

201
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,700
Him?

202
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,020
I don't like him at all.
