00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,260
=Episode 8=

3
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,760
How do you know

4
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,430
her flowers are all dead?

5
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,640
Everyone at the office knows now

6
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,710
that her flowers all died overnight.

7
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:52,640
There must be something fishy.

8
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,060
How dare you?

9
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,320
It was supposed
to be a nice garden party,

10
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,960
and now it's a mess.

11
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,870
Take them back.

12
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,070
Speak up.

13
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,680
Xu Xinglan cheated.

14
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,310
City Lord, Madam, please uphold justice.

15
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,140
Wei Yingying.

16
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,280
Where did I cheat?

17
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:19,760
I made it.

18
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,600
Look, look.

19
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,640
Such a marvelous method.

20
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,040
How did you come up with it?

21
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:25,230
This is simple.

22
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,590
I played with it growing up.

23
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:27,640
I'm familiar with it.

24
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,900
I made this flower with my hands,

25
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,380
so there's only one in the world.

26
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,660
You didn't say
we must use real flowers, right?

27
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,260
By the way,

28
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,060
my flowers were ruined by you, right?

29
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,220
Madam, she's framing me.

30
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,100
Kneel.

31
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,780
Did you hear that?

32
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,340
Kneel.

33
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:53,900
I confess.

34
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:54,980
I confess.

35
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,340
I ruined Miss Xu's flowers.

36
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,340
Miaoyi.

37
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,980
You're being silly.

38
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,300
For all these years,

39
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,740
you've worked diligently

40
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,820
in the mansion.

41
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,220
How could you do such a thing?

42
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,500
Do you

43
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,460
have any difficulties?

44
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,700
Don't worry.

45
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,180
If someone threatens you,

46
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,180
I will definitely help you.

47
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,220
Well.

48
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,260
It's Miss Wei.

49
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,300
Shen Miaoyi.

50
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,340
How dare you slander me?

51
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,980
She said if I didn't help her

52
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,700
kick Miss Xu out of the office,

53
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,140
she'd make me leave.

54
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,060
I really had no choice.

55
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,460
I beg the City Lord and Madam
for mercy.

56
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,730
Shen Miaoyi.

57
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,580
You did all this.

58
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,620
Let's see who's lying.

59
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,060
Bring it up.

60
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,260
The reason these flowers
withered overnight

61
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,780
is because they were sprayed
with excessive fertilizer.

62
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,580
That doesn't prove it was me.

63
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,340
Mr. Yan went to your home late at night

64
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,900
and proved that the fertilizer

65
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,330
in your bedroom
is your family's exclusive secret.

66
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,140
(He found this out for me
without telling me.)

67
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,180
I didn't do it.

68
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,420
It wasn't me.

69
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,580
It wasn't me.

70
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,420
Mr. Yan,

71
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,940
it really wasn't me.

72
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,340
It's all your fault.

73
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,180
It's all your fault.

74
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:49,980
It's all your fault.

75
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,300
You're bold.

76
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,580
How dare you hit
my future daughter-in-law?

77
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,740
Drag her out.

78
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,260
Dismiss her from the office.

79
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:05,900
Everyone else, leave.

80
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,260
- Yes.
- Yes.

81
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,700
Are you okay?

82
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,100
Madam.

83
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,060
My Lord.

84
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,460
We finally got rid of this eyesore.

85
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,380
Madam,

86
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,290
you know about Wei Yingying all along?

87
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,740
How could I not know?

88
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,260
How is Xinglan doing
at the Arrangement Office?

89
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,180
Tell me everything.

90
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,300
Since you asked,

91
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,540
then I must speak up.

92
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,700
Madam, Wei Yingying at the office

93
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,180
is despicable.

94
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,260
She sticks to Mr. Yan every day,

95
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,740
always calling him "Mr. Yan".

96
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,180
What does she want?

97
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,660
She's so vile. So annoying.

98
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,900
She even framed Miss Xu.

99
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,780
Madam, the main thing

100
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,580
is she even said you were ugly.

101
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,300
Wei Yingying?

102
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,060
I'll see what kind of ruckus
you can stir up.

103
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,020
So,

104
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,140
Madam, you just...

105
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,060
So I just

106
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,620
played along.

107
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,380
But

108
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,980
my future daughter-in-law is

109
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,100
definitely the right one.

110
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,220
Yan,

111
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,380
why are you standing there?

112
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,700
Hurry up and take Xinglan back.

113
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:14,860
Okay.

114
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,460
Xinglan.

115
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,820
Your shoes are quite nice.

116
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,020
Where did you buy them?

117
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,660
- Looks good.
- Madam.

118
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,220
Without shoes,

119
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,300
she can't walk.

120
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,580
Yan, you carry her.

121
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,540
What a teachable child.

122
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,860
Madam, you're still so mischievous.

123
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,140
(Yanyu Pavilion)

124
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,620
I'll leave then.

125
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,420
Young Master.

126
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,100
I didn't see anything.

127
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,020
Nothing at all.

128
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:26,860
Stop.

129
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,420
What's the matter?

130
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,870
I have a message from the madam.

131
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,980
It's the festival tonight,

132
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,220
perfect for moon viewing.

133
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,000
Moon viewing?

134
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,940
Yes.

135
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,340
Everyone in the mansion must go.

136
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,300
The madam even found you

137
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,380
an excellent spot for moon viewing.

138
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,380
You and Miss Xu mustn't miss it.

139
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,420
Is this the excellent spot?

140
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,900
After a long wait,
it's just the two of us.

141
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,860
The moon is so beautiful.

142
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,260
What's wrong?

143
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,020
I miss my parents.

144
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,820
Aren't you happy

145
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,980
in the mansion?

146
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,420
I am happy,

147
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,380
but this isn't my home.

148
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,900
Then I'll give you two days off

149
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,540
to go home and visit your family.

150
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,300
Go home?

151
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,380
(This is a good opportunity.)

152
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:33,980
Young Master, look.

153
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,660
The moon is so big.

154
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,780
(Arrangement Office)

155
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,620
I planted these flowers. Take them.

156
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,100
I don't want them; take them away.

157
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,300
Keep them; your favorites.

158
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,460
I said I didn't want them.

159
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,420
What are you doing?
It's not good if someone sees us.

160
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,340
Let her go!

161
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,460
Just keep them.

162
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,580
Fine, I'll keep them.

163
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,980
Put them there; hurry and go.

164
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:00,940
Okay, then.

165
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,220
Remember to water them.

166
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,660
Hurry and go.

167
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,740
Where is he?

168
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,820
He ran away again.

169
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,660
Are you alright?

170
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,540
I'm fine.

171
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,700
By the way, Xinglan,

172
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,900
there's a letter for you.

173
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,220
You even learned
to change the subject.

174
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,020
Who gave it to you?

175
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,340
I don't know.

176
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,840
(See you at 7 am on the East Street.)
It has your name on it.

177
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,340
(Could it be him?)

178
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,740
(Can this person
lead me back home?)

179
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,380
Yunxin, ask for leave for me
at the office.

180
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,780
I have something to go out for.

181
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,460
Where are you going, Xinglan?

182
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,300
Come and take a look.

183
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,860
Homemade wine.

184
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,980
- Who is he to me?
- Rich and tasty.

185
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,640
After being out of touch for so long,
he still found me.

186
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,980
You're so capable.

187
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,820
Why did you still end up
in my hands?

188
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,100
Guess.

189
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,300
Will anyone come to save you now?

190
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,460
Wei Yingying.

191
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,860
If you're sensible,

192
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,500
let me go right now.

193
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,620
Why does everyone like you?

194
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,500
Why does even Mr. Yan favor you?

195
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,620
Why?

196
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,740
(Mr. Yan,)

197
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:02,340
(didn't you go out with Miss Xu?)

198
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,220
(What are you doing here at this time?)

199
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,540
(How long has she been out?)

200
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,900
(About an hour.)

201
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,660
- Hurry, that way.
- Yes.

202
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,020
- You go that way.
- Yes.

203
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,300
(Xu Xinglan.)

204
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,500
(Please be safe.)

205
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,740
Do you think

206
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,020
everyone will still like you

207
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,340
after I ruin your face?

208
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,740
Mr. Yan.

209
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,740
Go.

210
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,260
I'm late.

211
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,500

212
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,620
He'll be here soon.

213
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,580
Young Master.

214
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,500
Wei Yingying has been locked up.

215
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,440
Go tell Nianxia to prepare
some clean clothes.

216
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,140
(What am I doing?)

217
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,660
Who sent you?

218
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,740
What do you mean?

219
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,900
(At first, I kept you in the mansion)

220
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,580

behind the spy organization.)
