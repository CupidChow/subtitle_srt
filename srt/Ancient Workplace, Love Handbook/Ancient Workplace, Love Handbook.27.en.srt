3
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,760
No.

4
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:43,920
You can't possibly think

5
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,820
you can trap me, right?

6
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:47,950
I told you last time

7
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,840
that your consciousness
is fading in this world,

8
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,110
while my consciousness

9
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,730
will eventually reclaim my body.

10
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,670
After a while,

11
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,950
you'll forget this world completely,

12
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,220
and my consciousness will awaken.

13
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,860
Then I'll slaughter everyone
in the mansion.

14
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,900
I won't forget them.

15
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,060
I will never forget.

16
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,020
Why can't we find a way
to save her?

17
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,150
Young Master.

18
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,820
Oh, my.

19
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,980
Amitabha.

20
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,060
(Xinglan.)

21
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,820
(You had a nightmare again.)

22
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:52,920
My prescription

23
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,060
is definitely the right one.

24
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:54,930
Use my prescription.

25
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,910
Yours isn't working.

26
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,280
Try mine.

27
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,260
Xinglan has been unconscious
for five days,

28
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,700
and you've been here for five days.

29
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:05,980
You should take a break.

30
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,140
Yan,

31
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,900
if Miss Xu knows this,

32
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,950
she won't feel at ease.

33
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,380
The medicine is here.

34
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,460
Feed it to her while it's hot.

35
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,420
This medicine isn't working.

36
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,500
We have to try it anyway.

37
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,000
You all go out first.

38
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,980
Yan, I'll keep you company.

39
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:37,860
Let's go.

40
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,860
We should go out too.

41
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,620
Are you just going to sleep like this?

42
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,420
Have you forgotten?

43
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,620
We're supposed to get married soon.

44
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,940
Don't you like the quilt

45
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,220
with a truelove knot?

46
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,460
I've prepared

47
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,880
the wedding invitations

48
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,100
and the bridal gown for you.

49
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,540
If you don't wake up soon,

50
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,660
you won't be able to use them.

74
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,980
Then let's give it a try.

75
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,780
No.

76
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,940
I don't want to forget.

77
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,220
I don't want to forget them.

78
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,460
I don't want to forget them.

79
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,660
No.

80
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,340
I don't want to forget them.

81
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,620
I don't want to.

82
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:31,980
No.

83
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,780
Don't forget.

84
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,660
No.

85
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,140
No!

86
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,500
Miss, you finally woke up.

87
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,060
Who are you?

88
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,980
I'm Nianxia.

89
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,980
Nianxia?

90
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,310
Who is that?

91
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,230
(Where)

92
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,980
(is this?)

93
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,500
Mr. Yan. Mr. Yan.

94
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,340
Mr. Yan.

95
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,940
How is Xinglan?

96
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,900
Miss Xu is awake.

97
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,260
- Young Master.
- Mr. Yan.

98
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,300
I feel like Miss Xu seems a bit off.

99
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,780
Miss Xu doesn't remember me.

100
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,380
(Here...)

101
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,560
(I feel like I've been here before.)

102
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,420
Xinglan.

103
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,640
It's good that you're okay.

104
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,640
It's good that you're okay.

105
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,260
How are you?

106
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,340
Are you cold?

107
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,380
Are you hungry?

108
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,500
Xinglan.

109
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,910
Who are you?

110
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,980
I am your husband.

111
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,820
Husband?

112
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,440
When did I get married?

113
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,820
You really don't remember
anything at all?

114
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,740
I am Yuwen Yan.

115
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,220
I'm Yuwen Yan.

116
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,290
Yuwen Yan...

117
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,740
(I feel like I've heard
this name somewhere.)

118
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:06,860
Young Master,

119
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,340
you and Miss Xu's wedding attires
are ready.

120
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,700
Let's postpone the wedding for now.

121
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,540
But...

122
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,500
She doesn't remember who I am.

123
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,780
If we forced the marriage,

124
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,620
it wouldn't be fair to her.

125
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,380
(Why?)

126
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,220
(Why does my heart hurt so much?)

127
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,020
Alright, I'll take my leave.

128
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,100
Miss Xu.

129
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,340
I didn't mean to overhear
your conversation.

130
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,500
I just woke up and have many things
I want to clarify.

131
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,780
You don't need

132
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,580
to be so formal with me.

133
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,740
About what you just said,

134
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,940
thank you, Mr. Yan.

135
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,750
I heard Nianxia say

136
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,660
we were very much in love before.

137
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,620
Could you

138
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,540
give me some time

139
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,260
