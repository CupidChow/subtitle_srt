=Episode 22=

3
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,400
Miss.

4
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,320
Miss, wake up.

5
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,480
- Miss.
- Xinglan.

6
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,870
We should get going.

7
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,960
- What's wrong?
- Miss overslept again.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,840
I can't wake her up.

9
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,190
Xinglan.

10
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,040
Xinglan.

11
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,800
Xinglan.

12
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:56,870
Xinglan.

13
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,960
(This dream feels so real.)

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,910
Jun and Yunxin's wedding
is about to start.

15
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,560
The wedding?

16
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,760
Are you feeling unwell?

17
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,790
Do you need a physician?

18
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,400
No.

19
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,590
I'm fine.

20
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,150
I might just be too busy lately.

21
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,710
Let's go.

22
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,120
(Happy Union)

23
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,910
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

24
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,170
Enjoy your meal.

25
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:29,950
Take your time eating.

26
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,730
We finally sent off the guests
from the front yard.

27
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,710
Are you tired?

28
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,020
(Happy)

29
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,400
Yunxin and Mr. Jun

30
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,710
are finally together.

31
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,350
How wonderful.

32
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,710
We'll be just as good.

33
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,790
So much has happened.

34
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,680
It feels like a dream.

35
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,840
It's real.

36
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,290
Even if it's a dream,

37
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,750
I'll always be with you.

38
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,960
Got it.

39
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,310
Let's go.

40
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,470
So...

41
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,310
Young Master.

42
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,920
Miss Xu.

43
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,120
Rest early.

44
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,360
It's getting late.

45
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,920
You too.

46
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,710
Young Master,

47
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,120
the matter you instructed

48
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,190
has been handled.

49
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,030
No one found out?

50
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,120
Rest assured, Young Master.

51
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,430
I personally handled it.

52
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,430
No one knows.

53
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,800
Investigate.

54
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,240
Check everyone who came into contact

55
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,190
with that pot of flowers.

56
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:04,710
Understood.

57
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,910
(How could the Fairy Flower
still appear)

58
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,120
(after eliminating Yunying?)

59
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,630
(Could the poisoner
still be in the mansion?)

60
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,220
(Junling Pavilion)

61
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,630
What if others see us?

62
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,630
Yunxin, we're already married.

63
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,430
That's right.

64
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,680
Mr. Jun.

65
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,630
May I borrow your wife for a moment?

66
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,680
It's so early in the morning.

67
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,690
Isn't it inappropriate?

68
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:47,850
Aren't boys supposed

69
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:48,690
to be generous?

70
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,600
It's not like I won't let her return.

71
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,840
I'm leaving. I'm leaving.

72
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,550
Yunxin,

73
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,960
I want you to come back
and manage the school.

74
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,630
Manage the school?

75
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,080
Now, you're Mr. Jun's wife.

76
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,240
It's only natural for you

77
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,870
to run the school.

78
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,360
But I haven't handled school matters
in a long time.

79
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,070
I'm afraid I might be
out of practice.

80
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,800
How many new students
are there in the third class?

81
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,390
126 new students,

82
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,920
33 in the beauty class,

83
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,560
39 in the Xiliang language class,

84
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,190
- and 47 in the cooking class.
- See?

85
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,480
I can't remember these at all.

86
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,920
I've just gotten used to it.

87
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,040
We're about to form
the Xiliang inspection team.

88
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,040
Zhenzhen is too busy.

89
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,040
Having one more person
is always a help.

90
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,400
Well.

91
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,360
Okay then.

92
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,060
(Arrangement Office)

93
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,390
(If that dream is real,)

94
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,630
(Chiyuan will ultimately wake up
and kill Yuwen Yan.)

95
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,430
(Whether she'll succeed or not,)

96
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,070
(the time I can spend with Yuwen Yan)

97
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,070
(is running out.)

98
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,180
What are you thinking?

99
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,430
I'm thinking

100
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,480
that among all lovers,

101
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,750
some can reunite happily,

102
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,360
like Mr. Jun and Yunxin,

103
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,920
and Mr. Qi and Zhenzhen.

104
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,630
But some

105
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,560
must be separated by distance.

106
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,190
You just mentioned

107
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,870
reunited happy couples.

108
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,680
Why are we left out?

113

Of course.

114
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,790

115

that candlelit dinners

were only for those you like.

you haven't told me

119
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,870
that you like me.

120
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,190
So cheesy.

I'm not going to say that.

Maybe Miss Xu has been
too tired these days.

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,750
I'll prescribe
some nourishing medicine.

Seems there wasn't a kite
in the mansion before.

It should be from outside.
