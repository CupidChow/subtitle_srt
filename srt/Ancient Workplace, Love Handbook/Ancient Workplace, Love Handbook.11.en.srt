(Arrangement Office)

4
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,710
Warm congratulations on the inauguration

5
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,150
of our women's school.

00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,180
(Hongxiang School)

00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,820
(Arrangement Office)

8
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,640
Welcome to the opening ceremony
of Hongxiang School.

9
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,110
We are honored to have the madam

10
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,560
serve as our honorary principal.

11
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,000
Now, let's welcome her
to say a few words.

12
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,120
I...

13
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,070
No need for me to speak.

14
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,070
The school was entirely
established by Xinglan.

15
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,400
Everyone can learn skills here.

16
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,310
You'll become role models
for women in Anjin City.

17
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,430
The school offers majors

18
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,560
in cooking, hairstyling, cleaning,

19
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,350
and fashion design, among others.

20
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,200
These are all the hottest fields now.

21
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,590
Where can we find so many teachers?

22
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,720
We invited the officials
from the Three Departments

23
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,950
and Six Ministries to teach.

24
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,390
- They're ready.
- Use both hands.

25
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,230
Use your wrist and arm strength.

26
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,280
Snail noodle.

27
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,480
Stinky tofu.

28
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,560
Fish mint.

29
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,150
In Anjin City,

30
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,510
there are many delicacies,

31
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,960
but some are still undiscovered.

32
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,080
What are you going to do?

33
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,590
These are the new products
from the culinary class.

34
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,550
I want you

35
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,470
to have a taste for them.

36
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,430
With the face in your hands,

37
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,520
it starts with intention.

38
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,000
Plan your moves

39
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,280
in every detail.

40
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,870
Knead and press the line
from the peak

41
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,600
of the brows to the tails
to let blood rise to the surface.

42
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,080
This is

43
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,240
the latest project
from the beauty class.

44
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,840
Don't move.

45
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,150
Relax.

46
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,710
Done.

47
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,000
Done.

48
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,710
Very handsome.

49
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,840
Unmatched in the world.

50
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,560
I'll have the beauty students
touch up for you later.

51
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:26,990
Let me tell you.

52
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,000
(Pet Health)
Raising pets is a popular trend now.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,750
Feeding pets can be cumbersome,

54
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,150
but it's an important process.

55
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,910
So, understanding
the precautions for feeding

56
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,870
can better care for our pets.

57
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,190
For example, we have
to pay attention to a balanced diet.

58
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,870
Choosing the right food

59
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,590
is the foundation to allow our pets
to grow up healthily.

60
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,470
So, we need to pay attention
to reasonable dietary combinations

61
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,000
and nutritional balance.

62
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:52,710
Raising pets requires learning too?

63
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,150
Of course.

64
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,080
The pet industry
is the hottest right now.

65
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,910
It seems quite impressive.

66
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,100
It's even more complicated
than raising me.

67
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:03,990
Xiaobai,

68
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,790
stop running!

69
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,640
Xiaobai,

70
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,360
I finally caught you.

71
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,470
You're the teaching assistant
in the pet class,

72
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,630
not an ordinary stray dog.

73
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,470
Do you know that?

74
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,160
Isn't that Miss Xu?

75
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,270
What are you doing?

76
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,360
Catching a dog.

77
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,480
Give me a hand.

78
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,480
I can't get out.

79
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,040
Good morning.

80
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,070
Miss, what's this?

81
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,920
Nine-Nine-Six.

82
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,270
You've been doing great

83
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,750
in running the school at the office,

84
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,480
so I asked my mother
for a reward for you.

85
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,720
I remember you said

86
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,630
that 996 was a lucky number.

87
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,510
May you have 996 every day.

88
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,130
You made this?

89
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,720
This was carefully prepared

90
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,950
for you by Mr. Yan.

91
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,190
You should

92
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,870
keep this blessing for yourself.

93
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,420
(Nine-Nine-Six)

94
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,630
Doesn't she like this blessing?

95
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,510
A professional tailor
must take measurements

96
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,390
to meet the requirements
of different figures.

97
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,850
Divide by four, multiply by three,
and draw arcs.

98
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,040
Helping older maids
with re-employment.

99
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,040
I'm truly a genius.

100
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,720
The school has an examination system.

101
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,850
We have weekly tests, monthly tests
and final exams.

102
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,370
The course design consists
of compulsory and elective courses

103
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,460
based on individual needs,

104
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,610
nurturing with discretion.

105
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,720
What do you think?

106
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,830
Isn't my complete

107
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,190
teaching design flawless?

108
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,070
It's such a complex course design.

109
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,000
How did you come up with it?

110
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:54,870
Just a piece of cake.

111
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,040
I'm the talented

112
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,750
and beautiful Xu Xinglan.

113
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,360
This is nothing.

114
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,120
We have classes in the school today.

115
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,000
Why did you ask me out?

116
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,310
Come here.

117
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,160
Close your eyes.

118
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,360
(Is he going to...)

119
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,270
I heard

120
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,800
that all women like this.

121
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,310
Thanks.

122
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,720
(Did I send the wrong gift again?)

123
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,420
(Arrangement Office)

124
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,920
Everyone's grades are quite good.

125
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,240
Yunxin.

126
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,830
Take a look.

127
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,950
These are perfect scores.

128
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,870
Everyone's grades are quite good.

129
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,100
I believe that given time,

130
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,590
the students of Hongxiang
will surely find great jobs.

131
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:22,430
Their relationship
is really becoming closer.

132
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,360
Mother, you called for me?

133
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,270
Yan.

134
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,430
What have you

135
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,040
been busy with lately?

136
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,240
Recently, I've been supervising

137
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,720
the school with Miss Xu.

138
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,360
The school has shown initial results.

139
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,040
Not bad.

140
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,040
And?

141
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,160
Miss Xu is very dedicated to the school.

142
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,120
And?

143
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,630
She gets along extremely well
with everyone.

144
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,950
Everyone holds her in high regard.

145
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,720
I know that Xinglan

146
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,720
is capable in her work.

147
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,720
But is that what I want to know?

148
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,720
I want to know

149
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,310
what have you two been doing
at the Arrangement Office.

150
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,270
Of course,

151
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:25,830
we've only been

152
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,030
focusing on work.

153
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,840
Is that all?

154
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,230
Alright.

155
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,350
You can go back now.

156
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,440
That's it?

157
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,080
That's it. Go back.

158
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,350
Madam,

159
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,200
how can they focus on work?

160
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,440
Clearly, their focus

161
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,840
isn't in the right place.

162
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,960
Can Mr. Yan

163
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,790
do this or not?

164
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,840
It seems

165
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,440
that my son

166
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,960
really isn't up to the task.

167
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,270
I must

168
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,000
step in personally.

169
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,000
(Arrangement Office)

170
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,910
It's getting late.

171
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,960
Let's call it a day.

172
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,790
Goodbye, Xinglan.

173
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,030
Miss Xu, go and rest early.

174
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,120
Miss, I'll head back now.

175
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:44,020
(Arrangement Office)

176
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,390
It's already so late.

177
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,710
Still staying up?

178
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,200
Let's go back too.

179
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,560
Okay.

180
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,000
There are still
two living people inside.

181
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,110
Madam.

182
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,520
Shh.

183
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,140
Shh.

184
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,320
Open the door.

185
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,200
How did this door get locked?

186
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,040
Well.

187
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,030
It's so late.

188
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,240
There shouldn't be
any locksmiths around.

189
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,790
No, no. We can't find one.

190
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,200
- Song Heng.
- Open the door.
