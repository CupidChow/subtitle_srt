00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,260
=Episode 17=

3
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,280
(Is this the room?)

4
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,960
(He told me to leave the message here
after the task was done.)

5
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,560
(Are there any other clues here?)

6
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,870
(What are all these strange things?)

7
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,150
You shouldn't be looking at this.

8
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,230
Sir, you're drunk.

9
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,070
Sweetheart.

10
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,310
(Amazing Night)
Come and drink.

11
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,150
Take it easy.

12
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,070
Sir.

13
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,760
Sweetheart.

14
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:36,680
Give me a hug.

15
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,840
- Why did you come in?
- Sir.

16
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,760
Why in such a rush?

17
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,920
- Right, I'm Chiyuan.
- You smell so good.

18
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,400
You're drunk.

19
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,680
The wine may not intoxicate,

20
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,150
but I'm still intoxicated.

21
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,190
Come on.

22
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,840
- Give me a kiss.
- Don't look.

23
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,150
- Sweetheart.
- Stop it.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,350
You're getting prettier.

25
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,310
Sir, you're so naughty.

26
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,200
Come on.

27
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,950
Give me another kiss.

28
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,480
Stop it, sir.

29
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,960
Come on.

30
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,870
- No.
- Darling.

31
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,310
- You smell too good.
- Stop it.

32
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,030
- I'll ask for you next time.
- Deal.

33
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,000
They should have left.

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,460
- They've left.
- I'll see you out.

35
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:36,060
(Three days later;
Bamboo forest west of the city)

36
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,870
Chiyuan, I've been waiting for you.

37
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,100
I've been looking for you too.

38
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,870
Looks like your mission is accomplished.

39
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,960
Of course.

40
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,960
Is the Chief Inspector dead?

41
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,360
I killed him myself.

42
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,870
Here's your payment.

43
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,360
(Stones?)

44
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,150
Die!

45
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,080
I arrived just in time, didn't I?

46
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,470
Is it him?

47
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,120
Oh, no.

48
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,210
There's no scar.

49
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,080
He's a fake.

50
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,130
Watch out.

51
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,360
Chiyuan.

52
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,870
I've finally found you.

53
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,000
He's the real Yun Ying.

54
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,200
Chiyuan.

55
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,680
How dare you betray me?

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,150
I've captured so many spies.

57
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,220
Now it's finally your turn,

58
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,960
the mastermind behind it all.

59
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,730
Enough talk.

60
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,800
Watch out behind you.

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,290
You're not playing by the rules.

62
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,210
Another attack?

63
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,520
Does it still hurt?

64
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,720
How did I do today?

65
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,390
You're the MVP.

66
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:04,710
Young Master,

67
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,950
Yun Ying's men have been

68
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,070
locked up in the prison,

69
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,360
awaiting your orders.

70
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,230
Young Master,

71
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,840
I hurt

72
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,680
my foot today too.

73
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,520
Nianxia.

74
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,230
- Someone's hurt their foot.
- No, no.

75
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,240
No need. No need.

76
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,270
No need.

77
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,880
Everything's changed.

78
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,070
Everything has changed.

79
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,520
Mr. Yan.

80
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,590
Miss.

81
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,120
Here's the nourishing soup from Madam.

82
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,800
Smells wonderful.

83
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,400
Get some rest early.

84
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,160
I'll come find you in the morning.

85
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,980
(Peace and Eternity)

86
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,830
Xinglan?

87
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,920
What are you doing?

88
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,190
Why are your hands so cold?

89
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,000
Don't talk.

90
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,920
I just came to ask you for something.

91
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,720
What is it?

92
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,310
From now on,

93
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,120
don't even think about running away.

94
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,850
Something's wrong with her.

95
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,630
Don't use too much fragrance.

96
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,110
It will clash

97
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,870
with strong tonics.

98
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,750
What did I do yesterday?

99
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,270
Oh, no, this is so embarrassing.

100
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,860
What did I do?

101
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,960
Xinglan.

102
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:23,990
Yunxin.

103
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,440
Why are you here?

104
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,490
It's because of that Zhenzhen.

105
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,920
Zhenzhen?

106
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,370
I would've forgotten all about her
if not for you.

107
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,350
What's going on?

108
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,000
Recently, she's been

109
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,270
coming to Mr. Jun's courtyard every day,

110
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,320
saying good morning and good night.

111
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:41,750
Three meals a day.

112
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,080
She's never late.

113
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,970
She won't leave once she's by the table.

114
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,360
Last night,

115
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,870
she even said in front of Mr. Jun

116
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,200
that she'd take me
as her personal maid

117
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,390
and make me a concubine.

118
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,390
There, there.

119
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,840
I was wondering

120
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,100
why she hasn't been
looking for Yuwen Yan lately.

121
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,840
I thought she had come to her senses.

122
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,960
Turns out she's been at Mr. Jun's place.

123
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,510
She's changed her target

124
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,350
so quickly.

125
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,120
Even clingier than a vine demon.

126
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,990
Let's go.

127
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,240
Let's go see her

128
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,550
