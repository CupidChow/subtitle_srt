(Arrangement Office)

4
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,840
I haven't been this happy
in a long time.

5
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,520
The children have all gathered here.

6
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,120
Qi,

7
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,070
how is your injury?

8
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,520
Thanks for your concern, Father.

9
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,920
It's all external injuries.

10
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,710
These villains are truly despicable.

11
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,600
Jun, Yan,

12
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:00,190
you must investigate this thoroughly.

13
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,040
- Yes.
- Yes.

14
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,360
Alright.

15
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,070
Glad you're safe.

16
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,590
Today is a rare occasion
for everyone to gather.

17
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,070
Let's raise our glasses and drink.

18
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,120
Everyone, dig in.

19
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,350
Let me serve the drink for Madam.

20
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:42,000
This time Qi had a narrow escape.

21
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,000
Let's have another drink.

22
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,120
Come on.

23
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,550
Jun.

24
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,550
Jun!

25
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,430
Mr. Jun.

26
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,400
Jun.

27
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,120
Mrs. Jun.

28
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,150
Mr. Qi.

29
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,150
Madam.

30
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,750
- Madam.
- Father, Mother.

31
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,560
Madam, how are you?

32
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,910
- City Lord.
- Wake up.

33
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,150
Madam. Madam.

34
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,990
Princess.

35
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,310
Xinglan.

36
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,470
What happened?

37
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,750
What's wrong, Madam?

38
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:23,990
Xinglan.

39
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,590
Jun...

40
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,990
He's not breathing.

41
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,360
Mr. Jun?

42
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,030
What about the others?

43
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,910
Everyone else is fine,

44
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,750
but...

45
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,710
Mr. Jun...

46
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,570
What's wrong with him?

47
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,360
My Lord.

48
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,100
Everyone's wine was poisoned,

49
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,150
but the poison in Mr. Jun's cup
was the strongest.

50
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,710
I'm sorry for your loss.

51
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,870
My loss?

52
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,870
Suppress the news.

53
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,520
Find out who the poisoner is.

54
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,710
Yes.

55
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,270
Leave.

56
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,810
Get out!

57
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,430
My Jun.

58
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,800
Jun.

59
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,430
(Xinglan.)

60
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,560
(There's something I must do.)

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,480
(This time it's too dangerous.)

62
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,920
(I don't want you to get involved.)

63
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,420
(Funeral)

64
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,880
Madam.

65
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:59,260
(Spirit Tablet
of the Late Husband Yuwen Jun)

66
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,600
Mrs. Jun,

67
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,030
it's been seven days
since Mr. Jun passed away.

68
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,720
According to the mansion's rules,

69
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,270
he should be buried as soon as possible.

70
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,120
Everyone, leave.

71
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,750
Madam, bear your grief.

72
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,630
Mr. Jun has been deceased
for seven days.

73
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,160
According to the mansion's rules,

74
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,800
(Spirit Tablet)
let them take the coffin

75
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,160
and bury him in peace.

76
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,510
- Madam.
- Leave.

77
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,240
Anyone who dares to take him away

78
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,310
will have to step over my dead body.

79
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,680
We are just...

80
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,390
I told you to leave. Did you hear me?

81
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,110
Yes.

82
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,680
Close the gates.

83
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,120
I won't allow anyone to disturb him.

84
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,670
Yes.

85
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,620
(Spirit Tablet
of the Late Husband Yuwen Jun)

86
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,700
(Arrangement Office)

87
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:16,950
Have you heard?

88
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,270
It turns out Mr. Jun

89
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,040
is our city's Chief Inspector.

90
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,600
Mr. Jun's death is suspicious.

91
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,860
I heard

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,310
the murderer is Mr. Yan.

93
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,270
He's been planning
to be the future City Lord.

94
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,270
You can't say that.

95
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,050
Everyone's talking about it in the city.

96
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,360
Hasn't the City Lord ordered
to suppress the news?

97
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,800
News always gets out.

98
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,270
- Let's go.
- Go.

99
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,080
Come on.

100
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,880
What's going on?

101
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,910
Do you know?

102
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,870
It turns out Mr. Jun

103
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:48,920
was killed by Mr. Yan.

104
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,230
No way.

105
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,120
How could that be?

106
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,960
I heard it.

107
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,390
Mr. Jun is the firstborn.

108
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,430
He was supposed to be
the City Lord's heir.

109
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,750
But Mr. Yan thinks

110
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,960
he's more suitable

111
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,540
than Mr. Jun for that position.

112
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,390
Miss Xu is also a foreign assassin.

113
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,920
Mr. Yan has been hiding her here.

114
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,160
The two conspired to seize
the position of City Lord.

115
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,870
No wonder everyone says Miss Xu
has an unclear background.

116
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,600
Miss Shen.

117
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,000
Have you finished your work?

118
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,160
Miss Xu is still unconscious
from the poison.

119
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,870
Everyone must remain calm

120
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,240
and not gossip recklessly.

121
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,160
Fortunately,
I was the only one who heard it.

122
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,390
If it were someone else,

123
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,170
how many heads
would be enough to chop off?

124
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,190
Miss Shen, thanks for the reminder.

125
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,310
We will remember it.

126
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,270
Let me tell you.

127
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,040
This is outrageous.

128
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,870
Say that again.

129
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,870
This is called Fairy Flower.

130
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,750
It was found in Mr. Jun's room.

131
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,440
If kept in the room for fifteen days,

132
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:49,560
it'd be poisonous.

133
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,010
If this flower is ground into powder
and mixed into wine,

134
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,250
it will lead to immediate death.

135
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,700
The physician has confirmed

136
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,420
that the poison that killed Mr. Jun
came from this.

137
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,990
This flower?

138
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:06,300
It was a gift from Mr. Yan to Mr. Jun.

139
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,270
All the servants in Junling Pavilion
can prove it.

140
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,230
That's impossible.

141
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,160
They've always been
on good terms.

142
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,240
There must be something fishy
about these rumors.

143
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,340
Please investigate it, My Lord.

144
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,310
But, Madam,

145
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,800
the evidence is all here.

146
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:19,940
Nonsense.

147
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,670
Report.

148
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,240
My Lord, Mr. Yan is missing.

149
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,520
What?

150
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,990
Yanyu Pavilion's servants said

151
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,830
Mr. Yan went out
with his guard last night

152
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,740
and hasn't returned.

153
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,350
My Lord,

154
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,460
I'm afraid Mr. Yan
has fled out of guilt.

155
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,450
There are also discussions
in the mansion

156
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,440
saying that Miss Xu

157
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,150
is the No. 1 assassin Chiyuan.

158
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,110
Surely,

159
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,390
she's behind this.

160
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,800
Enough, enough.

161
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,000
Confine Xu Xinglan to Yanyu Pavilion.

162
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,040
I will investigate

163
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,670
her identity on my own.

164
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,470
No one is allowed to visit her,

165
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,320
except for meals.

166
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,650
Yes.

167
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,300
(Yanyu Pavilion)

168
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,910
I'll kill Yuwen Yan.

169
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,550
I will kill all of you.

170
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:18,870
Chiyuan!

171
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,270
I'll wake up eventually.

172
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,870
I will kill all of you.

173
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,960
Yuwen Yan?

174
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,000
Miss.

175
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,120
- Nianxia.
- Miss.

176
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,040
Nianxia.

177
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,750
(Why is the door locked?)

178
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,480
Miss, you've been asleep
for a long time.

179
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,770
So much has happened
in the past few days.

180
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,360
Mr. Jun is dead.

181
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,980
Mr. Yan is missing.

182
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,720
Mr. Jun is dead?

183
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,910
Yuwen Yan is missing?

184
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,080
Now everyone is saying

185
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,320
that Mr. Yan killed Mr. Jun.

186
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,840
Yuwen Yan?

187
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,480
(How could Yuwen Yan kill Mr. Jun?)

188
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,240
(There must be some misunderstanding.)
