00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,260
=Ancient Workplace, Love Handbook=

2
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,300
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,850
You're going
to the Arrangement Office tomorrow,

4
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,030
and you'll be busy.

5
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,920
Yeah, with some free time today,

6
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,070
we can buy ingredients
and take a stroll.

7
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,280
Sir, I want this.

8
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,120
Sure.

9
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,640
(It's suspicious to go out the day)

10
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,320
(before becoming an official.)

11
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,320
That's three taels.

12
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,430
So expensive.

13
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,000
Is this extortion?

14
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,920
How can you say that?

15
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,230
No money? Don't cause trouble then.

16
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,120
Go, go, go.

17
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,120
Miss, this is too pricey.

18
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,510
Let's not buy this.

19
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,870
(If only I had money.)

20
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,350
This is a deposit.

21
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,450
If you can find the person
we're looking for,

22
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,310
the price is no issue.

23
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,870
Nianxia, you go buy the ingredients.

24
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,230
I'll head somewhere else.

25
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,510
Alright, be careful by yourself.

26
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,950
(Is she going to deliver a message?)

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,840
Young Master,

28
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,950
you can openly follow her if you want.

29
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:51,630
Follow her.

30
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,120
(Since I can't return right away,)

31
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,310
(I have to find the money
from the memory)

32
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,510
(to live here.)

33
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,340
(Zuixin House)
(I found it.)

34
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,640
(The place from my memory.)

35
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,020
(Zuixin House)

36
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,990
Today,

37
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,870
I must find that bag of money.

38
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,100
Waiter, bring me a pot of tea.

39
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,590
Coming right up.

40
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,590
Hello, sir.

41
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,430
Where's that girl who just came in?

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,590
She's in the private room upstairs.

43
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,120
I knew it was you.

44
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,120
Mother?

45
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,430
What are you doing here?

46
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,960
He cheated me out of my money

47
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,310
and went off with another woman
behind my back.

48
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,870
That heartless man.

49
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,710
Don't worry.

50
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,240
I will write him dead

51
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,080
in the story.

52
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,150
For inspiration?

53
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,580
Yeah.

54
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,960
The previous stories

55
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,030
aren't enough
for the experience house.

56
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,430
That's why I thought

57
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,360
to come here for some inspiration.

58
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,310
Why are you with my mother?

59
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,640
Madam.

60
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,120
Xinglan.

61
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,030
How come it's you?

62
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,400
(Why do I keep running
into acquaintances?)

63
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,190
(He's already wary of me.)

64
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,540
(If I tell him the truth,
it'll only complicate things.)

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,430
If people find out

66
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,150
Madam is getting inspirations here,

67
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,960
it will cause unnecessary trouble.

68
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:29,990
I naturally

69
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,560
came to protect the madam.

70
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,680
I see.

71
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,750
Xinglan,

72
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,030
so, everything you do is for me.

73
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,630
You know my mother is a noble.

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,430
If she encounters danger,

75
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,030
how many heads
do you have to spare?

76
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,470
Everything I do is wrong.

77
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,840
I've had enough
of this wretched place.

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,080
Come on, kill me.

79
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,360
What attitude is that?

80
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,910
A let-it-go attitude.

81
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,560
(What's up with those two?)

82
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,590
(They're arguing.)

83
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,310
Alright, it's getting late.

84
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,470
Let's head back together.

85
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,520
Let's arrange to meet again.

86
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,840
I want to hear your whole story

87
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,680
and write it down.

88
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,400
Let's go, Xinglan.

89
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,960
Let's go.

90
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,830
(In the end, I didn't find that wallet.)

91
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,240
(It's all this blockhead's fault.)

92
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,360
(Seems I have to first do my job well
in the Arrangement Office)

93
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,390
(to regain the initiative)

94
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,440
(and come back to search.)

95
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,540
(Arrangement Office)

96
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,320
(Today, I won't let you arrive on time
at the Arrangement Office.)

97
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,630
(I want to see you mess everything up.)

98
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,560
(You won't be able to win over anyone)

99
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:55,920
(so that Mother
will see your true colors.)

100
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,520
(Song Heng.)

101
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,070
(Do everything possible)

102
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,830
(to stop her from reaching the office.)

103
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,160
(Young Master, what do you mean?)

104
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,370
(I've thought it through.)

105
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,000
(She's very likely to use this chance)

106
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,240
(to uncover secrets here.)

107
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,160
(We cannot let her succeed.)

108
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,880
Young Master,

109
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:15,360
I sent Miss Xu a bowl
of drugged tranquilizing soup.

110
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,950
She'll get up late tomorrow.

111
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,350
Who's there?

112
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,560
It's me, Song Heng.

113
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,800
Miss Xu,
knowing it's your first day tomorrow.

114
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,000
Mr. Yan specially made
the ginseng soup for you.

115
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,150
Try it.

116
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,560
It smells great.

117
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,120
Please thank him for me.

118
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,000
What if she doesn't drink it?

119
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,270
Delivering soup at midnight.

120
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,820
How can he be so kind?

121
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,850
What if it doesn't work?

122
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,390
I have another trick up my sleeve.

123
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,480
Tomorrow morning,

124
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,950
I'll completely seal her door.

125
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,750
Guard Song, what are you doing?

126
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm

127
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,270
helping you fix the door frame.

128
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,430
Miss Xu, where did you come out from?

129
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,390
From the window.

130
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,270
Take your time.

131
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,230
I'll be leaving now.

132
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,830
What if that still doesn't work?

133
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,040
I have another plan.

134
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,200
Miss Xu,

135
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,040
the Arrangement Office
is after this garden.

136
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,510
Mr. Yan is waiting for you there.

137
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,120
What's that sound?

138
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,600
Bees! Run!

139
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,600
Run!

140
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,120
This is terrible!

141
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,040
Is there any backup plan?

142
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,190
If none of this works,

143
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,750
I'll have to use my ultimate move.

144
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,270
Alright, let's do it that way.

145
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,560
Miss Xu, you hurt me.

146
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,800
I swear.

147
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,630
I didn't even touch your finger.

148
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,950
Miss Xu, you can't just leave me here.

149
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,510
I'm in pain

150
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,270
from head to toe.

151
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,720
Could you help me find a physician?

152
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,190
(Looks like Song Heng succeeded.)

153
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,680
Miss Xu, you can't leave.

154
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,160
Well, wait for me here.

155
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,040
Once I report in,

156
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,530
I'll come back to get
a physician.

157
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:44,290
Miss Xu, you can't go.

158
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,000
Miss Xu, you can't just leave me here.

159
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,040
What's wrong?

160
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,120
Just in time.

161
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,510
You take him to see a physician.

162
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,480
I have to rush
to the Arrangement Office.

163
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,680
Don't worry, Miss.

164
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,660
I'll take care of this.

165
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,560
Guard Song,

166
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,070
don't worry.

167
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,160
I'll get you to the physician
right away.

168
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,830
You're late.

169
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,190
Don't you know

170
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,190
why I'm late?

171
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,750
You know in your heart.

172
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,680
I only care about the result.

173
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,840
So I...

174
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,390
Mr. Yan, I'm late.

175
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,720
(Wai Yingying, an official)

176
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,670
Who is this?

177
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,480
She is the supervisor
sent by the master,

178
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,720
but she hasn't passed the assessment,

179
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,440
so she can't interfere in any matters
at the Arrangement Office.

180
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,670
Why?

181
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,360
She arrived later than me.

182
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,770
- Why?
- No need to say more.

183
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,000
- With me here,
- Yuwen Yan.

184
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,750
Mr. Yan can rest assured.

185
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,630
Goodbye, Mr. Yan.

186
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,440
(Indeed.)

187
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,510
(The bosses in this world
are annoyingly double-standard.)

188
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,820
(Arrangement Office)

189
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,270
Zhong Yunxin.

190
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,390
Do you have eyes?

191
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,440
I'm sorry, sorry.

192
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,870
(Zhong Yunxin, a maid)
What's the use of saying sorry?

193
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,440
My sister bought these shoes

194
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,550
less than two hours ago

195
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,510
and you've dirtied them.

196
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,060
What are you going to do?

197
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,870
How about

198
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,360
I pay you back?

199
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,120
Pay?

200
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,440
You're a lowly maid.

201
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,960
How much is your monthly wage?

202
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,240
Can you afford it?

203
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,390
My monthly wage is fifty wen.

204
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,390
This pair of shoes is a replica
of Wenxiuge's

205
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,510
new model,

206
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,550
priced at about eight wen.

207
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,670
My monthly wage

208
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,960
can buy you 6.5 pairs.

209
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,510
What did you say?

210
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,630
Do you believe I'll hit you? You...

211
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,480
Who dares to splash me?

212
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,790
Greetings, Miss Xu.

213
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:03,750
Why stand there?

214
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,750
Got no work to do?

215
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,850
Do you want another bucket?

216
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,870
No, no. I'll take my leave.

217
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,920
I'll take my leave.

218
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,800
Are you okay?

219
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,150
Thank you, Miss Xu.

220
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,120
Why are you the only one
working here at the office?

221
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,870
It's always like this.

222
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,600
In the past two years,

223
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,000
the servants in our mansion

224
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,910
have become increasingly lax,

225
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,360
yet their salary hasn't been cut at all.

226
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,480
It's almost become unsustainable.

227
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,840
(Not just lax.)

228
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,510
(Everyone here is living off)

229
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,510
(the labor of others.)

230
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,270
(To get to the bottom of this,)

231
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,910
(I need to start
with the account books.)

232
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,200
You're Zhong Yunxin?

233
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,270
How long have you worked here?

234
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,240
It's been a while.

235
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,750
Do you know
where the account books are?

236
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,510
They are usually kept with Miss Wei,

237
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,150
but after Mr. Yan took office,

238
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,790
he took the account books away.

239
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,320
It's him again.
