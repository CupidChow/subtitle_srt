Xinglan.

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,360
Xinglan?

00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:54,890
Mr. Yan.

7
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,920
Where's Xinglan?

8
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,450
She was just here.

18
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,060
(Why did you have to disappear
at this moment?)

19
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,980

Mr. Yan. Miss Xu...

22
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,260
Where do you think

23
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,980
she could have gone?

24
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:49,130
I don't know.

25
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,180
It's all my fault.

26
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,500
I didn't keep her safe.

27
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,290
I thought her illness had healed.

28
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,890
I was careless and lost track of her.

29
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,360
Young Master,

30
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,470
the diary.

31
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:07,770
What diary?

32
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,020
A few days ago,

33
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,980
she'd been forgetting things easily,

34
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,780
so she started writing a diary

35
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,860
to help her remember
what she would forget.

36
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,860
Where's the diary?

37
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,260
It's in the drawer of her room.

38
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,380

The date

41
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:35,980
is unknown.

42
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,100
This is my first day in this world.

43
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,940
I met that wooden-faced guy.

44
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,580
He thought I was an assassin.

45
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,020
He should see a physician
about his eyesight.

46
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,340
I didn't expect there to be so many
older maids at the office.

47
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,540
That wooden-faced guy
is helping me run a school.

48
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,500
I feel a bit grateful.

49
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,620
He confessed to me today.

50
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,460
Turns out he likes me.

51
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,180
Perfect, I like him too.

52
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,820
Then I'll stay here and be his wife.

53
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,940
With him,

54
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,460
anywhere feels like home.

55
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,620
Today,

56
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,340
I dreamed of Chiyuan.

57
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,860
(Happy)

58
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,900
She said I occupied her body.

59
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,380
(Arrangement Office)
My sleeping time will get longer.

60
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,220
Chiyuan will eventually awaken.

61
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,660
Everyone in the mansion

62
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,940
will face slaughter.

63
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,140
I know

64
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,580
I can't change Chiyuan's consciousness,

65
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,500
but I can perish with her.

66
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,980
I just can't let go of Yuwen Yan.

67
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,020
I want to stay by his side
a little longer.

68
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,700
I need a bit more time.

69
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,660
But my body tells me

70
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,140
today

71
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,500
is the final deadline.

72
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,740
Yuwen Yan,

73
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,780
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,060
I have to disappear on this day.

75
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,460
