What's wrong with you two?

00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,440
Nothing.

00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,440
What could happen
between me and Yuwen Yan?

00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,180
See?

00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,510
I haven't even said who it is,

8
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:57,510
and you already know.

00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:01,960
I...

10
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,280
I just haven't figured out

11
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,280
a lot of things yet.

12
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,920
I don't know
what you're worried about,

13
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,920
but I think

14
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,190
it's a very happy thing
for two people in love

15
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,280
to be together.

16
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:29,800
I can't do that,

17
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:31,390
but you

18
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,630
need to face your true feelings.

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,740

I'll take you to find him.

Mr. Jun.

55
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,010
Come out.

56
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,030
Mr. Jun.

00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,490
We're discussing important matters.

60
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,070
Wait a moment.

61
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,150
Yunxin has something to clarify
with Mr. Jun.

62
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,230
Step aside.

63
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,030
Mr. Jun, when you were not around,

64
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,840
I've been thinking.

65
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,110
Since I was young, aside from my father,

66
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,510
only you have cared for me

67
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,030
meticulously.

68
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,190
But I'm the humble daughter

69
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,550
of a traitor.

70
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,030
If you're determined to ignore me,

71
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,400
I will

72
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,000
have no complaints.

73
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,550
Yunxin.

74
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:33,500
Yunxin.

75
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,510
Jun.

76
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,350
Yunxin.

77
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,700
Yunxin.

78
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,100
I left without saying goodbye,

79
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,000
but it wasn't
because I wanted to avoid you.

80
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,780
I just went to Mengyun City.

81
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,860
Why did you go there?

82
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,700
I found these in Mengyun City.

83
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,260
Did you go to investigate these?

84
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,500
Jun has always wanted
to clear your family's name

85
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,340
and free you from being
the daughter of a traitor.

86
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,340
How did you know I needed this info?

87
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,740
I shouldn't have known,

88
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,300
but...

89
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,700
The Plum Blossom...

90
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,140
Is this true?

91
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,520
Before Mr. Zhong died,

92
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,700
he suspected that Plum Blossom
was related

93
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,260
to the spies of the enemy state.

94
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,540
But the Zhongs

95
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,180
were branded as traitors

96
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,900
before the memorial requesting

97
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,380
a thorough investigation
reached Father's hands.

98
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,380
Yan.

99
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,780
They didn't find this

100
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,100
when Father ordered them to investigate.

101
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,550
- Where did you get it?
- It's a long story.

102
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,460
Following this lead

103
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,460
to clear the Zhongs' name
is the top priority.

104
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,020
So,

105
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,340
you went to Mengyun City alone
to investigate?

106
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:31,940
Miss Zhong,

107
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,820
my brother's feelings for you

108
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,340
have never changed.

109
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,620
So,

110
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,700
you knew everything

111
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,940
yet you hid it from us?

112
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,220
I asked him not to tell you.

113
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,180
Before it was done,

114
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,400
I wasn't sure I could find it.

115
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,870
This is the flawless plan

116
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,820
of your so-called fool.

117
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,540
With these,

118
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,940
your family's name can be cleared.

119
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,340
We can also

120
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,580
be together openly and honestly.

121
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,700
(Why does it feel like)

122
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,140
(he has been reaching out
to me less recently?)

123
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,100
(Should I clarify
the misunderstanding with him?)

124
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,300
(But will he believe it?)

125
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,260
What a coincidence.

126
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,460
Mr. Yan, you also like
feeding fish at night?

127
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,070
- That day...
- That day...

128
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,220
What do you want to say?

129
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,620
Nothing.

130
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,860
I just want to say

131
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,740
Mr. Jun is quite devoted.

132
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,940
Actually, I...

133
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,900
You also did a good deed.

134
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,900
You're like a matchmaker for them.

135
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,820
So are you.

136
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,820
Of course.

137
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,940
I've been worrying a lot

138
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,980
about their relationship.

139
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,860
Their relationship

140
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,380
was tightened by me with wire.

141
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,140
That day, I...

142
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,300
I didn't mean to dodge.

143
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,300
Dodge from what?

144
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,000
The kiss...

145
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,060
So, you were thinking about that.

146
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,420
Who said I was thinking about it?

147
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,500
I wasn't.

148
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,020
I didn't say what it was.

149
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:32,860
You...

150
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,700
(Xu Xinglan.)

151
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,460
(What are you looking forward to?)

152
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,100
(Arrangement Office)

153
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,940
No wonder it's said

154
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,900
that love is a woman's best skincare.

155
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,940
You just moved
to Mr. Jun's house a few days ago,

156
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,460
and your complexion

157
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,180
is so rosy.

158
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,860
What nonsense are you saying?

159
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,820
Why aren't you

160
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,860
being lovey-dovey

161
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,700
with Mr. Jun today?

162
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,180
What brings you to the office?

163
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,420
My holiday is over.

164
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,780
Today I'm on duty.

165
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,980
After a busy day,

166
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,140
I'm so hungry.

167
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,220
(About you and Miss Xu,)

168
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,820
(we can only help you this far.)

169
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,500
(What if it gets messed up?)

170
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,380
(Dining together
is just the first step.)

171
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,740
(Sincerity)

172
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,220
(is always the trump card.)

173
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,540
Yunxin, let me pour you some wine.

174
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:11,860
Yunxin doesn't drink.

175
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,780
Let me.

176
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,740
So strong.

177
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,820
Xinglan doesn't drink.

178
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:26,980
Let me.

179
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:27,860
I'll drink first.

180
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,980
Everyone, feel free.

181
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,220
Yunxin,

182
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,360
this is the fish you love.

183
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,540
Sure.

184
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,340
Xinglan,

185
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,250
eat fish.

186
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,540
Shrimp?

187
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,620
Scallops?

188
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,980
I don't like seafood.

189
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,460
Can't you have something else?

190
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:08,900
Have some soup.

191
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,740
Okay.

192
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,420
Xinglan, have some soup.

193
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,260
I came here to drink.

194
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,340
Tonight, let's get drunk.

195
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,540
Right, let's get drunk.

196
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,980
Can you really drink?

197
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:32,940
Xinglan,

198
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,620
you shouldn't ask that.

199
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:43,860
Mr. Jun,

200
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,180
if you dare to let Yunxin down,

201
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,180
I won't spare you.

202
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,820
You can rest assured.

203
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,620
In this lifetime, I only have Yunxin,

204
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,180
and I will only treat her well.

205
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,020
Good.

206
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,060
Let's toast to that.

207
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,180
Come on.

208
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,300
I didn't expect them
to get drunk so easily.

209
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,780
Should we drink a bit more?

210
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,860
You still want to drink?

211
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,920
Alright.

212
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,420
Are you happy today?

213
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,860
Yunxin is happy.

214
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,000
Of course, I'm happy for her.

215
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,060
What about you?

216
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:30,940
Me?

217
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,340
What do you want?

218
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,580
What do you want?

219
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,060
Yuwen Yan,

220
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,780
you are my only...

221
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,820
The only

222
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,380
boy

223
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,140
that I have

224
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,500
actively kissed.

225
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,300
The only one?

226
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,860
Don't be ungrateful.

227
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,460
Yunxin told me

228
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,020
to cherish the person in front of me.

229
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:09,420
Do you have someone
you want to cherish forever?

230
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,700
You're drunk.

231
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,540
Let me take you back.

232
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,820
