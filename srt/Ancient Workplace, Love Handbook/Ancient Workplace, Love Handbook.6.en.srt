=Ancient Workplace, Love Handbook=

2
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,260
=Episode 6=

3
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,550
(To get the most authentic info,)

4
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,390
(I must cleverly hide myself)

5
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,430
(and infiltrate the office's
internal info network.)

6
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:53,470
This is terrifying.

7
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,030
Have you all heard?

8
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,920
Miss Xu plans to dismiss over 30 maids.

9
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,470
- Really?
- Yes.

10
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,390
Though it's our job,

11
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,030
we've been slacking off for so long.

12
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,200
Suddenly, we have to work.

13
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,920
It's a bit hard to adapt.

14
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,560
Here she comes.

15
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,040
Be proactive in front of her.

16
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,280
Stop talking, stop talking.

17
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,480
Come here, come here.

18
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,680
What an ugly thing.

19
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,270
Am I ugly?

20
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,230
- Let me see.
- So awkward.

21
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,070
Let me see.

22
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,280
Let me see.

23
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,000
I didn't expect Mr. Yan
to have such preferences.

24
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,150
The fundamental issues at the office
haven't been resolved.

25
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,350
According to Madam,

26
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,640
you need to help me out.

27
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,040
Now, look at this.

28
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,120
What is this?

29
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,400
The Eighteen Regulations
of the Arrangement Office.

30
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,590
Article 1.

31
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,180
Regulations of the Arrangement Office.

32
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,560
First, streamline the office.

33
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,620
No redundant personnel.

34
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,590
Pay the salary on time

35
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,730
with rewards for more work.

36
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,800
Good morning, Mr. Yan.

37
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,940
Second, set a lunch break.

38
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,860
The lunch break is two hours

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,680
when activities can be arranged freely.

40
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,150
I won. Stick it on yourself.

41
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,270
One more time.

42
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,910
Third, establish a shift change system.

43
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,000
Seven days make a week.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,280
Work four days and rest three,

45
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,170
with paid leave.

46
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,620
No overtime unless necessary.

47
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,590
Just these few articles

48
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,310
will rejuvenate the Arrangement Office.

49
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,430
What do you think?

50
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,710
Shall we cooperate?

51
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,710
(She knows how
to manage internal affairs.)

52
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,660
(For the Arrangement Office,)

53
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,360
(I'll cooperate with her.)

54
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,030
I've bought the herbs you asked for.

55
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,710
Every maid can receive them for free.

56
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,420
(Regulations of the Arrangement Office)

57
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,380
(Yanyu Pavilion)

58
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,870
There's a regular meeting tonight.

59
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,240
Everyone, don't forget.

60
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,870
Since implementing the new regulations,

61
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,030
the office has been
streamlined by 11 positions,

62
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,240
30 posts have been merged,

63
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,080
and 30 lazy maids have been dismissed,

64
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,000
saving us 1,300 taels monthly.

65
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,030
Our employees' sense of happiness

66
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,400
has increased by 98 percent.

67
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,630
With you at the office,

68
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,470
I feel reassured.

69
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,910
Mr. Yan,

70
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,190
today is your day off.

71
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,520
Miss Xu said
you didn't have to come here.

72
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,910
The office has indeed been revitalized.

73
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,840
There are even people reporting.

74
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,750
Miss Xu,

75
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,800
Mr. Yan has always been looking for you.

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,680
There are rumors in the mansion.

77
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,030
Are you two...?

78
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,360
What? I'm telling you.

79
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,590
That wood-faced guy
has nothing nice to say.

80
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,840
He targets me everywhere

81
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,720
and reports me.

82
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,920
I'm stuck here.

83
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,160
Everything I do is right.

84
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,120
- Stop it.
- Really.

85
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,870
Why can't I say it?

86
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,120
Bring him in front of me.

87
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,920
I can scold him for a day
without repeating.

88
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,360
You can say it to his face now.

89
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,760
Do you have something to say to me?

90
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,120
Mr. Yan, please.

91
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,120
Yunxin.

92
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,960
You're too...

93
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,830
Straightforward.

94
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,840
Good.

95
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,040
Thanks for the compliment.

96
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,360
You're welcome.

97
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,240
A clear and upright atmosphere.

98
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,800
A harmonious workplace.

99
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,510
What's going on?

100
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,700
- Miss Shen!
- Miss Shen!

101
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,270
Miss Shen fainted while working.

102
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,630
Are you sick?

103
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,130
Do you need a physician?

104
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,080
I'm fine.

105
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,790
I just got my period.

106
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,960
Don't worry.

107
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,360
At the Arrangement Office,

108
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,360
everyone gets one day off
per month for this.

109
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,630
Anyone who isn't feeling well
can take a break.

110
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,920
No.

111
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,720
If we give them so many days off,

112
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,160
what about the work?

113
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,480
Stop arguing.

114
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,040
I'm fine.

115
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,450
Nianxia.

116
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,390
Since you like to work so much,

117
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,800
you can do all the work.

118
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,310
That won't do.

119
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,360
I'll be exhausted.

120
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,040
You need a break,

121
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,310
but they don't?

122
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,270
Miss Xu.

123
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,270
Miss Wei.

124
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,880
Nanny.

125
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,870
Does Madam have any instructions?

126
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,510
Last time,
Miss Xu mentioned team building.

127
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,920
It sounded interesting.

128
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,240
Madam wants
to hold the event tomorrow.

129
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,310
We finally get a day off.

130
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,120
I also have things to do.

131
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,560
Let's set aside our personal matters
for now.

132
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,270
Since the madam has spoken,

133
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,800
- we should...
- No.

134
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,570
It's team building.

135
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,310
Why not choose a duty day?

136
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:35,770
Well...

137
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,830
Xu Xinglan,

138
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,870
how dare you disobey Madam's orders?

139
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,870
No one's order can decide on this.

140
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,600
Team building should not
be on a day off.

141
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,860
(Monthly Team Building
of the Arrangement Office)

142
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,560
Xinglan is indeed thoughtful.

143
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,240
It's thanks to your wise decision

144
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,630
that we can come out
for team building while on duty.

145
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,680
The first monthly team building
of the Arrangement Office

146
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,920
is starting now.

147
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,040
Good.

148
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,790
Good. Good.

149
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,720
Today's game is tug-of-war,

150
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,190
with the madam as the judge.

151
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,510
Within an hour,

152
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,830
best two out of three rounds.

153
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,510
Winners will receive
a generous reward.

154
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,470
Start!

155
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,270
In the first round,

156
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,630
(I)
Miss Xu won.

157
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,830
The second round begins.

158
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,230
Come on.

159
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,030
Go, go.

160
00:07:59,070 --> 00:07:59,910
Come on.

161
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,920
- Harder.
- Come on.

162
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,270
In the second round,

163
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,960
(I)
Miss Wei won.

164
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,400
Yunxin.

165
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,070
Yunxin, are you okay?

166
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,540
I think something's wrong.

167
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,870
I'm so sorry.

168
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,710
It's all my fault.

169
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,240
I've dragged everyone down.

170
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,000
It's fine; you go rest first.

171
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,120
Leave this to us.

172
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,100
With one less person,

173
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,100
let's see how you all win.

174
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:35,660
Wei Yingying,

175
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,080
don't gloat now.

176
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,060
The third round.

177
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:12,690
Come on.

178
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,790
- For our first event,
- Amazing.

179
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,550
Miss Xu's team won.

180
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,320
We won.

181
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,480
Awesome!

182
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,360
Great, great!

183
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,200
We won.

184
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,360
(Since she arrived,)

185
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
(the mansion has become more lively.)

186
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,110
(That's fine.)

187
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,120
(II)(As long as Mother is happy.)

188
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,080
Why are you so happy every day?

189
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,870
Of course.

190
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,960
There's no unscrupulous boss
cutting our wages now.

191
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,000
No more 996 working hours.

192
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,960
Eight hours of work each day.

193
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,620
Which worker wouldn't be happy?

194
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,840
996?

195
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,000
What's that?

196
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,970
A lucky number.

197
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,200
You don't need to know.

198
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,910
A lucky number?

199
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,550
By the way,

200
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,440
we all won the match.

201
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,630
Everyone else gets rewards.

202
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,710
What about mine?

203
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,990
What do you want?

204
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,480
Well.

205
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,960
I want...

206
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,360
From the previous fragments
of memory,

207
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,320
I can tell the ancient Xu Xinglan

208
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,980
is an assassin.

209
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,510
Playing dumb?

210
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,080
Don't try any tricks with me.

211
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,510
Report to the office

212
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,350
at 7 am tomorrow.

213
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,840
If you're late,

214
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,280
don't bother to come at all.

215
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,440
Who's your superior?

216
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,080
No wonder he is

217
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,360
always on guard against me.

218
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,460
(Serenity and Fragrance)

219
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,390
(What just popped)

220
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:17,570
(into my mind?)

221
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,360
Whatever happened, I'm sorry.

222
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,840
Sir, please don't hit me.

223
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,510
Listen, I'm no longer
the person you used to know.

224
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,320
I've had enough
of this wretched place.

225
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,510
Come on, kill me.

226
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,840
(It doesn't seem like nonsense.)

227
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,960
(Are these bizarre images
trying to tell me)

228
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,630
(that she really isn't Chiyuan?)

229
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,470
Song Heng.

230
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,480
I want to ask you something.

231
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,510
Young Master, go ahead.

232
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,960
What kind of person

233
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,600
do you think Miss Xu is?

234
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,830
Young Master, do you like Miss Xu?

235
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,750
I just want

236
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,220
to understand

237
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,520
what others think of Miss Xu.

238
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,160
I kept her in the mansion

239
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,710
to investigate the spies.

240
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,720
I understand.

241
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,720
You're the Chief Inspector.

242
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,000
Everything you do is
to uncover the culprit.

243
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,630
Miss Xu is quite clever.

244
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:18,150
Her way of handling things
is truly unprecedented.

245
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,360
Both Madam and the City Lord
are very satisfied with Miss Xu.

246
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,840
They've treated her as...

247
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,680
Is the inspection agency so idle?

248
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,980
You have nothing to do?

249
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,790
I haven't finished speaking.

250
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,630
It's not shameful to like her.

251
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,480
I'll go get busy now.

252
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,030
