3
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,120
Yuwen Yan.

4
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,670
Do you know I almost
scared myself to death?

5
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:57,790
Why are you here?

6
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,200
- Our people
- Didn't I tell you...

7
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,670
have surrounded the place.

8
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,390
You two traitors.

9
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,510
Miss Xu,

10
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,710
did you really think
I came to help you?

11
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,550
You...

12
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,350
I came to kill you.

13
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,870
By this time,

14
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,230
the guards

15
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,430
must have killed everyone
in the mansion.

16
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,230
You guessed right.

17
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,950
What did you say?

18
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,640
She's talking about you.

19
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,150
You're gloating too early.

20
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,680
Just you?

21
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,310
Add me in.

22
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,680
You didn't die?

23
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,710
You're all lying to me.

24
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,510
You conspired
to kill the Chief Inspector

25
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,680
and have repeatedly tried
to frame the princess,

26
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,280
attempting to incite chaos
between Anjin and Xiliang.

27
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,280
Shen Miaoyi,

28
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,480
everything you've done
has been exposed.

29
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,590
Impossible.

30
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,520
I've been in the mansion for years
without being exposed.

31
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,630
The flowers were bought
through the office.

32
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,080
Here's the list.

33
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,420
(Shen Miaoyi, Liu Zhu'er, Huiwen)

34
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,020
(Shen Miaoyi)

35
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,520
This was found in Shen Miaoyi's room.

36
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,150
They're all materials for making kites.

37
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,870
You're the Chief Inspector.

38
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,430
You hid yourself well.

39
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,630
Even better than you?

40
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,750
I've sent a message
to Mengyun's ambassador.

41
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,120
Soon,

42
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,300
Mengyun's troops will be

43
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,190
at your city gates.

44
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,570
In the end, you're still defeated.

45
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,750
Are you talking

46
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,190
about this letter?

47
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,030
The person helping you outside

48
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,560
has long been caught.

49
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,430
(Being caught is a dead end.)

50
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,400
(I might as well...)

51
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,840
Miaoyi.

52
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,120
Yu Zheng.

53
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,470
Ever since we
found out you're a spy,

54
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,590
we investigated your background.

55
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,560
We didn't expect

56
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,240
to find your beloved.

57
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,190
In the battle between Anjin
and Mengyun back then,

58
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,710
General Yu did not die.

59
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,400
He was just severely injured.

60
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,030
Mengyun used your hatred.

61
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,840
They released news of his death

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,590
to trick you

63
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,590
into infiltrating Anjin as a spy.

64
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,360
You didn't die.

65
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,150
Why didn't you come back to find me?

66
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,590
I was injured back then

67
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,810
and fell into a coma for half a year.

68
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,190
When I woke up, I heard you died for me.

69
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,830
I intended to follow you

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,920
but was saved by the daughter

71
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,480
of a farmer.

72
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,510
I have since

73
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,370
had children with her.

74
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,040
I'm a joke.

75
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,870
If I had known, I would've died for you.

76
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,390
I wouldn't have to demean myself
for so many years.

77
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,400
Yu Zheng,

78
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,720
I live for you in this life.

79
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,390
In the next life,

80
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,430
I don't want to meet you again.

81
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,390
- Miaoyi!
- Miaoyi!

82
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,350
Miaoyi!

83
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,390
Miaoyi!

84
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,160
Miaoyi...

85
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,480
Miaoyi...

86
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,520
Yunxin,

87
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,870
you've suffered

88
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,430
these days.

89
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,800
I'm your wife.

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,600
This is all I should do.

91
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,000
Don't worry.

92
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,950
From now on,

93
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,720
I won't let you suffer
any grievances again.

94
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,240
From now on,

95
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:02,040
don't let us both
worry about you anymore.

96
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,420
(Arrangement Office)

97
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,240
Why did you take such risks?
I told you...

98
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,000
To wait in the mansion.

99
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,750
How could I feel at ease?

100
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,310
How did you know

101
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,480
I was dealing
with Shen Miaoyi this time?

102
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,830
I didn't mention it in the letter.

103
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,870
I'm clever.

104
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,070
In your letter, you said you wanted

105
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,240
to design a trap to catch Mengyun's spy

106
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,190
and told me not to go to the office.

107
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,390
So, I thought

108
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,720
this spy must be hiding there.

109
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,310
Coincidentally,
Mr. Qi found this in your room.

110
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:58,190
I intentionally left the letter
at the office.

111
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,190
It was Yun Ying.

112
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,240
So, I knew the spy was Shen Miaoyi.

113
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,760
Who is it?

114
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,270
Clever.

115
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,630
But

116
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,240
why did you leave half of it?

117
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,900
What if there really was a secret
and she got everything?

118
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,890
That would've been bad.

119
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,950
You should be working
at the inspection agency.

120
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,240
You should let me be
the Chief Inspector.

121
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,600
The Chief Inspector only
takes orders from Miss Xu.

122
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,310
Do you know

123
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,920
when I saw you at the city gate,

124
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,390
my heart almost jumped out?

125
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,290
I was afraid you'd be caught
by Shen Miaoyi.

126
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,870
Anyway, you were there.

127
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,720
I would protect you.

128
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,630
Xinglan? Xinglan?

129
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,950
Young Master,

130
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,160
I've told the City Lord
and Madam everything.

131
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,360
You don't need to worry about the rest.

132
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,870
How did it go with the folk physicians

133
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,080
I asked you to find last time?

134
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,550
There are a few.

135
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,520
Should I have them come tomorrow
to take a look?

136
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,870
Yan.

137
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,510
Xinglan has

138
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,840
fallen asleep again?

139
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,630
How is she?

140
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,930
As a physician for so many years,

141
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,030
I've never seen such a strange ailment.

142
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,870
You should seek someone more capable.

143
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,510
It's fine, Yan.

144
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,200
Don't worry; take your time.

145
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,510
Mr. Yan,

146
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,750
as for this illness,

147
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,520
(Sphygmology Classic)
I can't do anything.

148
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,390
You should prepare for the worst.

149
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,360
Impossible.

150
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,360
I must find a way to cure her.
