(Wasn't I already dead?)

5
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,520
(How could this be?)

6
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,640
Young Master, tonight we're going
to Zuixin House to capture the spy.

7
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,790
Please wear this outfit.

8
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,230
(Capture the spy?)

9
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,640
(Have I gone back to the past?)

10
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,560
(There's still a chance
to save all of this.)

14
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,350
(That dancer in red must be here.)

15
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,400
(Red silk.)

16
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,400
(Aqua green skirts.)

17
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,120
(She's really here.)

18
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,470
Is this the new dancer at Zuixin House?

19
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:30,660
Yes.

20
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,800
Everyone is waiting to catch
a glimpse of her beauty.

21
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,870
(Finally.)

22
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,470
(I've found you.)

23
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,240
Great.

24
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,960
I never thought
the infamous No. 1 assassin

25
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,000
could dance so well.

26
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,080
Isn't that the City Lord's second son?

27
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,120
Yeah.

28
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,960
That's right.

29
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,750
What does he mean by "assassin"?

30
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,840
Am I right,

31
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,120
Chiyuan?

32
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,740
(Chiyuan, No. 1 Assassin)

33
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,560
How do you know my identity?

34
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,240
We've never met.

35
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,960
Not only do I know who you are,

36
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,910
but I also know your next target.

37
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,960
It's me.

38
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,800
I don't know
how the Chief Inspector found out,

39
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,470
but capturing me

40
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,840
won't be so easy.

41
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,840
You can't escape.

42
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,630
Come back with me.

43
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,830
Why not the other way around?
Let me kill you.

44
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,190
Tell me who's behind all this,

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,360
and I might spare you.

46
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,120
Spare my life?

47
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,000
Then give it a try.

51
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,430
(What kind of outfit is this?)

52
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,270
I gave you a chance.

53
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,510
(Did I pass out from drinking?)

54
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,560
Don't blame my rudeness.

55
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,070
(But I was working overtime.)

56
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,560
Whatever happened, I'm sorry.

57
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,950
Sir, please don't hit me.

58
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,310
Playing dumb?

59
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,040
Help!

60
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,640
When do we strike?

61
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,240
During the banquet.

62
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,240
(Who am I? Where am I?)

63
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,190
(Forget it; I need to run.)

64
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,430
(Why did I suddenly
end up in another place?)

65
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,630
It's you again.

66
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,480
I told you I'm not a bad guy.

67
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,800
Who sent you?

68
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,920
What do you mean?

69
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,240
I was working overtime.

70
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,750
I haven't even finished the proposal.

71
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,830
Without the proposal,

72
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,580
what if the client scolds me?

73
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,240
He's great at scolding.

74
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,080
He...

75
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,270
Still playing dumb.

76
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,360
What do you mean I'm pretending?

77
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,040
What you're doing now is kidnapping.

78
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,490
Do you believe I'll call the police?

79
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,430
Don't try any tricks with me.

80
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,920
I have time to wait for you to talk.

81
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,470
Then I...

82
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,750
(Did I really time travel?)

83
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,920

writing a proposal.)

84
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,480
(And a hairpin suddenly appeared.)

85
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:04,870
Xinglan.

86
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,230
(Right.)

87
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,430
(At that time,
there seemed to be a voice.)

88
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,230
Xinglan.

89
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,890
The first person you see when you
open your eyes after time traveling

90
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,600
is the one who can bring you back home.

91
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,040
(The first person?)

92
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,600
(Does he hold the clue
to getting me back?)

93
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,160
When do we strike?

94
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,750
During the banquet.

95
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:33,920
Could it be

96
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,040
these memories are
the clues to going back?

97
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,870
To see these images,

98
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,720
I need to touch him first.

99
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,670
Then I...

100
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,600
(How do I get close to him?)

101
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,870
(Starting this journey on a hard mode.)

103
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,300
(Song Heng, Yuwen Yan's guard)

104
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,680
Tell me what you want to say.

105
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,310
Stop pacing in front of me.

106
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,320
Young Master.

107
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:17,950
I'm not one for gossip.

108
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,120
Didn't you go
to catch a spy the other day?

109
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,270
Why did you

110
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,390
bring back a girl from the restaurant?

111
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,190
She's a killer sent by the spies.

112
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,600
She's also figured out
I'm the Chief Inspector.

113
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,080
She's an assassin?

114
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,000
But that girl

115
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,120
doesn't look like one at all.

116
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,080
She's playing dumb.

117
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,000
I'll expose her game for sure.

118
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,750
Fire!

119
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,910
Hurry.

120
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,870
- Fire!
- Young Master.

121
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,600
Hurry.

122
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,440
Oh, no.

123
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,660
- Someone, help.
- Quick.

124
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,040
Young Master, wait.

125
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:55,930
Hurry and get water.

126
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,920
Coming.

127
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,330
Over here.

128
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:03,770
Faster.

129
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,600
What are you doing?

130
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,280
You're finally here.

131
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,200
What grudge do you have against me?

132
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,360
You locked me up.

133
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,150
However I shouted,
you didn't show up.

134
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,180
Let me tell you something.

135
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,360
The person here is
no longer the me you used to know.

136
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,790
Last night, when I touched you,

137
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,440
strange images flashed in my mind.

138
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,610
You're the first person I met here.

139
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,200
You're the clue to my way back home.

140
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,040
So strange.

141
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,030
Don't leave; let me touch you.

142
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,110
Young Master.

143
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,510
Something's off with this girl.

144
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,790
Have the maid change her clothes

145
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,390
and find a familiar physician

146
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,270
to check her head.

147
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,510
Remember.

148
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,150
Don't let this spread.

149
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,470
Didn't we have a fire?
Where are you going?

150
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,130
To find a physician

151
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,870
to examine the girl in Mr. Yan's room.

152
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,270
(The girl in the room?)

153
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,720
Whose daughter is she?

154
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,840
I don't know.

155
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,150
But that girl

156
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,120
doesn't seem very healthy,

157
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,390
always needing a physician.

158
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,600
I heard Mr. Yan

159
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,150
brought a girl back from outside,

160
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,270
and she's pregnant.

161
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,110
Really?

162
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,480
It's absolutely true.

163
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,910
I even saw Mr. Yan call for a physician.

164
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,480
He even brought a physician?

165
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,560
What?

166
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,860
(Xiang Xirou, City Lord's wife)
My grandson is on the way?

167
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,320
Mr. Yan.

168
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,590
How is she?

169
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,770
Anything wrong with her head?

170
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,240
She's talking nonsense,

171
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,550
but her head seems fine.

172
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,200
Could it be hysteria?

173
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,840
It doesn't seem so.

174
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,440
The symptoms are more like amnesia.

175
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,830
Let me observe her
after she takes the medicine.

176
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,270
I'll take my leave now.

177
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,110
Wait.

178
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,720
When you examined her,

179
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,440
did you notice any internal energy?

180
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,680
None.

181
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,960
I told you.

182
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,240
That girl can't be an assassin.

183
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,510
When you carried her back,

184
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,750
I saw her.

185
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,320
She's obviously a dancer.

186
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,150
What's there to be embarrassed about?

187
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,540
(How could she have no internal energy?)

188
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,790
(That day, I fought with her.)

189
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,150
(She even managed
to fool the physician.)

190
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,270
(Really no reaction?)

191
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,080
(If I strike her now, she'll die.)

192
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,550
(Has she truly lost
her internal energy?)

193
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,630
Who are you?

194
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,080
Help!

195
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,320
- Wait.
- No, I won't.

196
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:52,840
Calm down first.

197
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,600
Calm down?
What are you trying to do?

198
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,600
- You...
- You...

199
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,440
Let me go.

200
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,000
Don't come any closer. Stay back.

201
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,510
- Madam. Madam.
- Stop right there.

202
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,440
Who are you?

203
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,350
Let me look.

204
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,360
Don't touch me.

205
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,960
What's all this commotion?

206
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,840
Make room for me.

207
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,840
Stop the noise; quiet down.

208
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,910
Stop chasing me; who are you?

209
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,680
Listen to me.

210
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,120
- Help!
- Stop shouting.

211
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,960
It's you.

212
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,850
Don't leave; it'll only take a second.

213
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,600
What are you trying to do?

214
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,080
Nothing. I just want to touch you.

215
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,040
Don't leave.

216
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,870
Let me touch you.

217
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,510
This girl is too wild.

218
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,000
Who are they?

219
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,750
This is the City Lord's wife,

220
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,720
Mr. Yan's mother.

221
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,390
Good.

222
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,870
What's your name?

223
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,720
I'm Xu Xinglan.

224
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,510
Is my son treating you well?
Has he bullied you?

225
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,320
Your son?

226
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,510
(She's talking
about the wood-faced guy.)

227
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,320
(It seems like she's misunderstood
our relationship.)

228
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,790
(This is a chance.)

229
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,550
He won't even let me leave the house.

230
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,350
Mother,

231
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,320
- I...
- Be quiet.

232
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,800
Xinglan,

233
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,240
if you ever need anything,
just come to me.

234
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,840
I'll make sure to stand up for you.

235
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,320
As for the child,

236
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,670
don't worry.

237
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,360
I'll help cover it up

238
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,720
in front of the City Lord.

239
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,910
Don't misunderstand.

240
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,210
I have no relationship with her.

241
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:54,840
No?

242
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
Not yet.

243
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,790
Oh, it's fine.

244
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,960
Take your time.

245
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,270
Xinglan, from now on,
come to my place every day

246
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,960
to learn the etiquette here.

247
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,320
It'll be useful.

248
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,550
(How will I get close to him then?)

249
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,870
(Leaving her by Mother's side
is too dangerous.)

250
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,240
I'll make sure to teach her myself.

251
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,590
No need to trouble you, Mother.

252
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,120
(At last, something sensible for once.)

253
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Xinglan,

254
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,390
I know you two can't bear
to be apart for even a moment.

255
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,240
But don't worry; you'll only need

256
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,870
to come to my place at 7 am

257
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,080
and leave by 5 pm.

258
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,600
You'll still have time for Yan.

259
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,720
(It seems like I can't avoid this.)

260
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,910
How does that sound?

261
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,120
(Since I can't go back anytime soon,)

262
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,750
(maybe I'll find some clues here.)

263
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,080
Nianxia.

264
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,720
(Nianxia, a maid)
From today on,

265
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,960
you'll serve Xinglan.

266
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,350
Yes.

267
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,600
- Nanny Cui.
- Yes.

268
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,120
It's getting late.

269
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,390
Let's head back.

270
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,470
You should go back.

271
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,320
I'll go see them off.

272
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,380
I'm warning you; don't try any tricks.

273
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,720
Though I can't prove to Mother
that you're an assassin,

274
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,960
I'll be watching your every move

275
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,750
