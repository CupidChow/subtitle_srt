00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,260
=Ancient Workplace, Love Handbook=

2
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,260
=Episode 2=

3
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,620
(Layout of the Mansion)

4
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,150
We just finished explaining

5
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,030
the eating and dressing etiquette here.

6
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,790
Now we will explain

7
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,600
the layout of our mansion.

8
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,840
The layout of the mansion
has been explained.

9
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,320
(Finally done.)

10
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,680
Next, I will continue to explain

11
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,150
the walking etiquette to Miss Xu.

12
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,640
- (What? There's more?)
- Seating etiquette.

13
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,430
(But learning this
won't take me back home.)

14
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,590
Madam, do we have any

15
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,680
etiquette that can make men like us?

16
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,070
Well...

17
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,350
(If I want to return
to the 21st century soon,)

18
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,960
(I can only take the initiative.)

19
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,820
(Yanyu Pavilion)

20
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,920
(The best way to approach others
is with kindness.)

21
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,260
(Being considerate)

22
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,120
What are you doing here?

23
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,000
This is the sugar water I made.
Please try it.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,840
No need.

25
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,150
(I anticipated this long ago.)

26
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,790
(It's okay; I still have
a trick up my sleeve.)

27
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,300
(Feigning a different intention)

28
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,870
You want me to feed you personally,
right?

29
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,200
What are you doing?

30
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,790
I didn't mean it. Let me clean you up.

31
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,790
Song Heng, throw her out.

32
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,200
- Let me try again.
- Miss Xu, leave.

33
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,230
Let me try again.

34
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,640
Get a tailor to come tomorrow.

35
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,790
- Yes.
- (A tailor?)

36
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,710
(Alright.)

37
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,310
(Switching places)

38
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,430
Young Master, the tailor
for new clothes has arrived.

39
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,240
(Why aren't there any
strange memories?)

40
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,630
(Did I touch the wrong places?)

41
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,750
(Could it be here?)

42
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,800
(Here?)

43
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,870
(Or this place?)

44
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,590
Why do you look so familiar to me?

45
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,800
I have a common face.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Many people would say that.

47
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,960
Then let me

48
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,750
take a closer look.

49
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,590
Stop it.

50
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,470
Sir, it's me.

51
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,840
Don't push so hard.

52
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,280
Miss Xu, why is it you?

53
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,910
I'm making clothes.

54
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,870
Stop trying to play tricks on me.

55
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,680
I have no patience left.

56
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,120
Seems you haven't learned

57
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,150
the rules of the mansion.

58
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,280
Go back and copy the rules

59
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,710
two hundred times.

60
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,340
(Breeze and Moon)
Two hundred times?

61
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,630
(But)

62
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,080
(I've touched him everywhere.)

63
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,960
(Arrangement Office)
(There are no strange memories.)

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,080
(To find clues to return)

65
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,430
(Guests)
(is not that simple.)

66
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,280
(I don't know how much longer
I have to stay here.)

67
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,840
(But)

68
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,080
(this person looks foolish and naive.)

69
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,470
(He doesn't seem like a bad person.)

70
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,080
(Well.)

71
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,430
(I'll give it a try
and see if we can get along.)

72
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,750
Miss, you're amazing.

73
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,120
You managed to find such a method.

74
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,360
A piece of cake.

75
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,160
When I was in school,

76
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,190
I often did this.

77
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,770
Look at your dark circles.

78
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,210
Mr. Yan didn't say
it had to be delivered today.

79
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,080
How about we write it tomorrow?

80
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,090
Sure.

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,310
Miss, let's hurry back.

82
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,480
It's been unsettling
in the mansion at night lately.

83
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,480
Unsettling?

84
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,070
I heard there are ghosts.

85
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,920
How can there be ghosts in this world?

86
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,760
Silly girl.

87
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,640
Stop!

88
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,390
We are here on the orders of Father

89
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,510
to apprehend you, you monster.

90
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,310
Who is she talking to?

91
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,070
Is this the madam?

92
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,120
I can't see clearly.

93
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,120
What's going on?

94
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,480
Miss, are we really going
to follow them?

95
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,920
Don't be afraid.
I'll prove to you right now

96
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,510
that there are no ghosts in this world.

97
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,270
Madam?

98
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,760
Madam?

99
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,740
(Yanyu Pavilion)

100
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,480
What time is it?

101
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,640
Young Master,

102
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,070
it's almost 11 pm.

103
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,630
So late.

104
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,870
She still hasn't returned?

105
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,430
You mean

106
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,720
Miss Xu, right?

107
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,840
Of course.

108
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,320
Yes.

109
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,510
Miss Xu should still be

110
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,870
with Madam,

111
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,390
copying the rules.

112
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:48,750
It's so late.

113
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,420
Why is she still at Muxi Pavilion?

114
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,310
Let's go there.

115
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,270
Hurry.

116
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,230
Bring your sword.

117
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,190
Where's my mother?

118
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,920
I haven't seen her.

119
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,720
Did Madam go to see the City Lord?

120
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,480
That's impossible. I asked.

121
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,830
They said Madam hasn't gone out.

122
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,670
How about Xu Xinglan?

123
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,750
I just saw Miss Xu and Madam
in the main hall.

124
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,590
Let's go.

125
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,960
Let's go.

126
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,750
Mother!

127
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,830
It's you!

128
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,530
Young Master.

129
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,750
It's not like that.

130
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,360
When I came,

131
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,830
- Madam said...
- Young Master, wait.

132
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,490
Nanny Cui, perfect timing.

133
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,150
Please explain to the Young Master.

134
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,700
It's not what he saw.

135
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,960
Young Master,

136
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,940
this blood is fake.

137
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,740
How am I supposed
to continue acting?

138
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,580
Mother!

139
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,860
- Brat.
- Madam!

140
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,710
Why are you here?

141
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:02,940
Miss Xu, are you alright?

142
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,900
Oh, no.

143
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,940
You're bleeding.

144
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:06,980
What should we do?

145
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,940
Look at what you've done to Xinglan.

146
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,250
You...

147
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,580
Yan.

148
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,940
You know I'm interested in storytelling.

149
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,840
I asked

150
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,860
- Miss Xu to help me with this.
- Yes.

151
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,700
Miss Xu, you mustn't tell anyone

152
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,180
what you saw tonight.

153
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,260
Madam has loved writing stories
since she was young.

154
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,300
Every night,

155
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,260
she thinks of new stories like this.

156
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,660
If this gets out,

157
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,620
it might tarnish Madam's reputation.

158
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,780
So, that's how it is.

159
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,900
Then may I ask if you can

160
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,660
show me the stories?

161
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,540
I can teach you something
even more fun.

162
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,140
Something even more fun?

163
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,020
That's ridiculous.

164
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,700
If you hadn't come,

165
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,860
we would have so much fun.

166
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:08,900
How is she?

167
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,020
Mr. Yan,

168
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,540
I have given Miss Xu

169
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,540
some calming medicine,

170
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,580
and she's already asleep.

171
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,220
For the wound on her neck,

172
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,060
apply some medicine

173
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,500
to ease the bleeding and bruising.

174
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,060
Thank you.

175
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,820
Please.

176
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,100
Miss Xu's medicine
needs to be prepared.

177
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:37,940
Hurry up.

178
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:38,810
Yes.

179
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,050
I'll step back now.

180
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,490
Young Master, you were too ruthless.

181
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,580
Her identity is suspicious.

182
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,660
Besides, my mother
is lying in front of me.

183
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,060
How could I not be anxious?

184
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,900
But I did

185
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,900
make a mistake today.

186
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,420
What are you doing?

187
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,020
Are you okay?

188
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,740
Did I hear you wrong?

189
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,590
You, with that wooden face,

190
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,770
actually care about me?

191
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,020
Regarding today,

192
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,930
I truly misunderstood you.

193
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,820
But if you have ulterior motives,

194
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,740
I won't let you off.

195
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,510
Are you apologizing

196
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,870
or threatening me?

197
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,340
Who told you to come up
with such a bad idea for my mother?

198
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,740
What do you mean?

199
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,470
A bad idea?

200
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,960
We were having a good time,

201
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,500
and you barged in

202
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,060
and disrupted our plan.

203
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,620
Young Master.

204
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,050
That's true.

205
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,440
What Miss Xu was playing

206
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,620
was really quite interesting.

207
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,470
Right?

208
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,020
I'm telling you.

209
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,140
The more people, the more fun it is.

210
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,240
You can join us.

211
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,520
Really?

212
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,460
Young Master, then...

213
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,340
Well.

214
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,380
Miss Xu's medicine is almost ready.

215
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,500
I'll help Nianxia.

216
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,540
Next time, join us.

217
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,420
Now that you're awake,

218
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,700
you can apply it yourself.

219
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,820
Who would apologize like this?

220
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,060
Besides,

221
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,540
I don't even know where my wound is.

222
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,580
What exactly do you want?

223
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,180
Oh heaven, oh earth.

224
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,260
My life is so miserable.

225
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,580
I just wanted to have fun with everyone,

226
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,420
and as a result,

227
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,020
I almost lost my life.

228
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,500
Alright, I'll apply it for you.

229
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,880
The first person you see when you
open your eyes after time traveling

230
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,580
is the one who can bring you back home.

231
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,580
(The clue to my memory)

232
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,940
(must be on him.)

233
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,100
(I need to think of a way.)

234
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,340
(I have to spend every day with him.)
