=Episode 9=

3
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,670
(Why is he here?)

4
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,030
(Did he stay here all night
to watch over me?)

5
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,670
Are you feeling unwell?

6
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,840
I feel refreshed.

7
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,760
Wait for me.

8
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,320
I was worried you'd be hungry.

9
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,710
I've prepared food for you.

10
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,510
Just this?

11
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,920
You had a fever last night.

12
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,360
You need to eat something light.

13
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,960
But...

14
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,000
I want hotpot.

15
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,440
Snail noodles.

16
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,960
Stinky tofu.

17
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,200
Spicy gluten is fine.

18
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,280
I'll do it myself.

19
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,960
Take it slow.

20
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,000
Where are you going?

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,510
I'm going to the office.

22
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,030
The physician said

23
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,920
though you didn't hurt
your muscles or bones,

24
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,590
you still needed to rest for a few days.

25
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,150
I don't feel unwell though.

26
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,320
Could it be

27
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,110
that I've suffered the legendary

28
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,110
internal injury?

29
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,480
Lie back down.

30
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,500
(Arrangement Office)

31
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,400
Miss Xu,

32
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,360
Mr. Yan asked you to rest at home.

33
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,710
I'm fine.

34
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,150
He's making a big deal out of it.

35
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,840
If Mr. Yan hadn't arrived in time,

36
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,110
who knows how badly Wei Yingying

37
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,360
would have hurt you?

38
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,510
Forget it. It's a blessing in disguise.

39
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,000
There's a vacancy,

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,960
and Yunxin got promoted.

41
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,670
But Miss Yunxin
doesn't seem happy about it.

42
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,550
She looks like
she's got a lot on her mind.

43
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,630
I bought flowers for you.

44
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,280
I said I didn't want them.

45
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,190
- Take them.
- Why is it always flowers?

46
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,590
Finally caught you.

47
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,070
- They're hard to buy.
- Miss Xu.

48
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,320
It took me ages to find them.

49
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,280
Please accept them.

50
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,110
Let go of her!

51
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,670
Miss Xu!

52
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,550
Take them.

53
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,360
Are these your favorite flowers?

54
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,440
Miss, he's...

55
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,760
He's the one
who's been bullying Yunxin.

56
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,030
Why aren't you resting at home?

57
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,320
What are you doing here?

58
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,920
Looks like someone else
will need to rest now.

59
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,600
Brother?

60
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,160
Bro...

61
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,070
Brother?

62
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,240
Well.

63
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,280
Mr. Jun, I'm sorry.

64
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,000
So,

65
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,760
you're the pervert.

66
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,950
No.

67
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,150
The one giving gifts to Yunxin.

68
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,980
(Yuwen Jun, first son of the City Lord)

69
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,590
He said it was fine.

70
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,760
You've got quite a kick.

71
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,110
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

72
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,760
You should leave.

73
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,150
I'm not leaving.

74
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,960
There's no chance for us anymore.

75
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,960
Don't worry.

76
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,550
I don't need your help.

77
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,030
What are they talking about?

78
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,350
It's a long story.

79
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,810
Ten years.

80
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,400
Childhood sweethearts.

81
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,760
Then why has Yunxin
been avoiding him?

82
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,840
Are Mr. Jun's feelings one-sided?

83
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,190
But Mr. Jun

84
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,960
can't even speak properly,

85
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,550
yet Yunxin understands him.

86
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,420
They're quite the match.

87
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,440
Very sweet.

88
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,280
What?

89
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,600
Nothing.

90
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,800
Then

91
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,030
should we help them?

92
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,550
How?

93
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,760
Who just refused them?

94
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,070
Now, you're quite happy.

95
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,320
Are you free tomorrow?

96
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,190
Yes.

97
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,840
Ever since Wei Yingying was dismissed,

98
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,920
there has been

99
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,800
so much work

100
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,030
in and around the office.

101
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,400
I'm so busy I can hardly keep up.

102
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,230
You should take care of yourself.

103
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,320
What I mean is

104
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,280
you're now part

105
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,960
of the management team at the office.

106
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,400
You should share my burden.

107
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,110
There's a big event tomorrow.

108
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,230
You must be there.

109
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,150
Do I need to prepare anything?

110
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,760
Just show up.

111
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,460
(Junling Pavilion)

112
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,510
Jun, you know Miss Zhong

113
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,150
has her reasons.

114
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,760
I'm definitely going to help Yunxin

115
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,110
all the way.

116
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,550
Jun, let's go somewhere tomorrow.

117
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:45,960
Is Yunxin asking me out?

118
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,670
Xinglan accidentally hurt you.

119
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,230
Tomorrow, she'll apologize to you.

120
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,510
Yan.

121
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,110
Miss Xu has a hot temper.

122
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,440
How will you live your life
in the future?

123
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:13,060
(Arrangement Office)

124
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,110
What's going on?

125
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,150
Is the big event you mentioned
playing mahjong?

126
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,440
- Yunxin.
- Yunxin.

127
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:33,430
We...

128
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,480
We need one more player.

129
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,070
Right, right.

130
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,110
- One of Characters.
- One of Characters.

131
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,310
This should be what you want.

132
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,600
Nine of Bamboo.

133
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,590
I can't afford your tile.

134
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,510
I won.

135
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,440
So fast?

136
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,230
Yunxin, you're amazing.

137
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,480
Because I can do math.

138
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,360
I was careless.

139
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,440
Continue.

140
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,680
Seven of Characters.

141
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,070
I won.

142
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:26,870
Three of Characters.

143
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,950
I won.

144
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,110
How is it possible to win so fast?

145
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,070
Self-draw.

146
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,110
All of one suit.

147
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,270
I won again.

148
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,600
You took a tile,

149
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,030
but you discarded it to help me.

150
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,110
You could've won,

151
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,390
but you gave your tiles to me.

152
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,600
When I was surely a winner,

153
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,560
you still helped me.

154
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,360
I...

155
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,970
Young Master, you don't need
to be so kind to me.

156
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,600
I...

157
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,520
Yunxin.

158
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,270
Then I'll head back first.

159
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,560
I planned to defeat Yunxin,

160
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,760
make her cry for help,

161
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,760
and then have Mr. Jun save her.

162
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,780
Unexpectedly...

163
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,720
We were outmatched.

164
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,840
It's okay; there will be other ways.

167
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,840
(The plan failed.)

168

(I need to come up with another plan.)

169
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,110

This month's supplies have arrived.

175
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,310
Please check them, Miss Zhong.

176
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,190
This makes it easier.

177
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,840
Likes me.

178
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,720
Doesn't like me.

179
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,110
Likes me.

180
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,520
Doesn't like me.

181
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,070
Likes me.

182
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,800
Jun.

183
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,390
What are you doing?

184
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,360
Yunxin

185
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,720
probably really doesn't like me.

186
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,370
Impossible.

187
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,670
If she didn't like you,

188
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,670
why would she keep
the little tiger from you?

189
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,420
Really?

190
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,310
She's still keeping our love token.

191
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,230
I can only help you this far.
