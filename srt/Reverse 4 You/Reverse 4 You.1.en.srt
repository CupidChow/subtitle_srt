1
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,480
This is a story of Jattawa.

2
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,240
An average 19-year-old girl

3
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,400
who looks like any other girl,

4
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,120
but she actually
has extraordinary hidden secrets.

5
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,320
She's also a soon to be prosecutor.

6
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,880
Excuse me.

7
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,000
Jattawa, that way.

8
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,680
-Coming up next…
-Okay.

9
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,360
is a special performance
from our pocket bunny.

10
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,880
Luna!

11
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,440
Hi.

12
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:34,000
But her journey to becoming a prosecutor
isn't as easy as it may seem.

13
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,160
You can leave it here.

14
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,200
Okay.

15
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,760
Here's your wage for today.

16
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,480
Thank you so much. I'll excuse myself.

17
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,760
Okay, take care!

18
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,080
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

19
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,320
Jattawa, wait!

20
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,480
-Yes?
-Here.

21
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,920
Jattawa's life has no 'luck' in it.

22
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,920
Watch out!

23
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,680
But what she has are secrets
that do not rely on any kind of luck.

24
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,520
And this is her ultimate secret.

25
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,520
Jattawa has the ability to control time

26
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,920
and stop time for as long as she pleases.

27
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,880
She can also turn back time…

28
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,160
with a maximum limit of ten minutes
before the present.

29
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,120
Sir, be careful with this wire.

30
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,520
It's leaning on the pole.
Don't pull it.

31
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,440
Oh.

32
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,880
-You can place it here.
-Okay.

33
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,000
Here's your wage for today.

34
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,360
Thank you so much.

35
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,160
Do you have anything for me?

36
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,720
Yes, I almost forgot.

37
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,360
How did you know?

38
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,240
Here it is.

39
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,520
Thank you so much.

40
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,800
Congratulations on your exam.
What was the major again?

41
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,080
It's the faculty of Law,
but only for the written exam.

42
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,880
I have an oral exam tomorrow.

43
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,880
You'll be fine.

44
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,640
You have the top score
in the written exam. You'll pass the oral.

45
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,880
You're smart and hardworking.

46
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,000
Okay then, I'll excuse myself.

47
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,840
-Okay.
-Goodbye.

48
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,560
Jattawa has a younger sister.
She's 15 years old.

49
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,880
She's also kind, smart, and adorable.
Her name is…

50
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,320
Vivi! Come get the door for me please.

51
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,360
Okay.

52
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,840
Did you get some snacks from the event?

53
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,120
You saw it in your vision?

54
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,960
I want to have a power
to foresee the future

55
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,480
so I can become rich
by telling fortunes.

56
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,280
Nonsense. All I can see is our future.

57
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,240
Plus it can't be controlled
unlike yours.

58
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,960
You can turn back time whenever you want.

59
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,000
Can I just have a power and be rich?

60
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,000
Once you become the prosecutor,
we'll be comfortable.

61
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,600
Not a prosecutor.
I've told you I wanted to be a lawyer.

62
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,160
You must be exhausted
from working and studying.

63
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,240
Because we've only got each other.

64
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,080
I have jobs,

65
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,280
and your job is to find me food
and keep me from being hungry.

66
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,240
Deal?

67
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,080
Okay. I'll make you a nice dinner
to make you fresh.

68
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,800
Sounds good, bring me the full course!

69
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,000
Copy that!

70
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,160
Vivi!

71
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,000
Jattawa! I just had a vision.

72
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,360
Vision?

73
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,400
I saw that you will meet your soulmate.

74
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,280
Huh? Soulmate?

75
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,280
What does he look like? Is he handsome?

76
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,880
I'm not sure,
I can only see his silhouette.

77
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,760
But I have work tomorrow after my exam.

78
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,840
I won't have time
to meet your so-called "soulmate".

79
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,920
But the atmosphere
was so romantic, Jattawa!

80
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,480
Really?

81
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,400
You'll meet your soulmate
once it starts snowing!

82
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,920
-Snowing?
-Yes.

83
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,120
In Bangkok?

84
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,720
Come on!

85
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,280
That's not a vision, that's a delusion.

86
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,880
And that soulmate too.

87
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,680
Nonsense. See you!

88
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,560
But it's true, Jattawa!

89
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,800
Jattawa!

90
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,240
There's a small garden at the university

91
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,160
where you'll meet your soulmate.

92
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,960
How am I supposed to meet my soulmate?

93
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,680
Excuse me.

94
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,640
Do you know
where the faculty of law building is?

95
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,280
You're here for the exam?

96
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,280
The building is over there.

97
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,200
Thank you.

98
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,400
But the registration desk
has closed.

99
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,320
What?

100
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,520
-Wait!
-Yes?

101
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,880
Didn't you just cross over?

102
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,280
What? Has the heat gotten to you? Bye.

103
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,640
Excuse me, please register here first.

104
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,160
Did I make it?

105
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,880
Yes, you did.

106
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,200
I've told you
the registration desk is closed.

107
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,840
They've moved
to in front of the exam room.

108
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,680
Next time try to listen more.

109
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,280
What's your name?

110
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,280
It's Jattawa Piengpradabkwan.

111
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,040
Please write your name here.

112
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,880
And please wait in front of the room.

113
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,160
Thank you.

114
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,120
Jattawa, pretty weird name.

115
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,320
Is this the only reason
why you want to be a lawyer?

116
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,160
I feel like
the salary seems well paid to me.

117
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,840
What if we leave out the salary,
what do you really want to do?

118
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,720
If money is out of the picture,
I don't want to do anything.

119
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,000
That was terrible. I'll answer again.

120
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,680
I've already used up my power.
All because of him.

121
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,080
Next candidate please.

122
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,120
Okay.

123
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,520
Not him again.

124
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,840
Hey, that's Soulmate!

125
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,920
No, it's not!

126
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,120
Yes, it is! Look!

127
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,120
This year's production
from the drama club.

128
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,720
You've always been too quick.

129
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,360
I'm Top.

130
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,800
I'm Khun.

131
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,960
You're the son of the ambassador.
Everyone knows you.

132
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,960
I'm Jattawa, you can call me Wa.

133
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,680
Okay, Wa.

134
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,040
But won't be seeing each other again.

135
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,360
Why is that?

136
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,840
My interview didn't go as planned.

137
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,880
The exam isn't that harsh.

138
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,480
They just want to see
that you are not insane.

139
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,000
And you seem… fine to me.

140
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,800
You should be able to get in.

141
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,200
-Really?
-Yes.

142
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,320
I'm so glad.

143
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,600
Are you two
going to the students' hazing after?

144
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,560
I'm not sure yet. We'll see.

145
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,040
Really?

146
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,640
I don't think so too. I'll have to work.

147
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,160
You're so hardworking.

148
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,840
Well, I'll let you know
if there are any dramas later.

149
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,960
I don't think
I'll have time for any dramas.

150
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,160
I have to go, guys.

151
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,600
Thank you so much, Top. You too.

152
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,320
Bye.

153
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,800
She's always in a rush.

154
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,920
Hi, Uncle.

155
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,080
Leaving for work?

156
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,280
Yes.

157
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,600
I saw that the gates were broken
so I'm fixing them.

158
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,200
Thank you so much. I'm leaving now.

159
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,920
Wa, wait!

160
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,880
Congratulations on passing the exams.

161
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,800
Oh.

162
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,600
Here, take this.
Go celebrate with your sister.

163
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,360
It's okay, Uncle.

164
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,920
We're doing fine from your usual support.

165
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,600
Take it. Your father told me
to look after you guys.

166
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,480
It's the least I can do.

167
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,080
Thank you so much, Uncle.
I really have to go.

168
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,680
Judging from the size of their house,

169
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,520
I don't think they'll mind
getting their pizza two minutes late.

170
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,560
That will be 512 baht.

171
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,840
It's free after 30 minutes.

172
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,720
But it was only two minutes over.

173
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,720
Wanna talk to the house owner?

174
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,560
A worker just like me,
why am I getting bullied?

175
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,080
How about this move?

176
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,160
Miss, please help me.

177
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,560
Please tell the house owner to help me.

178
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,960
Please.

179
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,480
If you don't help me,

180
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,640
I'll have to pay for the pizza,
plus I won't get paid.

181
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,280
Please help me.

182
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,200
Talk to the house owner for me, please.

183
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,880
Why should I care?

184
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,680
What should I do?

185
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,880
ORIENTATION DAY

186
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,120
"Ride safe,
watch out for the snow."

187
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,920
She won't give this up, Vivi.

188
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,720
It won't snow.

189
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,960
"Tell me more about your soulmate after."

190
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:37,320
"There's nothing to tell.
No snow, no soulmate."

191
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,520
What are you staring at?

192
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,160
Four, let's go to the orientation.
We're late.

193
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,400
I'm coming.

194
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,120
Four…

195
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:44,680
Five, four, three, two, one.

196
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,040
I'm back.

197
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,640
How was it, Jattawa?

198
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,760
Tired as usual.

199
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,000
Have some water.

200
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,080
I was talking about your soulmate
when it snowed.

201
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,120
See? I told you
you'd meet your soulmate when it snowed.

202
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,600
Meaning that person you've met
must be your soulmate.

203
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,680
I've met so many people today.

204
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,400
How would I know which one is my soulmate?

205
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,920
I don't even know what he looks like.

206
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,760
I didn't really see
the entirety of his face.

207
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,520
But I've sketched his face.

208
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,560
-Really?
-One second.

209
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,280
Let me see.

210
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,480
Wow!

211
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,160
Is he this handsome?

212
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,080
Oh, not him.

213
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,800
That's Johnny Kim, he's my favorite.

214
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,520
And this is for you.

215
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,320
Did you meet anyone
that looks like this today?

216
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,720
Quite tall.

217
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,760
Looks like this?

218
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,040
What are you staring at?

219
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,960
I don't think so.

220
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,280
If I have any more visions,
I'll let you know.

221
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,319
Okay.

222
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,560
Jattawa, time for dinner.

223
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,880
FIRST DAY OF SEMESTER

224
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,880
I thought you're sitting alone.

225
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,240
It's Khun's.

226
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,080
Here, take it.

227
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,560
What are they looking at?

228
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,960
It's Khun.

229
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,120
Why?

230
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,400
You missed the students hazing.

231
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,440
Khun was really popular.
All the girls like him.

232
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,240
So how was the students' hazing?
Any updates?

233
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,760
A lot.

234
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,960
The garden next to
Business Administration faculty.

235
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,760
If possible, you two must avoid it.

236
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,560
Because it's the Four Serpents' territory.

237
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,600
Four Serpents?

238
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,440
-Yes, for real.
-For real?

239
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,000
The notorious reputation
of the four vicious seniors.

240
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,480
Wait, are they like snakes?

241
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,400
Are they going to bite you
when you walk past?

242
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,720
Hey, I'm serious.

243
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,600
If they don't like you,
you're in big trouble.

244
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,920
Especially to Four, she's the worst one.

245
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,480
Four?

246
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,880
What did she do?

247
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,600
Hey, Top, are you showing the clip again?

248
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,520
Yes.

249
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,400
It's so dramatic.
You won't want see it.

250
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,200
Yes, I do. Show me.

251
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,400
I thought you don't like dramas.

252
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,800
It's just a clip.

253
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,840
Let me see.

254
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,880
Kie! Why did you do this to me?

255
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,280
Hey! Stop it!

256
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,880
Go break it!

257
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,000
Oh no.

258
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,720
How was it? Brutal?

259
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,480
You two try not to be around her at all
if possible.

260
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,560
Kie! Why did you do this to me?

261
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,640
Wa, hold this for a second.

262
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,360
Why me? Just put it somewhere else.

263
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,720
We're friends, help me for a bit.

264
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,680
Are you two arguing again?

265
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,120
Did I make a mistake grouping with you?

266
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,680
Look at Khun.

267
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,520
You want to talk about the report
this evening?

268
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,120
I'm busy this evening. I'll have to go to…

269
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,080
Work after. We all know, hardworking girl.

270
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,160
Really?

271
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,080
Take it back.

272
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,680
Hey, don't hit me.

273
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,880
What did you say?

274
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,080
Not everyone has time
to play football.

275
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,520
It's not just for fun.

276
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,320
I'll have
a football club tryouts later today.

277
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,480
Tryouts?

278
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,760
Want to join?

279
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,240
I'm going.

280
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,280
You're going?

281
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,280
Yes.

282
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,960
You have a little free time left?
Come watch for a bit.

283
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,560
I should get going now.
I have to change too.

284
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,080
Goodbye.

285
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,800
Hey, Khun.

286
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,320
Good luck.

287
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,880
Jattawa, right?

288
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,640
I'm Jib.

289
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,360
Oh.

290
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,040
Are you hitting on Khun?

291
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,320
What?

292
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,960
No, I'm not.

293
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,000
I'm working in the same group as him.

294
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,920
Excuse me.

295
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,360
Then you're okay
if I want to flirt with him, right?

296
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,880
Okay, go ahead.

297
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,400
Yes, professor. Now? Of course.

298
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,400
Okay.

299
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,400
Wa, it's me.

300
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,160
You called me right on time.

301
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,880
Wa, I saw something bad in my vision.

302
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,000
Now you can see things instantly?

303
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,920
That's why you rescued me.

304
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,520
It's not about what just happened to you.

305
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,920
Then who is it?

306
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,400
I didn't see the face,

307
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,960
but I saw someone wearing a yellow shirt.

308
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,720
Yellow shirt…

309
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,680
Wa, hold on.

310
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,960
Why me? Just put it somewhere else.

311
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,160
What's happening?

312
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,040
-You haven't gone to work yet?
-Top.

313
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,520
Hey.

314
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,280
-Yes?
-Where's Khun?

315
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,960
There he is.

316
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,480
I saw that someone challenged him

317
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,680
and he fell down with a broken leg.

318
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,800
Does his leg seem injured to you?

319
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,920
No. Why? What's wrong with his leg?

320
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,760
Really?

321
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,160
Okay.

322
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,760
-Oh!
-Oh!

323
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,040
Where are you going?

324
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,160
Khun's leg is broken!

325
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,440
He's just teasing.

326
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,480
Are you all right, Wa?

327
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,760
I'm okay.

328
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,880
Vivi must have been wrong.

329
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,400
Top, I'll see you later.

330
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,400
Okay.

331
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,080
That's Four.

332
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,520
What are they doing?

333
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,600
Is Four having a fight
with the volleyball club member again?

334
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,160
Attention!

335
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,960
Volleyball club
will have a track race with…

336
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,440
non-club members.

337
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,600
If anyone is interested,
come watch the race.

338
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,440
Are you serious, Four? Don't do it.

339
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,920
She asked for it. I can't back off.

340
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,240
Yellow shirt…

341
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,360
On your mark!

342
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,760
Where are you going, Jattawa? Get to work!

343
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,960
Get set!

344
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,120
It could have been a false alarm.

345
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,040
Vivi must have been delusional.

346
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,840
But why am I still running?

347
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,240
Go!

348
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,000
Hey, Four! Let's go!

349
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,520
Four's leg is broken! Call an ambulance!

350
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,280
My friend broke her leg…

351
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,560
-Four.
-…at the sports stadium.

352
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,560
Attention! Volleyball club
will have track race with…

353
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,560
non-members.

354
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,360
If anyone is interested,
come watch the race.

355
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,160
Please don't race.

356
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,800
Who's this, Four?

357
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,840
Are you here for the pizza money?

358
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,560
Don't go on the race
just because someone challenges you.

359
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,320
Kie sent you?

360
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,560
Kie?

361
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,280
We're ready.

362
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,360
But if you're scared,
you're welcome to withdraw from the race.

363
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,360
Four, I'm serious.

364
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,800
It's not worth it
if something bad happens to you.

365
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Four.

366
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,880
Go tell her that this isn't working.

367
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,400
Please, Four, I'm begging you.

368
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,680
Move.

369
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,840
On your mark!

370
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,160
Get set!

371
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,280
Four!

372
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,560
Not backing down?

373
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,400
What's that?

374
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,600
I just caught you red-handed. Admit it.

375
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,200
Aren't you aware that pulling the alarm
without any emergency is wrong?

376
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,640
Of course it's an emergency.
At least no one gets hurt.

377
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,080
Hey!

378
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,840
What kind of person is Four?

379
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:43,640
Suspects me for helping her out.

380
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,760
Because you just showed up randomly
crying to her.

381
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,040
Well, I…

382
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,520
Wait! I haven't told you
that I was crying.

383
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,800
I saw the whole thing.

384
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,920
Why didn't you tell me?

385
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,840
It seems like you enjoy telling me stories
about her so I rolled with it.

386
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,360
No, I didn't.

387
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,760
What are you drawing? Come here.

388
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,680
It's almost done.

389
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,880
Is your favorite singer
more important than your sister?

390
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,880
No, I was drawing your "favorite".

391
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:23,160
It's done. Here it is your soulmate.

392
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,600
Huh? That's…

393
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,640
Four? For real?

394
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,520
I don't think so.

395
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,320
You know, it's really sweet
when you two are dating.

396
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,400
Calling each other "honey bunny".

397
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,480
How cute!

398
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,800
There's no way.

399
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,000
Four's a cruel person.
I think you're wrong.

400
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:57,400
Your loss,
because that's what the future holds,

401
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,600
I didn't plan it. I just see it.

402
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,960
Wait a second,

403
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,880
don't you remember when you told me

404
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,720
that the result of the lottery
was going to be "44" so I bought them all?

405
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,040
I spent all my money.

406
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:15,280
It was around the beginning of semester.

407
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,600
And what happened?

408
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,040
It wasn't 44!

409
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,120
Come on! It was just once.

410
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,120
So why not a second time?

411
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,600
Not this time, I'm sure.

412
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:29,400
You'll meet her again tomorrow,

413
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,280
because you'll be
delivering her food order.

414
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,280
Huh?

415
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,280
Nope. You're wrong!

416
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,800
There's neither her name
nor address on the list!

417
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,080
You are wrong!

418
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,640
Why are you laughing?

419
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,440
You said you didn't like her,

420
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,880
but you can clearly
remember her name and address.

421
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,440
Vivi!

422
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,560
Food's here.

423
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,000
Are you Fang?

424
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,920
Yes.

425
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,920
Here it is.

426
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,960
Thank you.

427
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,320
Thank you for using Green Gusto.

428
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,760
-Okay.
-Bye.

429
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,120
Your food's here, Four.

430
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,600
Okay, thank you.

431
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,920
Try to order it yourself next time.

432
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,440
Why order it myself?
I've got you.

433
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,960
The delivery was slow.

434
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:41,000
No way! This can't be like Vivi's vision.

435
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,800
Oh, I'm sorry.

436
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,880
The delivery got mixed up.

437
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,320
Can I reimburse your order instead?

438
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,240
-Sure.
-I'll wire it to you.

439
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,920
Okay. Just a moment.

440
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,880
360 Baht!

441
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,400
Why don't you check the prices first?

442
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,760
Here it is.

443
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,400
-I'm really sorry.
-It's okay.

444
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,320
What was that?

445
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,160
Fang! Where's the food?

446
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,120
It's not here,
the delivery got mixed up.

447
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,040
What?

448
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,320
Vivi's vision didn't come true.

449
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,960
-What should we eat?
-Guys!

450
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,000
My mom bought a lot of Green Gusto.
Let's eat!

451
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,080
Just about time!

452
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,680
-Let's eat.
-Put it down.

453
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,000
I'm starving.

454
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,200
-Your mom just saved the day.
-Agree.

455
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,440
No!

456
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:38,080
360 Baht. This could last me
a couple of meals with Vivi.

457
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,480
I'll finish the whole thing.

458
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,480
We're here.

459
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:47,040
Wow! You're eating fancy today.

460
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:52,320
So now you're being fancy
because you've become a representative.

461
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,080
What's that? I don't get it.

462
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:59,160
Khun was chosen by the seniors
as a freshmen representative.

463
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:04,440
Oh? So what does it
have to do anything with me?

464
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:11,160
The seniors asked me
about my desirable representative,

465
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,480
so I told them it's "Jattawa".

466
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,000
Congratulations.

467
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:23,400
Wait a second, guys. Is this a joke?

468
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,240
It's not a big deal.

469
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,720
It's just a title.

470
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,800
Are you sure?

471
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,960
Yes, we just have to contend
as representatives of our university.

472
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,760
Huh? University representatives!

473
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,120
Are you crazy, Khun?

474
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,720
You should have run it by me first!

475
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,880
You know I'm swamped with work!

476
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,200
That's annoying.

477
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,200
Jang, go find out more about Jattawa.

478
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:58,560
I wanted to go talk to her
about what we talked about last time.

479
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,600
Sure.

480
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,200
-I've got to work.
-There's rewards.

481
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,680
-I already told you!
-Yes, rewards.

482
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,080
It's not like I'll win the contest.

483
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,400
Fifty thousand Baht. Think about it.

484
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,600
Fifty thousand.

485
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,960
Fifty thousand.

486
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,199
-Fifty thousand.
-Sit down first.

487
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:19,960
Fifty thousand?

488
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:20,920
Yes.

489
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:27,800
So let's hear it then.

490
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,520
That was quick.

491
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:34,000
What? If I were to compete,
then might as well do it good.

492
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:45,920
Hey!

493
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,000
Help!

494
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,120
Please help me. That thief took my purse!

495
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,960
Thank you so much.

496
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,320
I would've been in big trouble.

497
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,000
Oh, no. It's okay, miss.

498
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,680
In fact, me and my sister
go to school around here.

499
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,160
Let's agree we made
this neighborhood a little bit safer.

500
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,640
You live around here?

501
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,800
If my house is in this area,
I wouldn't be delivering food like this.

502
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,200
GO-WA-GO Oh…

503
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,840
I've got to go now.

504
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,160
Wait a second!

505
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,200
Can I have your contact?
We'll help each other out.

506
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,720
Oh… Yes, sure.

507
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,560
I added you. Is it there?

508
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,480
"I'll wait for you at the same spot."

509
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:15,080
Jattawa… Jatta… Where is she?

510
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,000
It's 50,000, Vivi.

511
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,600
That's the electricity bills
for two years!

512
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,360
Fifty thousand?

513
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,720
Then we'll be comfortable, for sure.

514
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,000
As university representative,
this could be tough.

515
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,600
Whose shoes are these?

516
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,440
Did someone break into our house?

517
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,520
Water…

518
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:12,280
Jattawa…

519
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,760
Hey! Who are you?

520
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,880
Get out of here!
How did you get in? Get out!

521
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,520
Miss! Miss!

522
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,840
-Calm down.
-Get out!

523
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,880
What's going on?

524
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,280
Call the police, Vivi!

525
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,000
Calm down!

526
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,440
Call the cops, Vivi!

527
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,920
You're a thief, right? Get out!

528
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,200
Call the cops, Vivi!

529
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,440
I'm here for…

530
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,880
Hello, there's an stranger in my house!

531
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,560
Please help us!

532
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:41,160
Please help me and my sister!
Please hurry!

533
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,600
-Wa!
-Hey!

534
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,160
Jattawa, wait!

535
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,280
Mister Somkiat is here with me.

536
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,600
Is he your friend?

537
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,880
No.

538
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:54,080
But he's interested in buying this house.
